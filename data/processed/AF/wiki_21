Nicknamed \"the Boss\", Springsteen has released 21 studio albums spanning six decades; most of his albums feature the E Street Band, his backing band since 1972. Springsteen is a pioneer of heartland rock, combining commercially successful rock with poetic, socially conscious lyrics that reflect working class American life. He is known for his energetic concerts, some of which last more than four hours.\nSpringsteen released his first two albums, \"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\" and \"The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle\", in 1973. Although both were well received by critics, neither earned him a large audience. He changed his style and achieved worldwide popularity with \"Born to Run\" (1975). Springsteen followed with \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" (1978) and \"The River\" (1980), Springsteen's first album to top the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. After the solo acoustic album \"Nebraska\" (1982), he recorded \"Born in the U.S.A.\" (1984) with the E Street Band, which became his most commercially successful album and the 23rd-best selling album ever as of 2024. All seven singles from \"Born in the U.S.A.\" reached the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, including the title track. Springsteen mostly hired session musicians for the recording of his next three albums, \"Tunnel of Love\" (1987), \"Human Touch\" (1992), and \"Lucky Town\" (1992). He reassembled the E Street Band for \"Greatest Hits\" (1995), and recorded the acoustic album \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\" (1995) and the EP \"Blood Brothers\" (1996) solo.\nSpringsteen then released \"The Rising\" (2002), which was dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. He released two more folk albums, \"Devils &amp; Dust\" (2005) and \"\" (2006), his first cover album. Springsteen followed with two more albums with the E Street Band, \"Magic\" (2007) and \"Working on a Dream\" (2009). His next albums, \"Wrecking Ball\" (2012) and \"High Hopes\" (2014), topped album charts worldwide. In 2017, 2018 and 2021, Springsteen performed the critically acclaimed show \"Springsteen on Broadway\", in which he performed songs and told stories from his 2016 autobiography; an album version from the Broadway performances was released in 2018. He released the solo album \"Western Stars\" in 2019, \"Letter to You\" with the E Street Band in 2020, and a solo covers album entitled \"Only the Strong Survive\" in 2022. \"Letter to You\" reached No. 2 in the US, making Springsteen the first artist to release a top-five album in six consecutive decades.\nA prominent musician from the album era, Springsteen has sold more than 140 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. His accolades include 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Special Tony Award. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2009, was named MusiCares person of the year in 2013, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 and the National Medal of Arts in 2023. In 2010, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Springsteen 23rd on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", describing him as \"the embodiment of rock and roll\". In 2025, Springsteen became one of only five artists to gross over $2.3 billion in touring thanks to his 2023-2025 Tour with the E Street Band.\nEarly life and education.\nBruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, New Jersey, on September 23, 1949, to Douglas Frederick \"Dutch\" Springsteen (1924\u20131998) and his wife, Adele Ann (n\u00e9e Zerilli; 1925\u20132024). Springsteen's father worked as a bus driver and other jobs. His father had mental health issues throughout his life, which worsened in his later life. His mother, who was originally from the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, worked as a legal secretary and was the family's main breadwinner. He is of Dutch, Irish, and Italian descent, and grew up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey.\nSpringsteen's paternal ancestors were among the early Dutch families who, in the 17th century, settled in colonial-era America, then part of the Dutch Republic known as New Netherland. Springsteen's paternal ancestor, John Springsteen, was a patriot in the American Revolution, which evolved into the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The Springsteen surname originates in Groningen, a province in the Netherlands, and is topographic, translating to \"jump stone\" and meaning a stepping stone used on unpaved streets or between two houses. Springsteen's Italian maternal grandfather was born in Vico Equense and emigrated through Ellis Island. He arrived in the United States unable to read or write English, but went on to become a lawyer and impressed the young Springsteen as being \"larger than life\".\nSpringsteen has two younger sisters, Virginia (born 1951) and Pamela (born c. 1962). Pamela Springsteen worked briefly as an actress and later as a photographer; she took photos for three Springsteen albums, \"Human Touch\", \"Lucky Town\", and \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\".\nSpringsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic School in Freehold, where he was at odds with the nuns and rebelled against the strictures imposed upon him, though some of his later music reflected a Catholic ethos and included Irish Catholic hymns with a rock music twist. In 2012, Springsteen said that it was his Catholic upbringing rather than his political ideology that most influenced his music. He said his faith gave him a \"very active spiritual life\" but joked that this \"made it very difficult sexually\" and added \"once a Catholic, always a Catholic\". He grew up hearing fellow New Jersey singer Frank Sinatra on the radio, and became interested in being a musician by the age of seven after seeing Elvis Presley's performances on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1956 and 1957. Soon after, his mother rented him a guitar from Mike Diehl's Music in Freehold for $6 a week and took a few weeks of guitar lessons, but quit after it failed to provide him with the instant gratification he desired.\nIn ninth grade, Springsteen entered Freehold High School, a public high school, but did not fit in there either. A former teacher said Springsteen was a \"loner who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar\". He graduated in 1967, but felt so alienated that he skipped his graduation ceremony. He briefly attended Ocean County College, but dropped out. At age 19, Springsteen was called for his draft physical, but failed it because of a concussion he suffered in a motorcycle accident two years earlier combined with his behavior at induction, both of which reportedly made him unacceptable for military service. In failing his examination, Springsteen likely avoided service in the Vietnam War. In 1969, when he was 20 years old, Springsteen's parents and sister Pamela moved to San Mateo, California; he and his sister Virginia, who was married and pregnant at the time, remained in Freehold.\nCareer.\n1964\u20131972: Early career.\nIn 1964, Springsteen saw the Beatles' televised appearances on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Inspired, he bought his first guitar for $18.95 at the Western Auto appliance store. Thereafter, he started playing for audiences with a band called the Rogues at local venues, including Elks Lodge in Freehold. Later that year, his mother took out a loan to buy him a $60 Kent guitar, an act he later memorialized in his song \"The Wish\". In 1965, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist and subsequently one of the lead singers of the Castiles, a band that recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township and played a variety of venues, including Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village. Marion Vinyard said she believed the young Springsteen when he promised he would make it big. In the late 1960s, Springsteen performed briefly in a power trio known as Earth, who played in various clubs in New Jersey and at a major show at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City.\nFrom 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed with the band Child, which later changed its name to Steel Mill and included Danny Federici, Vini Lopez, Vinnie Roslin, and later Steven Van Zandt and Robbin Thompson. Steel Mill performed at various Jersey Shore venues and also outside of New Jersey, in Richmond, Virginia; Nashville, Tennessee; and California, and gathered a cult following. In his January 1970 review of Steel Mill's show at The Matrix, music critic Philip Elwood wrote in the \"San Francisco Examiner\" that he had \"never been so overwhelmed by a totally unknown talent\" and called Steel Mill \"the first big thing that's happened to Asbury Park since the good ship \"Morro Castle\" burned to the waterline of that Jersey beach in '34\". Elwood praised the band's \"cohesive musicality\" and called Springsteen \"a most impressive composer\". In San Mateo, Steel Mill recorded three original Springsteen songs at Pacific Recording.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis was different, shifted the lay of the land. Four guys, playing and singing, writing their own material. [...] Rock 'n' roll came to my house where there seemed to be no way out [...] and opened up a whole world of possibilities.\n \u2014Springsteen on the impact of the Beatles\nAs Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and lyrical style, he performed with the bands Dr. Zoom &amp; the Sonic Boom from early-to-mid-1971, the Sundance Blues Band in mid-1971, and the Bruce Springsteen Band from mid-1971 to mid-1972. His songwriting ability included, as his future record label described it in early publicity campaigns, \"more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums\". He brought his skills to the attention of several people who went on to prove influential to his career development, including managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, who in turn brought him to the attention of John Hammond, a talent scout at Columbia Records. In May 1972, Springsteen auditioned for Hammond.\nIn October 1972, Springsteen formed a new band for the recording of his debut album, \"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\" The band eventually became known as the E Street Band, although the name was not used until September 1974. Springsteen acquired the nickname \"the Boss\" during this period, since he took on the task of collecting his band's nightly pay and distributing it among his bandmates. The nickname also reportedly sprang from games of \"Monopoly\", which Springsteen played with other Jersey Shore musicians.\n1972\u20131974: Initial struggle.\nSpringsteen was signed to Columbia Records in 1972 by John Hammond, who had signed Bob Dylan to the same label a decade earlier. His debut album, \"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\", was released in January 1973, establishing him as a critical favorite. Because of Springsteen's lyrical poeticism and folk rock-rooted music exemplified on tracks like \"Blinded by the Light\" and \"For You\", and his connection with Hammond and Columbia Records, critics initially compared Springsteen to Bob Dylan. \"He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven't heard since I was rocked by 'Like a Rolling Stone'\", \"Crawdaddy\" magazine editor Peter Knobler wrote in a March 1973 profile of Springsteen's that included photographs taken by Ed Gallucci. Knobler is the journalist who discovered Springsteen in the rock press. \"Crawdaddy\" was an early champion of Springsteen; Knobler profiled him in the magazine three times, in 1973, 1975, and 1978. In June 1976, Springsteen and the E Street Band acknowledged the magazine's support by giving a private performance at the magazine's 10th Anniversary Party in New York City.\nSpringsteen's second album, \"The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle\", was released in November 1973, eleven months after \"Greetings from Asbury Park\". Like Springsteen's inaugural album, \"The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle\" was met with critical acclaim but limited commercial success. Springsteen's songs became grander in form and scope with the E Street Band providing a less folksy, more rhythm and blues vibe, and lyrics that romanticized teenage street life. \"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\" and \"Incident on 57th Street\" became fan favorites, while \"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\" continues to rank among Springsteen's most beloved concert numbers. \"Rosalita\" is the ninth-most played song in Springsteen's concert catalog; as of June 2020, he has played it live 809 times.\nIn February 1974, the Stone Pony, a music venue and bar, opened on Ocean Avenue in Asbury Park, and Springsteen played there regularly. Several years later, in the early 1980s, prior to the start of the Born in the U.S.A. Tour in June 1984, Springsteen also met his second and current wife Patti Scialfa at the Stone Pony during her performance there. A regular venue for Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Southside Johnny, and other acts from the area, the Stone Pony has since been described as \"an integral part of music history for decades.\"\nAfter seeing Springsteen's performance at the Harvard Square Theater in 1974, music critic Jon Landau wrote that he \"saw rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen.\" Springsteen met Landau in Boston a month prior and the two became close friends; Landau subsequently became the co-producer of Springsteen's next album, \"Born to Run\", in February 1975. As Springsteen's last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a \"Wall of Sound\" production. When his manager, Mike Appel, orchestrated the release of an early mix of \"Born to Run\" to nearly a dozen radio stations, anticipation built toward the album's release.\nThe album took over 14 months to record, with six months spent recording \"Born to Run\" alone. E Street Band members David Sancious and Ernest Carter departed after \"Born to Run\" was completed, and were replaced by Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg on piano and drums, respectively. Springsteen battled with anger and frustration throughout the sessions, saying he heard \"sounds in [his] head\" that he could not explain to the others in the studio. He also dealt with two producers who had opposing views. During the recording of \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\", Steven Van Zandt conceived the horn parts for the horn players on the spot in the studio after Springsteen and Bittan had failed to write proper ones by the time the players arrived to record. He joined the E Street Band shortly thereafter. Mixing for \"Born to Run\" lasted until July 20, 1975, just before a concert tour began.\n\"Born to Run\" was mastered while the band was on the road. Springsteen was furious at the initial acetate, throwing it into the swimming pool of the hotel he was staying at. He contemplated scrapping the entire project and re-recording it live before he was stopped by Landau. Springsteen was sent multiple mixes as he was on the road and rejected all of them until August when he approved the final one.\n1975\u20131983: \"Born to Run\" and breakthrough success.\n\"Born to Run\" was released in August 1975. It proved to be a breakthrough album that catapulted Springsteen to worldwide fame. The album peaked at No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, eventually going seven times platinum in the US. The album's two singles, \"Born to Run\" and \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" reached No. 23 and 83, respectively, on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. According to author Louis Masur, the album's success was tied to the fears of growing old held by a generation of late teenagers. In October 1975, Springsteen appeared on the covers of both \"Newsweek\" and \"Time\" in the same week, becoming the first artist to do so. The magazines' cover stories resulted in a media backlash, as critics began wondering if Springsteen was for real or the product of record company promotion. Springsteen was hurt by the backlash and disliked his newfound attention. When the E Street Band arrived in London for their first concerts outside North America, Springsteen personally tore down promotional posters in the lobby of the Hammersmith Odeon.\nA legal battle with Appel kept Springsteen out of the studio for nearly a year, during which time he kept the E Street Band together through extensive touring across the U.S. and continued writing new material. Reaching a settlement with Appel in May 1977, Springsteen returned to the studio, and the subsequent nine-month recording sessions with the E Street Band produced \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\". The record stripped the \"Wall of Sound\" production of \"Born to Run\" for a rawer hard rock sound. Its lyrics focus on ill-fortuned people who fight back against overwhelming odds.\nReleased in June 1978, \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" sold fewer copies than its predecessor, but remained on the \"Billboard\" chart for 167 weeks, selling three million copies in the U.S. Its three singles\u2014\"Prove It All Night\", \"Badlands\", and \"The Promised Land\"\u2014performed modestly. The supporting Darkness Tour was Springsteen's largest up to that point and featured shows that lasted upwards of three hours in length. The staff of \"Ultimate Classic Rock\" said the tour solidified Springsteen and the E Street Band as \"one of the most exciting live acts in rock 'n' roll\".\nBy the late 1970s, Springsteen earned a reputation as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. Manfred Mann's Earth Band had achieved a U.S. No. 1 pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of \"Greetings\"' \"Blinded by the Light\" in early 1977. Patti Smith reached No. 13 with her version of Springsteen's unreleased \"Because the Night\" with revised lyrics by Smith in 1978. The Pointer Sisters hit No. 2 in 1979 with Springsteen's then unreleased \"Fire\". Between 1976 and 1978, Springsteen provided four compositions to Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, including \"The Fever\" and \"Hearts of Stone\", and collaborated on four more with Steven Van Zandt, producer of their first three albums. In September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the Musicians United for Safe Energy anti-nuclear power collective at Madison Square Garden for two nights, playing an abbreviated set while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent \"No Nukes\" live album, as well as the following summer's \"No Nukes\" documentary film, represented the first official recordings and footage of Springsteen's fabled live act and Springsteen's first tentative dip into political involvement.\nThe recording sessions for Springsteen's fifth album, \"The River\", lasted 18 months. The 20-track double album was an attempt at capturing the energy and feel of the E Street Band playing live on stage and featured a mix of party songs and introspective ballads. Released in October 1980, \"The River\" became Springsteen's biggest and fastest-selling album yet, topping the U.S. \"Billboard\" chart. The single \"Hungry Heart\" became his first top ten single as a performer, reaching number five, while \"Fade Away\" reached No. 20.\nSeveral songs on \"The River\" foreshadowed the direction of Springsteen's next record, the minimalist, folk-inspired solo effort \"Nebraska\", released in September 1982. Springsteen recorded the songs on the album as demo recordings at his home in Colts Neck, New Jersey, intending to re-record them with the E Street Band, but after poor test sessions he decided to release the recordings as is. The album chronicled dark hardships felt by everyday blue-collar workers, as well as bleak tales of criminals, cops, and gang wars. \"Nebraska\" sold minimally compared to Springsteen's three previous albums, but reached No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" chart. Nevertheless, it surprised critics, who praised it as a brave artistic statement.\n1984\u20131986: \"Born in the U.S.A.\" and cultural phenomenon.\nIn 1984, Springsteen released \"Born in the U.S.A.\", which sold 30\u00a0million worldwide, and became one of the best-selling albums of all time, with seven singles hitting the top ten. The title track was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans, some of whom were Springsteen's friends. The lyrics in the verses were entirely unambiguous when listened to, but the anthemic music and the title of the song made it hard for many, from politicians to the common person, to get the lyrics\u2014except those in the chorus, which could be read many ways. The song made a huge political impact, as he was advocating for the rights of the common working-class man.\nThe song was widely misinterpreted as patriotic, and in connection with the 1984 presidential campaign became the subject of considerable folklore. In 1984, conservative columnist George Will attended a Springsteen concert and then wrote a column praising Springsteen's work ethic. Six days after the column's publication, then President Ronald Reagan, in a campaign rally in Hammonton, New Jersey, made brief mention of the song, saying, \"America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young Americans admire\u2014New Jersey's own, Bruce Springsteen.\" Two nights later, at a concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen told the crowd, \"Well, the president was mentioning my name in his speech the other day and I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must've been, you know? I don't think it was the \"Nebraska\" album. I don't think he's been listening to this one.\" He then began playing \"Johnny 99\", with its allusions to closing factories and criminals.\n\"Dancing in the Dark\" was the biggest of seven hit singles from \"Born in the U.S.A.\", peaking at No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" singles chart. The video for the song showed a young Courteney Cox dancing on stage with Springsteen, which helped start the actress's career. The song \"Cover Me\" was written by Springsteen for Donna Summer, but his record company persuaded him to keep it for the new album. A big fan of Summer's work, Springsteen wrote another song for her, \"Protection\". Videos for \"Born in the U.S.A.\" were directed by Brian De Palma and John Sayles. Springsteen played on the \"We Are the World\" song and album in 1985. His live cover of the Jimmy Cliff song \"Trapped\" from that album received moderate airplay on US Top 40 stations as well as reaching No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Top Rock Tracks chart.\nThe \"Born in the U.S.A.\" period represented the height of Springsteen's visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience he would ever reach (aided by the release of Arthur Baker's dance mixes of three of the singles). From June 15 to August 10, 1985, all seven of his albums appeared on the UK Albums Chart: the first time an artist had charted their entire back catalogue simultaneously. \"Live/1975\u201385\", a five-record box set (also on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and became the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the most commercially successful live albums of all time, ultimately selling 13\u00a0million units in the U.S. During the 1980s, several Springsteen fanzines were launched, including \"Backstreets\" magazine.\n1987\u20131999: \"Tunnel of Love\", Academy Award and Hall of Fame.\nSpringsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative \"Tunnel of Love\" in October 1987. The album is a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, and the full sound of the E Street Band is included only selectively. Although it sold less than \"Born in the U.S.A.\", it was a commercial success, reaching No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200. On July 19, 1988, Springsteen's concert in East Germany attracted 300,000 spectators. Journalist Erik Kirschbaum called the concert \"the most important rock concert ever, anywhere\" in his 2013 book \"Rocking the Wall. Bruce Springsteen: The Berlin Concert That Changed the World\". The concert had been conceived by the Socialist Unity Party's youth wing in an attempt to placate the youth of East Germany, who were hungry for more freedom and the popular music of the West. However, it is Kirschbaum's opinion that the success of the concert catalyzed opposition to the regime in East Germany, and helped contribute to the fall of the Berlin Wall the following year.\nLater in 1988, Springsteen headlined the worldwide Human Rights Now! tour for Amnesty International. In October 1989, he dissolved the E Street Band. In 1992, after risking fan accusations of \"going Hollywood\" by moving to Los Angeles and working with session musicians, Springsteen released two albums at once: \"Human Touch\" and \"Lucky Town\". An electric band appearance on the acoustic \"MTV Unplugged\" television program (later released as \"In Concert/MTV Plugged\") was poorly received and cemented fan dissatisfaction. \nSpringsteen won an Academy Award in 1994 for his song \"Streets of Philadelphia\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the film \"Philadelphia\". The video for the song shows Springsteen's actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This technique was developed on the \"Brilliant Disguise\" video. In 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first \"Greatest Hits\" album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary \"Blood Brothers\"), and also one show at Tramps in New York City, he released his second folk album, \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\". The album was inspired by John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and by \"Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass\", a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Dale Maharidge and photographer Michael Williamson. \"Rolling Stone\" characterized the album as Springsteen's first overtly social statement since \"Born in the U.S.A.\", drawing a strong parallel to \"Nebraska\", due to its acoustic nature and Depression-era storytelling sensibility reminiscent of Woody Guthrie. The album is noted for its bleak, unrelenting atmosphere, focusing on characters who are broken by life's hardships, with few escapes and little musical relief from the dark, desolate scenarios portrayed.\nSpringsteen supported the album on the lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour. The tour presented many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form. Springsteen explicitly reminded his audiences to \"shut the fuck up\" and not to clap during the performances. Following the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, Springsteen moved from California back to New Jersey with his family. In 1998, he released the sprawling, four-disc box set of outtakes, \"Tracks\". Later, he would acknowledge that the 1990s were musically a \"lost period\" for him: \"I didn't do a lot of work. Some people would say I didn't do my best work.\"\nSpringsteen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 by Bono (the lead singer of U2), a favor he returned in 2005. In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band reunited and began their extensive Reunion Tour, which lasted over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey and a ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City's Madison Square Garden. A new song played at these shows, \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" (about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo), proved controversial.\n2002\u20132007: \"The Rising\", \"Devils &amp; Dust\", and other releases.\nIn 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, \"The Rising\", produced by Brendan O'Brien. The album, mostly a reflection on the September 11 attacks, was a critical and popular success. The title track gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record became Springsteen's best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on \"The Today Show\", The Rising Tour commenced; the band barnstormed through a series of single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe. Springsteen played an unprecedented 10 nights at Giants Stadium in New Jersey.\n\"The Rising\" won the Grammy for Best Rock Album and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards in 2003. In addition, \"The Rising\" won the Grammy for Best Rock Song and for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, and nominated for Song of the Year. At the ceremony, Springsteen performed the Clash's \"London Calling\" with Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt and No Doubt's bassist, Tony Kanal, in tribute to Joe Strummer. In 2004, Springsteen and the E Street Band participated in the Vote for Change tour, with John Mellencamp, John Fogerty, the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., Bright Eyes, the Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne, and other musicians.\nThe solo record \"Devils &amp; Dust\" was released in April 2005. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in the same vein as \"Nebraska\" and \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\". Some of the material was written almost 10 years earlier, during or shortly after the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour; a few of the songs had been performed at that time but unreleased. The title track concerns an ordinary soldier's feelings and fears during the Iraq War. The album topped the charts in ten countries. Springsteen began the solo Devils &amp; Dust Tour at the same time as the album's release, playing both small and large venues. Attendance was disappointing in a few regions, and except in Europe tickets were easier to get than in the past.\nIn April 2006, Springsteen released \"\", an American roots music project focused around a big folk sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism of Pete Seeger. A tour began the same month, with the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed the Seeger Sessions Band (and later shortened to the Sessions Band). The tour proved very popular in Europe, selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent reviews, including its opening act in New Orleans, Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina, but newspapers reported that a number of U.S. shows suffered from sparse attendance.\nSpringsteen's next album, \"Magic\", was released in October 2007. Recorded with the E Street Band, it had 10 new Springsteen songs plus \"Long Walk Home\", performed once with the Sessions band, and a hidden track (the first included on a Springsteen studio release), \"Terry's Song\", a tribute to Springsteen's long-time assistant Terry Magovern, who died in July 2007. \"Magic\" debuted at No. 1 in the U.S., Ireland and the UK. Springsteen supported the album on the Magic Tour, his first tour with the E Street Band since 2003. It was the final tour for longtime E Street member Danny Federici, who died in 2008.\n2008\u20132011: Political involvement, Super Bowl XLIII, and Kennedy Center Honors.\nSpringsteen supported Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. He gave solo acoustic performances in support of Obama's campaign throughout 2008, culminating with a November 2 rally at which he debuted the song \"Working on a Dream\" in a duet with Scialfa. Following Obama's electoral victory on November 4, Springsteen's song \"The Rising\" was the first song played over the loudspeakers after Obama's victory speech in Chicago's Grant Park. Springsteen was the musical opener for the on January 18, 2009, which was attended by over 400,000 people. He performed \"The Rising\" with an all-female choir. Later he performed Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" with Pete Seeger.\nOn January 11, 2009, Springsteen won the Golden Globe Award for Best Song for \"The Wrestler\", from the Darren Aronofsky film by the same name. After receiving a heartfelt letter from lead actor Mickey Rourke, Springsteen supplied the song for the film for free.\nSpringsteen performed at the halftime show at Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009, agreeing to perform after having declined on prior occasions. A few days before the game, Springsteen gave a rare press conference at which he promised a \"twelve-minute party\".

He is a pioneer of heartland rock, a genre combining mainstream rock music with working class thematic concerns and socially conscious lyrics. According to \"Rolling Stone\", his work \"epitomizes rock's deepest values: desire, the need for freedom and the search to find yourself.\" Often described as cinematic in their scope, Springsteen's lyrics frequently explore highly personal themes such as individual commitment, dissatisfaction and dismay with life in a context of everyday situations. Springsteen's themes include social and political commentary and are rooted in the struggles faced by his own family of origin.\nA shift in Springsteen's lyrical approach began with the album \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\", in which he focused on the emotional struggles of working class life, alongside more typical rock and roll themes. Reviewing \"Born in the U.S.A.\", \"Rolling Stone\" critic Debby Miller noted that \"Springsteen ignored the British Invasion and embraced instead the legacy of Phil Spector's releases, the sort of soul that was coming from Atlantic Records, and especially the garage bands that had anomalous radio hits. He's always chased the utopian feeling of that music\".\nJon Pareles included Springsteen among the \"pantheon\" of artists of the album era. \"Springsteen is the quintessential album-era rock star,\" writes Ann Powers, who argues that while other acts like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Marvin Gaye probably made better individual works, \"none [had] used the long-player form itself more powerfully over the arc of a career, not only to establish a world through song, but to inhabit an enduring persona\". He used it to lyricize \"America's slide from industrial-era swagger into service-economy anomie\". In her mind, Springsteen needed the \"track-by-track architecture of albums to flesh out characters, relate each to the other, extend metaphors and build a palpable, detail-strewn landscape through which they could travel\". He simultaneously grew musically \"both with his stalwart E Street Band (a metaphor itself for the family connections and community spirit his songs celebrate or lament) and in more minimalist projects.\"\nSpringsteen and the E Street Band have frequently appeared in lists ranking the best live acts of all time. In \"Forbes\", Steve Baltin wrote: \"There has never been a live experience in music that captures the feeling of liberation and optimism rock and roll is supposed to bring you more than a Springsteen and the E Street Band show.\" In January 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" named Springsteen the 77th-greatest singer of all time. In April 2023, the governor of New Jersey issued a proclamation announcing September 23 \"Bruce Springsteen Day\".\nSpringsteen's songs have been the subject of various scholarly articles analyzing his music and lyrics. The Bruce Springsteen Special Collection houses academic journals and papers on Springsteen published since the 1980s. Springsteen himself said in 2001: \"The Collection has almost 1,000 books and magazines on myself and the band\u2013more stuff than every place except my mother's basement!\"\nIn 2003, \"Rolling Stone\"'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included \"Born to Run\" (18), \"Born in the U.S.A.\" (85), \"The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle\" (132), \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" (151), \"Nebraska\" (224), \"The River\" (250), \"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\" (379), and \"Tunnel of Love\" (475). In 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, \"Rolling Stone\" included \"Born to Run\" (21), \"Thunder Road\" (86), and \"Born in the U.S.A.\" (275). In 2010, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Springsteen 23rd on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", describing him as \"the embodiment of rock and roll\".\nPersonal life.\nRelationships.\nSpringsteen briefly dated artist Karon Bihari in the 1970s, who claimed the \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" song \"Candy's Room\" was about her. He also had relationships with photographer Lynn Goldsmith, model Karen Darvin and, for four years in the 1980s, actress Joyce Hyser.\nIn the early 1980s, he met Patti Scialfa at the Stone Pony the evening she was performing alongside his friend Bobby Bandiera, with whom she wrote \"At Least We Got Shoes\" for Southside Johnny. Springsteen liked her voice and after the performance he introduced himself to her. They soon started spending time together and became friends.\nEarly in 1984, Springsteen asked Scialfa to join the E Street Band for the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, which began in June 1984. According to the book \"Bruce\" by Peter Ames Carlin, they seemed about to become a couple through the first leg of the tour, but Springsteen was introduced to actress Julianne Phillips and married her shortly after midnight on May 13, 1985, at Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Opposites in background, the two had an 11-year age difference and Springsteen's traveling took its toll on their relationship. Many of the songs on \"Tunnel of Love\" described the unhappiness he felt in his relationship with Phillips.\nThe Tunnel of Love Express Tour began in February 1988 and Springsteen convinced Scialfa to postpone her own solo record and join the tour. Scialfa moved in with Springsteen shortly after he separated from Phillips. On August 30, 1988, citing irreconcilable differences, Phillips filed for divorce in Los Angeles, and a settlement was reached in December and finalized on March 1, 1989. They had no children.\nSpringsteen received press criticism for the apparent haste in which he and Scialfa started their relationship. In a 1995 interview with \"The Advocate\", he told Judy Wieder about the negative publicity the couple subsequently received: \"It's a strange society that assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love and whom they shouldn't. But the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, 'Well, all I know is, this feels real, and maybe I have got a mess going here in some fashion, but that's life.'\" Years later, he reflected, \"'I didn't protect Juli... some sort of public announcement would have been fair, but I felt overly concerned about my own privacy. I handled it badly, and I still feel badly about it. It was cruel for people to find out the way they did.'\"\nSpringsteen and Scialfa lived in New Jersey before moving to Los Angeles, where they decided to start a family. On July 25, 1990, Scialfa gave birth to the couple's first child, Evan James Springsteen. On June 8, 1991, Springsteen and Scialfa married at their Los Angeles home in a private ceremony, only attended by family and close friends. Their second child, Jessica Rae Springsteen, was born on December 30, 1991. Their third child, Samuel Ryan Springsteen, was born on January 5, 1994. In a 1995 interview, Springsteen said, \"I went through a divorce, and it was really difficult and painful and I was very frightened about getting married again. So part of me said, 'Hey, what does it matter?' But it does matter. It's very different than just living together. First of all, stepping up publicly\u2014which is what you do: You get your license, you do all the social rituals\u2014is a part of your place in society and in some way part of society's acceptance of you\u00a0... Patti and I both found that it did mean something.\"\nWhen their children reached school age in the 1990s, Springsteen and Scialfa moved back to New Jersey to raise them away from paparazzi. The family owns and lives on a horse farm in Colts Neck Township and has a home in Rumson; they also own homes in Los Angeles and Wellington, Florida. Evan graduated from Boston College; he writes and performs his own songs and won the 2012 Singer/Songwriter Competition held during Boston College's Arts Festival. Jessica graduated from Duke University and is a nationally ranked champion equestrian. She made her show-jumping debut with Team USA in August 2014. Sam is a firefighter in Jersey City. On July 17, 2022, Springsteen and Scialfa became grandparents when their son Sam and his fianc\u00e9e had a daughter.\nHealth.\nSpringsteen has avoided hard drugs his entire life. Van Zandt said in 2012, \"[Springsteen is] the only guy I know\u2014I think the only guy I know at all\u2014who never did drugs.\" Springsteen has spoken about his struggles with depression, which he began to address in his 30s after years of denial. During this time, he also became frustrated with being an underweight \"fast food junkie\" who had to be helped off the stage after a show due to his poor health. He later began following a mostly vegetarian diet while running up to six miles on a treadmill and lifting weights three times a week. A 2019 \"Consequence\" article celebrating his 70th birthday revealed that he still maintains this routine and diet. In September 2023, Springsteen announced the postponement of all his concerts in the US beginning in that month and through December, due to his ongoing treatment for peptic ulcer disease.\nReligion.\nWhile rejecting religion in his earlier years, Springsteen stated in his 2016 autobiography \"Born to Run\", \"I have a personal relationship with Jesus. I believe in his power to save, love [...] but not to damn.\" In terms of his lapsed Catholicism, he said that he \"came to ruefully and bemusedly understand that once you're a Catholic you're always a Catholic ... I don't participate in my religion but I know somewhere... deep inside... I'm still on the team.\"\nWealth.\nIn a 2017 interview with Tom Hanks, Springsteen admitted that he evaded taxes early in his career since the government had not paid attention to his taxes prior to his 1975 appearance on the cover of \"Time\". Most of his income over the next several years went towards paying back his taxes; by his 30th birthday, he had only $20,000, despite multiple bestselling records and tours. \"Forbes\" \"conservatively\" estimated Springsteen's net worth at US$1.1 billion in 2024.\nHobbies.\nSpringsteen is a model railroader. He collects and runs HO scale model trains.\nPolitical views and activism.\nSpringsteen announced his endorsement of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign in April 2008. He appeared at several rallies in support of Obama throughout that year. At one rally in Ohio, Springsteen discussed the importance of \"truth, transparency and integrity in government, the right of every American to have a job, a living wage, to be educated in a decent school, and a life filled with the dignity of work, the promise and the sanctity of home\". Despite saying that he would sit out the 2012 presidential election, Springsteen campaigned for Obama's re-election in Ohio, Iowa, Virginia, Pittsburgh, and Wisconsin.\nSpringsteen supports LGBTQ rights and gay marriage. In 2009, he posted the following statement on his website: \"I've long believed in and have always spoken out for the rights of same sex couples and fully agree with Governor Corzine when he writes that 'The marriage-equality issue should be recognized for what it truly is\u2014a civil rights issue that must be approved to assure that every citizen is treated equally under the law.'\" In 2012, he lent his support to the Four 2012, an ad campaign for gay marriage. Springsteen noted in the ad, \"I couldn't agree more with that statement and urge those who support equal treatment for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to let their voices be heard now.\" In April 2016, Springsteen cancelled a show in Greensboro, North Carolina, days before it was to take place to protest the state's newly passed Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act, also referred to as the \"bathroom law\", which dictates which restrooms transgender people are permitted to use and prevents LGBTQ citizens from suing over human rights violations in the workplace. Springsteen released a statement on his website. The Human Rights Campaign celebrated Springsteen's statement, and he has received praise and gratitude from the LGBTQ community.\nDuring a 2017 show in Perth, Australia, Springsteen made a statement celebrating the post-inauguration Women's March against the incoming Trump administration in cities worldwide: \"We're a long way from home, and our hearts and spirits are with the hundreds of thousands of women and men that marched yesterday in every city in America, and in Melbourne\u00a0... [They] rallied against hate and division and in support of tolerance, inclusion, reproductive rights, civil rights, racial justice, LGBTQ rights, the environment, wage equality, gender equality, healthcare, and immigrant rights. We stand with you. We are the new American resistance.\"\nSpringsteen is a staunch critic of Donald Trump, whom he calls the \"conman from Queens\". During Trump's first term as president of the United States in October 2019, Springsteen said Trump \"doesn't have a grasp of the deep meaning of what it means to be an American\", and in June 2020 called him a \"threat to our democracy\". Springsteen's song \"The Rising\" was featured prominently in the 2020 Democratic National Convention in support of Joe Biden, accompanied with a new video and campaign slogan, #TheRising. On October 13, 2020, author Don Winslow released a video critical of Trump prior to his campaign event in Pennsylvania. The video features Springsteen's song \"Streets of Philadelphia\". A few days prior to the 2020 United States presidential election, Springsteen provided narration for a campaign ad that spotlights Biden's upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania with \"My Hometown\" playing throughout the ad. Biden used \"We Take Care of Our Own\" as one of his theme songs, as Obama had before him in 2012. On October 3, 2024, Springsteen endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election, and gave a speech at one of her campaign rallies on October 24.\nDuring a show in Manchester, England, on May 14, 2025, Springsteen spoke out against Trump and called his administration \"corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous\". Two days later, Trump responded on Truth Social by calling Springsteen \"highly overrated\" and \"dumb as a rock\". Tino Gagliardi, the president of the American Federation of Musicians defended Springsteen, saying, \"Musicians have the right to freedom of expression, and we stand in solidarity with all our members.\" On May 19, Trump called for a major investigation into Springsteen, Beyonc\u00e9, Oprah, and other celebrities for their endorsement of Harris. He claims that Harris illegally paid them to support her 2024 campaign for president. Musicians such as Neil Young and Eddie Vedder spoke out in defense of Springsteen saying his freedom of speech rights were being violated. Springsteen included recordings of his Manchester remarks as part of a live EP release, \"Land of Hope and Dreams.\"\nAchievements and awards.\nSpringsteen has sold more than 140\u00a0million records worldwide and more than 71\u00a0million records in the United States, making him one of the world's best-selling artists.

Springsteen was inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2009, was named MusiCares person of the year in 2013, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2016.\nIn May 2021, Springsteen became the eighth recipient of the Woody Guthrie Prize, a prize that honors an artist who speaks out for social justice and carries on the spirit of the folk singer. In March 2023, Springsteen was awarded the 2021 National Medal of Arts from President Joe Biden at the White House. Springsteen was supposed to receive the award in 2021 but the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the ceremonies.\nIn March 2024, it was announced that Springsteen would be named an Academy Fellow by The Ivors Academy in May 2024. On May 23, 2024, Springsteen became the first international songwriter that the academy has inducted into the Fellowship in its 80-year history.\nOn October 18, 2025, Springsteen received the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures inaugural Legacy Award \"for an artist whose body of work has inspired generations of storytellers and deeply influenced our culture.\" On November 3, 2025, he was inducted Into the 2025 class of Library Lions by the New York Public Library.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nConcert tours.\nSpringsteen has developed a reputation for energetic and long-lasting live performances.\nHeadlining tours.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A total of 17 Karmapa manifestations have incarnated after their predecessors predict their own rebirths in detailed letters.\nTheir honorific titles include His Holiness the Gyalwa Karmapa (, and more formally as Gyalwang () The Karmapa is the head of the Karma Kagyu, the largest sub-school of the Kagyu school (Tibetan: \u0f56\u0f40\u0f60\u0f0b\u0f56\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f74\u0f51, Wylie: \"bka' brgyud\"), itself one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. \nThe main seat of the four Tibetan seats of the Karmapas is the Tsurphu Monastery in U-Tsang, along the Tolung valley of central Tibet. The Karmapa's seat built during the Tibetan diaspora is the Dharma Chakra Centre at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim, India. The international monastic seats are Karma Triyana Dharmachakra in New York and Dhagpo Kagyu Ling in Dordogne, France, and in Dominica.\nBorn in 1985, it was a few years after the 17th Karmapa, Orgyen Trinley Dorje was located and then recognized in 1992 by the Dalai Lama, and by the Chinese Central Government, that another Karmapa was recognized by Shamar Rinpoche, Trinley Thaye Dorje. The identity of the current 17th Karmapa was resolved by the Karmapas themselves, Orgyen Trinley Dorje and Trinley Thaye Dorje, both of whom issued a joint statement on 4 December 2023.\nOrigin of the lineage.\nD\u00fcsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama ( Wylie: \"Dus gsum Mkhyen pa\", 1110\u20131193), was a disciple of the Tibetan master Gampopa. A talented child who studied Buddhism with his father from an early age and who sought out great teachers in his twenties and thirties, he is said to have attained enlightenment at the age of fifty while practicing dream yoga. He was henceforth regarded by the contemporary highly respected masters Shakya \u015ari and Lama Shang as the Karmapa, a manifestation of Avalokite\u015bvara, whose coming was predicted in the \"Samadhiraja Sutra\" and the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra\".\nThe source of the oral lineage, traditionally traced back to the Buddha Vajradhara, was transmitted to the Indian master of mahamudra and tantra called Tilopa (989\u20131069), through Naropa (1016\u20131100) to Marpa Lotsawa and Milarepa. These forefathers of the Kagyu (Bka' brGyud) lineage are collectively called the \"Golden Rosary\".\nRecognition of the Karmapa.\nThe Karmapa is a long line of consciously reborn lamas, and the second Karmapa, Karma Pakshi (1204\u20131283), is the first recognized tulku ( Wylie: \"sprul sku\") in Tibetan Buddhism who predicted the circumstances of his rebirth.\nA Karmapa's identity is confirmed through a combination realized lineage teachers supernatural insight, prediction letters left by the previous Karmapa, and the young child's own self-proclamation and ability to identify objects and people known to its previous incarnation.\nConflicts in recognitions.\nThe 8th, 10th, and 12th incarnations, as well as the widely renowned 16th Karmapa, each faced conflicts during their recognition, which were ultimately resolved. There is currently a controversy over the enthronement of two 17th Karmapas.\nBlack Crown.\nThe Karmapas are the holders of the Black Crown ( Wylie: \"Zhwa-nag\") and are thus sometimes known as \"the Black Hat Lamas\". This crown ( Wylie: \"rang 'byung cod pan\" \"self-arisen crown\"), is traditionally said to have been woven by the dakinis from their hair and given to the Karmapa in recognition of his spiritual realization. The physical crown displayed by the Karmapas was offered to Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama by the Yongle Emperor of China as a material representation of the spiritual one.\nThe crown was last known to be located at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim, the last home of the 16th Karmapa, although that location has been subject to some upheaval since 1993 causing some to worry as to whether or not it is still there. An inventory of items remaining at Rumtek is purported to be something the Indian government is going to undertake in the near future.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nThe history of the Karmapa lineage, including biographical details of the historical Karmapas, can be found at the following web sites.

The first part was published alone in 1969 as (transl.\"Tarots: The Visconti Pack in Bergamo and New York\"). It contains allusions to Ludovico Ariosto's \"Orlando Furioso\". The second part, with the header \"The Tavern of Crossed Destinies\", features the Tarot of Marseilles.\nSynopsis.\nThe narrative details a meeting among travelers who are inexplicably unable to speak after passing through a forest.

The postmodernist narrative, in the form of a frame story, is about the reader trying to read a book called \"If on a winter's night a traveler\". Each chapter is divided into two sections. The first section of each chapter is in second person, and describes the process the reader goes through to attempt to read the next chapter of the book they are reading. The second half is the first part of a new book that the reader (\"you\") finds. The second half is always about something different from the previous ones. The book was published in an English translation by William Weaver in 1981.\nStructure.\nThe book begins with a chapter on the art and nature of reading, and is subsequently divided into twenty-two passages. The odd-numbered passages and the final passage are narrated in the second person. That is, they concern events purportedly happening to the novel's reader. (Some contain further discussions about whether the person narrated as \"you\" is the same as the \"you\" who is actually reading.) These chapters concern the reader's adventures in reading Italo Calvino's novel, \"If on a winter's night a traveler.\" Eventually the reader meets a woman named Ludmilla, who is also addressed in her own chapter, separately, and also in the second person.\nAlternating between second-person narrative chapters of this story are the remaining (even) passages, each of which is a first chapter in ten different novels, of widely varying style, genre, and subject-matter. All are broken off, for various reasons explained in the interspersed passages, most of them at some moment of plot climax.\nThe second-person narrative passages develop into a fairly cohesive novel that puts its two protagonists on the track of an international book-fraud conspiracy, a mischievous translator, a reclusive novelist haunted by advertisers who wish to embed products in his stories and programmers who demand to let a computer generate the conclusion to his unfinished novels, a collapsing publishing house, and several repressive governments.\nThe chapters, which are the first chapters of different books, all push the narrative chapters along. Themes which are introduced in each of the first chapters will then exist in succeeding narrative chapters. For example, after reading the first chapter of a detective novel, the narrative story takes on a few common detective-style themes. There are also phrases and descriptions that are similar between the narrative and the new stories.\nWhen the titles of the fragmentary fictions are read in order\u2014as they are by a character near the end of the narrative\u2014they form a sentence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If on a winter's night a traveler, outside the town of Malbork, leaning from the steep slope without fear of wind or vertigo, looks down in the gathering shadow in a network of lines that enlace, in a network of lines that intersect, on the carpet of leaves illuminated by the moon around an empty grave\u2014 What story down there awaits its end?\u2014he asks, anxious to hear the story.\nThe theme of a writer's objectivity appears also in Calvino's novel \"Mr. Palomar\", which explores if absolute objectivity is possible, or even agreeable. Other themes include the subjectivity of meaning, the relationship between fiction and life, what makes an ideal reader and author, and authorial originality.\nCimmeria.\nCimmeria is a fictional country in the novel. The country is described as having existed as an independent state between World War I and World War II. The capital is \u00d6rkko, and its principal resources are peat and by-products, bituminous compounds. Cimmeria seems to have been located somewhere on the Gulf of Bothnia, a body of water between Sweden to the west and Finland to the east. The country has since been absorbed, and its people and language, of the 'Bothno-Ugaric' group, have both disappeared. As Calvino concludes the alleged, fictional encyclopedia entry concerning Cimmeria: \"In successive territorial divisions between her powerful neighbors the young nation was soon erased from the map; the autochthonous population was dispersed; Cimmerian language and culture had no development\".\nThe pair of chapters following the two on Cimmeria and its literature are followed by one describing another fictional country called the Cimbrian People's Republic, which allegedly absorbed Cimmeria after World War II.\nCharacters.\nThe main character in the first part of each chapter is you, the reader. The narrative starts out when you begin reading a book but then all of the pages are out of order. You then go to a bookstore to get a new copy of the book. When at the bookstore, you meet a girl, Ludmilla, who becomes an important character in the book. You think Ludmilla is beautiful, and you both share a love of books. Throughout the rest of the narrative, you and Ludmilla develop a relationship while on the quest for the rest of the book you had started reading. There are a number of minor characters that appear at various points in the story including Lotaria (Ludmilla's sister), Ermes Marana (a translation scammer), and Silas Flannery (an author).\nInfluences.\nIn a 1985 interview with Gregory Lucente, Calvino stated \"If on a winter's night a traveler\" was \"clearly\" influenced by the writings of Vladimir Nabokov. The book was also influenced by the author's membership in the literary group Oulipo. The structure of the text is said to be an adaptation of the structural semiology of A. J. Greimas.\nIn a letter written to critic Lucio Lombardo Radice dated November 13, 1979 (published in \"Italo Calvino: letters, 1941\u20131985\"), Calvino mentions Mikhail Bulgakov, Yasunari Kawabata, Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki, Juan Rulfo, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas, Jorge Luis Borges and G. K. Chesterton as having influenced, in various ways, the narrative style of the ten stories that comprise the book.\nLegacy and opinion.\nDave Langford reviewed \"If on a winter's night a traveler\" for \"White Dwarf\" #45, and declared it \"a splendidly batty book about books. [...] Offbeat and fun.\"\n\"The Telegraph\" included the novel in 69th place in a list of \"100 novels everyone should read\" in 2009, describing it as a \"playful postmodernist puzzle\".\nAuthor David Mitchell described himself as being \"magnetised\" by the book from its start when he read it as an undergraduate, but on rereading it, felt it had aged and that he did not find it \"breathtakingly inventive\" as he had the first time, yet does stress that \"however breathtakingly inventive a book is, it is only breathtakingly inventive once. But once is better than never.\"\nNovelist and lecturer Scarlett Thomas uses it to teach innovative contemporary fiction, as an example of different kinds of narrative techniques.\nSting named his 2009 album \"If on a Winter's Night...\" after the book.\nEnglish musician and composer Bill Ryder-Jones released the album \"If...\" on 14 November 2011. The album is a musical adaptation of the book and serves as an \"imaginary film score\".\nThe 2021 video game \"If on a Winter's Night, Four Travelers\" was named after the book.\nA radio adaptation of the book starring Toby Jones, Indira Varma and Tim Crouch was recorded as part of BBC's \"100 years of Radio Drama Celebrations\" and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 24 Sep 2023.\nIn the version 2.0 of the game \"Wuthering Waves\" Carlotta Montelli's companion quest \"If On A Rainy Night A Family\" references the book.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor, but is known primarily as a painter.\nMatisse is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso, as one of the artists who best helped to define the revolutionary developments in the visual arts throughout the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture.\nThe intense colourism of the works he painted between 1900 and 1905 brought him notoriety as one of the Fauves (French for \"wild beasts\"). Many of his finest works were created in the decade or so after 1906, when he developed a rigorous style that emphasized flattened forms and decorative pattern. In 1917, he relocated to a suburb of Nice on the French Riviera, and the more relaxed style of his work during the 1920s gained him critical acclaim as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting. After 1930, he adopted a bolder simplification of form. When ill health in his final years prevented him from painting, he created an important body of work in the medium of cut paper collage.\nHis mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in modern art.\nEarly life and education.\nMatisse was born in Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis, in the Nord department in Northern France on New Year's Eve in 1869, the oldest son of a wealthy grain merchant. He grew up in Bohain-en-Vermandois, Picardie. In 1887, he went to Paris to study law, working as a court administrator in Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis after gaining his qualification. He first started to paint in 1889, after his mother brought him art supplies during a period of convalescence following an attack of appendicitis. He discovered \"a kind of paradise\" as he later described it, and decided to become an artist, deeply disappointing his father.\nIn 1891, he returned to Paris to study art at the under William-Adolphe Bouguereau and at the \u00c9cole Nationale des Beaux-Arts under Gustave Moreau. Initially he painted still lifes and landscapes in a traditional style, at which he achieved reasonable proficiency. Matisse was influenced by the works of earlier masters such as Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, Nicolas Poussin, and Antoine Watteau, as well as by modern artists, such as \u00c9douard Manet, and by Japanese art. Chardin was one of the painters Matisse most admired; as an art student he made copies of four of Chardin's paintings in the Louvre.\nIn 1896, Matisse, an unknown art student at the time, visited the Australian painter John Russell on the island of Belle \u00cele off the coast of Brittany. Russell introduced him to Impressionism and to the work of Vincent van Gogh\u2014who had been a friend of Russell\u2014and gave him a Van Gogh drawing. Matisse's style changed completely: abandoning his earth-coloured palette for bright colours. He later said Russell was his teacher, and that Russell had explained colour theory to him. The same year, Matisse exhibited five paintings in the salon of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts, two of which were purchased by the state.With the model Caroline Joblau, he had a daughter, Marguerite, born in 1894. In 1898, he married Am\u00e9lie Noellie Parayre; the two raised Marguerite together and had two sons, Jean (born 1899) and Pierre (born 1900). Marguerite and Am\u00e9lie often served as models for Matisse.\nIn 1898, on the advice of Camille Pissarro, he went to London to study the paintings of J. M. W. Turner and then went on a trip to Corsica. Upon his return to Paris in February 1899, he worked beside Albert Marquet and met Andr\u00e9 Derain, Jean Puy, and Jules Flandrin. Matisse immersed himself in the work of others and went into debt from buying work from painters he admired. The work he hung and displayed in his home included a plaster bust by Rodin, a painting by Gauguin, a drawing by Van Gogh, and C\u00e9zanne's \"Three Bathers\". In C\u00e9zanne's sense of pictorial structure and colour, Matisse found his main inspiration.\nMany of Matisse's paintings from 1898 to 1901 make use of a Divisionist technique he adopted after reading Paul Signac's essay, \"\".\nIn May 1902, Am\u00e9lie's parents became ensnared in a major financial scandal, the Humbert Affair. Her mother (who was the Humbert family's housekeeper) and father became scapegoats in the scandal, and her family was menaced by angry mobs of fraud victims. According to art historian Hilary Spurling, \"their public exposure, followed by the arrest of his father-in-law, left Matisse as the sole breadwinner for an extended family of seven\". During 1902 to 1903, Matisse adopted a style of painting that was comparatively somber and concerned with form, a change possibly intended to produce saleable works during this time of material hardship. Having made his first attempt at sculpture, a copy after Antoine-Louis Barye, in 1899, he devoted much of his energy to working in clay, completing \"The Slave\" in 1903.\nFauvism.\nFauvism as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910. The movement as such lasted only a few years, 1904\u20131908, and had three exhibitions. The leaders of the movement were Matisse and Andr\u00e9 Derain. Matisse's first solo exhibition was at Ambroise Vollard's gallery in 1904, without much success. His fondness for bright and expressive colour became more pronounced after he spent the summer of 1904 painting in St. Tropez with the neo-Impressionists Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross. In that year, he painted the most important of his works in the neo-Impressionist style, \"Luxe, Calme et Volupt\u00e9\". In 1905, he travelled southwards again to work with Andr\u00e9 Derain at Collioure. His paintings of this period are characterised by flat shapes and controlled lines, using pointillism in a less rigorous way than before.\nMatisse and a group of artists now known as \"Fauves\" exhibited together in a room at the Salon d'Automne in 1905. The paintings expressed emotion with wild, often dissonant colours, without regard for the subject's natural colours. Matisse showed \"The Open Window\" and \"Woman with a Hat\" at the Salon. Critic Louis Vauxcelles commented on a lone sculpture surrounded by an \"orgy of pure tones\" as \"Donatello chez les fauves\" (Donatello among the wild beasts), referring to a Renaissance-type sculpture that shared the room with them. His comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in \"Gil Blas\", a daily newspaper, and passed into popular usage. The exhibition garnered harsh criticism\u2014\"A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public\", said the critic Camille Mauclair\u2014but also some favourable attention. When the painting that was singled out for special condemnation, Matisse's, \"Woman with the Hat\", was bought by Gertrude and Leo Stein, the embattled artist's morale improved considerably.\nMatisse was recognised as a leader of the Fauves, along with Andr\u00e9 Derain; the two were friendly rivals, each with his own followers. Other members were Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, and Maurice de Vlaminck. The Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau (1826\u20131898) was the movement's inspirational teacher. As a professor at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions.\nIn 1907, Guillaume Apollinaire, commenting about Matisse in an article published in \"La Falange\", wrote, \"We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable.\" But Matisse's work of the time also encountered vehement criticism, and it was difficult for him to provide for his family. His painting \"Nu bleu\" (1907) was burned in effigy at the Armory Show in Chicago in 1913.\nThe decline of the Fauvist movement after 1906 did not affect the career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in Montparnasse, even though he did not quite fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict bourgeois work habits. He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to Algeria in 1906 studying African art and Primitivism. After viewing a large exhibition of Islamic art in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited Morocco in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in Tangier he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour. The effect on Matisse's art was a new boldness in the use of intense, unmodulated colour, as in \"L'Atelier Rouge\" (1911).\nMatisse had a long association with the Russian art collector Sergei Shchukin. He created one of his major works \"La Danse\" specially for Shchukin as part of a two painting commission, the other painting being \"Music\" (1910). An earlier version of \"La Danse\" (1909) is in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\nGertrude Stein, Acad\u00e9mie Matisse, and the Cone sisters.\nAround April 1906, Matisse met Pablo Picasso, who was 11 years his junior. The two became lifelong friends as well as rivals and are often compared. One key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was more inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and still lifes, with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris salon of Gertrude Stein with her partner Alice B. Toklas. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris\u2014Gertrude Stein, her brothers Leo Stein, Michael Stein, and Michael's wife Sarah\u2014were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings. In addition, Gertrude Stein's two American friends from Baltimore, the Cone sisters Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings. The Cone collection is now exhibited in the Baltimore Museum of Art.\nWhile numerous artists visited the Stein salon, many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at 27 rue de Fleurus. Where the works of Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, Matisse, and Picasso dominated Leo and Gertrude Stein's collection, Sarah Stein's collection particularly emphasised Matisse.\nContemporaries of Leo and Gertrude Stein, Matisse and Picasso became part of their social circle and routinely joined the gatherings that took place on Saturday evenings at 27 rue de Fleurus. Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, remarking, \"More and more frequently, people began visiting to see the Matisse paintings [...] Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance\".\nAmong Pablo Picasso's acquaintances who also frequented the Saturday evenings were Fernande Olivier (Picasso's mistress), Georges Braque, Andr\u00e9 Derain, the poets Max Jacob and Guillaume Apollinaire, Marie Laurencin (Apollinaire's mistress and an artist in her own right), and Henri Rousseau.\nHis friends organized and financed the \"Acad\u00e9mie Matisse\" in Paris, a private and non-commercial school in which Matisse instructed young artists. It operated from 1907 until 1911. The initiative for the academy came from the Steins and the D\u00f4miers, with the involvement of Hans Purrmann, Patrick Henry Bruce, and Sarah Stein.\nMatisse spent seven months in Morocco from 1912 to 1913, producing about 24 paintings and numerous drawings. His frequent orientalist topics of later paintings, such as odalisques, can be traced to this period. Goldfish in aquariums also became a frequently recurring theme in Matisse's art following his trip to Morocco.\nAfter Paris.\nIn 1917, Matisse relocated to Cimiez on the French Riviera, a suburb of the city of Nice. His work of the decade or so following this relocation shows a relaxation and softening of his approach. This \"return to order\" is characteristic of much post-World War I art, and can be compared with the neoclassicism of Picasso and Stravinsky as well as the return to traditionalism of Derain.\nMatisse's orientalist odalisque paintings are characteristic of the period; while this work was popular, some contemporary critics found it shallow and decorative.\nIn the late 1920s, Matisse once again engaged in active collaborations with other artists. He worked with not only Frenchmen, Dutch, Germans, and Spaniards, but also a few Americans and recent American immigrants.\nAfter 1930, a new vigor and bolder simplification appeared in his work. American art collector Albert C. Barnes convinced Matisse to produce a large mural for the Barnes Foundation, \"The Dance II\", which was completed in 1932; the Foundation owns several dozen other Matisse paintings. This move toward simplification and a foreshadowing of the cut-out technique is also evident in his painting \"Large Reclining Nude\" (1935). Matisse worked on this painting for several months and documented the progress with a series of 22 photographs, which he sent to Etta Cone.\nWorld War II years.\nMatisse's wife Am\u00e9lie, who suspected that he was having an affair with her young Russian emigr\u00e9e companion, Lydia Delectorskaya, ended their 41-year marriage in July 1939, dividing their possessions equally between them. Delectorskaya attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest; remarkably, she survived with no serious after-effects, and returned to Matisse and worked with him for the rest of his life, running his household, paying the bills, typing his correspondence, keeping meticulous records, assisting in the studio, and coordinating his business affairs.\nMatisse was visiting Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940, but managed to make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to depart for Brazil to escape the occupation of France but changed his mind and remained in Nice, in Vichy France. In September 1940, he wrote Pierre: \"It seemed to me as if I would be deserting. If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?\" Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay.\nWhile the Nazis occupied France from 1940 to 1944, they were more lenient in their attacks on \"degenerate art\" in Paris than they were in the German-speaking nations under their military dictatorship. Matisse was allowed to exhibit, along with other former Fauves and Cubists whom Hitler had initially claimed to despise, although without any Jewish artists, all of whose works had been purged from all French museums and galleries; any French artists exhibiting in France had to sign an oath assuring their \"Aryan\" status, including Matisse. He also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the Mourlot Studios in Paris.\nIn 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. The surgery, while successful, resulted in serious complications from which he nearly died. Being bedridden for three months resulted in his developing a new art form using paper and scissors.\nThat same year, a nursing student named Monique Bourgeois responded to an advertisement placed by Matisse for a nurse. A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois. He discovered that she was an amateur artist and taught her about perspective. After Bourgeois left the position to join a convent in 1944, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him. Bourgeois became a Dominican nun in 1946, and Matisse painted a chapel in Vence, a small town he moved to in 1943, in her honor.\nMatisse remained, for the most part, isolated in southern France throughout the war, but his family was intimately involved with the French resistance. His son Pierre, the art dealer in New York, helped the Jewish and anti-Nazi French artists he represented to escape occupied France and enter the United States. In 1942, Pierre held an exhibition in New York, \"Artists in Exile\", which was to become legendary. Matisse's estranged wife, Am\u00e9lie, was a typist for the French Underground and jailed for six months. Matisse was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the \"R\u00e9sistance\" during the war, was tortured (almost to death) by the Gestapo in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp in Germany. Marguerite managed to escape from the train to Ravensbr\u00fcck, which was halted during an Allied air raid; she survived in the woods in the chaos of the closing days of the war until rescued by fellow resisters. Matisse's student Rudolf Levy was killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944.\nFinal years.\nCut-outs.\nDiagnosed with abdominal cancer in 1941, Matisse underwent surgery that left him reliant on a wheelchair and often bed bound. Painting and sculpture became physical challenges, so with the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or decoupage. He cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with gouache by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arranged them to form lively compositions. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity\u2014an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture. His initial pieces were modest in size, but he eventually developed murals and room-sized works. He referred to his final years as his second life, because while his mobility was limited, he could wander through gardens in the form of his cut-outs.\nAlthough the paper cut-out was Matisse's major medium in the final decade of his life, his first recorded use of the technique was in 1919 during the design of decor for the \"Le chant du rossignol\", an opera composed by Igor Stravinsky. Albert C. Barnes arranged for cardboard templates to be made of the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of cut-outs were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the cut-out technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.\nHe moved to the hilltop of Vence, France in 1943, where he produced his first major cut-out project for his artist's book titled \"Jazz\". However, these cut-outs were conceived as designs for stencil prints to be looked at in the book, rather than as independent pictorial works. At this point, Matisse still thought of the cut-outs as separate from his principal art form. His new understanding of this medium unfolds with the 1946 introduction for \"Jazz\". After summarizing his career, Matisse refers to the possibilities the cut-out technique offers, insisting \"An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of a style, prisoner of a reputation, prisoner of success\u2026\"\nThe number of independently conceived cut-outs steadily increased following \"Jazz\", and eventually led to the creation of mural-size works, such as \"Oceania the Sky\" and \"Oceania the Sea\" of 1946. Under Matisse's direction, Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant, loosely pinned the silhouettes of birds, fish, and marine vegetation directly onto the walls of the room. The two Oceania pieces, his first cut-outs of this scale, evoked a trip to Tahiti he made years before.\nIn May 1954, his cut out \"The Sheaf\" was exhibited at the Salon de Mai and met with success. The artwork was a commission for American collectors Sidney and Frances Brody and the cut out was then adapted to a ceramic for their house in Los Angeles. It is now located in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\nChapel and museum.\nIn 1948, Matisse began to prepare designs for the Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence, which allowed him to expand this technique within a truly decorative context. The experience of designing the chapel windows, chasubles, and tabernacle door\u2014all planned using the cut-out method\u2014had the effect of consolidating the medium as his primary focus. Finishing his last painting in 1951 (and final sculpture the year before), Matisse utilized the paper cut-out as his sole medium for expression up until his death.\nIn 1952, Matisse established a museum dedicated to his work, the Matisse Museum in Le Cateau, and this museum is now the third-largest collection of Matisse works in France.\nAccording to David Rockefeller, Matisse's final work was the design for a stained-glass window installed at the Union Church of Pocantico Hills near the Rockefeller estate north of New York City: \"It was his final artistic creation; the maquette was on the wall of his bedroom when he died in November of 1954.\" Installation was completed in 1956.\nDeath.\nMatisse died of a heart attack at the age of 84 on 3 November 1954. He is buried in the cemetery of the Monast\u00e8re Notre Dame de Cimiez, in the Cimiez neighbourhood of Nice.\nLegacy.\nThe first painting of Matisse acquired by a public collection was \"Still Life with Geraniums\" (1910), acquired in 1912 by the Pinakothek der Moderne.\nMatisse's son Pierre Matisse (1900\u20131989) opened a modern art gallery in New York City during the 1930s. The Pierre Matisse Gallery, which was active from 1931 until 1989, represented and exhibited many European artists and a few Americans and Canadians in New York often for the first time. He exhibited Joan Mir\u00f3, Marc Chagall, Alberto Giacometti, Jean Dubuffet, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Yves Tanguy, Le Corbusier, Paul Delvaux, Wifredo Lam, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Balthus, Leonora Carrington, Zao Wou Ki, Sam Francis, and Simon Hanta\u00ef, sculptors Theodore Roszak, Raymond Mason, and Reg Butler, and several other important artists, including the work of Henri Matisse.\nThe Mus\u00e9e Matisse in Nice, a municipal museum, has one of the world's largest collections of Matisse's works, tracing his artistic beginnings and his evolution through to his last works. The museum, which opened in 1963, is located in the Villa des Ar\u00e8nes, a seventeenth-century villa in the neighbourhood of Cimiez.\nHis \"The Plum Blossoms\" (1948) was purchased on 8 September 2005 for the Museum of Modern Art by Henry Kravis and the new president of the museum, Marie-Jos\u00e9e Drouin. Its estimated price was $25 million. Previously, it had not been seen by the public since 1970.\nA crater on the planet Mercury was named Matisse in his honor in 1976.\nIn film, Matisse was portrayed by Joss Ackland in \"Surviving Picasso\" (1996), as well as by Yves-Antoine Spoto in \"Midnight in Paris\" (2011).\nThe Ray Bradbury short story \"The Watchful Poker Chip of H. Matisse\" contains an allusion to the artist painting an eye on a poker chip for an American man to use as a monocle.\nNazi-looted art.\nNumerous artworks by Matisse were seized by the Nazis or looted from Jewish collectors or changed hands in forced sales during the Nazi years. In the past twenty years, several artworks by Matisse have been restituted to the heirs of their pre-Third Reich owners, including \"Le Mur Rose\", from France's Pompidou Museum to the heirs of Henry Fuld, \"\"Femme Assise\",\" discovered in the stash of Hildebrand Gurlitt's son in Munich, \"La vall\u00e9e de la Stour,\" which had belonged to Anna Jaff\u00e9, found in the La Chaux-de-Fonds Museum and many others. The German Lost Art Foundation lists 38 artworks by Matisse in the Lost Art Internet Database.\nRecent exhibitions.\nIn 2004, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Royal Academy of Arts, London and Le Mus\u00e9e Matisse, Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis organized \"Matisse: The Fabric of Dreams: His Art and His Textiles\", displaying Matisse\u2019s textile collection with works showing the textiles. The exhibit was shown at the Mus\u00e9e Matisse (October 23, 2004\u2013January 25, 2005), the Royal Academy of Arts (March 5\u2013May 30, 2005) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (June 23\u2013September 25, 2005). The catalog was written by Hilary Spurling, Kathleen Brunner, Ann Dumas and others. \nIn 2012, \"Matisse:\" \"In Search of True Painting\" was organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, in collaboration with the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen, and the Centre Pompidou, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, Paris.\u00a0 Roberta Smith of the New York Times described it as \"the most thrillingly instructive exhibitions of [Matisse].\" The exhibit was shown at the Centre Pompidou, Paris (March 7\u2013June 18, 2012), at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (December 4, 2012 \u2013 March 17, 2013) and the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen (July 14\u2013October 28, 2012). The catalog was edited by Rebecca Rabinow and Dorthe Aagesen \n\"Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs\" was exhibited at London's Tate Modern, from April to September 2014. The show was the largest and most extensive of the cut-outs ever mounted, including approximately 100 paper maquettes\u2014borrowed from international public and private collections\u2014as well as a selection of related drawings, prints, illustrated books, stained glass, and textiles. In total, the retrospective featured 130 works encompassing his practice from 1937 to 1954. The Tate Modern show was the first in its history to attract more than half a million people.\nThe show was then moved to New York's Museum of Modern Art, where it was on display from October 12, 2014, until February 10, 2015. The newly conserved cut-out, \"The Swimming Pool\", which had not been exhibited for more than 20 years, returned to the galleries as the centerpiece of the exhibition.\nFrom October 30, 2015 through January 18, 2016, the Morgan Library &amp; Museum held of an exhibit of his book illustration projects titled, \"Graphic Passion: Matisse and the Book Arts\".\nIn 2018, Matisse's work was exhibited alongside that of Joan Mir\u00f3, Le Corbusier, Raymond Hains and \u00c9ric Sandillon at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design in Riga, Latvia. This exhibition, titled \"\"Colour of Gobelins: Contemporary Gobelins from the 'Mobilier national' collection in France\",\" took place during the sixth edition of the Riga Textile Art.\nFrom 1 May to 10 September 2022, the Museum of Modern Art exhibited Matisse's painting \"The Red Studio\", along with https://.\nIn 2023, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, co-organized and exhibited \"Vertigo of Color: Matisse, Derain, and the Origins of Fauvism\", an exhibit examining their work together and the birth of Fauvism. The Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibited the show 13 October 2023 \u2013 21 January 2024; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston exhibited it 25 February\u201327 May 2024.

{"id": "60204", "revid": "8087765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60204", "title": "Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!", "text": "1985 studio album by Megadeth\nKilling Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is the debut studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released in the UK on May 17, 1985, by Music for Nations and in the US on June 12, 1985, by Combat Records.\nAt the beginning of 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. The band was forced to fire their original producer and produce the album by themselves, after spending half of the album's budget on drugs, alcohol, and food. Despite the poor production, the album was a well-received effort that obtained strong reviews in various music publications. \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\" played an essential role in establishing thrash metal as an authentic subgenre of heavy metal music. It explores themes of death, occultism, and violence.\nThe album features the track \"Mechanix\", a song that frontman Dave Mustaine would perform with Metallica during his tenure in the band, and a controversial cover of the 1965 song \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\". A deluxe edition, completely remixed and remastered with several bonus tracks, was released through Loud Records on February 5, 2002. It features vastly different artwork, with its cover based on the version originally designed by Mustaine in 1985. All songs from the album were performed frequently during Megadeth's initial tour but have been steadily dropped from the setlist since, except for \"Mechanix\". A new remastered version of the album called \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill\" was released on June 8, 2018, which includes a version of \"These Boots\" with re-recorded vocals, redone to match Lee Hazlewood's version.\nBackground.\nOriginally, Dave Mustaine was the lead guitarist for Metallica. However, due to drinking, substance abuse, violent behavior, and personality conflicts with bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, Mustaine was eventually fired from the band. Two months after being fired from Metallica, Mustaine met bassist David Ellefson and together they formed Megadeth in Los Angeles. Mustaine later recalled: \"After getting fired from Metallica, all I remember is that I wanted blood. Theirs. I wanted to be faster and heavier than them.\" Fueled by the desire for revenge, Mustaine elevated the intensity of Megadeth's music in order to challenge his former band. He sped up existing songs such as \"Mechanix\", which Metallica's new line-up adapted into the slower paced \"The Four Horsemen\". Mustaine included his original version of the song on the album to \"straighten Metallica up\", as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk, and said that he could not play guitar.\nAfter going through multiple vocalists, including Lor Kane, Billy Bonds and John Cyriis, Mustaine decided to handle the vocal duties himself, while also serving as the band's primary lyricist, main songwriter, and co-lead and rhythm guitarist. Megadeth recorded a three-song demo tape early in 1984 titled \"Last Rites\", engineered by Karat Faye, and released it on March 9, 1984. On the strength of the demo, the band was asked to sign with the New York-based independent label Combat Records in November 1984. Early in 1985, Megadeth was given $8,000 ($23,323 in 2024) by Combat to record and produce its debut album. However, this proved not to be enough, and the band was given a further $4,000 ($11,661 in 2024). Instead, a majority of the budget was spent on drugs, alcohol, and food, prompting the group to fire the original producer, and produce the record themselves. Poland has disputed this account. The album was successfully recorded at the Indigo Ranch Studios, in Malibu, California.\nMusic and lyrics.\nAccording to writer Peter Buckley, the record presented a faster, \"thrashier kind of heavy metal\". Steve Huey of AllMusic opined that the music on \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\" is predominantly \"chaotic\", accompanied by \"lightning-fast\" solo sections. In his book \"\", editor Jeff Wagner wrote the album displayed unusual rhythms and unorthodox guitar riffs, which carried \"like a runaway train\". Speaking about the intensity of the record, Ellefson said that \"extreme speed was deemed the cool factor in thrash metal back in those days\". Although Ellefson considers the album as a solid debut release, he wanted some of the songs to be recorded in slower tempo.\nThe album explores gloomy lyrical subjects such as death, violence, and occultism. Speaking about the themes on the album, author Bob Larson asserted that Megadeth \"cranks out songs about spilling blood and stomping guts with venomous anger\". The album's title, as well as its lyrics, led to accusations whether the band was promoting Satanism. These allegations were rigidly denied by Mustaine, who said that the band consciously kept away from the Satanic image. \"I mean, it's great to thrash and pound, cut yourself up, scream and have fun, but you don't have to take out a Pagan attitude. Why support the Devil? He's already there. I'd rather just fucking thrash and be a metalist and listen to whatever I want to than be forced to listen to one style of music.\"\nSongs.\nThe album's opening track, \"Last Rites/Loved to Death\", consists of two parts. The first part, \"Last Rites\", is an instrumental featuring a piano intro, which is a reinterpretation of J.S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. Mustaine explained that \"Loved to Death\" was his \"version of a love song\" to his girlfriend at the time. The title track was inspired by the Marvel Comics superhero the Punisher, and tells of a paid assassin. The song caused minor media controversy when a man posted an online request to a radio station to play the tune, saying it was \"good music to go postal and kill a bunch of people to\". The man was later arrested under suspicion of commencing a potential shooting spree. \"The Skull Beneath the Skin\" graphically describes a horrendous human torture, while also probing into the occult and black magic. Mustaine has said that the creation of Vic Rattlehead was explained throughout that track. \"Rattlehead\", according to Dave Mustaine, was dedicated to the band's mascot and their fans.\n\"Looking Down the Cross\" was penned by Mustaine in 1983 under the working title \"Speak No Evil\". The song tells about the temptation of Jesus Christ, using religious metaphors and imagery. \"Chosen Ones\" was partially inspired by Tim the Enchanter from the movie \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\". \"Mechanix\" was originally written by Mustaine before his tenure in Metallica. He would perform the song with them during his time in the band and, after his departure, the music and lyrics were modified to create \"The Four Horsemen\". Lyrically, \"Mechanix\" is about having sex at a gas station. \nThe album features the first of many covers performed by Megadeth: a speed metal version of Nancy Sinatra's classic \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\", with lyrics altered by Mustaine. This sparked controversy, as in 1995, the song's original author, Lee Hazlewood, \"took offense\" at the rewritten lyrics and requested that the song be removed or else risk getting sued. The song was removed from all pressings released afterwards, and in 2002, the album was re-released with a modified version of the song: the altered lyrics were censored because Hazlewood had not given permission to the band to release the cover in its original version. \nIn the liner notes of the album's 2002 reissue, Mustaine was \"strongly critical of Hazlewood\", noting that Hazlewood received royalties for a number of years before taking issue. In 2018, the song was released with the original Lee Hazlewood lyrics on the remixed and remastered version of \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\"\nArtwork.\nThe album's artwork, featuring a plastic skull with \"tinfoil and ketchup\", was not intended to be the original artwork. The intended artwork was inspired by the Three wise monkeys; Mustaine drew the original sketch and asked his friend Peyton Tuttle to paint a version of it; this early version was used on Megadeth merchandise. Both Mustaine and Ellefson had many phone conversations with Combat Records to get the cover artwork properly reproduced from a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover. However the studio lost the artwork, and instead made their own improvised replacement, with which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified. \"Metal Hammer\" included it on their list of \"50 most hilariously ugly rock and metal album covers ever\".\nPromotional tour.\nMegadeth began with live performances before the record was released. Although not a member of the band, Kerry King of Slayer played guitar for a short period because Mustaine had not recruited a full-time guitarist yet. In mid-1985, the group started a tour promoting the \"Killing Is My Business...\" album with the band Exciter. During the tour, guitarist Chris Poland abruptly left the band, and was replaced by guitarist Mike Albert. However, Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, and stayed with the band up after the tour of the next album.\nRelease.\nThe album was released on May 17, 1985. To date it remains the only Megadeth album that did not chart on the \"Billboard\" 200, primarily because it was released through an independent label with little promotion. Nevertheless, the album still went on to become one of Combat Records' highest selling releases. Later that year, Capitol Records signed Megadeth as they began working on their second album, \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\", released the following year. \nA limited edition of \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\" was released in 2002. This version's cover is redesigned to match Mustaine's original sketch, and the song \"These Boots\" was re-added, with extra \"bleeps\" in place of the rewritten sections. Over 254,000 copies of the album were sold in the United States since the beginning of the Nielsen SoundScan era. \n2018 remaster.\nIn April 2018 it was announced that the album would once again be remixed and remastered, with Mark Lewis remixing the album and Ted Jensen remastering it. Titled \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill\", the deluxe reissue features new album artwork, new mixes and masters of the original album, a new version of \"These Boots\" featuring Lee Hazlewood's original lyrics, the original 1984 demos featured on the 2002 remix, and newly-discovered live tracks sourced from VHS tapes found in Dave Mustaine's attic, as well as a previously undiscovered \"performance\" by Samuelson. The new remaster was released on June 8, 2018.\nA 40th anniversary edition was released on vinyl and streaming in October 2025. This version is based on the 2002 remaster, but contains the partial re-recording of \"These Boots\" from the \"Final Kill\" edition.\nCritical reception.\n\"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\" received mostly positive reviews, not just from metal-oriented magazines, but from the mainstream press too. Colin Larkin, writing in the \"Encyclopedia of Popular Music\", called the album a \"ferocious blast of high-energy thrash metal\", weakened by a thin production. Similarly, Steve Huey from AllMusic observed that the album is \"as raw as Megadeth gets\". However, Huey noted that the riffs and compositions weren't completely developed, and called Mustaine's vocals \"amateurish at best\". Chad Bowar from About.com said that Megadeth were still \"finding their way\" on their debut album, but remarked that the band showed great potential through angry and passionate musicianship.\nAdrien Begrand of \"PopMatters\" dismissed the original recording, but praised the re-release, writing that the album \"blazes on at a furious pace\". According to him, the record greatly influenced the heavy metal genre in the upcoming two decades. Mike Marsh of \"Drowned in Sound\" recommended the music \"for people who want it loud, fast and brutal\". In a retrospective review for KNAC, Frank Meyer said that the album put Megadeth at the forefront of heavy metal scene in the early 1980s and credited it for paving the way for thrash metal's arrival. \"CMJ New Music Report\" praised Mustaine's \"masterful\" wordplay and called the record a representative of \"the golden age of speed metal\".\nPersonnel.\nProduction and performance credits are adapted from the album liner notes.\nMegadeth\nProduction\n2002 remix and remaster\n\"The Final Kill 2018\" remix and remaster\nCharts.\nThe Final Kill\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The recording of the album was difficult for the band because of the ongoing drug issues the members had at the time. Drummer Gar Samuelson and guitarist Chris Poland were fired shortly after the album's promotional tour for drug abuse, making \"Peace Sells\" Samuelson's last Megadeth album. Poland would reappear as a session musician on Megadeth's 2004 album \"The System Has Failed\". The title track, noted for its politically conscious lyrics, was released as the album's second single and was the band's first music video. The album's cover art, featuring the band's mascot Vic Rattlehead in front of a desolated United Nations Headquarters, was created by Ed Repka.\n\"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" is often regarded as a thrash metal classic and as an album that gave prominence to extreme metal. It has been featured in several publications' best album lists, including Robert Dimery's \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\" and Martin Popoff's \"Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time\". The album has been reissued several times over the years. In 2004, the album was remixed and remastered by Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine, with extensive liner notes detailing the album's background. In 2011, the three different versions were reissued as part of the album's 25th anniversary celebration. All of them, with the exception of the 2004 mixes, feature new remastering.\nBackground and recording.\nIn an interview for \"Metal Forces\" in December 1985, frontman Dave Mustaine revealed that the band had already started writing new material for the second album. He said that two songs (\"Black Friday\" and \"Bad Omen\") were finished and described them as a \"total blur\", being much faster than \"Rattlehead\" from their debut album, \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\" However, \"Bad Omen\" was played at the bands debut gig on February 1984 at Ruthie's Inn in Berkeley, California, while \"Black Friday\" was played in April at The Keystone. Speaking about the lyrical content of \"Peace Sells...\", Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson stated that they wanted to change the public perception of heavy metal by writing songs that contained socially aware lyrics. Mustaine further noted that the band was not unaware of the political situation at the time, and that some of his political beliefs were reflected in the songs. Professional rock critic Steve Huey noted the album's combination of \"punkish political awareness with a dark, threatening, typically heavy metal worldview\".\nDuring the first two months of 1986, Megadeth commenced a brief tour of the East Coast of the United States. At the shows, which were practically a continuation of the Killing for a Living tour, the band performed a number of songs from its upcoming album. Following the conclusion of the tour, the band intended to start making the record at the Music Grinder studio on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. Mustaine lifted the title from an article in \"Reader's Digest\", which was titled \"Peace Would Sell But No One Would Buy It\". Their label at the time, Combat Records, provided a recording budget of $25,000 ($71,553 in 2024), which allowed the band to hire a freelance producer, Randy Burns. The recording of the album turned out to be very difficult for the band, because Mustaine and Ellefson were both homeless at the time. Furthermore, guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson would not show up for hours because of their heroin addiction. Shortly after the band finished the final recordings of the album for Combat, they were approached by Tim Carr, an A&amp;R representative of Capitol Records. After securing a contract with the group, Capitol hired producer Paul Lani to mix the final album. Some of Randy Burns' original demo mixes for the album were later released as bonus material when the album was remixed by Dave Mustaine in 2004.\nPoland was the only member who had multiple instruments, as Ellefson and Mustaine only had one bass and guitar respectively.\nSongs.\nTracks 1\u20134.\n\"Wake Up Dead\" features lyrics which describe a man who has been cheating on his wife or girlfriend and is sneaking into his house, knowing that if his wife finds out about his other lover, she will kill him. Mustaine said that \"Wake Up Dead\" was written about him cheating on a girl with whom he was living. He stayed with her because he was homeless at the time and needed a place to stay. Unfortunately, he was in love with another girl and thought the one he lived with would be mad because he was cheating on her. He had to leave her because he thought she had intentions to kill him. \n\"The Conjuring\", according to evangelist Bob Larson, simulates a Satanic ceremony, and makes references about being the devil's advocate and his salesman. Mustaine explained the song is about black magic and contains instructions for hexes. However, because the subject matter appears incompatible to his conversion to Christianity, the song had not been played live since 2001, until June 12, 2018, when Megadeth performed \"The Conjuring\" live for the first time in 17 years at the Home Monitoring Ar\u00e9na in Plze\u0148, Czech Republic.\n\"Peace Sells\" reflects Mustaine's political and social beliefs. The lyrics are a disapproval of the American way and convey Mustaine's wish for a new social structure. Ellefson has stated that during the tour prior to recording the album, the band could tell then that the song was going to be a hit. The video for the title track became an MTV mainstay and the opening bass line was used as introduction to MTV News. However, Mustaine proclaimed that they received no royalties because the song was excluded shortly before MTV would have to pay them for its use. \n\"Devils Island\" is a reference to a former French penal colony off the coast of French Guiana. The lyrics detail the thoughts of a condemned prisoner awaiting execution. He is spared by God, but must spend the rest of his life on the island.\nTracks 5\u20138.\n\"Good Mourning/Black Friday\" is a two-piece song, which begins with an instrumental section called \"Good Mourning\". Lyrically, Mustaine has described \"Black Friday\" as being about \"a homicidal madman who goes on a killing spree\". With an excessive use of gory language and violent imagery, the song chronicles the acts of a serial killer. It was inspired by Dijon Carruthers, who was briefly the band's drummer prior to the hiring of Gar Samuelson. According to Mustaine, Carruthers was hanging out with people who were practicing occultism, and they inspired him to write songs based on spiritual themes.\n\"Bad Omen\" explores the theme of occultism. Mustaine described \"Bad Omen\" like \"two happy campers who have stumbled onto a Satanic orgy in the middle of the woods\" and then \"they see these fools waiting around for Satan's blessing\". Asked whether the band members really believe in the subject matters they write, Mustaine responded: \"We're aware of the subjects we write about\u2014witchcraft, Satanic sacrifices and the like\u2014but we're not condoning them.\" \n\"I Ain't Superstitious\" was written by Willie Dixon and originally recorded by Howlin' Wolf in 1961. However, Megadeth's version is vastly different from the original. \n\"My Last Words\" is about a game of Russian roulette and the fear one goes through when playing the game. Despite being one of the lesser known tracks on the record, music journalist Martin Popoff said that the song was an example of the band's \"fast thrashers\" and an evidence why Megadeth were dubbed as the \"fearless speed progenitors\". Lars Ulrich, founding member of Metallica and former bandmate of Mustaine, has stated that \"My Last Words\" is his favorite Megadeth song.\nRelease and promotion.\n\"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" was released on September 25, 1986. The album's artwork was designed by Ed Repka, who later did other artwork for the band. The cover art depicts the band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, in front of a ruined United Nations Headquarters. He is portrayed as a real estate agent, who is selling the devastated remains of the organization's headquarters. Repka considers the art cover to be a \"significant milestone\" in his career.\nThe title track was released as a single, for which the band filmed its first video. In 1987, a video was made for the lead single, \"Wake Up Dead\", which featured the band performing in a steel cage. Soon after the album's release, Megadeth began a tour as a supporting band for Mot\u00f6rhead. The tour took place in California and the southwestern parts of the United States. However, due to disagreements between the managements of the two bands, Megadeth were pulled from the last three shows. Following the short stint with Mot\u00f6rhead, Megadeth were added as the opening act on Alice Cooper's Constrictor tour, which took place at the beginning of 1987. Later in 1987, after the conclusion of the album's promotional tour, Mustaine fired Poland and Samuelson due to their substance abuse issues.\nCritical reception.\nContemporary reviews.\n\"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" was well received by contemporary music critics. \"Billboard\"'s critic Fred Goodman facetiously remarked that the album is an \"array of impressive tracks\" that he does not recommend for \"the weak-hearted\". Colin Larkin, writing in the \"Encyclopedia of Popular Music\", viewed the album as a vast improvement over their previous record, from both technical and musical aspect. \"Kerrang!\" deemed \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" as the album that saw the inception of Megadeth's always-distinctive sound. Writing in \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\", author Nathan Brackett said that Megadeth were representing \"the dark and nasty side\" of American thrash throughout the 1980s. However, he considered the album to be almost identical to the rest of their discography from this period.\nIn the liner notes on the 25th anniversary reissue, Lars Ulrich gave his praise for the album, \"Whether you heard this record for the first time in 1986, or you hear this record for the first time today or tomorrow, \"Peace Sells\" is a great heavy metal album. Nothing more, nothing less. It has stood the test of time. And will continue to do so.\"\nAccording to Ellefson, he was once approached by Dimebag Darrell giving his approval of the album, \"We went out, drank hard, a good time, and Dimebag \u2013 who was known as Diamond Darrell at that time \u2013 after we had been drinking all night, he comes up to me and he looks me dead in the eye and he goes, 'David, I just want to tell you the \"Peace Sells\" album changed my life.' And I kind of shrugged it off like, 'Oh, thanks, man. Appreciate it.' And I remember he put his hand on my shoulder. He goes, 'No, it changed my life.' It was like a sobering moment right there when he said that.\"\nLegacy.\nIn retrospect, \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" has been regarded as a milestone of the American thrash metal movement. Along with Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" and Slayer's \"Reign in Blood\", which were also released in 1986, \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" is considered pivotal in giving prominence to extreme metal. AllMusic's Steve Huey recognized the record as a notable achievement in the band's history, and called it a \"classic of early thrash\". Similarly, Chad Bowar of About.com said that the album captured Megadeth in their prime, and recommended it as a \"mandatory\" recording for the fans of this genre. Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno named the album a \"bona-fide masterpiece\" and said it was the main reason why Megadeth became one of the leading acts of the underground scene. Joel McIver, writing in \"Record Collector\", said that the album's main strength was its fluidity, with all songs moving in a continuous, steady stream. According to him, the album was \"flip the bird\" to the critics who were hostile to this type of music at the time.\n\"Pitchfork Media\"'s Jess Harvell said that thanks to this album, Megadeth developed a strong cult following. He viewed the record as a resistance against the glam metal acts from the day, because bands like Megadeth were more appealing to the \"dead-end kids\". Adrien Begrand of \"PopMatters\" praised the album for making strong impression both musically and visually. Although Begrand acknowledged that this was not Megadeth's most technically proficient album, he explained that the unique combination of \"the extreme and the accessible\" is why this album remained a fan-favorite. \"Spin\" magazine's Mike Powell cited the record as an example of \"glossy hardcore\" with Satanic lyricism. Jeff Treppel from \"Decibel\" noted that the album exhibits a distinctive sound, which set Megadeth apart from their contemporaries: \"\"Peace Sells\" was a leaner, nastier predator. Megadeth preferred to kill with speed and precision instead of size and power.\" According to him, the album influenced countless heavy metal bands that followed, from Arch Enemy to DragonForce.\nIn addition to being critically acclaimed, the album received numerous accolades since its release. It has been featured in Robert Dimery's book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\", as well as in Martin Popoff's edition of the \"Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time\". About.com ranked it third on their list of \"Essential Thrash Metal Albums\", commenting that more than two decades after its release, the record holds a status as an undisputed classic. In 2017, it was ranked 8th on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\".\nReissues.\nIn 2003, Capitol Records re-released the album on DVD-Audio, with the original track list, in 96k/24-bit resolution for both surround and stereo mixes, and music videos for \"Wake Up Dead\" and \"Peace Sells\". The album was remixed and remastered in 2004 along with the rest of the band's Capitol Records albums. This reissue featured four alternate mixes of the album's songs as bonus tracks.\nOn July 12, 2011, the band re-released the album in both a two-disc reissue and a special five-disc + three-LP box set, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the album. The reissue features liner notes written by Mustaine and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich. The 25th anniversary re-release sold approximately 2,000 units in its first week of release.\nThe 25th Anniversary edition box set features five discs. Discs one\u2013three all feature the original album, with disc one having the original mix (remastered version from 2011), disc two featuring the 2004 remix, and disc three featuring the Randy Burns mixes (four examples of which appear as bonus tracks on the album's 2004 release). Disc four features the same 1987 show available on the two disc set. Disc five contains both the original album (again, remastered version from 2011), and the above listed 1987 show in hi-resolution audio. The 25th anniversary two CD edition features the original album on disc one and a previously unreleased 1987 concert on disc two.\nPersonnel.\nProduction and performance credits are adapted from the album liner notes.\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An estimated 807 million\u20131.2 billion people are infected with \"Ascaris lumbricoides\" worldwide. People living in tropical and subtropical countries are at greater risk of infection. Infection by \"Ascaris lumbricoides\" is known as ascariasis.\nIt has been proposed that \"Ascaris lumbricoides\" and \"Ascaris suum\" (pig roundworm) are the same species.\nLife cycle.\n\"Ascaris lumbricoides\", a roundworm, infects humans via the fecal-oral route. Eggs released by adult females are shed in feces. Unfertilized eggs are often observed in fecal samples but never become infective. Fertilized eggs embryonate and become infectious after 18 days to several weeks in soil, depending on the environmental conditions (optimum: moist, warm, shaded soil).\nInfection occurs when a human swallows water or food contaminated with embryonated eggs. In the duodenum, a single rhabditiform larva hatches from each of the ingested eggs. The larvae then penetrate the mucosa and submucosa and enter the venules or lymphatic vessels. From there, the larvae then pass through the heart to enter the pulmonary circulation. The larvae then break through the walls of the pulmonary capillaries to enter the alveoli. The juvenile worms then migrate from the alveoli, through the bronchioles and bronchi, and into the trachea. An acute inflammatory reaction can occur if some of the worms get lost during this migration process and accumulate in other organs of the body.\nOnce in the trachea, the worms are coughed up into the pharynx and then swallowed again, after which they pass through the stomach and into the small intestine, where they mature into adult worms. The adult worms begin producing fertilized eggs within 60\u201365 days of being swallowed; females produce as many as 200,000 eggs per day for 12\u201318 months. These fertilized eggs become infectious after two weeks in soil; they can persist in soil for 10 years or more.\nIt might seem odd that the worms end up in the same place where they began. One hypothesis to account for this behavior is that the migration mimics an intermediate host, which would be required for juveniles of an ancestral form to develop to the third stage. Another possibility is that tissue migration enables faster growth and larger size, which increases reproductive capacity. The eggs have a lipid layer which makes them resistant to the effects of acids and alkalis, as well as other chemicals.\nMorphology and anatomy.\n\"Ascaris lumbricoides\" is characterized by its great size. Males are in diameter and long. The male's posterior end is curved ventrally and has a bluntly pointed tail. Females are wide and long. The vulva is located in the anterior end and accounts for about one-third of its body length. Uteri may contain up to 27 million eggs at a time, with 200,000 being laid per day. Fertilized eggs are oval to round in shape and are long and wide with a thick outer shell. Unfertilized eggs measure long and wide.\nAnatomically, the digestive tract is complete with prominent muscular pharynx. Respiration is by simple diffusion across body wall. The nervous system consists of a nerve ring and many longitudinal nerve cords. They are dioecious and have separate reproductive systems consisting of thread like gonads and genital ducts that open outside by apertures. Fertilization is internal and development is mostly indirect. Sexual dimorphism is well marked. Externally, males are much shorter than females and males also have a curved posterior end, unlike females. Internally, in males, all the digestive, reproductive systems open in a common chamber- cloaca whereas in females, there is a separate anus for digestive tract and female genital pore for female reproductive system.\nEpidemiology.\nAn estimated 807 million\u20131.2 billion people are infected with \"A. lumbricoides\" worldwide. While infection occurs throughout most of the world, ascariasis is most common in sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, China, and east Asia. Although the prevalence is low in the United States, ascariasis is still endemic in the southeastern United States due to the temperature and humid climate.\n\"A. lumbricoides\" eggs are extremely resistant to strong chemicals, desiccation, and low temperatures. The eggs can remain viable in soil for months or even years. Eggs of \"A. lumbricoides\" have been identified in coprolites in the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and New Zealand, the oldest ones being more than 24,000 years old.\nInfections.\nInfections with these parasites are more common where sanitation is poor, and raw human feces are used as fertilizer.\nSymptoms.\nOften, no symptoms are presented with a minor \"A. lumbricoides\" infection, the inevitable consequence being the e.g. once a year passage of such clearly visible worm(s) on close inspection. In the case of bad infections symptoms commonly include bloody sputum, cough, fever, abdominal discomfort, intestinal ulcer(s), as well as a less commonly missed passing of the quite long worms. Ascariasis is the most common cause of L\u00f6ffler's syndrome worldwide. Accompanying pathological symptoms include pulmonary infiltration, eosinophilia (symptoms of the overabundance of eosinophils in the blood such as asthma and allergic reactions), and a diagnostic symptom is, aside from standard microscopy of stools, radiographic opacities. One study has observed increases in fertility in infected women, in a similar vein to good diet and exercise, but with all of the pathological negatives and discomforts the disease carries with it, varying from host to host and again with diet.\nDistribution.\n\"Ascaris lumbricoides\" is primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, particularly in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices. It is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia (including countries like India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia), and parts of Latin America, where inadequate sanitation infrastructure and the use of human faeces as fertilizer contribute to its spread.\nPrevention.\nPreventing any fecal-borne disease requires educated hygienic habits/culture and effective fecal treatment systems. This is particularly important with \"A. lumbricoides\" because its eggs are one of the most difficult pathogens to kill (second only to prions), and the eggs commonly survive 1\u20133 years. \"A. lumbricoides\" lives in the intestine where it lays eggs. Infection occurs when the eggs, too small to be seen by the unaided eye, are eaten. The eggs may get onto vegetables when improperly processed human feces of infected people are used as fertilizer for food crops. Infection may occur when food is handled without removing or killing the eggs on the hands, clothes, hair, raw vegetables/fruit, or cooked food that is (re)infected by handlers, containers, etc. Bleach does not readily kill \"A. lumbricoides\" eggs, but it will remove their sticky film, to allow the eggs to be rinsed away. \"A. lumbricoides\" eggs can be reduced by hot composting methods, but to completely kill them may require rubbing alcohol, iodine, specialized chemicals, cooking heat, or \"unusually\" hot composting (for example, over for 24 hours).\nTreatment.\nControl of roundworm infections is based on treatment with medication, improved sanitation and health education. This usually takes around three days.\nHistory.\nGiant intestinal roundworms have been known since antiquity. In 1758 Linnaeus named them \"Ascaris lumbricoides\". For many centuries, they were thought to arise by spontaneous generation. In 1855, \"Ascaris\" eggs were found in human faeces by Henry Ransom in England then this was described in the literature two years later by Casimir-Joseph Davaine in France. Attempts to infect animals by feeding them eggs were unsuccessful. In 1886, Salvatore Calandruccio in Italy successfully infected a boy to whom he had given 150 eggs. Battista Grassi published this information without giving any acknowledgement to Calandruccio. Development was thought to occur directly within the bowel lumen but Francis Stewart in Hong Kong in 1916 fed eggs to rats, then later mice, and found infective larvae in the faeces and in the lungs but no mature worms. In 1918, Sadao Yoshida ingested larvae recovered from the trachea of a guinea pig, then found eggs in his own stools 76 days later. In 1922, Shimesu Koino ingested 2,000 \"Ascaris lumbricoides\" eggs, found larvae in his sputum a few days later, then after 50 days took an anthelmintic and recovered 667 immature \"Ascaris lumbricoides\", thus confirming the life cycle.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is commonly known as the \"whipworm\" which refers to the shape of the worm; it looks like a whip with wider \"handles\" at the posterior end. The helminth is also known to cause rectal prolapse.\nLife cycle.\nThe female \"T. trichiura\" produces 2,000\u201310,000 single-celled eggs per day. Eggs are deposited from human feces to soil where, after two to three weeks, they become embryonated and enter the \"infective\" stage. These embryonated infective eggs are ingested by hand-mouth or through fomites and hatch in the human small intestine, exploiting the intestinal microflora as a stimulus to hatching. This is the location of growth and molting. The infective larvae penetrate the villi and continue to develop in the small intestine. The young worms move to the caecum and penetrate the mucosa, and there they complete development as adult worms in the large intestine. The life cycle from the time of ingestion of eggs to the development of mature worms takes approximately three months. During this time, there may be limited signs of infection in stool samples, due to a lack of egg production and shedding. The female \"T. trichiura\" begin to lay eggs after three months of maturity. Worms commonly live for about one year, during which time females can lay up to 20,000 eggs per day.\nRecent studies using genome-wide scanning revealed that two quantitative trait loci on chromosome 9 and chromosome 18 may be responsible for a genetic predisposition or susceptibility to infection of \"T. trichiura\" by some individuals.\nMorphology.\n\"Trichuris trichiura\" has a narrow anterior esophageal end and shorter and thicker posterior end. These pinkish-white worms are threaded through the mucosa. They attach to the host through their slender anterior end and feed on tissue secretions instead of blood. Females are larger than males; approximately 35\u201350\u00a0mm long compared to 30\u201345\u00a0mm. The females have a bluntly round posterior end compared to their male counterparts with a coiled posterior end. Their characteristic eggs are barrel-shaped and brown, and have bipolar protuberances.\nInfection.\nTrichuriasis, also known as \"whipworm infection,\" occurs through ingestion of whipworm eggs and is more common in warmer climates. Whipworm eggs are passed in the feces of infected persons, and if an infected person defecates outdoors or if untreated human feces is used as fertilizer, eggs are deposited on soil where they can mature into an infective stage. Ingestion of these eggs \"can happen when hands or fingers that have contaminated dirt on them are put in the mouth or by consuming vegetables or fruits that have not been carefully cooked, washed or peeled.\" The eggs hatch in the small intestine, then move into the wall of the small intestine and develop. On reaching adulthood, the thinner end (the anterior of the worm) burrows into the large intestine, the thicker (posterior) end projecting into the lumen, where it mates with nearby worms. The females can grow to long.\n\"Trichuris trichiura\" can cause the serious disease Trichuris dysentery syndrome (TDS), with chronic dysentery, anemia, rectal prolapse, and poor growth. TDS is treated with anthelminthics as well as iron supplementation for anemia.\nWhipworm commonly infects patients also infected with \"Giardia\", \"Entamoeba histolytica\", \"Ascaris lumbricoides\", and hookworms.\nTreatment.\n\"Trichuris trichiura\" can be treated with a single dose of albendazole. In Kenya, half of a group of children, 98% of whom had \"Trichuris trichiura\" with or without infections by other soil-transmitted helminths, were given albendazole, while the other half of the children received placebos. It was found that the children who received the drug grew significantly better than the group of children who did not receive the treatment. Another treatment that can be used is mebendazole, or flubendazole. The medication interferes with the parasite's nutrient intake, which eventually leads to death. \nHowever, it has been shown that both albendazole and mebendazole have low cure rate for \"Trichuris trichiura\" specifically, with treatments only achieving cure rates 30.7% for albendazole and 42.1% for mebendazole.\nEpidemiology.\nThere is a worldwide distribution of \"Trichuris trichiura\", with an estimated one billion human infections. However, it is chiefly tropical, especially in Asia and, to a lesser degree, in Africa and South America. Within the United States, infection is rare overall but may be common in the rural Southeast, where 2.2 million people are thought to be infected. Poor hygiene is associated with trichuriasis as well as the consumption of shaded moist soil, or food that may have been fecally contaminated. Children are especially vulnerable to infection due to their high exposure risk. Eggs are infective about 2\u20133 weeks after they are deposited in the soil under proper conditions of warmth and moisture, hence its tropical distribution.\nA closely related species, \"Trichuris suis\", which typically infects pigs, is capable of infecting humans. This shows that the two species have very close evolutionary histories. However, morphology and developmental stages remain different, making them two separate species.\nWHO have since 2001 had a strategy for control of soil-transmitted helminths, including whipworms. This strategy entails treating at-risk individuals in the endemic areas. Risk groups for whipworm infections are children at preschool and school-aged children, people with specific high-risk jobs, women in reproductive and pregnant and breastfeeding women. The periodic treatment of the risk groups is done through either deworming campaigns or preventative chemotherapy.\nTreatment of inflammatory disorders.\nThe hygiene hypothesis suggests that various immunological disorders that have been observed in humans only within the last 100 years, such as Crohn's disease, or that have become more common during that period as hygienic practices have become more widespread, may result from a lack of exposure to parasitic worms (helminths) during childhood. The use of \"Trichuris suis\" ova (TSO, or pig whipworm eggs) by Weinstock, et al., as a therapy for treating Crohn's disease and to a lesser extent ulcerative colitis are two examples that support this hypothesis. There is also anecdotal evidence that treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with TSO decreases the incidence of asthma, allergy, and other inflammatory disorders. Some scientific evidence suggests that the course of multiple sclerosis may be very favorably altered by helminth infection; TSO is being studied as a treatment for this disease.\nSee also.\nDefecography\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCaroline Pomeroy, PhD July 9th, 2019."}

Its common name in the US is threadworm. In the UK and Australia, however, the term \"threadworm\" can also refer to nematodes of the genus \"Enterobius\", otherwise known as pinworms.\nThe \"Strongyloides stercoralis\" nematode can parasitize humans. The adult parasitic stage lives in tunnels in the mucosa of the small intestine. The genus \"Strongyloides\" contains 53 species, and \"S. stercoralis\" is the type species. \"S. stercoralis\" has been reported in other mammals, including cats and dogs. However, it seems that the species in dogs is typically not \"S. stercoralis\", but the related species \"S. canis\". Non-human primates are more commonly infected with \"S. fuelleborni\" and \"S. cebus\", although \"S. stercoralis\" has been reported in captive primates. Other species of \"Strongyloides\" that are naturally parasitic in humans, but with restricted distributions, are \"S. fuelleborni fuelleborni\" in central Africa and \"S. fuelleborni kellyi\" in Papua New Guinea.\nGeographic distribution.\n\"S. stercoralis\" infection is associated with fecal contamination of soil or water. Hence, it is a very rare infection in developed economies. In developing countries, it is less prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas (where sanitation standards are poor). \"S. stercoralis\" can be found in areas with tropical and subtropical climates.\nStrongyloidiasis was first described in the 19th century in French soldiers returning home from expeditions in Indochina. Today, the countries of the old Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) still have endemic strongyloidiasis, with the typical prevalences being 10% or less. Regions of Japan used to have endemic strongyloidiasis, but control programs have eliminated the disease. Strongyloidiasis appears to have a high prevalence in some areas of Brazil and Central America. It is endemic in Africa, but the prevalence is typically low (1% or less). Pockets have been reported from rural Italy, but the current status is unknown. In the Pacific islands, strongyloidiasis is rare, although some cases have been reported from Fiji. In tropical Australia, some rural and remote Australian Aboriginal communities have very high prevalences of strongyloidiasis.\nIn some African countries (e.g., Congo), \"S. fuelleborni\" was more common than \"S. stercoralis\" in parasite surveys from the 1970s, but the current status is unknown. In Papua New Guinea, \"S. stercoralis\" is endemic, but prevalence is low. However, in some areas, another species, \"S. kellyi\", is a very common parasite of children in the New Guinea Highlands and Western Province.\nKnowledge of the geographic distribution of strongyloidiasis is of significance to travelers who may acquire the parasite during their stays in endemic areas.\nBecause strongyloidiasis could theoretically be transmittable through unsanitary bedclothes care must be taken never to use unclean hotel bed sheets in endemic areas. Using plastic slippers when showering may be very important when travelling in tropical regions.\nEstimates of the number of people infected vary with one estimate putting the figure at 370 million worldwide. Local prevalence can exceed 40% in some tropical and subtropical countries.\nLife cycle.\nThe life cycle of this parasite is more complex than that of most nematodes, with its alternation between free-living and parasitic cycles, and its potential for autoinfection (the parasite has the ability to complete its life cycle without the involvement of another host) and multiplication within the host. The parasitic cycle is homogonic, while the free-living cycle is heterogonic. The heterogonic life cycle is advantageous to the parasite because it allows reproduction in the absence of a host.\nIn the free-living cycle, the rhabditiform larvae passed in the stool can either molt twice and become infective filariform larvae (direct development) or molt four times and become free-living adult males and females that mate and produce eggs from which rhabditiform larvae hatch. In the direct development, first-stage larvae (L1) transform into infective larvae (IL) via three molts. The indirect route results first in the development of free-living adults that mate; the female lays eggs, which hatch and then develop into IL. The direct route gives IL faster (three days) versus the indirect route (seven to 10 days). However, the indirect route results in an increase in the number of IL produced. Speed of development of IL is traded for increased numbers. The free-living males and females of \"S. stercoralis\" die after one generation; they do not persist in the soil. The latter, in turn, can either develop into a new generation of free-living adults or develop into infective filariform larvae. The filariform larvae penetrate the human host skin to initiate the parasitic cycle.\nUpon contact with contaminated soil, infectious larvae contained in the soil can penetrate the skin. \nSome of the larvae enter the superficial veins and are carried in the blood to the lungs, where they enter the alveoli. They are then coughed up and swallowed into the gut, where they parasitise the intestinal mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum. In the small intestine, they molt twice and become adult female worms. The females live threaded in the epithelium of the small intestine and, by parthenogenesis, produce eggs, which yield rhabditiform larvae. Only females will reach reproductive adulthood in the intestine. Female strongyloids reproduce through parthenogenesis. The eggs hatch in the intestine and young larvae are then excreted in the feces. It takes about two weeks to reach egg development from the initial skin penetration. By this process, \"S. stercoralis\" can cause both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. The worms also participate in autoinfection, in which the rhabditiform larvae become infective filariform larvae, which can penetrate either the intestinal mucosa (internal autoinfection) or the skin of the perianal area (external autoinfection); in either case, the filariform larvae may follow the previously described route, being carried successively to the lungs, the bronchial tree, the pharynx, and the small intestine, where they mature into adults; or they may disseminate widely in the body. To date, occurrence of autoinfection in humans with helminthic infections is recognized only in \"Strongyloides stercoralis\" and \"Capillaria philippinensis\" infections. In the case of \"Strongyloides\", autoinfection may explain the possibility of persistent infections for many years in persons not having been in an endemic area and of hyperinfections in immunodepressed individuals.\n\"Strongyloides\" is thought to be attracted to humans via paired thermosensory neurons. While \"S. stercoralis\" is attracted to chemicals such as carbon dioxide or sodium chloride, these chemicals are not specific. Larvae have been thought to locate their hosts via chemicals in the skin, the predominant one being urocanic acid, a histidine metabolite on the uppermost layer of skin that is removed by sweat or the daily skin-shedding cycle. Urocanic acid concentrations can achieve at least fivefold greater levels on the foot sole than any other part of the human body.\nZoonotic transmission.\nDogs can act as a host for this parasite both in the wild and in the laboratory, but transmission from dog to human has been difficult to prove. Molecular genetic analyses have shown that there are two populations of this parasite in dogs, one of which (type B) is exclusive to dogs and a second (type A) that is common to dogs and humans. These two genotypes may be separate species. The identity of the genes suggests that dog to human transmission may occur.\nMorphology.\nWhereas males grow to only about in length, females can grow from . Both sexes also possess a tiny buccal capsule and cylindrical esophagus without a posterior bulb. In the free-living stage, the esophagi of both sexes are rhabditiform. Males can be distinguished from females by two structures: the spicules and gubernaculum.\nAutoinfection.\nAn unusual feature of \"S. stercoralis\" is autoinfection. Only one other species in the genus \"Strongyloides\", \"S. felis\", has this trait. Autoinfection is the development of L1 into small infective larvae in the gut of the host. These autoinfective larvae penetrate the wall of the lower ileum or colon or the skin of the perianal region, enter the circulation again, travel to the lungs, and then to the small intestine, thus repeating the cycle. Autoinfection makes strongyloidiasis due to \"S. stercoralis\" an infection with several unusual features.\nPersistence of infection is the first of these important features. Because of autoinfection, humans have been known to still be infected up to 65 years after they were first exposed to the parasite (e.g., World War II or Vietnam War veterans). Once a host is infected with \"S. stercoralis\", infection is lifelong unless effective treatment eliminates all adult parasites and migrating autoinfective larvae.\nSymptoms.\nMany people infected are asymptomatic at first. Symptoms include dermatitis: swelling, itching, larva currens, and mild hemorrhage at the site where the skin has been penetrated. Spontaneous scratch-like lesions may be seen on the face or elsewhere. If the parasite reaches the lungs, the chest may feel as if it is burning, and wheezing and coughing may result, along with pneumonia-like symptoms (L\u00f6ffler's syndrome). The intestines could eventually be invaded, leading to burning pain, tissue damage, sepsis, and ulcers. Stools may have yellow mucus with a recognizable smell. Chronic diarrhea can be a symptom. In severe cases, edema may result in obstruction of the intestinal tract, as well as loss of peristaltic contractions.\nStrongyloidiasis in immunocompetent individuals is usually an indolent disease. However, in immunocompromised individuals, it can cause a hyperinfective syndrome (also called disseminated strongyloidiasis) due to the reproductive capacity of the parasite inside the host. This hyperinfective syndrome can have a mortality rate close to 90% if disseminated.\nImmunosuppressive drugs, especially corticosteroids and agents used for tissue transplantation, can increase the rate of autoinfection to the point where an overwhelming number of larvae migrate through the lungs, which in many cases can prove fatal. In addition, diseases such as human T-lymphotropic virus 1, which enhance the Th1 arm of the immune system and lessen the Th2 arm, increase the disease state. Another consequence of autoinfection is the autoinfective larvae can carry gut bacteria back into the body. About 50% of people with hyperinfection present with bacterial disease due to enteric bacteria. Also, a unique effect of autoinfective larvae is larva currens due to the rapid migration of the larvae through the skin. Larva currens appears as a red line that moves rapidly (more than per day), and then quickly disappears. It is pathognomonic for autoinfective larvae and can be used as a diagnostic criterion for strongyloidiasis due to \"S. stercoralis\".\nDiagnosis.\nLocating juvenile larvae, either rhabditiform or filariform, in recent stool samples will confirm the presence of this parasite. Other techniques used include direct fecal smears, culturing fecal samples on agar plates, serodiagnosis through ELISA, and duodenal fumigation. Still, diagnosis can be difficult because of the day-to-day variation in juvenile parasite load.\nPrevention.\nIdeally, prevention, by improved sanitation (proper disposal of feces), practicing good hygiene (washing of hands), etc., is used before any drug regimen is administered.\nTreatment.\nIvermectin is the drug of choice for treatment, due to its low side effect profile. Albendazole is also effective in treating strongyloidiasis. Mebendazole has a much higher failure rate in clinical practice than albendazole or ivermectin. However, these drugs have little effect on the autoinfective larvae. Hence, repeat treatments with ivermectin or albendazole must be administered to kill newly matured parasites that have developed from the autoinfective larvae. This means a full treatment dose every two weeks until all larvae capable of maturing into adults have been extirpated. Follow-up stool samples, potential additional treatment, and blood tests are necessary to ensure a cure.\nChemoattractant.\nThis parasite depends on chemical cues to find a potential host. It uses sensor neurons of class AFD to identify cues excreted by the host.\" S. stercoralis\" is attracted to nonspecific attractants of warmth, carbon dioxide, and sodium chloride. Urocanic acid, a component of skin secretions in mammals, is a major chemoattractant. Larvae of \"S. stercoralis\" are strongly attracted to this compound. This compound can be suppressed by metal ions, suggesting a possible strategy for preventing infection.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The epithet \"Curthose\" originated in the Norman French word \"courtheuse\" (\"short stockings\"). The chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Orderic Vitalis wrote that his father had derisively called him \"brevis-ocrea\" (\"short boot\").\nRobert's reign is noted for the discord with his brothers, the English kings William II and Henry I. He mortgaged his duchy to finance his participation in the First Crusade, where he was an important commander. In 1106, his disagreements with Henry led to defeat in the Battle of Tinchebray and lifelong captivity, with Normandy temporarily absorbed into England's possession.\nEarly life.\nRobert was the eldest son of William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England and Matilda of Flanders. Estimates of Robert's birth-date range between 1051 and 1053. As a child he was betrothed to Margaret, the heiress of Maine, but she died before they could wed, and Robert did not marry until his late forties. In his youth he was courageous and skilful in military exercises. He was also prone to laziness and weakness of character that discontented nobles and the King of France exploited to stir discord with his father. He was unsatisfied with the share of power allotted to him and quarrelled with his father and brothers fiercely. In 1063, his father made him the Count of Maine in view of his engagement to Margaret, and Robert may have ruled independently in Maine. The county remained under Norman control until 1069, when the county revolted and reverted to Hugh V of Maine.\nIn 1077, Robert instigated his first insurrection against his father as the result of a prank played by his younger brothers William Rufus and Henry, who had dumped a full chamber pot over his head. Robert was enraged and, urged on by his companions, started a brawl with his brothers that was only interrupted by the intercession of their father. Feeling that his dignity was wounded, Robert was further angered when King William failed to punish his brothers. The next day Robert and his followers attempted to seize the castle of Rouen. The siege failed, but, when King William ordered their arrest, Robert and his companions took refuge with Hugh of Chateauneuf-en-Thymerais. They were forced to flee again when King William attacked their base at R\u00e9malard.\nExile.\nRobert fled to Flanders to the court of his uncle Robert I, Count of Flanders before plundering the county of the Vexin and causing such mayhem that his father, King William, allied himself with King Philip I of France to stop his rebellious son. Relations were not helped when King William discovered that his wife, Robert's mother Queen Matilda, was secretly sending him money. At a battle in January 1079, Robert is said to have unhorsed King William in combat and succeeded in wounding him, only stopping his attack when he recognised his father's voice. Humiliated, King William cursed his son. King William then raised the siege and returned to Rouen.\nAt Easter 1080, father and son were reunited by the efforts of Queen Matilda, and a truce between the two lasted until she died in 1083. Robert seems to have left court soon after the death of his mother and spent several years travelling throughout France, Germany, and Flanders. He visited Italy seeking the hand of the great heiress Matilda of Tuscany (b. 1046) but was unsuccessful. During this period as a wandering knight Robert sired several illegitimate children. His son Richard seems to have spent much of his life at the royal court of his uncle William Rufus. This Richard was killed in a hunting accident in the New Forest in 1100, as was his uncle, King William Rufus, the same year. An illegitimate daughter was later married to Helias of Saint-Saens.\nReign as Duke of Normandy (1087\u20131096).\nSuccession crisis.\nIn 1087, the elder William died of wounds suffered from a riding accident during a siege of Mantes. At his death he reportedly wanted to disinherit his eldest son but was persuaded to instead divide the Norman dominions between his two eldest sons. To Robert he granted the Duchy of Normandy and to William Rufus he granted the Kingdom of England. The youngest son, Henry, was given money to buy land. Of the two elder sons Robert was considered to be much weaker and was generally preferred by the nobles who held lands on both sides of the English Channel since they could more easily circumvent his authority. When their father died, the two brothers agreed to be each other's heirs. \nThis agreement lasted less than a year, when barons joined with Robert to displace Rufus in the Rebellion of 1088, beginning in the spring of that year. Although Robert initially accepted Rufus's claim in England, when given the opportunity by the leader of the conspiracy, Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, he began preparations. For this, Robert lacked sufficient funds, and approached his younger brother Henry for part of the money he had received in the inheritance. Henry refused, but Robert promptly offered the whole of the Cotentin, as well as Avranches and Mont-Saint-Michel, in exchange for 3000 livres. Henry agreed.\nMeanwhile, William found out about his barons' plot to overthrow him, and went to besiege Odo at Rochester. Odo found out, and fled for Pevensey to join the defence. The king followed the bishop towards Pevensey Castle and promptly began a siege there instead, abandoning the proposed action against Rochester. Although Robert did not himself join his allies in England, he sent a contingent of soldiers towards England so as to support them as he continued preparations. William sent his own fleet to contest the Norman landing as he invested Pevensey, at which point the English navy won a decisive victory. Robert's fleet had cost 3000 livres; all of the money gained from selling the Cotentin was now gone. After six weeks, Pevensey fell and Odo was captured, with William then having to besiege Rochester defended by multiple great Norman magnates, such as Robert of Bell\u00eame amongst the leaders. \nWith still no aid from Robert, whose resources were now limited, the defenders were forced to surrender. Bishop Odo was exiled and lost all of his lands within England, alongside other conspirators, and Robert lost any opportunity he had to seize England for the next 12 years. Not all of the barons who participated in the revolt were punished so severely; many, such as Roger Bigod and the Grandmesnils, reconciled with Rufus and came to oppose Robert. The revolt failed in part because Robert never showed up to support the English rebels, leaving only the controversial Odo of Bayeux to lead the barons.\nRule in Normandy.\nThe central authority of the Duke of Normandy weakened in the midst of William I's death, though not to a terminal extent. Local magnates including Ralph of Conches and Robert of Bell\u00eame expelled the garrisons of the late king and established areas of dominion. Robert was affable, mild, and generous to his barons and the clergy. In 1088 alone, Robert endowed the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne and F\u00e9camp Abbey. However, this, alongside the sudden weakness of ducal authority, and other expenditures, left Robert almost perpetually lacking in funds. \nEnemies of Henry at Robert's court had convinced the duke to arrest his younger brother and Robert of Bell\u00eame, on suspicion of reconciling with Rufus. Henry had, in fact, travelled across the channel to request the estates of the late Matilda of Flanders, which Rufus refused to surrender. Henry was released after six months. \nOn the advice of Odo of Bayeux, Duke Robert quickly assembled an army in August of 1088 with which he marched to Le Mans and was welcomed by the citizens, with the purpose of securing his control over the southern frontier castles of the duchy. This army secured the castles of Saint-C\u00e9neri and Ballon, both formerly in revolt against Robert. The duke had Robert Quarrel, the lord of Ballon, blinded, and mutilated his enemies within Saint-C\u00e9neri. Robert of Bell\u00eame was imprisoned by the duke, and only freed due to the intervention of Roger of Montgomery, his father. Roger requested peace, and successfully petitioned for his son to be released. The duke may have been motivated by Robert's prior dogged support for the invasion of England.\nInstability and defections.\nBy 1089, Duke Robert faced another threat in the form of Rufus's wish to destabilize Normandy. In contrast to his elder brother, the English king possessed deep pockets and more expansive methods of raising wealth, with a large treasury available at Winchester. William bribed many of Robert's vassals away from him, starting with the garrison of Saint-Valery. Stephen of Aumale, Gerard of Gournay, Robert of Eu, Walter Giffard, and Ralph Mortemer were all coaxed towards William's side, leaving most of the Norman barons on the right bank of the Seine ready to break away from the duke. \nLacking the same financial resources or ability to deliver reward, Robert was in a sense helpless against this change, but Helias of Saint-Sa\u00ebns, the Lord of Saint-Sa\u00ebns, stood firm in the duke's camp. Helias was, for his loyalty, given the hand of an illegitimate daughter of Robert's alongside the castles of Arques and Bures, making him one of the only counterbalances to William's intercessions in the region. The duke managed to form an alliance with Philip, King of France against the magnates East of the Seine, and they launched a siege of Gerard of Gournay's castle at La Fert\u00e9-Bernard. In exchange, Robert granted Philip the castle of Gisors, along the Epte, which marked the border of the Vexin. The castle had belonged to the Cathedral of Rouen and this grant angered Archbishop William. Robert besieged and captured the castle of Eu, and Aird considers him to have had a successful campaign against the rebels by September of 1089.\nA revolt broke out in Maine when the Manceau heard of Robert's illness in late 1089. Preoccupied with the barons east of the Seine, Robert met with Fulk IV, Count of Anjou, and requested that he resolve the crisis. Fulk agreed if he was allowed to marry the daughter of Simon de Montfort, Bertrade, despite having been married thrice. Bertrade was in the care of her uncle, William of \u00c9vreux, and to secure the marriage, Robert had to grant William the lands of Ralph Asshead, and grant a series of castles to his nephew, William of Breteuil. Fulk successfully suppressed the revolt in Maine for a year.\nIn November 1090, a revolt broke out in Rouen led by the Pilatenses, a faction of the city opposed to Robert's rule and led by Conan, the son of Gilbert Pilatus. As supposedly the wealthiest citizen of Rouen, Conan was supported by William Rufus in his revolt, and Robert had to hastily summon his vassals to assist him in crushing the riot. Henry, Robert's brother, was convinced to forget the duke's prior wrongs against him and come to his aid. Though he led his men bravely, Duke Robert's vassals convinced him to flee the city for his own safety, while Henry and Gilbert of L'Aigle crushed the revolt and captured many of its leaders. Conan was personally executed by Henry. \nBut Robert's success here did not prevent failures elsewhere. In the same month, a private war broke out between Ralph of Conches and William of \u00c9vreux, and Ralph appealed to the duke for aid. Robert, under significant pressure, was not forthcoming, and Ralph then requested support from William of England. William quickly directed his satellites in Normandy to support Ralph, thus expanding the king's influence in the duchy. At the same time, in Maine, the Norman garrisons were expunged and Maine was claimed by Hugh of Este, a relative of Hugh IV. Only Ho\u00ebl, Bishop of Le Mans stayed loyal to Robert and his resistance saw support for Hugh ultimately deteriorate. Hugh would ultimately sell the comital title to Helias of La Fl\u00e8che.\nCooperation and renewed conflict.\nIn early 1091, either January or February, King William launched an invasion of Normandy with a large fleet, establishing his base at Eu. Robert's barons abandoned him against Rufus, retreating to their castles. Robert ultimately required the aid of Philip of France once again, and the two marched against the city of Eu. However, before major fighting could begin, negotiations instead took place at Rouen. Robert surrendered the Abbey of F\u00e9camp, the counties of Eu and Aumale, the territories of Gerard of Gournay and Ralph of Conches, and the castles of Cherbourg and Mont-Saint-Michel. All the barons who had been punished by either brother were to receive amnesty and their estates back.\nThis was threatening for Henry, who still ruled in the Cotentin. After the riot at Rouen, Henry had been forced from Rouen by the duke and sent home, with their relationship once again on the decline. The prince immediately began preparations for war, but as the armies of Curthose and Rufus invaded, his baronial support network melted away. After the bulk of Henry's capacity for resistance had already been eliminated, he held out at the castle of Mont-Saint-Michel for two weeks, at which point Henry negotiated a surrender. \nMeanwhile, the brothers envisaged a stricter enforcement of ducal authority, summoning an assembly on 18 July for that purpose. A few weeks later, either in early August or late July, Robert, William, and Henry crossed over into England, after helping William assert his lordship over Malcolm, King of Scotland, Robert returned to Normandy in December of 1091. Even after this point, the power of the duke did not stay for long. Henry returned in 1092 and seized Domfront, which he used as a base to begin successfully recovering the Cotentin.\nWith the short reconciliation between Henry and his brothers over, the alliance between William and Robert came next. William had neglected his promise to aid Robert in 1092 and 1093, to the point that the duke's patience ran out, and in 1093, he ended their alliance. Robert accused Rufus of perjury, provoking the king into launching an invasion around Midlent of 1094. After a failed negotiation, the dispute was put in the hands of the barons, who unilaterally agreed that the origin of the conflict was in Rufus's own failures to honor his agreement. \nThe king did not accept their condemnation, and withdrew from the conference. After bribing multiple barons to his side, William captured the castle of Bures-en-Bray, held by Helias. But Robert launched a simultaneous campaign of much more success, seizing the significant castles of Argentan and Le Homme, each with large garrisons, alongside his overlord Philip of France, and capturing William Peverel. William retreated to England to raise greater forces, and successfully bribed Philip to abandon his Norman ally, but Robert maintained his campaign without French aid. When the king summoned Prince Henry to his side, Henry was unable to make it past Robert's forces. William sent ships to retrieve Henry with which Henry travelled to England for an audience with the king upon his return. Rufus stayed in Normandy until 29 December, at which point he sailed to Dover, England, with nothing to show for his campaign. William's war against Robert continued into 1095.\nFirst Crusade and return.\nIn 1096, Robert formed an army and left Normandy to join the First Crusade to aid the Byzantine Empire against the Seljuk Turks and travel to Jerusalem. To raise money for the crusade he mortgaged his duchy to his brother William for the sum of 10,000 marks. \nRobert joined forces with his cousin, Robert II, Count of Flanders, and his brother-in-law, Stephen, Count of Blois; they travelled together to Italy, where they stayed in Norman Apulia during the winter of 1096/97. It is then that he most likely met his future wife, Sybil of Conversano, daughter of Geoffrey, Count of Conversano, a wealthy Italo-Norman lord; and according to Orderic he fell in love with her.\nCrossing from Brindisi to the city of Dyrrachium in the Byzantine Empire on 5 April 1097, Robert and his army marched along the Via Egnatia and past Ohrid, Thessaloniki and the Aegean coast of Thrace on their way to Constantinople. Robert and Stephen were the last leading nobles to arrive at the gathering point in Constantinople in May of 1097 but were nonetheless welcomed with great respect by Emperor Alexios and memories of Robert's grandfather's visit to Constantinople during his own pilgrimage to Jerusalem were reignited. Both then swore, as had the other crusading leaders except for Raymond of Toulouse, an oath to restore all cities that had been in Byzantine possession to Alexios and honour his superior status.\nIn the first week of June 1097 Robert and Stephen joined the main forces of the crusading army who at this point were besieging Nicaea which was successfully conquered on the 19th of June. At the Battle of Dorylaeum on 1 July, the crusader vanguard led by Robert and Bohemond of Taranto were ambushed and surrounded by the Seljuk Turks. After a heavy cavalry charge failed to disperse them, the Normans formed a defensive circle and held the line for hours in the hot summer sun until the rest of the army arrived, surrounding the Turks and forcing them to flee after inflicting heavy casualties. Robert then participated in the brutal Siege of Antioch and commanded the Normans and English in the first line alongside Robert of Flanders at the subsequent Battle of Antioch in which a huge Muslim relief army was defeated. After months spent languishing at Antioch, Robert joined Raymond of Toulouse and Tancred in pressing on to Jerusalem on 13 January 1099 after the former paid Robert to join him. Together they advanced down the Mediterranean coast and laid siege to Arqa in February but were met with failure and left on 13 May 1099 and went to Jerusalem, finally arriving outside its walls on 7 June. Robert left Raymond's service during the siege on Jerusalem and instead joined Godfrey of Bouillon. As the crusaders lacked the necessary materials, Robert was sent out to gather wood to aid in the construction of siege towers. He was among the crusaders that captured Jerusalem on 15 July 1099. He also took on a prominent role in the final battle of the crusade at Ascalon on 12 August 1099 as one of the commanders of the crusader centre, personally killing the Egyptian standard-bearer and capturing the tent of the Egyptian commander, Al-Afdal. The fulfilment of his crusader vows was a personal triumph for Robert: he had shown military skills as well as the ability to mediate between different factions in the crusading forces.\nRobert left the Holy Land around September 1099 and sailed to Constantinople, where Emperor Alexios showered him with gifts, for he was one of the few crusade leaders to have kept the oath he had made back in 1096, and offered him to enter into the service of the Byzantine Empire, but Robert declined. Instead, he travelled again to Southern Italy where he wintered again and married Sybil which also brought him a big dowry which enabled him to raise the necessary funds to buy back his duchy. When William II died on 2 August 1100, Robert was still on the return journey and absent from Normandy and would not arrive until September, allowing his other brother Henry to seize the crown of England for himself.\nUpon his return, Robert\u2014urged by Flambard and several Anglo-Norman barons\u2014claimed the English crown, on the basis of the short-lived agreement of 1087, and in July 1101 led an invasion to oust his brother Henry. He landed near Portsmouth with his army, but the lack of popular support among the English (Anselm, the archbishop of Canterbury, was decidedly against him and the Charter of Liberties issued at Henry's coronation was well-liked) as well as Robert's own mishandling of the invasion tactics enabled Henry to resist the invasion. Robert was forced by diplomacy to renounce his claim to the English throne in the Treaty of Alton. Orderic claimed that Robert squandered his wealth and became so poor that he had nothing to wear, but this seems unlikely given that Robert would have been reduced to penury so short after his return and might rather refer to his pre-Crusade persona.\nImprisonment and death.\nIn 1105, Robert's continual stirring of discord with his brother in England, as well as civil disorder in Normandy, prompted Henry to invade Normandy. Orderic reports on an incident at Easter 1105 when Robert was supposed to hear a sermon by the venerable Serlo, Bishop of S\u00e9es. Robert spent the night before sporting with harlots and jesters, and while he lay in bed sleeping off his drunkenness his unworthy friends stole his clothes. He awoke to find himself naked and had to remain in bed and missed the sermon.\nIn 1106, Henry defeated Robert's army decisively at the Battle of Tinchebray and claimed Normandy as a possession of the English crown, a situation that endured for almost a century. Captured after the battle, Robert was imprisoned in Devizes Castle in Wiltshire for twenty years before being moved to Cardiff.\nRobert died in Cardiff Castle, probably on 3 February 1134. He was buried in Gloucester Abbey. The exact place of his burial is difficult to establish\u2014legend states that he requested to be buried before the High Altar. His effigy carved in bog oak adorns a mortuary chest decorated with the attributed arms of the Nine Worthies (missing one\u2014Joshua, and replaced with the arms of Edward the Confessor). The effigy dates from about 100 years after his death and the mortuary chest much later. The church subsequently became Gloucester Cathedral.\nDescendants.\nRobert married Sybilla of Conversano, daughter of Geoffrey of Brindisi, Count of Conversano (and a grandniece of Robert Guiscard, another Norman duke) on the way back from Crusade; they had one child:\nWilliam Clito was born 25 October 1102 and became heir to the Duchy of Normandy. William Clito was unlucky all his life; his attempts to invade Normandy failed twice (1119 and 1125), his first marriage to a daughter of the Count of Anjou was annulled by his uncle's machinations, and even his late inheritance of the county of Flanders was mishandled. William Clito died in 1128 leaving no issue, thus leaving the field clear in the Norman succession (at least until the death of Henry I).\nSybilla, who was admired and often praised by chroniclers of the time, died shortly after the birth of her son. William of Malmesbury says she died as a result of binding her breasts too tightly; both Robert of Torigny and Orderic Vitalis suggest she was murdered by a cabal of noblewomen led by her husband's mistress, Agnes Giffard.\nRobert also had at least three illegitimate children: Richard, who died hunting in the New Forest in May 1100; William, a full brother of Richard; and a daughter, who married Helias of Saint-Sa\u00ebns. William went to the Holy Land after 1106 and was named lord of Tortosa, but disappears from the historical record after 1110.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60215", "revid": "50524619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60215", "title": "The Forsyte Saga", "text": "Three novels by John Galsworthy\nThe Forsyte Saga, first published under that title in 1922, is a series of three novels and two interludes published between 1906 and 1921 by the English author John Galsworthy, who won the 1932 Nobel Prize in Literature. They chronicle the vicissitudes of the leading members of a large upper-middle-class English family that is similar to Galsworthy's. Only a few generations removed from their farmer ancestors, its members are keenly aware of their status as \"new money\". The main character, the solicitor and connoisseur Soames Forsyte, sees himself as a \"man of property\" by virtue of his ability to accumulate material possessions, but that does not succeed in bringing him pleasure.\nSeparate sections of the saga, as well as the lengthy story in its entirety, have been adapted for cinema and television. \"The Man of Property\", the first book, was adapted in 1949 by Hollywood as \"That Forsyte Woman\", starring Errol Flynn, Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, and Robert Young. In 1967, the BBC produced a popular 26-part serial that dramatised \"The Forsyte Saga\" and a subsequent trilogy concerning the Forsytes, \"A Modern Comedy\". In 2002 Granada Television produced two series for the ITV network: \"The Forsyte Saga\" and \"The Forsyte Saga: To Let\". Both made runs in the US as parts of \"Masterpiece Theatre\". In 2003, \"The Forsyte Saga\" was listed as #123 on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's \"best-loved novel\".\nFollowing \"The Forsyte Saga\", Galsworthy wrote two more trilogies and several more interludes based around the titular family. The resulting series is collectively titled The Forsyte Chronicles.\nBooks.\n\"The Man of Property\" (1906).\nIn this first novel of the \"Forsyte Saga\", after introducing us to the impressive array of Forsytes headed by the formidable Aunt Ann, Galsworthy moves into the main action of the saga by detailing Soames Forsyte's desire to own things, including his beautiful wife, Irene Forsyte (n\u00e9e Heron). The character of Irene is based upon Galsworthy's wife Ada Galsworthy. Soames is jealous of Irene's friendships and wants her to be his alone. He concocts a plan to move Irene to a house he is having built at Robin Hill, away from everyone she knows and cares for. Irene resists his grasping intentions, and falls in love with the architect Philip Bosinney, who has been engaged by Soames to build the house. Bosinney returns Irene's love, although he is the fianc\u00e9 of her young friend June Forsyte, the daughter of Soames's estranged cousin \"Young\" Jolyon. There is no happy ending: Irene leaves Soames after he asserts what he perceives to be his ultimate right on his property by raping her, and Bosinney dies under the wheels of a bus after being driven frantic by the news of the rape.\n\"Indian Summer of a Forsyte\" (1918).\nIn a short interlude after \"The Man of Property\", Galsworthy delves into the newfound friendship between Irene and Old Jolyon Forsyte (June's grandfather, now the owner of the house Soames had built). This attachment gives Old Jolyon pleasure, but exhausts his strength. He leaves Irene money in his will, with his son, Young Jolyon, as trustee. In the end, Old Jolyon dies under an ancient oak tree in the garden of the Robin Hill house.\n\"In Chancery\" (1920).\nThe marital discord of both Soames and his sister Winifred is the subject of the second novel (the title refers to the Court of Chancery, which dealt with domestic issues). They take steps to divorce their spouses, Irene and Montague Dartie respectively. While Soames tells his sister to brave the consequences of going to court, he is unwilling to go through a divorce. Instead he stalks and hounds Irene, follows her abroad, and asks her to have his child, which was his father's wish.\nIrene inherits \u00a315,000 after Old Jolyon's death. His son, Young Jolyon Forsyte, also Soames's cousin, manages Irene's finances. When she first leaves Soames, Young Jolyon offers his support. By the time his son Jolly dies in the South African War, Irene has developed a strong friendship with Jolyon. Then Soames confronts young Jolyon and Irene at Robin Hill, falsely accusing them of having an affair. Young Jolyon and Irene assert that they have had an affair because Soames has it in his mind already. This statement gives Soames the evidence he needs for divorce proceedings. That confrontation sparks an eventual consummation between young Jolyon and Irene, leading to their marriage once the divorce is final and the birth of a son Jolyon \"Jon\" Forsyte. Soames marries Annette, the young daughter of a French Soho restaurant owner. With his new wife, he has his only child, a daughter named Fleur.\n\"Awakening\" (1920).\nThe subject of the second interlude is the naive and exuberant lifestyle of eight-year-old Jon Forsyte. He loves and is loved by his parents. He has an idyllic youth, and his every desire indulged.\n\"To Let\" (1921).\nThis novel concludes the Forsyte Saga. Second cousins Fleur and Jon Forsyte meet and fall in love, ignorant of their parents' past troubles, indiscretions and misdeeds. Once Soames, Jolyon, and Irene discover their romance, they forbid their children to see each other again. Irene and Jolyon also fear that Fleur is too much like her father, and once she has Jon in her grasp, will want to possess him entirely. Despite her feelings for Jon, Fleur has a very suitable suitor, Michael Mont, heir to a baronetcy, who has fallen in love with her. If they marry, Fleur would elevate the status of her family from \"nouveau riche\" to the aristocratic upper class. The title derives from Soames' reflections as he breaks up the house in which his Uncle Timothy, recently deceased in 1920 at age 101 and the last of the older generation of Forsytes, had lived a recluse, hoarding his life like property.\nKnowing he is soon to die from a weak heart, Jolyon writes a letter to Jon, detailing the events of Irene's marriage to Soames, including her love affair with Philip Bosinney and Soames's rape of her and warns him that Irene would be alone if he were to marry Fleur. But while Jon reads the letter, Jolyon suddenly dies of a heart attack, and Jon is left torn between the past and his present love for Fleur. He ultimately rejects Fleur, breaking his own heart as well as hers, and leaves for Canada. Fleur marries Michael Mont, though she knows she doesn't love him. With her marriage, Soames is separated from the only person whom he has truly loved. Irene also leaves for Canada, selling the house at Robin Hill. Soames and Irene briefly exchange glances at a distance and a kind of peace is made between them, but Soames is left contemplating all that he never really had but tried to possess.\nAdaptations.\nTwentieth century.\nSilent films.\nThe book was filmed in 1920 and 1922. There was also a silent film adaptation of \"The White Monkey\" (1925).\n1949 movie.\nA 1949 adaptation, called \"That Forsyte Woman\" in its United States release, starred Errol Flynn as Soames, Greer Garson as Irene, Walter Pidgeon as Young Jolyon, and Robert Young as Philip Bosinney.\n1967 serial.\nA television adaptation by the BBC of \"The Forsyte Saga\", and its sequel trilogy \"A Modern Comedy\", starred Eric Porter as Soames, Joseph O'Conor as Old Jolyon, Susan Hampshire as Fleur, Kenneth More as Young Jolyon and Nyree Dawn Porter as Irene. It was produced by Donald Wilson and was shown in 26 episodes on Saturday evenings between 7 January and 1 July 1967 on BBC2. It was the repeat on Sunday evenings on BBC1 starting on 8 September 1968 that secured the programme's success, with 18 million tuning in for the final episode in 1969. It was shown in the United States on public television and broadcast all over the world, and became the first British television programme to be sold to the Soviet Union.\nRadio adaptations.\nThere have been various BBC radio dramatisations. The first was probably a radio production of \"The Man of Property\" in 11 weekly parts commencing 9 December 1945 on the BBC Home Service. The music used as the opening and closing theme came from Edward Elgar's \"Enigma Variations\", specifically the \"Nimrod\" variation. This adaptation starred Leo Genn as Jo, Grizelda Hervey as Irene and Ronald Simpson as Soames. It was adapted by Muriel Levy and produced by Val Gielgud and Felix Felton. Young Jolyons in later adaptations included Andrew Cruickshank, Leo Genn and Guy Rolfe. Another production of the dramatised cycle, which had Rachel Gurney as Irene, Noel Johnson as Young Jolyon and Alan Wheatley as Soames, came soon after the 1967 television series. The version broadcast in 1990 comprised a 75-minute opening episode followed by 22 hour-long episodes, entitled \"The Forsyte Chronicles\". It was the most expensive radio drama serial ever broadcast, due to its length and its big-name cast, which included Dirk Bogarde, Diana Quick, Michael Williams and Alan Howard. This radio series was rerun on BBC 7 radio in 2004, and has been released commercially.\nTwenty-first century.\n\"The Forsyte Saga\" (2002).\nIn 2002, the first two books and the first interlude were adapted by Granada Television for the ITV network, although, like the 1967 production, the miniseries took many liberties with Galsworthy's original work. Additional funding for this production was provided by American PBS station WGBH, the BBC version having been a success on PBS in the early 1970s.\n\"The Forsyte Saga: To Let\" (2003 serial).\nImmediately following the success of the 2002 adaptation, a second series was released in 2003. It portrays the saga's last book \"To Let\". Much of the cast resumed their roles, but most of the first generation of Forsytes had died in the previous series. The principal characters played by Damian Lewis, Gina McKee, Rupert Graves, and Amanda Root return. The series has also been released on DVD.\n\"The Forsytes\" (2016-17 radio series).\nIn January 2016, BBC Radio 4 began broadcasting a new radio adaptation by Shaun McKenna and Lin Coghlan under the title \"The Forsytes\", broken into four parts. The cast was led by Joseph Millson as Soames, Jessica Raine as Fleur, Juliet Aubrey as Irene, Harry Haddon Paton as Bosinney and Ewan Bailey as Young Jolyon. It was directed by Marion Nancarrow and Gemma Jenkins.\n\"The Forsytes\" (7 episodes), first broadcast in February 2016, adapted \"The Man of Property\" through \"In Chancery\". In April, \"The Forsytes Continues\" (7 episodes) adapted \"Awakening\", \"To Let\" and \"The White Monkey\". \"The Forsytes Returns\" (7 episodes), broadcast in September 2016, covered \"A Silent Wooing\", \"The Silver Spoon\", \"Passers-By\" and \"Swan Song\". \"The Forsytes Concludes\" (8 episodes), broadcast in May 2017, adapted the final three novels in the series, \"Maid in Waiting\", \"Flowering Wilderness\", and \"Over the River\", with Nina Sosanya playing Dinny.\n\"The Forsyte Saga: Parts 1 &amp; 2\" (2024 stage play).\nA two-part stage adaptation \"(Part 1: Irene\" and \"Part 2: Fluer)\" premiered at the Park Theatre, London in October 2024, bringing unheard female voices to the fore. The two parts were adapted for stage by Shaun Mckenna and Lin Coghlan, starring Fiona Hampton, Joseph Millson, and Flora Spencer-Longhurst. The production will be revived in November 2025 by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.\n\"The Forsytes\" (2025 TV Series).\nA six-part television series adaptation. The series is led by an ensemble cast which includes Francesca Annis, Jack Davenport, Millie Gibson, Danny Griffin, Tuppence Middleton, Stephen Moyer, Joshua Orpin and Eleanor Tomlinson. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 5 in October 2025\nThemes.\nDuty versus Desire.\nYoung Jolyon was the favourite of the family until he left his wife for his daughter's governess. He eschews his status in society and in the Forsyte clan to follow his heart. Soames, though it seems he is the polar opposite of Jolyon, has those same inclinations toward doing what he desires. For example, instead of finding a wife who is rich, he marries Irene and then Annette, who have neither money nor status. When he takes Irene to a play about a married woman and her lover, he ironically sympathizes with the lover and not the husband. However, most of his decisions are on the side of duty.\nGenerations and Change.\nThe many generations of the Forsyte clan remind everyone of what has come to pass over the years. However, as the old ranks begin to die, people are able to change. For example, after a few generations, the fact that they are nouveau riche does not matter as much. This is also the case with Soames and Irene's marital problems. Once they grow old and their children can overcome their parents' past, Soames can finally let go of the past. Another change with generations is the diminished number of Forsyte offspring. Many of the second generation have fewer children.\nSequels.\nGalsworthy's sequel to \"The Forsyte Saga\" was \"A Modern Comedy\", a further trilogy written in the years 1924 to 1928. This comprises the novel \"The White Monkey\"; an interlude, \"A Silent Wooing\"; a second novel, \"The Silver Spoon\"; a second interlude, \"Passers By\"; and a third novel, \"Swan Song\". The principal characters are Soames and Fleur, and the second saga ends with the death of Soames in 1926. This is also the point reached at the end of the 1967 television series.\n\"The White Monkey\" (1924).\nFleur Forsyte has settled into married life with Michael Mont, following her aborted romance with Jon Forsyte. Unbeknownst to Michael, his best friend Wilfred Desert has also fallen in love with Fleur. Fleur seems to treat Wilfred\u2019s affection as an amusement in her otherwise dull life.\nMichael works for a publishing firm and catches one of his employees, Bickett, stealing books and is forced to fire him. Feeling bad for a man who was trying to help his sick wife, Michael helps Bickett\u2019s wife Victorine gain a job posing as a nude model for various artists. Victorine eventually gains enough money for the two of them to move to Australia.\nSoames Forsyte, Fleur\u2019s father, is on the board for a company with extensive capital invested overseas. A young man comes to him and advises that he has overheard that the Chairman of the Board, Mr Emerson, has been taking commissions to invest in failing stock, losing a considerable amount of the shareholders\u2019 money in the process. Soames and Lawrence Mont, Michael\u2019s father, attempt to bring this to the attention of the Board but are too late to stop Mr Emerson escaping prosecution. They both resign in protest.\nSoames also visits his cousin George shortly before his death and secures a Chinese painting, the titular \u2018White Monkey\u2019. He gives the painting to Fleur and Michael.\nEventually, Wilfred tires of Fleur tormenting him and leaves to go to the East. A depressed Fleur turns to Michael and falls pregnant and eventually gives birth to a son, Christopher (or Kit).\nA Silent Wooing (Interlude 1927).\nIn America, Jon goes on a picnic with his friend Francis Wilmot and meets his sister Anne. Anne and Jon go to explore an Indian mound and become lost, returning hours later. Jon then visits Francis and Anne at home and falls in love with her. They eventually marry.\n\"The Silver Spoon\" (1926).\nThe book focuses mainly on Michael Mont\u2019s political career, and Fleur\u2019s social activities. Jon Forsyte\u2019s brother-in-law, Francis Wilmot, arrives in London, staying with Fleur and Michael. He attends one of Fleur\u2019s evening parties, and is smitten with Marjorie Ferrar, grand-daughter of the Marquess of Shropshire, and a lively member of a \u2018fast set\u2019.\nSoames overhears her talking disparagingly about Fleur, and strong words are exchanged. Fleur writes some injudicious letters about the incident, and Marjorie is persuaded to launch a libel action. Soames, Sir Lawrence Mont and Lord Shropshire attempt to mediate, but in vain, and neither party will back down.\nMichael chucks publishing, and launches his political career. His maiden speech promotes a scheme known as \u2018Foggartism\u2019, which advocates a policy of child migration to the Dominions. He also attempts to assist a group of \u2018down-and-outs\u2019, but the project only partly succeeds. He has a run-in with Marjorie\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Sir Alexander McGown, a fiery Scottish MP.\nThe libel case comes to court. As a result of legal manoeuvering by Soames, Marjorie\u2019s views on modern morality, including the reading of \u2018advanced literature\u2019, are aired in public. She defends her opinions bravely, but is persuaded to quietly settle out of court, without an apology from Fleur.\nNow deeply in debt, and refusing to disclose her various love affairs to McGown, he breaks their engagement. Lord Shropshire offers to pay her debts, on her word as a lady to pay cash for her needs in future.\nMarjorie is now the toast of her set, and Fleur is humiliated. She asks Michael to take her \u2018around the world\u2019. She and Soames decide to go together, with Michael joining them later, when Parliament rises.\nPassers-By (Interlude 1927).\nSoames is in the final days of his holiday with Fleur and Michael in Washington when he becomes aware that Jon, Anne and Irene Forsyte are in town and staying at the same hotel. He works to ensure Fleur remains unaware of their existence, though he cannot stop himself from spying on Irene playing the piano. They return to England with only Soames aware of the near encounter.\n\"Swan Song\" (1928).\nThe General Strike is called. Many Forsytes enrol as special constables. Michael Mont\u2019s sympathies are with the strikers, but he can do nothing to help. Fleur takes over the running of a canteen for the volunteers who will keep the trains running. Holly joins her, as well as Anne, Jon\u2019s wife. Jon volunteers to stoke an engine; he eats at the canteen, but he and Fleur do not meet.\nAnne and Jon decide to stay in England, and buy a farm in Sussex..\nDisillusioned with Foggartism, Michael is drawn into a scheme promoted by his uncle, Rev. Hilary Charwell, to buy and convert the worst of the London slums. He and his father help to set up the Fund, and recruit rich and influential men to invest in the scheme. Soames is co-opted as legal advisor.\nMichael visits June Forsyte, who tells him the story of Fleur and Jon\u2019s affair, and something of the tangled family history, which he hadn\u2019t previously known. \nVal Dartie is visited by an old college pal, Stainforth, now fallen on hard times, who claims to know something about an employee at Val\u2019s racehorse stables, and offers to sell him the information. He later forges Val\u2019s name on a cheque.\nFleur sets up a rest home in the country for working girls, but it\u2019s really an excuse to be close to Jon. She schemes to arrange \u2018accidental\u2019 meetings. Jon and Fleur have one last fling, but when Anne becomes pregnant, he breaks it off. Fleur is devastated.\nA fire breaks out in Soames\u2019 house, almost certainly started accidentally by Fleur. Most of the pictures are saved, but a heavy painting falls and hits Soames as he tries to rescue Fleur. He is badly injured, and dies a few days later.\nLater works.\nGalsworthy wrote one further trilogy, \"End of the Chapter\", comprising \"Maid in Waiting\", \"Flowering Wilderness\", and \"Over the River\" (also known as \"One More River\"), chiefly dealing with Michael Mont's young cousin, Dinny Cherrell.\nThe three trilogies have been republished under the collective title of \"The Forsyte Chronicles\".\nIn 1930 Galsworthy published \"On Forsyte 'Change\", which deals in the main with the older Forsytes before the events chronicled in \"The Man of Property\". Galsworthy states in a foreword that \"They have all been written since \"Swan Song\" was finished but in place they come between the Saga and the Comedy ...\" By way of explanation he writes that \"It is hard to part suddenly and finally from those with whom one has lived so long; and these footnotes do really, I think, help to fill in and round out the chronicles of the Forsyte family.\"\nIn 1994 Suleika Dawson published a sequel to \"The Forsytes\" titled \"\" in which Soames's daughter, Fleur, Lady Mont, is the main character. She has been a dutiful wife and mother, and has long forgotten her love for Jon Forsyte, but when tragedy brings Jon back to England Fleur is determined to recapture the past and the love of her life.\nAwards.\n\"The Forsyte Saga\" earned John Galsworthy the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932.\nDedication.\nA framed letter from Galsworthy stood next to his wife's bed until her death. It read, \"I super-dedicate in its entirety \"The Forsyte Saga\" whose first word was written on Campden Hill, London of a May morning in 1903 and whose last word was written at Hampstead on 15 August 1920. Of all my work I have most enjoyed the making of this chronicle, and on the whole set more store by it than anything else I have written up to now. This is why I super-dedicate the whole of it to one without whose instigation, sympathy, interest and criticism, my obscure inner necessity might never have pushed through the mufflement of circumstance and made me a writer \u2013 such as I am.\" (1921)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60225", "revid": "1782949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60225", "title": "Intel MCS-51", "text": "Single chip microcontroller series by Intel\nThe Intel MCS-51 (commonly termed 8051) is a single-chip microcontroller (MCU) series developed by Intel in 1980 for use in embedded systems. The architect of the Intel MCS-51 instruction set was John H.\u00a0Wharton. Intel's original versions were popular in the 1980s and early 1990s, and enhanced binary compatible derivatives remain popular today. It is a complex instruction set computer with separate memory spaces for program instructions and data.\nIntel's original MCS-51 family was developed using N-type metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (NMOS) technology, like its predecessor Intel MCS-48, but later versions, identified by a letter C in their name (e.g., 80C51) use complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) technology and consume less power than their NMOS predecessors. This made them more suitable for battery-powered devices.\nThe family was continued in 1996 with the enhanced 8-bit MCS-151 and the 8/16/32-bit MCS-251 family of binary compatible microcontrollers. While Intel no longer manufactures the MCS-51, MCS-151 and MCS-251 family, enhanced binary compatible derivatives made by numerous vendors remain popular today. Some derivatives integrate a digital signal processor (DSP) or a floating-point unit (coprocessor, FPU). Beyond these physical devices, several companies also offer MCS-51 derivatives as IP cores for use in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs.\nImportant features and applications.\nThe 8051 architecture provides many functions (central processing unit (CPU), random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), input/output (I/O) ports, serial port, interrupt control, timers) in one package:\nOne feature of the 8051 core is the inclusion of a Boolean processing engine, which allows bit-level Boolean logic operations to be carried out directly and efficiently on select internal registers, ports and select RAM locations. Another feature is the inclusion of four bank-selectable working register sets, which greatly reduce the time required to perform the context switches to enter and leave interrupt service routines. With one instruction, the 8051 can switch register banks, avoiding the time-consuming task of transferring the critical registers to RAM.\nDerivative features.\nAs of 2013[ [update]], new derivatives are still being developed by many major chipmakers, and major compiler suppliers such as IAR Systems, Keil and TASKING continuously release updates.\nMCS-51-based microcontrollers typically include one or two UARTs, two or three timers, 128 or 256\u00a0bytes of internal data RAM (16\u00a0bytes of which are bit-addressable), up to 128\u00a0bytes of I/O, 512\u00a0bytes to 64\u00a0KB of internal program memory, and sometimes a quantity of extended data RAM (ERAM) located in the external data space. External RAM and ROM share the data and address buses. The original 8051 core ran at 12 clock cycles per machine cycle, with most instructions executing in one or two machine cycles. With a 12\u00a0MHz clock frequency, the 8051 could thus execute 1\u00a0million one-cycle instructions per second or 500,000 two-cycle instructions per second. Enhanced 8051 cores are now commonly used which run at six, four, two, or even one clock per machine cycle (denoted \"1T\") and have clock frequencies of up to 100\u00a0MHz, thus being capable of an even greater number of instructions per second. All Silicon Labs, some Dallas (now part of Maxim Integrated) and a few Atmel (now part of Microchip) devices have single-cycle cores.\n8051 variants may include built-in reset timers with brown-out detection, on-chip oscillators, self-programmable flash ROM program memory, built-in external RAM, extra internal program storage, bootloader code in ROM, EEPROM non-volatile data storage, I2C, SPI, and USB host interfaces, CAN or LIN bus, Zigbee or Bluetooth radio modules, PWM generators, analog comparators, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, RTCs, extra counters and timers, in-circuit debugging facilities, more interrupt sources, extra power-saving modes, more or fewer parallel ports etc. Intel manufactured a mask-programmed version, 8052AH-BASIC, with a BASIC interpreter in ROM, capable of running user programs loaded into RAM.\nMCS-51-based microcontrollers have been adapted to extreme environments. Examples for high-temperature variants are the Tekmos TK8H51 family for \u221240\u00b0C to +250\u00b0C or the Honeywell HT83C51 for \u221255\u00b0C to +225\u00b0C (with operation for up to 1 year at +300\u00b0C). Radiation-hardenend MCS-51 microcontrollers for use in spacecraft are available; e.g., from Cobham (formerly Aeroflex) as the UT69RH051 or from NIIET as the 1830VE32 ().\nIn some engineering schools, the 8051 microcontroller is used in introductory microcontroller courses.\nFamily naming conventions.\nIntel's first MCS-51 microcontroller was the 8051, with 4\u00a0KB ROM and 128\u00a0byte RAM. Variants starting with 87 have a user-programmable EPROM, sometimes UV-erasable. Variants with a C as the third character are some kind of CMOS. 8031 and 8032 are ROM-less versions, with 128 and 256 bytes of RAM. The last digit can indicate memory size, e.g. 8052 with 8\u00a0KB ROM, 87C54 16\u00a0KB EPROM, and 87C58 with 32\u00a0KB EPROM, all with 256-byte RAM.\nMemory architecture.\nThe MCS-51 has four distinct types of memory: internal RAM, special function registers, program memory, and external data memory. To access these efficiently, some compilers utilize as many as 7 types of memory definitions: internal RAM, single-bit access to internal RAM, special function registers, single-bit access to selected (divisible by 8) special function registers, program RAM, external RAM accessed using a register indirect access, using one of the standard 8-bit registers, and register indirect external RAM access utilizing the 16-bit indirect access register.\nThe 8051's instruction set is designed as a Harvard architecture with segregated memory (data and instructions); it can only execute code fetched from program memory and has no instructions to write to program memory. However, the bus leaving the IC has a single address and data path, and strongly resembles a von\u00a0Neumann architecture bus.\nMost 8051 systems respect the instruction set and require customized features to download new executable programs, e.g. in flash memory.\nInternal RAM.\nInternal RAM (IRAM) has an 8-bit address space, using addresses 0 through 0xFF. IRAM from 0x00 to 0x7F contains 128 directly addressable 1-byte registers, which can be accessed using an 8-bit absolute address that is part of the instruction. Alternatively, IRAM can be accessed indirectly: the address is loaded into R0 or R1, and the memory is accessed using the codice_1 or codice_2 syntax, or as stack memory through the stack pointer SP, with the codice_3/codice_4 and codice_5/codice_6 operations.\nThe original 8051 has only 128 bytes of IRAM. The 8052 added IRAM from 0x80 to 0xFF, which can \"only\" be accessed indirectly (e.g. for use as stack space). Most 8051 clones also have a full 256 bytes of IRAM.\nDirect accesses to the IRAM addresses 0x80\u20130xFF are, instead, mapped onto the special function registers (SFR), where the accumulators A, B, carry bit C, and other special registers for control, status, etc., are located.\nSpecial function registers.\nSpecial function registers (SFR) are located in the same address space as IRAM, at addresses 0x80 to 0xFF, and are accessed directly using the same instructions as for the lower half of IRAM. They cannot be accessed indirectly via codice_1 or codice_2 or by the stack pointer SP; indirect access to those addresses will access the second half of IRAM instead.\nThe special function registers (SFR) include the accumulators A (or ACC, at E0) and B (at F0) and program status word (or PSW, at D0), themselves, as well as the 16-bit data pointer DPTR (at 82, as DPL and 83 as DPH). In addition to these, a small core of other special function registers\u00a0\u2013 including the interrupt enable IE at A8 and interrupt priority IP at B8; the I/O ports P0 (80), P1 (90), P2 (A0), P3 (B0); the serial I/O control SCON (98) and buffer SBUF (99); the CPU/power control register PCON (87); and the registers for timers 0 and 1 control (TCON at 88) and operation mode (TMOD at 89), the 16-bit timer 0 (TL0 at 8A, TH0 at 8C) and timer 1 (TL1 at 8B, TH1 at 8D)\u00a0\u2013 are present on all versions of the 8051. Other addresses are version-dependent; in particular, the registers of timer\u00a02 for the 8052, the control register T2CON (at C8), the 16-bit capture/latch (RCAP2L at CA, RCAP2H at CB) and timer\u00a02 (TL2 at CC and TH2 at CD) are not included with the 8051.\nRegister windows.\nThe 32 bytes in IRAM from 0x00 to 0x1F contain space for four 8-byte register windows, which the eight registers R0\u2013R7 map to. The currently active window is determined by a two-bit address contained in the program status word.\nBit registers.\nThe 16 bytes (128 bits) at IRAM locations 0x20\u20130x2F contain space for 128 1-bit registers, which are separately addressable as bit registers 00\u20137F.\nThe remaining bit registers, addressed as 80\u2013FF, are mapped onto the 16 special function registers 80, 88, 90, 98,\u00a0..., F0 and F8 (those whose addresses are multiples of 8), and therefore include the bits comprising the accumulators A, B and program status word PSW. The register window address, being bits 3 and 4 of the PSW, is itself addressable as bit registers D3 and D4 respectively; while the carry bit C (or CY), at bit 7 of the PSW, is addressable as bit register D7.\nProgram memory.\nProgram memory (PMEM, though less common in usage than IRAM and XRAM) is up to 64\u00a0KB of read-only memory, starting at address 0 in a separate address space. It may be on- or off-chip, depending on the particular model of chip being used. Program memory is read-only, though some variants of the 8051 use on-chip flash memory and provide a method of re-programming the memory in-system or in-application.\nIn addition to code, it is possible to store read-only data such as lookup tables in program memory, retrieved by the or instructions. The address is computed as the sum of the 8-bit accumulator and a 16-bit register (PC or DPTR).\nSpecial jump and call instructions ( and ) slightly reduce the size of code that accesses local (within the same 2\u00a0KB) program memory.\nWhen code larger than 64\u00a0KB is required, a common system makes the code bank-switched, with general-purpose I/O selecting the upper address bits. Some 8051 compilers make provisions to automatically access paged code. In these systems, the interrupt vectors and paging table are placed in the first 32\u00a0KB of code and are always resident.\nExternal data memory.\nExternal data memory (XRAM) is a third address space, also starting at address 0, and allowing 16 bits of address space. It can also be on- or off-chip; what makes it \"external\" is that it must be accessed using the (move external) instruction. Many variants of the 8051 include the standard 256\u00a0bytes of IRAM plus a few kilobytes of XRAM on the chip.\nThe first 256 bytes of XRAM may be accessed using the , , , and instructions. The full 64\u00a0KB may be accessed using and . The 16-bit address requires the programmer to load the 16-bit index register. For this reason, RAM accesses with 16-bit addresses are substantially slower.\nSome CPUs permit the 8-bit indirect address to use any 8-bit general-purpose register.\nTo permit the use of this feature, some 8051-compatible microcontrollers with internal RAM larger than 256 bytes, or an inability to access external RAM, access internal RAM as if it were external and have a special function register (e.g. PDATA) that permits them to set the upper address of the 256-byte page. This emulates the MCS8051 mode that can page the upper byte of a RAM address by setting the general-purpose I/O pins.\nWhen RAM larger than 64\u00a0KB is required, a common system makes the RAM bank-switched, with general-purpose I/O selecting the upper address bits. Some 8051 compilers make provisions to automatically access paged data.\nRegisters.\nThe only register on an 8051 that is not memory-mapped is the 16-bit program counter (PC). This specifies the address of the next instruction to execute. Relative branch instructions supply an 8-bit signed offset which is added to the PC.\nEight general-purpose registers R0\u2013R7 may be accessed with instructions one byte shorter than others. They are mapped to IRAM between 0x00 and 0x1F. Only eight bytes of that range are used at any given time, determined by the two bank-select bits in the PSW.\nThe following is a partial list of the 8051's registers, which are memory-mapped into the special function register space:\n256 single bits are directly addressable. These are the 16 IRAM locations from 0x20\u20130x2F, and the 16 special function registers 0x80, 0x88, 0x90, ..., 0xF8. Any bit of these bytes may be directly accessed by a variety of logical operations and conditional branches.\nNote that the PSW does not contain the common negative (N), or zero (Z) flags. For the former, the most significant bit of the accumulator can be addressed directly, as it is a bit-addressable SFR. For the latter, there are explicit instructions to jump on whether or not the accumulator is zero. There is also a two-operand compare and jump operation.\nThe parity (P) bit is often used to implement serial modes that include parity. To support this, the standard MCS51 UARTs could send 9 bits.\nMicroarchitecture.\nThe microarchitecture of the Intel MCS8051 is proprietary, but published features suggest how it works. It is a multi-cycle processor. The MCS8051 used 12 clock cycles for most instructions. Many instructions utilize an accumulator. In contrast, most compatible computers execute instructions in one to three cycles, except for the multiply and divide instructions. The much higher speed is a major reason why these have replaced the MCS8051 in most applications.\nEach interrupt has four priorities. Within each priority, the interrupts of devices are in a fixed priority.\nInstruction set.\nInstructions are all 1 to 3 bytes long, consisting of an initial opcode byte, followed by up to 2 bytes of operands.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 of the opcode bytes, \"x\"0\u2013\"x\"3, are used for irregular opcodes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 of the opcode bytes, \"x\"4\u2013\"x\"F, are assigned to 16 basic ALU instructions with 12 possible operands. The least significant nibble of the opcode selects the primary operand as follows:\nThe most significant nibble specifies the operation as follows. Not all support all addressing modes; the immediate mode in particular is unavailable when the primary operand is written to. Instruction mnemonics use \"destination\", \"source\" operand order.\nOnly the , , and instructions set PSW flags. The , , and logical instructions do not. The instruction modifies the C bit only, to the borrow that results from \"operand1\" \u2212 \"operand2\".\nThe irregular instructions comprise 64 opcodes, having more limited addressing modes, plus several opcodes scavenged from inapplicable modes in the regular instructions.\nThe (short jump) opcode takes a signed relative offset byte operand and transfers control there relative to the address of the following instruction. The / opcodes combine the three most significant bits of the opcode byte with the following byte to specify an 11-bit destination that is used to replace 11 bottom bits of the PC register (top 5 bits of PC register remain intact). For larger addresses, the and instructions allow a 16-bit destination.\nOne of the reasons for the 8051's popularity is its range of operations on single bits. Bits are always specified by absolute addresses; there is no register-indirect or indexed addressing. Instructions that operate on single bits are:\nA bit operand is written in the form . Because the carry flag is bit 7 of the bit-addressable program status word, the , and instructions are shorter equivalents to , and .\nProgramming.\nThere are various high-level programming language compilers for the 8051. Several C compilers are available for the 8051, most of which allow the programmer to specify where each variable should be stored in its six types of memory, and provide access to 8051-specific hardware features such as the multiple register banks and bit manipulation instructions. There are many commercial C compilers. Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) is a popular open-source C compiler.\nOther high level languages such as C++, Forth,\nBASIC, Object Pascal, Pascal, PL/M and Modula-2 are available for the 8051, but they are less widely used than C and assembly.\nBecause IRAM, XRAM, and PMEM (read only) all have an address 0, C compilers for the 8051 architecture provide compiler-specific pragmas or other extensions to indicate where a particular piece of data should be stored (i.e. constants in PMEM or variables needing fast access in IRAM). Since data could be in one of three memory spaces, a mechanism is usually provided to allow determining to which memory a pointer refers, either by constraining the pointer type to include the memory space or by storing metadata with the pointer.\nRelated processors.\nIntel discontinued its MCS-51 product line in March 2007; however, there are plenty of enhanced 8051 products or silicon intellectual property added regularly from other vendors.\nThe 8051's predecessor, the 8048, was used in the keyboard of the first IBM PC, where it converted keypresses into the serial data stream which is sent to the main unit of the computer. An Intel 8049 served a similar role in the Sinclair QL. The 8048 and derivatives are still used today[ [update]] for basic model keyboards.\nThe 8031 was a reduced version of the original 8051 that had no internal program ROM. To use this chip, external ROM had to be added containing the program that the 8031 would fetch and execute. An 8051 chip could be sold as a ROM-less 8031, as the 8051's internal ROM is disabled by the normal state of the EA pin in an 8031-based design. A vendor might sell an 8051 as an 8031 for any number of reasons, such as faulty code in the 8051's ROM, or simply an oversupply of 8051s and undersupply of 8031s.\nThe 8044 (as well as the ROM-less 8344 and the 8744 with EPROM) added an SDLC controller to the 8051 core (especially for Bitbus applications).\nThe 8052 was an enhanced version of the original 8051 that featured 256\u00a0bytes of internal RAM instead of 128\u00a0bytes, 8\u00a0KB of ROM instead of 4\u00a0KB, and a third 16-bit timer. Most modern 8051-compatible microcontrollers include these features.\nThe 8032 had these same features as the 8052 except it lacked internal ROM program memory.\nThe 8751 was an 8051 with 4\u00a0KB EPROM instead of 4\u00a0KB ROM. They were identical except for the non-volatile memory type. This part was available in a ceramic package with a clear quartz window over the top of the die so UV light could be used to erase the EPROM. Related parts are: 8752 had 8\u00a0KB EPROM, 8754 had 16\u00a0KB EPROM, 8758 had 32\u00a0KB EPROM.\nThe 80C537 (ROM-less) and 80C517 (8 KB ROM) are CMOS versions, designed for the automotive industry. Enhancements mostly include new and enhanced peripherals. The 80C5x7 has fail-safe mechanisms, analog signal processing facilities, enhanced timer capabilities, and a 32-bit arithmetic peripheral. Other features include:\nDerivative vendors.\nMore than 20 independent manufacturers produce MCS-51 compatible processors. \nOther ICs or IPs compatible with the MCS-51 have been developed by Analog Devices, Integral Minsk,\nKristall Kyiv, and\nNIIET Voronezh.\nUse as intellectual property.\nToday, 8051s are still available as discrete parts, but they are mostly used as silicon intellectual property cores. Available in hardware description language source code (such as VHDL or Verilog) or FPGA netlist forms, these cores are typically integrated within embedded systems, in products ranging from USB flash drives to washing machines to complex wireless communication systems on a chip. Designers use 8051 silicon IP cores, because of the smaller size, and lower power, compared to 32-bit processors like ARM Cortex-M series, MIPS and BA22.\nSubsequent 8051 core designs have increased performance while retaining compatibility with the original MCS 51 instruction set. The original Intel 8051 was a microcode engine using 12 clocked microcode cycles per machine cycle to minimize the number of NMOS logic gates consuming power in passive resistive pull-ups. Most instructions executed in one or two machine cycles. At the typical maximum clock frequency of 12\u00a0MHz the original 8051 types execute one million single-cycle instructions, or 500,000 two-cycle instructions, per second. The change to CMOS using active P-channel FET pull-ups makes it possible to realize the core without microcode. Enhanced 8051 IP cores run at one clock cycle per machine cycle. With clock frequencies of up to 450\u00a0MHz an 8051-compatible processor can execute up to 450 million instructions per second.\nDigital signal processor (DSP) variants.\nSeveral variants with an additional 16-bit digital signal processor (DSP) (for example for MP3 or Vorbis coding/decoding) with up to 675 million instructions per second (MIPS) and integrated USB 2.0 interface or as intellectual property exist.\nEnhanced 8-bit binary compatible microcontroller: MCS-151 family.\nIn 1996 Intel announced the MCS-151 family, an up to 6 times faster variant, that's fully binary and instruction set compatible with 8051. Unlike their 8051 MCS-151 is a pipelined CPU, with 16-bit internal code bus and is 6x the speed. The MCS-151 family was also discontinued by Intel, but is widely available in binary compatible and partly enhanced variants.\n8/16/32-bit binary compatible microcontroller: MCS-251 family.\nThe 80251 8/16/32-bit microcontroller with 16\u00a0MB (24-bit) address-space and 6 times faster instruction cycle was introduced by Intel in 1996. It can perform as an 8-bit 8051, has 24-bit linear addressing, an 8-bit ALU, 8-bit instructions, 16-bit instructions, a limited set of 32-bit instructions, 16 8-bit registers, 16 16-bit registers (8 16-bit registers which do not share space with any 8-bit registers, and 8 16-bit registers which contain 2 8-bit registers per 16-bit register), and 10 32-bit registers (2 dedicated 32-bit registers, and 8 32-bit registers which contain 2 16-bit registers per 32-bit register).\nIt features extended instructions \u2013 see also the programmer's guide \u2013 and later variants with higher performance, also available as intellectual property (IP). It is 3-stage pipelined. The MCS-251 family was also discontinued by Intel, but is widely available in binary compatible and partly enhanced variants from many manufacturers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

It views religious pluralism as a construct of the liberal movements, and does not see their ideology as rooted in historic Jewish norms. While not recognizing Reform and Conservative as valid expressions of Judaism, it recognizes most who are affiliated with these movements as full-fledged Jews, aside from those whose Judaism is of patrilineal descent or who were converted under Conservative or Reform auspices. When dealing with the individual, Moshe Feinstein is famously quoted as characterizing all current-day non-Orthodox Jews as \"tinok shenishba\"\u2014literally, \"captured children\"\u2014in a category analogous to Jewish children captured by non-Jews who were never taught Judaism, meaning that they do not act out of wrong intent or motives, but out of ignorance and poor upbringing (\"Iggeroth Moshe\").\nHowever, when dealing with the movement/philosophy, they perceive the generation of other denominations to have historically been engendered by heretical intent and the 1800s widespread denigration of religion. They view Reform Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, and Conservative Judaism as heretical, less observant Jewish movements. As such, Orthodox authorities have strongly fought attempts by the Reform and Conservative movements to gain official recognition and denominational legitimacy in Israel. Haredi groups and authorities will not work with non-Orthodox religious movements in any way, as they view this as lending legitimacy to those movements. The members of those movements who have been born of a Jewish mother are, however, still regarded as Jews.\nModern Orthodox views.\nIn his 1964 responsum on relations with non-Orthodox Judaism, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik developed the intellectual foundations for the way Modern Orthodox Judaism was to approach the issue in subsequent decades. Soloveitchik developed the idea that Jews have historically been linked together by two distinct covenants. One is the \"brit yi'ud\" (covenant of destiny), the covenant by which Jews are bound together through their adherence to \"Halakha\". The second is the \"brit goral\" (covenant of fate), which is the desire and willingness to be part of a people chosen by God to live a sacred mission in the world, and the fact that all those who live in this covenant share the same fate of persecution and oppression, even if they do not live by \"Halakha\". Soloveitchik held that non-Orthodox Jews were in violation of the covenant of destiny; yet, they are still bound together with Orthodox Jews in the covenant of fate. This approach permitted cooperation in matters involving the covenant of fate, while recognizing differences and limits based on the covenant of destiny.\nFollowing this lead, until the 1970s, the Modern Orthodox and the non-Orthodox movements worked together in the now-defunct Synagogue Council of America. However, the relationship between Modern Orthodoxy and the non-Orthodox movements has worsened over the last few decades. The movements have seen a polarization of views. Haredi Judaism has seen a great resurgence in its popularity, and many formerly Modern Orthodox rabbis have been swayed to some degree by their views. Non-Orthodox movements have progressively moved to the left theologically and halakhically. Reform Judaism rejected the traditional definition of a Jew via matrilineal descent, effectively severing the conventional view of Jewish peoplehood that had linked Reform and non-Reform movements. For practically all Orthodox Jews (and many Conservative Jews), this was seen as splitting the Jewish people into two mutually incompatible groups. The confluence of these two phenomena helped drive most of Modern Orthodoxy further to the right, and effectively ended all official cooperation between Modern Orthodoxy and all of the non-Orthodox denominations.\nSome within the Orthodox world advocate that while non-Orthodox forms of Judaism are incorrect, they nonetheless have functional validity and spiritual dignity. Rabbi Norman Lamm writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist communities are not only more numerous in their official memberships than the Orthodox community, but they are also vital, powerful, and dynamic; they are committed to Jewish survival, each according to its own lights; they are a part of \"Klal Yisrael\"; and they consider their rabbis their leaders. From a \"functional\" point of view, therefore, non-Orthodox rabbis are \"valid\" leaders of Jewish religious communities, and it is both fatuous and self-defeating not to acknowledge this openly and draw the necessary consequences - for example, establishing friendly and harmonious and respectful relationships and working together, all of us, towards those Jewish communal and global goals that we share and that unite us inextricably and indissolubly...\n...non-Orthodox rabbis and laypeople may possess \"spiritual dignity\". If they are sincere, if they believe in God, if they are motivated by principle, and not by convenience or trendiness, if they endeavor to carry out the consequences of their faith in a consistent manner\u2014then they are \"religious people\"... But neither functional \"validity\" nor spiritual \"dignity\" are identical with Jewish \"legitimacy\". \"Validity\" derives from the Latin \"validus\", strong. It is a factual, descriptive term. \"Legitimacy\" derives from the Latin \"lex\", law. It is a normative and evaluative term.\nA number of Modern Orthodox rabbis advocate good relations with their non-Orthodox peers. In 1982, \"\" published a symposium on the state of Orthodox Judaism that included contributions by many leading Orthodox rabbis. The first question the editor asked the rabbis was: \"Do you believe that recent developments warrant the triumphalism exhibited by segments of Orthodoxy which predict the total disappearance of non-Orthodox movements?\" Rabbi Marc D. Angel replied, \"We should be frightened by the possibility. With all our theological differences, yet we are part of one Jewish people and work together in so many ways for the benefit of the Jewish community... It is not a happy prospect that the overwhelming majority of American Jews will lose their Jewishness. It is also unlikely that the vast numbers of the non-Orthodox community will move into Orthodoxy in the relatively near future.\" Rabbi David Berger replied, \"I confess that I would not look forward to such a disappearance... The Jewish loyalties and observances of non-Orthodox Jews are decidedly better than nothing... The only weakening of Conservatism and Reform for which Orthodoxy can legitimately hope would come through conversion to Orthodoxy. No such development appears imminent in statistically significant numbers.\" The message of other rabbis rings a similar note; no rabbis profiled in the symposium believed that most non-Orthodox Jews would ever convert to Orthodoxy. Thus, Orthodoxy should work together on some issues with non-Orthodox Judaism, and it is far better for Jews to be members of non-Orthodox Judaism than to assimilate and not be religious Jews at all.\nA small number of modern Orthodox rabbis regularly cooperate with non-Orthodox rabbis through smaller organizations such as CLAL (\"The National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership\") and the New York Board of Rabbis.\nSome American Modern Orthodox rabbis created a new modern Orthodox advocacy group called Edah, which included members of the Rabbinical Council of America. Edah's mission statement stated: \"The Vision of Edah is an Orthodox Jewish community in which we, as members, leaders, and institutions ... reach out to and interact with Jews of all the movements as well as non-affiliated Jews as an expression of the wholeness of, and in an effort to strengthen, the entire Jewish people.\"\nConservative views.\nConservative Judaism holds that Orthodox Judaism is a valid and legitimate form of normative Rabbinic Judaism and respects the validity of its rabbis. Conservative Judaism holds that both Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism have made major and unjustifiable breaks with historic Judaism by their rejection of the normativity of \"Halakha\" and redefinition of Jewishness (e.g., the conferral of Jewishness by patrilineal descent). Despite this disagreement, Conservative Judaism respects the right of Reform and Reconstructionist Jews to interpret Judaism in their own way(s). The Conservative movement recognizes the right of Jews to form denominations and acknowledges the ordination of Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis, but generally does not accept their decisions as valid. For example, since the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed their 1983 resolution to recognize patrilineal descent, the Conservative movement has not accepted Reform converts to Judaism as Jews, requiring them to convert through Conservative \"batei din\". Conservative denominational leadership has since agreed to recognize Reform converts who complete necessary rituals (i.e., appearing before a \"beth din\" and immersing in a \"mikveh\") and a full \"introduction to Judaism\" course without inquiring regarding the status of the sponsoring rabbi or deciding \"beth din\".\nWhile respecting the validity of Orthodox rabbis, the Conservative movement believes that Orthodoxy has deviated from historical Judaism by insisting on the halakhic principle of binding legal precedent, particularly concerning relatively recent codifications of Jewish law. A prominent Conservative spokesman has written:\nReform has asserted the right of interpretation but it rejected the authority of legal tradition. Orthodoxy has clung fast to the principle of authority, but has in our own and recent generations rejected the right to any but minor interpretations. The Conservative view is that both are necessary for a living Judaism. Accordingly, Conservative Judaism holds itself bound by the Jewish legal tradition, but asserts the right of its rabbinical body, acting as a whole, to interpret and to apply Jewish law.\n\u2014 Mordecai Waxman, \"Tradition and Change: The Development of Conservative Judaism\"\nThe Conservative movement, however, has clashed with Orthodoxy over its refusal to recognize the Conservative and Reform movements as legitimate, and in February 1997, Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, the then-chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, claimed that Orthodox organizations in Israel politically discriminate against non-Orthodox Jews, and called on Reform and Conservative Jews, as well as the Jewish Federations of North America, to stop funding Orthodox organizations and institutions that disagree with the Conservative view of pluralism. Several weeks later, at the movement's annual Rabbinical Assembly conference in Boston, he called for the disintegration of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel and its network of courts.\nReform views.\nReform Judaism espouses the notion of religious pluralism, advocating that most Jewish denominations\u2014including Orthodoxy and the Conservative movement\u2014are valid expressions of Judaism. Historically, however, the Reform view of Orthodox Judaism had been negative. Early battles between Reform and Orthodox groups in Germany for control of communal leadership were fierce. Reform viewed Orthodoxy as overly focused on tradition and a literal interpretation of scripture that conflicted with modern science. Relations with the Conservative movement are much more cordial (although the two split due to such affairs as the Trefa Banquet), and Conservative and Reform leaders cooperate on many areas of mutual concern.\nHumanistic views.\nHumanistic Judaism views other forms of Judaism as valid from a traditional point of view, but emphasizes Jewish culture and history, rather than belief in God, as the sources of Jewish identity.\nKaraite views.\nKaraite Judaism does not recognize the Oral Law as a divine authority, maintaining that the Written Torah, and the subsequent prophets which God sent to Israel, whose writings are recorded in the Tanakh, are the only suitable sources for deriving halakha, which Karaite Judaism maintains, must not deviate from the plain meaning of the Hebrew Bible. Rabbinic laws which either allow Jews something the Torah forbids, or release Jews from a commandment the Torah requires, are seen as a break with the Torah, and transgression of Divine Law. An example being the white tzitzit donned by Rabbinic Jews, which has no tekhelet. This is regarded as a violation of the Torah, which requires that tzitzit be made with tekhelet. The tzitzit worn by some in the rabbinic community, which does have tekhelet, is also seen as a violation of the Torah, because according to the Talmud, a tekhelet string must be made of wool, and the white strings from linen, making the tzitzit shatnez. Karaite Jews also maintain that Rabbinic Jews are not observing Jewish holy days on their correct date, because the dates are fixed according to the pre-calculated Hillel II calendar, instead of beginning each month with the sighting of the New Moon from the horizon of Israel, and starting the year during the month when the barley reaches the stage of Aviv in the land of Israel. However, despite Rabbinic Judaism deviating from the plain meaning of the Torah, Karaite Jews recognize Rabbinic Jews who have unbroken patrilineal Jewish descent, as Jewish, and eligible to join Karaite Judaism without a conversion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its first members were 8048, 8035 and 8748. The 8048 is arguably the most prominent member of the family. Initially, this family was produced using NMOS (n-type metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor) technology. In the early 1980s, it became available in CMOS technology. It was manufactured into the 1990s to support older designs that still used it.\nThe MCS-48 series has a modified Harvard architecture, with internal or external program ROM and 64 to 256 bytes of internal (on-chip) RAM. The I/O is mapped into its own address space, separate from programs and data.\nThough the MCS-48 series was eventually replaced by the very successful MCS-51 series, it remained quite popular even by the year 2000 due to its low cost, wide availability, memory-efficient one-byte instruction set, and mature development tools. Because of this, it is used in high-volume, cost-sensitive consumer electronics devices such as TV remotes, computer keyboards, and toys.\nVariants.\nThe 8049 has 2\u00a0KB of masked ROM (the 8748 and 8749 had EPROM) that can be replaced with a 4\u00a0KB external ROM, as well as 128\u00a0bytes of RAM and 27\u00a0I/O ports. The microcontroller's oscillator block divides the clock input frequency by three and then further divides the result into five machine states. Using the 11\u00a0MHz maximum crystal frequency will produce 0.73\u00a0MIPS of single-cycle instructions. Some 70% of instructions are single byte and single cycle ones, but 30% need two cycles or two bytes, so its typical performance would be closer to 0.5\u00a0MIPS.\nUses.\nThe MCS-48 series was commonly used in computer and terminal keyboards, converting key presses into protocols that can be understood by digital circuits. This also allows the possibility of serial communication, reducing the number of conductors needed in cables on external keyboards. Microprocessors had been used in keyboards since at least 1972, simplifying earlier discrete designs. The 8048 has been used in this application since its introduction in 1978.\nThe Tandy/Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II, released in 1979, used the 8021 in its keyboard. The 8021 processor scans the key matrix, converts switch closures to an 8-bit code and then transmits that code serially to the keyboard interface on the main system. It will also accept commands to turn indicator LEDs on or off. The 8021 was also used in the keyboards for the TRS-80 Model 12, 12B, 16, 16B and the Tandy 6000/6000HD.\nThe original IBM PC keyboard and the keyboard for its precursor the IBM System/23 Datamaster used an 8048 as its internal microcontroller. The PC AT replaced the PC's Intel 8255 peripheral interface chip at I/O port addresses 0x60\u201363 with an 8042 accessible through port addresses 0x60 and 0x64. As well as managing the keyboard interface, the 8042 controlled the A20 line gating function for the AT's Intel 80286 CPU and could be commanded by software to reset the 80286 (unlike the 80386 and later processors, the 80286 had no way of switching from protected mode back to real mode except by being reset). Later PC compatibles integrate the 8042's functions into their super I/O devices.\nThe 8048 was used in the Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2 video game console, the Korg Trident series, and the Korg Poly-61, Roland Jupiter-4 and Roland ProMars analog synthesizers. The Sinclair QL used the closely related Intel 8049 to manage its keyboard, joystick ports, RS-232 inputs and audio. The ROM-less 8035 variant was used in Nintendo's arcade game \"Donkey Kong\" to generate the background music and some of the game's sound effects.\nInstruction set.\nAll MCS-48 instructions are one or two bytes long with 70% of the instructions being one byte. The MCS-48 can address 4096 bytes of program memory, 256 bytes of RAM, 256 bytes of external memory, and eight port I/O addresses. Most arithmetic and logical operations use the accumulator as a parameter and destination. Eight memory locations are mapped as registers so they can be addressed by a 3-bit field embedded in many instructions. Two of those registers can be used as memory pointers. Conditional branches can only access the current 256-byte page. JMP and CALL can directly access 2048 locations. To access the entire 4096 byte program space, a clunky select memory bank instruction must be used. The RET instruction can, however, return anywhere in the address space. Interrupts are well supported with alternate registers for quick context switches and the ability to restore the state of the flags with the RETR instruction. All instructions execute in one or two machine cycles. Each machine cycle takes 15 external clocks.\nExample code.\nThe following assembler source code is for a subroutine named that adds two 32-bit integers stored in little endian order. One addend is pointed to by R0 and the other addend and result are pointed to by R1.\nDerived microcontrollers.\nPhilips Semiconductors (now NXP) owned a license to produce this series and developed their MAB8400-family based on this architecture. These were the first microcontrollers with an integrated I\u00b2C-interface and were used in the first Philips (Magnavox in the US) Compact Disc players (e.g. the CD-100).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is considered one of the most important Austrian Expressionists. He is perhaps best known for his poem \"Grodek\", which he wrote shortly before he died of a cocaine overdose at the age of 27.\nLife and work.\nTrakl was born and lived the first 21 years of his life in Salzburg. His father, Tobias Trakl (11 June 1837, \u00d6denburg/Sopron\u00a0\u2013 1910), was a hardware dealer from Hungary. His mother, Maria Catharina Halik (17 May 1852, Wiener Neustadt\u00a0\u2013 1925), was a housewife of partly Czech descent who struggled with substance use disorder. She left her son's education to a French governess, who brought Trakl into contact with French language and literature at an early age. His sister Grete Trakl was a musical prodigy with whom he shared artistic endeavors. Poems allude to an incestuous relationship between the two.\nFrom 1892 Trakl attended a Catholic elementary school, but he was released two afternoons a week for religious instruction from a Protestant pastor. He matriculated in 1897 at the Salzburg Staatsgymnasium, where he had problems in Latin, Greek, and mathematics, for which he had to repeat one year and then leave without Matura. At age 13, Trakl began to write poetry.\nCarolyn Forch\u00e9 notes that \"Given his dependence on opiates, his lack of financial independence, and his poetic vocation, he chose somewhat practically to become a dispensing chemist\". From 1905, Trakl undertook a 3 year apprenticeship in a pharmacy; this facilitated access to drugs, such as morphine and cocaine. It was during this time that he experimented with playwriting, but his two short plays, \"All Souls' Day\" and \"Fata Morgana\", were not successful. However, from May to December 1906, Trakl published four prose pieces in the \"feuilleton\" section of two Salzburg newspapers. All cover themes and settings found in his mature work. This is especially true of \"Traumland\" (Dreamland), in which a young man falls in love with a dying girl who is his cousin.\nIn 1908, Trakl moved to Vienna to study pharmacy, and became acquainted with some local artists who helped him publish some of his poems. Trakl's father died in 1910, soon before Trakl received his pharmacy certificate; thereafter, Trakl enlisted in the army for a year-long stint. His return to civilian life in Salzburg was unsuccessful and he re-enlisted, serving as a pharmacist at a hospital in Innsbruck. There he became acquainted with a group of avant-garde artists involved with the well-regarded literary journal \"Der Brenner\", a journal that began the Kierkegaard revival in the German-speaking countries. Ludwig von Ficker, the editor of \"Der Brenner\" (and son of the historian Julius von Ficker), became his patron; he regularly printed Trakl's work and endeavored to find him a publisher to produce a collection of poems. The result of these efforts was \"Gedichte\" \"(Poems)\", published by Kurt Wolff in Leipzig during the summer of 1913. Ficker also brought Trakl to the attention of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who anonymously provided him with a sizable stipend so that he could concentrate on his writing. Johnston reports that Ficker selected Trakl to receive 20,000 crowns and that the \"news of this windfall prompted the drug-ridden Trakl to vomit\".\nAt the beginning of World War I, Trakl served in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was sent as a medical officer to attend soldiers on the Eastern Front. Trakl suffered frequent bouts of depression. On one such occasion during the Battle of Gr\u00f3dek (fought in autumn 1914 at Gr\u00f3dek, then in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria), Trakl had to steward the recovery of some ninety soldiers wounded in the fierce campaign against the Russians. He tried to shoot himself from the strain, but his comrades prevented him. Hospitalized at a military hospital in Krak\u00f3w and observed closely, Trakl lapsed into worse depression and wrote to Ficker for advice. Ficker convinced him to communicate with Wittgenstein. Upon receiving Trakl's note, Wittgenstein travelled to the hospital, but found that Trakl had died of a cocaine overdose.\nTrakl was buried at Krak\u00f3w's Rakowicki Cemetery on 6 November 1914, but on 7 October 1925, as a result of the efforts by Ficker, his remains were transferred to the municipal cemetery of Innsbruck-M\u00fchlau (where they now repose next to Ficker's).\nThemes and motifs.\nWhile Trakl's very earliest poems are more philosophical and do not deal as much with the real world, most of his poems are either set in the evening or have evening as a motif. Silence is also a frequent motif in Trakl's poetry, and his later poems often feature the silent dead, who are unable to express themselves.\nBibliography.\nSelected titles\nLiterary works in English\nCritical studies\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of four living species of the order Sirenia, which also includes three species of manatees. It is the only living representative of the once-diverse family Dugongidae; its closest modern relative, Steller's sea cow (\"Hydrodamalis gigas\"), was hunted to extinction in the 18th century.\nThe dugong is the only sirenian in its range, which spans the waters of some 40 countries and territories throughout the Indo-West Pacific. The dugong is largely dependent on seagrass communities for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitats that support seagrass meadows, with the largest dugong concentrations typically occurring in wide, shallow, protected areas, such as bays, mangrove channels, the waters of large inshore islands, and inter-reefal waters. The northern waters of Australia between Shark Bay and Moreton Bay are believed to be the dugong's contemporary stronghold.\nLike all modern sirenians, the dugong has a body with no dorsal fin or hind limbs. The forelimbs or flippers are paddle-like. The dugong is easily distinguishable from the manatees by its fluked, dolphin-like tail; it also possesses a unique skull and teeth. Its snout is sharply downturned, an adaptation for feeding in benthic seagrass communities. The molar teeth are simple and peg-like, unlike the more elaborate molar dentition of manatees.\nThe dugong has been hunted for thousands of years for its meat and oil. Traditional hunting still has great cultural significance in several parts of its modern range, particularly northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. The dugong's current distribution is fragmented, and many populations are believed to be close to extinction. The IUCN lists the dugong as a species vulnerable to extinction, while the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species limits or bans the trade of derived products. Despite it being legally protected in many countries, the main causes of population decline remain anthropogenic and include fishing-related fatalities, habitat degradation, and hunting. With its long lifespan of 70 years or more and slow rate of reproduction, the dugong is especially vulnerable to extinction.\nEvolution.\nDugongs are part of the Sirenia order of placental mammals which comprises modern \"sea cows\" (manatees as well as dugongs) and their extinct relatives. Sirenia are the only extant herbivorous marine mammals and the only group of herbivorous mammals to have become completely aquatic. Sirenians are thought to have a 50-million-year-old fossil record (early Eocene-recent). They attained modest diversity during the Oligocene and Miocene but subsequently declined as a result of climatic cooling, oceanographic changes, and human interference.\nEtymology and taxonomy.\nThe word \"dugong\" derives from the Visayan (probably Cebuano) '. The name was first adopted and popularized by the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, as \"dugon\" in \"Histoire Naturelle\" (1765), after descriptions of the animal from the island of Leyte in the Philippines. The name ultimately derives from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *duyu\u014b. Despite a common misconception, the term does not come from Malay ' and it does not mean \"lady of the sea\" (mermaid).\nOther common local names include \"sea cow\", \"sea pig\", and \"sea camel\". It is known as the \"balguja\" by the Wunambal people of the Mitchell Plateau area in the Kimberley, Western Australia.\n\"Dugong dugon\" is the only extant species of the family Dugongidae, and one of only four extant species of the Sirenia order, the others forming the manatee family. It was first classified by M\u00fcller in 1776 as \"Trichechus dugon\", a member of the manatee genus previously defined by Linnaeus. It was later assigned as the type species of \"Dugong\" by Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de and further classified within its own family by Gray and subfamily by Simpson.\nDugongs and other sirenians are not closely related to other marine mammals, being more closely related to elephants. Dugongs and elephants share a monophyletic group with hyraxes and the aardvark, one of the earliest offshoots of eutherians. The fossil record shows sirenians appearing in the Eocene, when they most likely lived in the Tethys Ocean. The two extant families of sirenians are thought to have diverged in the mid-Eocene, after which the dugongs and their closest relative, the Steller's sea cow, split off from a common ancestor in the Miocene. The Steller's sea cow became extinct in the 18th century. No fossils exist of other members of the Dugongidae.\nMolecular studies have been conducted on dugong populations using mitochondrial DNA. The results have suggested that the population in Southeast Asia is distinct from the others. Australia has two distinct maternal lineages, one of which also contains the dugongs from Africa and Arabia. Limited genetic mixing has taken place between those in Southeast Asia and those in Australia, mostly around Timor. One of the lineages stretches from Moreton Bay to Western Australia, while the other only stretches from Moreton Bay to the Northern Territory. There is not yet sufficient genetic data to make clear the boundaries between distinct groups.\nAnatomy and morphology.\nThe dugong's body is large with a cylindrical shape that tapers at both ends. It has thick, smooth skin that is a pale cream colour at birth but darkens dorsally and laterally to brownish-to-dark-grey with age. The colour of a dugong can change due to the growth of algae on the skin.\nAn adult's length rarely exceeds . An individual this long is expected to weigh around . Weight in adults is typically more than and less than . The largest individual recorded was long and weighed , and was found off the Saurashtra coast of west India. Females tend to be larger than males.\nThe body is sparsely covered in short hair, a common feature among sirenians which may allow for tactile interpretation of their environment. These hairs are most developed around the mouth, which has a large horseshoe-shaped upper lip forming a highly mobile muzzle. This muscular upper lip aids the dugong in foraging.\nThe dugong's tail flukes and flippers are similar to those of dolphins. These flukes are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing. The dugong lacks nails on its flippers, which are only 15% of a dugong's body length. The tail has deep notches.\nA dugong's brain weighs a maximum of , about 0.1% of the animal's body weight. With very small eyes, dugongs have limited vision, but acute hearing within narrow sound thresholds. Their ears, which lack pinnae, are located on the sides of their head. The nostrils are located on top of the head and can be closed using valves. Dugongs have two teats, one located behind each flipper. There are few differences between the sexes; the body structures are almost the same. A male's testes are not externally located, and the main difference between males and females is the location of the genital aperture to the umbilicus and the anus. The lungs in a dugong are very long, extending almost as far as the kidneys, which are also highly elongated to cope with the saltwater environment. If the dugong is wounded, its blood will clot rapidly.\nThe skull of a dugong is unique. The skull is enlarged with a sharply down-turned premaxilla, which is stronger in males. The spine has between 57 and 60 vertebrae. Unlike in manatees, the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two incisors (tusks) which emerge in males during puberty. The female's tusks continue to grow without emerging during puberty, sometimes erupting later in life after reaching the base of the premaxilla. The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong, and the cheek teeth move forward with age.\nThe full dental formula of dugongs is 2.0.3.33.1.3.3, meaning they have two incisors, three premolars, and three molars on each side of their upper jaw, and three incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars on each side of their lower jaw. Like other sirenians, the dugong experiences pachyostosis, a condition in which the ribs and other long bones are unusually solid and contain little or no marrow. These heavy bones, which are among the densest in the animal kingdom, may act as a ballast to help keep sirenians suspended slightly below the water's surface.\nDistribution and habitat.\nDugongs are found in warm coastal waters from the western Pacific Ocean to the eastern coast of Africa, along an estimated of coastline between 26\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 to the north and south of the equator. Their historic range is believed to correspond to that of seagrasses from the Potamogetonaceae and Hydrocharitaceae families. The full size of the former range is unknown, although it is believed that the current populations represent the historical limits of the range, which is highly fractured. Their distributions during warmer periods of Holocene might have been broader than today. Today populations of dugongs are found in the waters of 37 countries and territories. Recorded numbers of dugongs are generally believed to be lower than actual numbers, due to a lack of accurate surveys. Despite this uncertainty, the dugong population is thought to be shrinking, with a worldwide decline of 20 percent in the last 90 years. They have disappeared from the waters of Hong Kong, Mauritius, and Taiwan, as well as parts of Cambodia, Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Further disappearances are likely.\nDugongs are generally found in warm coastal waters with large numbers concentrated in wide and shallow protected bays. The dugong is the only strictly marine herbivorous mammal, as all species of manatee utilise fresh water to some degree. Nonetheless, they can tolerate the brackish waters found in coastal wetlands, and large numbers are also found in wide and shallow mangrove channels and around leeward sides of large inshore islands, where seagrass beds are common. They are usually located at a depth of around , although in areas where the continental shelf remains shallow dugongs have been known to travel more than from the shore, descending to as far as , where deepwater seagrasses such as \"Halophila spinulosa\" are found. Specific habitats are used for different activities. It has been observed that shallow waters are used as sites for calving, minimizing the risk of predation. Deep waters may provide a thermal refuge from cooler waters closer to the shore during winter.\nAustralia.\nAustralia is home to the largest population, stretching from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Moreton Bay in Queensland. The population of Shark Bay is thought to be stable with over 10,000 dugongs. Smaller populations exist up the coast, including one in Ashmore Reef. Large numbers of dugongs live to the north of the Northern Territory, with a population of over 20,000 in the Gulf of Carpentaria alone. A population of over 25,000 exists in the Torres Strait such as off Thursday Island, although there is significant migration between the strait and the waters of New Guinea. \nThe Great Barrier Reef provides important feeding areas for the species; this reef area houses a stable population of around 10,000, although the population concentration has shifted over time. Large bays facing north on the Queensland coast provide significant habitats for dugong, with the southernmost of these being Hervey Bay and Moreton Bay. Dugongs had been occasional visitors along the Gold Coast where a re-establishment of a local population through range expansions has started recently.\nPersian Gulf.\nThe Persian Gulf has the second-largest dugong population in the world, inhabiting most of the southern coast, and the current population is believed to range from 5,800 to 7,300. In the course of a study carried out in 1986 and 1999 on the Persian Gulf, the largest reported group sighting was made of more than 600 individuals to the west of Qatar. A 2017 study found a nearly 25% drop in population since 1950. Reasons for this drastic population loss include illegal poaching, oil spills, and net entanglement.\nEast Africa and South Asia.\nIn the late 1960s, herds of up to 500 dugongs were observed off the coast of East Africa and nearby islands. Current populations in this area are extremely small, numbering 50 and below, and it is thought likely they will become extinct. The eastern side of the Red Sea is home to large populations numbering in the hundreds, and similar populations are thought to exist on the western side. In the 1980s, it was estimated there could be as many as 4,000 dugongs in the Red Sea. Dugong populations in Madagascar are poorly studied, but due to widespread exploitation, it is thought they may have severely declined, with few surviving individuals. The resident population around Mayotte is thought to number just 10 individuals. In Mozambique, most of the remaining local populations are very small and the largest (about 120 individuals) occurs at Bazaruto Island, but they have become rare in historical habitats such as in Maputo Bay and on Inhaca Island. The Bazaruto Island population is possibly the last long-term viable population in East Africa, with only some of its core territory lying within protected waters.\nThe East African population is genetically distinct from those of the Red Sea and those off Madagascar. In Tanzania, observations have recently increased around the Mafia Island Marine Park where a hunt was intended by fishermen but failed in 2009. In the Seychelles, dugongs had been regarded as extinct in the 18th century until a small number was discovered around the Aldabra Atoll. This population may belong to a different group than that distributed among the inner isles. Dugongs once thrived among the Chagos Archipelago and Sea Cow Island was named after the species, although the species no longer occurs in the region.\nThere are less than 250 individuals scattered throughout Indian waters. A highly isolated breeding population exists in the Marine National Park, Gulf of Kutch, the only remaining population in western India. It is from the population in the Persian Gulf, and from the nearest population in India. Former populations in this area, centered on the Maldives and the Lakshadweep, are presumed to be extinct. A population exists in the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka, but it is seriously depleted. Recoveries of seagrass beds along former ranges of dugongs, such as the Chilika Lake have been confirmed in recent years, raising hopes for re-colonizations of the species. The population around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is known only from a few records, and although the population was large during British rule, it is now believed to be small and scattered.\nSoutheast Asia and the West Pacific.\nA small population existed along the southern coast of China, particularly the Gulf of Tonkin (Beibu Gulf), where efforts were made to protect it, including the establishment of ranging in Guangxi. Despite these efforts, numbers continued to decrease, and in 2007 it was reported that no more dugong could be found on the west coast of the island of Hainan. Historically, dugongs were also present in the southern parts of the Yellow Sea. The last confirmed record of dugongs in Chinese waters was documented in 2008. In August 2022, an article published on the Royal Society Open Science concluded that dugongs were functionally extinct in China, which was based on a large-scale interview survey conducted across four southern Chinese maritime provinces (Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian) in the summer of 2019.\nIn Vietnam, dugongs have been restricted mostly to the provinces of Ki\u00ean Giang and B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, including Phu Quoc Island and Con Dao Island, which hosted large populations in the past. Con Dao is now the only site in Vietnam where dugongs are regularly seen, protected within the C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park. Nonetheless, dangerously low levels of attention to the conservation of marine organisms in Vietnam and Cambodia may result in increased intentional or unintentional catches, and illegal trade is a potential danger for local dugongs. On Phu Quoc, the first 'Dugong Festival' was held in 2014, aiming to raise awareness of these issues.\nIn Thailand, the present distribution of dugongs is restricted to six provinces along the Andaman Sea, and very few dugongs are present in the Gulf of Thailand. The Gulf of Thailand was historically home to a large number of animals, but none have been sighted in the west of the gulf in recent years, and the remaining population in the east is thought to be very small and possibly declining. Dugongs are believed to exist in the Straits of Johor in very small numbers. The waters around Borneo support a small population, with more scattered throughout the Malay Archipelago.\nAll the islands of the Philippines once provided habitats for sizeable herds of dugongs. They were common until the 1970s when their numbers declined sharply due to accidental drownings in fishing gear and habitat destruction of seagrass meadows. Today, only isolated populations survive, most notably in the waters of the Calamian Islands in Palawan, Isabela in Luzon, Guimaras, and Mindanao. The dugong became the first marine animal protected by Philippine law, with harsh penalties for harming them. Recently, the local marine trash problem in the archipelago remained unabated and became the biggest threat to the already dwindling population of Dugongs in the country. Litters of plastic waste (single-use sachets, plastic bottles, fast food to-go containers, etc.) and other non-biodegradable materials abound in the coastal areas. As these materials may be mistaken as food by dugongs, these may lead to death due to plastic ingestion. Overpopulation and lack of education of all coastal fisherfolk in the Philippines regarding marine trash are harming the coastal environment not only in Palawan but also across the islands of the Philippines. The first documented sighting in Sarangani Bay occurred in July 2024.\nPopulations also exist around the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia, stretching to an easternmost population in Vanuatu. A highly isolated population lives around the islands of Palau.\nA single dugong lives at Cocos (Keeling) Islands although the animal is thought to be a vagrant.\nNorthern Pacific.\nToday, possibly the smallest and northernmost population of dugongs exists around the Ryukyu islands, and a population formerly existed off Taiwan. An endangered population of 50 or fewer dugongs, possibly as few as three individuals, survives around Okinawa. New sightings of a cow and calf have been reported in 2017, indicating a possible breeding had occurred in these waters. A single individual was recorded at Amami \u014cshima, at the northernmost edge of the dugong's historic range, more than 40 years after the last previous recorded sighting. A vagrant strayed into a port near Ushibuka, Kumamoto, and died due to poor health. Historically, the Yaeyama Islands held a large concentration of dugongs, with more than 300 individuals. On the Aragusuku Islands, large quantities of skulls are preserved at a utaki that outsiders are strictly forbidden to enter. Dugong populations in these areas were reduced by historical hunts as payments to the Ryukyu Kingdom, before being wiped out because of large-scale illegal hunting and fishing using destructive methods such as dynamite fishing after the Second World War.\nIn March 2025 a fisherman accidentally caught a dugong in his nets at Fenniaolin in Yilin County in northeast Taiwan, which he released back into the sea. This was the first sighting of a live dugong in Taiwan waters in 88 years.\nPopulations around Taiwan appear to be almost extinct, although remnant individuals may visit areas with rich seagrass beds such as Dongsha Atoll. Some of the last reported sightings were made in Kenting National Park in the 1950s and 60s. There had been occasional records of vagrants at the Northern Mariana Islands before 1985. It is unknown how much mixing there was between these populations historically. Some theorize that populations existed independently, for example, that the Okinawan population was isolated members derived from the migration of a Philippine subspecies. Others postulate that the populations formed part of a super-population where migration between Ryukyu, Taiwan, and the Philippines was common.\nExtinct Mediterranean population.\nIt has been confirmed that dugongs once inhabited the water of the Mediterranean possibly until after the rise of civilizations along the inland sea. This population possibly shared ancestry with the Red Sea population, and the Mediterranean population had never been large due to geographical factors and climate changes. The Mediterranean is the region where the Dugongidae originated in the mid-late Eocene, along with Caribbean Sea.\nEcology and life history.\nDugongs are long-lived, and the oldest recorded specimen reached age 73. They have few natural predators, although animals such as crocodiles, killer whales, and sharks pose a threat to the young, and a dugong has also been recorded to have died from trauma after being impaled by a stingray barb. A large number of infections and parasitic diseases affect dugongs. Detected pathogens include helminths, cryptosporidium, different types of bacterial infections, and other unidentified parasites. 30% of dugong deaths in Queensland since 1996 are thought to be because of disease.\nAlthough they are social animals, they are usually solitary or found in pairs due to the inability of seagrass beds to support large populations. Gatherings of hundreds of dugongs sometimes happen, but they last only for a short time. Because they are shy and do not approach humans, little is known about dugong behavior. They can go six minutes without breathing (though about two and a half minutes is more typical), and have been known to rest on their tails to breathe with their heads above water. They can dive to a maximum depth of ; they spend most of their lives no deeper than . Communication between individuals is through chirps, whistles, barks, and other sounds that echo underwater. Different sounds have been observed with different amplitudes and frequencies, implying different purposes. Visual communication is limited due to poor eyesight and is mainly used for activities such as lekking for courtship purposes. Mothers and calves are in almost constant physical contact, and calves have been known to reach out and touch their mothers with their flippers for reassurance.\nDugongs are semi-nomadic, often traveling long distances in search of food, but staying within a certain range their entire lives. Large numbers often move together from one area to another. It is thought that these movements are caused by changes in seagrass availability. Their memory allows them to return to specific points after long travels. Dugong movements mostly occur within a localized area of seagrass beds, and animals in the same region show individualistic patterns of movement. Daily movement is affected by the tides. In areas where there is a large tidal range, dugongs travel with the tide to access shallower feeding areas. In Moreton Bay, dugongs often travel between foraging grounds inside the bay and warmer oceanic waters. At higher latitudes dugongs make seasonal travels to reach warmer water during the winter. Occasionally individual dugongs make long-distance travels over many days and can travel over deep ocean waters. One animal was seen as far south as Sydney. Although they are marine creatures, dugongs have been known to travel up creeks, and in one case a dugong was caught up a creek near Cooktown.\nFeeding.\nDugongs, along with other sirenians, are referred to as \"sea cows\" because their diet consists mainly of seagrass, particularly the genera \"Halophila\" and \"Halodule\". When eating they ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although when this is impossible they will feed on just the leaves. A wide variety of seagrass has been found in dugong stomach contents, and evidence exists they will eat algae when seagrass is scarce. Although almost completely herbivorous, they will occasionally eat invertebrates, such as jellyfish, sea squirts, and shellfish. Dugongs in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when the supply of their choice grasses decreases. In other southern areas of both western and eastern Australia, there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates. This does not apply to dugongs in tropical areas, in which fecal evidence indicates that invertebrates are not eaten.\nMost dugongs do not feed on lush areas, but where the seagrass is more sparse. Additional factors such as protein concentration and regenerative ability also affect the value of a seagrass bed. The chemical structure and composition of the seagrass are important, and the grass species most often eaten are low in fiber, high in nitrogen, and easily digestible. In the Great Barrier Reef, dugongs feed on low-fiber high-nitrogen seagrass such as \"Halophila\" and \"Halodule\", to maximize nutrient intake instead of bulk eating. Seagrasses of a lower seral are preferred, where the area has not fully vegetated. Only certain seagrass meadows are suitable for dugong consumption, due to the dugong's highly specialized diet. There is evidence that dugongs actively alter seagrass species compositions at local levels. Dugongs may search out deeper seagrass. Feeding trails have been observed as deep as , and dugongs have been seen feeding as deep as . Dugongs are relatively slow-moving, swimming at around . When moving along the seabed to feed they walk on their pectoral fins.\nDugong feeding may favor the subsequent growth of low-fibre, high-nitrogen seagrasses such as \"Halophilia\" and \"Halodule.\" Species such as \"Zosteria capricorni\" are more dominant in established seagrass beds, but grow slowly, while \"Halophilia\" and \"Halodule\" grow quickly in the open space left by dugong feeding. This behavior is known as cultivation grazing and favors the rapidly growing, higher nutrient seagrasses that dugongs prefer. Dugongs may also prefer to feed on younger, less fibrous strands of seagrasses, and cycles of cultivation feeding at different seagrass meadows may provide them with a greater number of younger plants.\nDue to their poor eyesight, dugongs often use smell to locate edible plants. They also have a strong tactile sense and feel their surroundings with their long sensitive bristles. They will dig up an entire plant and then shake it to remove the sand before eating it. They have been known to collect a pile of plants in one area before eating them. The flexible and muscular upper lip is used to dig out the plants. This leaves furrows in the sand in their path.\nReproduction and parental care.\nA dugong reaches sexual maturity between the ages of eight and eighteen, older than in most other mammals. Females know that a male has reached sexual maturity by the eruption of the male's tusks, since tusks erupt in males when testosterone levels reach a high enough level. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, with some studies placing the age between ten and seventeen years while others place it as early as six years. There is evidence that male dugongs lose fertility at older ages. \nDespite the longevity of the dugong, which may live for 50 years or more, females give birth only a few times during their lives and invest considerable parental care in their young. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2.4 to 7 years.\nMating behaviour varies between populations located in different areas. In some populations, males establish a territory that females in estrus then visit. In these areas, the male attempts to impress females while defending the area from other males, a practice known as lekking. In other areas many males attempt to mate with the same female, sometimes inflicting injuries on the female or each other. During this event the female copulates with multiple males, who fight to mount her from below. This greatly increases the chances of conception.\nFemales give birth after a 13- to 15-month gestation, usually to just one calf. Birth occurs in very shallow water, with occasions known where the mothers were almost on the shore. As soon as the young is born the mother pushes it to the surface to take a breath. Newborns are already long and weigh around . Once born, calves stay close to their mothers, possibly to make swimming easier. The calf nurses for 14\u201318 months, although it begins to eat seagrasses soon after birth. A calf leaves its mother only after it has matured.\nImportance to humans.\nDugongs have historically provided easy targets for hunters, who killed them for their meat, oil, skin, and bones. As the anthropologist A. Asbj\u00f8rn J\u00f8n has noted, they are often considered the inspiration for mermaids, and people around the world developed cultures around dugong hunting. In some areas, it remains an animal of great significance, and a growing ecotourism industry around dugongs has had an economic benefit in some countries.\nThere is a 5,000-year-old wall painting of a dugong, apparently drawn by Neolithic peoples, in Tambun Cave, Ipoh, Malaysia. This was discovered by Lieutenant R.L. Rawlings in 1959 while on a routine patrol.\nDugongs feature in Southeast Asian, especially Austronesian, folklore. In languages like Ilocano, Mapun, Yakan, Tausug, and Kadazan Dusun of the Philippines and Sabah, the name for dugongs is a synonym for \"mermaid\". In Malay, they are sometimes referred to as ' (\"woman of the sea\") or ' (\"mermaid princess\"), leading to the misconception that the word \"dugong\" itself means \"lady of the sea\". A common belief found in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, is that dugongs were originally human or part-human (usually women), and that they cry when they are butchered or beached. Because of this, it is considered bad luck if a dugong is killed or accidentally dies in nets or fish corrals in the Philippines, some parts of Sabah (Malaysia), and northern Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda Islands (Indonesia). Dugongs are predominantly not traditionally hunted for food in these regions and they remained plentiful until around the 1970s.\nConversely, dugong \"tears\" are considered aphrodisiacs in other parts of Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Dugong meat is considered a luxury food and is also believed to have aphrodisiac properties. They are actively hunted in these regions, in some places to near-extinction.\nIn Palau, dugongs were traditionally hunted with heavy spears from canoes. Although it is illegal and there is widespread disapproval of killing dugongs, poaching remains a major problem. Dugongs are also widely hunted in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia; where their meat and ornaments made from bones and tusks are highly prized in feasts and traditional rituals. However, hunting dugongs is considered taboo in some areas of Vanuatu. Dugong meat and oil have traditionally been some of the most valuable foods of Australian Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Some Aboriginals regard dugongs as part of their Aboriginality.\nLocal fishermen in Southern China traditionally revered dugongs and regarded them as \"miraculous fish\". They believed it was bad luck to catch them and they were plentiful in the region before the 1960s. Beginning in the 1950s, a wave of immigrants from other regions that do not hold these beliefs resulted in dugongs being hunted for food and traditional Chinese medicine. This led to a steep decline in dugong populations in the Gulf of Tonkin and the sea around Hainan Island. In Japan, dugongs have been traditionally hunted in the Ryukyu Islands since prehistoric times. Carved ribs of dugongs in the shape of butterflies (a psychopomp) are found throughout Okinawa. They were commonly hunted throughout Japan up until around the 1970s.\nDugongs have also played a role in legends in Kenya, and the animal is known there as the \"Queen of the Sea\". Body parts are used as food, medicine, and decorations. In the Gulf states, dugongs served not only as a source of food but their tusks were used as sword handles. Dugong oil is important as a preservative and conditioner for wooden boats to people around the Gulf of Kutch in India, who also believe the meat to be an aphrodisiac.\nDugongs have a key role in indigenous marine governance and cultural identity across northern Australia. They are considered part of \u201csea-country\u201d, a living network of relationships linking people, animals and coastal environments, and contemporary management programs in the Torres Strait and northern Queensland increasingly integrate traditional ecological knowledge with scientific monitoring and co-management arrangements.\nConservation.\nDugong numbers have decreased in recent times. For a population to remain stable, the mortality of adults cannot exceed 5% annually. The estimated percentage of females humans can kill without depleting the population is 1\u20132%. This number is reduced in areas where calving is minimal due to food shortages. Even in the best conditions, a population is unlikely to increase more than 5% a year, leaving dugongs vulnerable to over-exploitation. The fact that they live in shallow waters puts them under great pressure from human activity. Research on dugongs and the effects of human activity on them has been limited, mostly taking place in Australia. In many countries, dugong numbers have never been surveyed. As such, trends are uncertain, with more data needed for comprehensive management. The only data stretching back far enough to mention population trends comes from the urban coast of Queensland, Australia. The last major worldwide study, made in 2002, concluded that the dugong was declining and possibly extinct in a third of its range, with unknown status in another half.\nThe IUCN Red List lists the dugong as vulnerable, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora regulates and in some areas has banned international trade. Most dugong habitats fall within proposed important marine mammal areas. Regional cooperation is important due to the widespread distribution of the animal, and in 1998 there was strong support for Southeast Asian cooperation to protect dugongs. Kenya has passed legislation banning the hunting of dugongs and restricting trawling, but the dugong is not yet listed under Kenya's Wildlife Act as an endangered species. Mozambique has had legislation to protect dugongs since 1955, but this has not been effectively enforced. France has a National Action Plan covering the species, implemented within the Mayotte Marine Natural Park. \nMany marine parks have been established on the African coast of the Red Sea, and the Egyptian Gulf of Aqaba is fully protected. The United Arab Emirates has banned all hunting of dugongs within its waters, as has Bahrain. The UAE has additionally banned drift net fishing, and has declared an intention to restore coastal ecosystems dugongs rely on. India and Sri Lanka ban the hunting and selling of dugongs and their products. Japan has listed dugongs as endangered and has banned intentional killing and harassment. Hunting, catching, and harassment are banned by the People's Republic of China. The first marine mammal to be protected in the Philippines was the dugong, although monitoring this is difficult. Palau has legislated to protect dugongs, although this is not well enforced and poaching persists. Indonesia listed dugongs as a protected species in 1999, and in 2018 the Fisheries Ministry began implementing a conservation plan. Protection is not always enforced and souvenir products made from dugong parts can be openly found in markets in Bali. Traditional dugong hunters continued to hunt for many years, and some have struggled to find alternative incomes after ceasing. The dugong is a national animal of Papua New Guinea, which bans all except traditional hunting. Vanuatu and New Caledonia ban the hunting of dugongs. Dugongs are protected throughout Australia, although the rules vary by state; in some areas, indigenous hunting is allowed. \nDugongs are listed under the Nature Conservation Act in the Australian state of Queensland as vulnerable. Most currently live in established marine parks, where boats must travel at a restricted speed and mesh net fishing is restricted. The World Wide Fund for Nature has purchased gillnet licences in northern Queensland to reduce the impact of fishing. In Vietnam, an illegal network targeting dugongs had been detected and was shut down in 2012. Potential hunts along Tanzanian coasts by fishermen have raised concerns as well.\nHuman activity.\nDespite being legally protected in many countries, the main causes of population decline remain anthropogenic and include hunting, habitat degradation, and fishing-related fatalities. Entanglement in fishing nets has caused many deaths, although there are no precise statistics. Most issues with industrial fishing occur in deeper waters where dugong populations are low, with local fishing being the main risk in shallower waters. As dugongs cannot stay underwater for a very long period, they are highly prone to death due to entanglement. The use of shark nets has historically caused large numbers of deaths, and they have been eliminated in most areas and replaced with baited hooks. Hunting has historically been a problem too, although in most areas they are no longer hunted, except in certain indigenous communities. In areas such as northern Australia, hunting has the greatest impact on the dugong population.\nVessel strikes have proved a problem for manatees, but the relevance of this to dugongs is unknown. Increasing boat traffic has increased danger, especially in shallow waters. Ecotourism has increased in some countries, although the effects remain undocumented. It has been seen to cause issues in areas such as Hainan due to environmental degradation. Modern farming practices and increased land clearing have also had an impact, and much of the coastline of dugong habitats is undergoing industrialization, with increasing human populations. Dugongs accumulate heavy metal ions in their tissues throughout their lives, more so than other marine mammals. The effects are unknown.\nWhile international cooperation to form a conservative unit has been undertaken, socio-political needs are an impediment to dugong conservation in many developing countries. The shallow waters are often used as a source of food and income, problems exacerbated by aid used to improve fishing. In many countries, legislation does not exist to protect dugongs, and if it does it is not enforced.\nOil spills are a danger to dugongs in some areas, as is land reclamation. In Okinawa, the small dugong population is threatened by United States military activity. Plans exist to build a military base close to the Henoko reef, and military activity also adds the threats of noise pollution, chemical pollution, soil erosion, and exposure to depleted uranium. The military base plans have been fought in US courts by some Okinawans, whose concerns include the impact on the local environment and dugong habitats. It was later revealed that the government of Japan was hiding evidence of the negative effects of ship lanes and human activities on dugongs observed during surveys carried out off Henoko reef. One of the three individuals has not been observed since June 2015, corresponding to the start of the excavation operations.\nEnvironmental degradation.\nIf dugongs do not get enough to eat they may calve later and produce fewer young. Food shortages can be caused by many factors, such as a loss of habitat, death and decline in the quality of seagrass, and a disturbance of feeding caused by human activity. Sewage, detergents, heavy metals, hypersaline water, herbicides, and other waste products all negatively affect seagrass meadows. Human activity such as mining, trawling, dredging, land reclamation, and boat propeller scarring also cause an increase in sedimentation which smothers seagrass and prevents light from reaching it. This is the most significant negative factor affecting seagrass.\n\"Halophila ovalis\"\u2014one of the dugong's preferred species of seagrass\u2014declines rapidly due to lack of light, dying completely after 30 days. Extreme weather such as cyclones and floods can destroy hundreds of square kilometres of seagrass meadows, as well as wash dugongs ashore. The recovery of seagrass meadows and the spread of seagrass into new areas, or areas where it has been destroyed, can take over a decade. Most measures for protection involve restricting activities such as trawling in areas containing seagrass meadows, with little to no action on pollutants originating from land. In some areas, water salinity is increased due to wastewater, and it is unknown how much salinity seagrass can withstand.\nDugong habitat in the Oura Bay area of Henoko, Okinawa, Japan, is currently under threat from land reclamation conducted by the Japanese Government in order to build a US Marine base in the area. In August 2014, preliminary drilling surveys were conducted around the seagrass beds there. The construction is expected to seriously damage the dugong population's habitat, possibly leading to local extinction.\nCapture and captivity.\nThe Australian state of Queensland has sixteen dugong protection parks, and some preservation zones have been established where even Aboriginal Peoples are not allowed to hunt. Capturing animals for research has caused only one or two deaths; dugongs are expensive to keep in captivity due to the long time mothers and calves spend together, and the inability to grow the seagrass that dugongs eat in an aquarium. Only one orphaned calf has ever been successfully kept in captivity.\nAs of 2018[ [update]] only three dugongs are held in captivity worldwide. A female from the Philippines lives at Toba Aquarium in Toba, Mie, Japan. A male also lived there until he died on 10 February 2011. The second resides in Sea World Indonesia, after having been rescued from a fisherman's net and treated. The last one, a male, is kept at Sydney Aquarium, where he has resided since he was a juvenile. Sydney Aquarium had a second dugong for many years, until she died in 2018.\nGracie, a captive dugong at Underwater World, Singapore, was reported to have died in 2014 at the age of 19, from complications arising from an acute digestive disorder.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also used in modern Microsoft operating systems as an alternate filename to the long filename, to provide compatibility with legacy programs. The filename convention is limited by the FAT file system. Similar 8.3 (and 6.3) file naming schemes have also existed on earlier CP/M, TRS-80, Atari, and some Data General and Digital Equipment Corporation minicomputer operating systems.\nOverview.\n8.3 filenames are limited to at most eight characters (after any directory specifier), followed optionally by a filename extension consisting of a period and at most three further characters. For systems that only support 8.3 filenames, excess characters are ignored. If a file name has no extension, a trailing has no significance (that is, and are equivalent). Furthermore, file and directory names are uppercase in this system, even though systems that use the 8.3 standard are usually case-insensitive (making equivalent to the name ). However, on non-8.3 operating systems (such as almost any modern operating system) accessing 8.3 file systems (including DOS-formatted floppy disks, but also including some modern memory cards and networked file systems), the underlying system may alter filenames internally to preserve case and avoid truncating letters in the names, for example in the case of VFAT.\nVFAT and computer-generated 8.3 filenames.\nVFAT, a variant of FAT with an extended directory format, was introduced in Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5. It allowed mixed-case Unicode long filenames (LFNs) in addition to classic 8.3 names by using multiple 32-byte directory entry records for long filenames (in such a way that old 8.3 system software will only recognize one as the valid directory entry).\nTo maintain backward-compatibility with legacy applications (on DOS and Windows 3.1), on FAT and VFAT filesystems, the operating system automatically generates an 8.3 filename for every LFN, through which the file can [also] be opened, renamed, or deleted, although the generated name (e.g. ) may show little similarity to the original. The generation of 8.3 filenames on NTFS filesystems can be turned off system-wide (with risks). The 8.3 filename can be obtained using the Kernel32.dll function GetShortPathName.\nAlthough there is no compulsory algorithm for creating the 8.3 name from an LFN, Windows uses the following convention:\nDuring the 2001 Microsoft antitrust case, the names MICROS~1 and MICROS~2 were humorously used to refer to the companies that might exist after a proposed split of Microsoft.\nNTFS, a file system used by the Windows NT family, supports LFNs natively, but 8.3 names are still available for legacy applications. Windows NTVDM are known to use 8.3 names. This can optionally be disabled system-wide to improve performance in situations where large numbers of similarly named files exist in the same folder. 8.3 filename creation can be disabled system-wide and/or per-volume, and existing 8.3 filenames can be stripped using or a Registry key.\nThe ISO 9660 file system (mainly used on compact discs) has similar limitations at the most basic Level 1, with the additional restriction that directory names cannot contain extensions and that some characters (notably hyphens) are not allowed in filenames. Level 2 allows filenames of up to 31 characters, more compatible with classic AmigaOS and classic Mac OS filenames.\nOn VFAT and NTFS file systems, 8.3 filenames are stored as ANSI encoding, for backward-compatibility.\nThe ReFS no longer supports 8.3 filenames.\nCompatibility.\nThis legacy technology is used in a wide range of products and devices, as a standard for interchanging information, such as compact flash cards used in cameras. VFAT LFN long filenames introduced by Windows 95/98/ME retained compatibility, but the VFAT LFN used on NT-based systems (Windows NT/2K/XP) uses a modified 8.3 shortname.\nIf a filename contains only lowercase letters, or is a combination of a lowercase \"basename\" with an uppercase \"extension\", or vice versa; and has no special characters, and fits within the 8.3 limits, a VFAT entry is not created on Windows NT and later versions such as XP. Instead, two bits in byte 0x0c of the directory entry are used to indicate that the filename should be considered as entirely or partially lowercase. Specifically, bit 4 means lowercase \"extension\" and bit 3 lowercase \"basename\", which allows for combinations such as or but not . Few other operating systems support this. This creates a backward-compatibility filename mangling problem with older Windows versions (95, 98, ME) that see all-uppercase filenames if this extension has been used, and therefore can change the capitalization of a file when it is transported, such as on a USB flash drive. This can cause problems for operating systems that do not exhibit the case-insensitive filename behavior as DOS and Windows do. Linux will recognize this extension when reading; the mount option \"shortname\" determines whether this feature is used when writing.\nFor MS-DOS, Henrik Haftmann's DOSLFN may be used.\nDirectory table.\nA directory table is a special type of file that represents a directory. Each file or directory stored within it is represented by a 32-byte entry in the table. Each entry records the name, extension, attributes (archive, directory, hidden, read-only, system and volume), the date and time of creation, the address of the first cluster of the file/directory's data and finally the size of the file/directory.\nLegal characters for DOS filenames include the following:\nThis excludes the following ASCII characters:\nThe DOS filenames are in the ASCII or in the code pages.\nCode 0xE5 as the first byte (see below) causes issues when extra-ASCII characters are used.\nDirectory entries, both in the Root Directory Region and in subdirectories, are of the following format:\nWorking with short filenames in a command prompt.\nSometimes it may be desirable to convert a long filename to a short filename, for example when working with the command prompt. A few simple rules can be followed to attain the correct 8.3 filename.\nTo find out for sure the SFN or 8.3 names of the files in a directory\nuse: shows the short names if there is one, and the long names.\nor: shows only the short names, in the original DIR listing format.\nIn Windows NT-based operating systems, the command prompt applet (cmd.exe) accepts long filenames with wildcard characters (question mark and asterisk ); long filenames with spaces in them need to be escaped (i.e. enclosed in single or double quotes).\nStarting with Windows Vista, console commands and PowerShell applets perform limited pattern matching by allowing wildcards in filenames and each subdirectory in the file path and silently substituting the first matching directory entry (for example, will change the current directory to ).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It supports a display resolution of pixels with 256 colors at 43.5\u00a0Hz (interlaced), or at 60\u00a0Hz (non-interlaced). 8514 usually refers to the display controller hardware (such as the 8514/A display adapter). However, IBM sold the companion CRT monitor (for use with the 8514/A) which carries the same designation, 8514.\nThe 8514 uses a standardised API called the \"Adapter Interface\" or AI. This interface is also used by XGA, IBM Image Adapter/A, and clones of the 8514/A and XGA such as the ATI Technologies Mach series and IIT \"AGX\". The interface allows computer software to offload common 2D-drawing operations (line-draw, color-fill, and block copies via a blitter) onto the 8514 hardware. This frees the host CPU for other tasks, and greatly improves the speed of redrawing a graphics visual (such as a pie-chart or CAD-illustration).\nThe 8514 initially sold for $1290 for the adapter and $270 for the 512KB memory expansion (equivalent to $ and $, respectively, in 2024). The 8514/A required a Micro Channel architecture bus at a time when ISA systems were standard.\nHistory.\nThe 8514 was introduced with the IBM PS/2 computers in April 1987. It was an optional upgrade to the Micro Channel architecture based PS/2's Video Graphics Array (VGA), and was delivered within three months of PS/2's introduction.\nAlthough not the first PC video card to support hardware acceleration, IBM's 8514 is often credited as the first PC mass-market fixed-function accelerator. Up until the 8514's introduction, PC graphics acceleration was relegated to expensive workstation-class, graphics coprocessor boards. Coprocessor boards (such as the TARGA Truevision series) were designed around special CPU or digital signal processor chips which were programmable. Fixed-function accelerators, such as the 8514, sacrificed programmability for better cost/performance ratio.\nLater compatible 8514 boards were based on the Texas Instruments TMS34010 chip.\nEven though the 8514 was not a best-seller, it created a market for fixed-function PC graphics accelerators which grew exponentially in the early 1990s. \nThe \"ATI Mach 8\" and \"Mach 32\" chips were popular clones, and several companies (notably S3) designed graphics accelerator chips which were not register compatible but were conceptually very similar to the 8514/A.\nThe 8514 was superseded by IBM XGA. \nThe VESA Group introduced a common standardized way to access features like hardware cursors, Bit Block transfers (Bit Blt), off screen sprites, hardware panning, drawing and other functions with VBE/accelerator functions (VBE/AF) in August 1996.\nSoftware support.\nSoftware that supported this graphic standard:\nOutput capabilities.\nThe 8514 offered:\nLatter clone board offered additional resolutions:\nClones.\nIn the late 1980s, several companies cloned the 8514/A often for the ISA bus. Notable among those was Western Digital Imaging's \"PWGA-1\" (also known as the \"WD9500\" chip set), the Chips &amp; Technologies \"82C480\", and ATI's \"Mach8\" and later \"Mach32\" chips. In one way or another, the clones were all better than the original with more speed, enhanced drawing functionality and overall improved video mode selections. Clone support for non-interlaced modes at resolutions like 800\u00d7600 and 1280\u00d71024 was typical, and all clones had longer command queues for increased performance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of six species of sea lions. Its natural habitat ranges from southeast Alaska to central Mexico, including the Gulf of California. California sea lions are sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have a thicker neck, and a protruding sagittal crest. They mainly haul out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves. California sea lions feed on a number of species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by orcas and great white sharks.\nCalifornia sea lions have a polygynous breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories and try to attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. California sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, California sea lions spend much of their time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.\nCalifornia sea lions are particularly intelligent, can be trained to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to them. Because of this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are trained by the United States Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. To protect fish, the US states of Oregon and Washington engage in annual kill quotas of California sea lions.\nTaxonomy.\nThe California sea lion was described by Ren\u00e9 Primev\u00e8re Lesson, a French naturalist, in 1828. It is grouped with other sea lions and fur seals in the family Otariidae. Otariids, also known as eared seals, differ from true seals in having external ear flaps, and proportionately larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles. Along with the Galapagos sea lion and the extinct Japanese sea lion, the California sea lion belongs to the genus \"Zalophus\", which derives from the Greek words \"za\", meaning \"intensive\", and \"lophus,\" meaning \"crest\". This refers to the protruding sagittal crest of the males, which distinguishes members of the genus.\nTraditionally, the Galapagos sea lion and Japanese sea lion were classified as subspecies of the California sea lion. However, a genetic study in 2007 found that all three are in fact separate species. The lineages of the California and Japanese sea lion appear to have split off 2.2 million years ago during the Pliocene. The California sea lion differs from the Galapagos sea lion in its greater sexual dimorphism. The Steller sea lion is the closest extant relative of the \"Zalophus\" sea lions, being a sister taxon.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe California sea lion ranges along the western coast and islands of North America, from southeast Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The above-mentioned stocks are separated by the Ensenada Front. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and the mouth of the bay (Southern stock). The stock status of the California sea lions at the deep waters of the central bay has not been analyzed.\nVagrants can reach the north-western Pacific such as on the Commander Islands. Although several otariinae have been recorded around the Japanese archipelago in recent years, their exact origins are unclear.\nDuring the breeding season, California sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie closer to the water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly up the Columbia River. In 2004, a healthy California sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and half a mile from the San Joaquin River.\nAppearance, physiology, and movement.\nBeing sexually dimorphic, California sea lions differ in size, shape, and coloration between the sexes. Males can grow up to long and weigh around , while females are typically around and weigh around . The heaviest recorded male weighed . \nFemales and juveniles have a tawny brown pelage, although they may be temporarily light gray or silver after molting. The pelage of adult males can be anywhere from light brown to black, but is typically dark brown. The face of adult males may also be light tan in some areas. Pups have a black or dark brown pelage at birth. \nAlthough the species has a slender build, adult males have robust necks, chests, and shoulders. Adult males also have a protruding crest which gives them a \"high, domed forehead\"; it is tufted with white hairs. They also have manes, which are less developed than those of adult male South American and Steller sea lions. Both sexes have long, narrow muzzles.\nLocomotion.\nAs an otariid, the California sea lion relies on its foreflippers to propel itself when swimming. This form of aquatic locomotion, along with its streamlined body, effectively reduces drag underwater. Its foreflipper movement is not continuous; the animal glides in between each stroke. The flexibility of its spine allows the California sea lion to bend its neck backwards far enough to reach its hindflippers. This allows the animal to make dorsal turns and maintain a streamlined posture. When moving on land, the California sea lion is able to turn its hindflippers forward and walk on all fours. It moves the foreflippers in a transverse, rather than a sagittal, fashion. In addition, it relies on movements of its head and neck more than its hindflippers for terrestrial locomotion. California sea lions may travel at speeds of around , and can dive at depths of and for up to 9.9 minutes, though most dives are typically and last less than 3 minutes.\nSenses.\nCalifornia sea lions have color vision, though it is limited to the blue-green area of the color spectrum. This is likely an adaptation for living in marine coastal habitats. Sea lions have fairly acute underwater hearing, with a hearing range of 0.4\u201332 kHz. California sea lions rely on their whiskers or vibrissae for touch and detection of vibrations underwater. Compared to the harbor seal, the California sea lion's vibrissae are smoother and less specialized and thus perform less when following hydrodynamic trails, although they still perform well.\nEcology.\nDiet.\nCalifornia sea lions feed on a wide variety of seafood, mainly octopus, squid and fish, and sometimes clams. Commonly eaten fish and squid species include salmon, hake, Pacific whiting, anchovy, herring, rockfish, lamprey, dogfish, and market squid. They mostly forage near mainland coastlines, the continental shelf, and seamounts. They may also search along the ocean bottom. California sea lions may eat alone or in small to large groups, depending on the amount of food available. They sometimes cooperate with other predators, such as dolphins, porpoises, and seabirds, when hunting large schools of fish. California sea lions sometimes follow dolphins and exploit their hunting efforts. Adult females feed between from shore. Adult males may forage as far as from shore when water temperatures rise. They also have learned to feed on steelhead and salmon below fish ladders at Bonneville Dam and at other locations where fish must queue in order to pass through dams and locks that block their passage.\nPredation.\nCalifornia sea lions are preyed on by orcas and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions appear to be the more common food items for transient mammal-eating orcas pods. The California sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. California sea lions are also common prey for great white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both great white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack California sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. California sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.\nLife history.\nReproductive behavior and parenting.\nCalifornia sea lions breed gregariously between May and August, when they arrive at their breeding rookeries. When establishing a territory, the males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on the rookery for as long as possible. During this time, they will fast, relying on a thick layer of fat called blubber for energy. Size and patience allow a male to defend his territory more effectively; the bigger the male, the more blubber he can store and the longer he can wait. A male California sea lion usually keeps his territory for around 27 days. Females have long parturition intervals, and thus the males do not establish their territories until after the females give birth. Most fights occur during this time. After this, the males rely on ritualized displays (vocalizations, head-shaking, stares, bluff lunges, and so on) to maintain their territorial boundaries. Since temperatures can reach over during this time, males must include water within their territories. Some territories are underwater, particularly those near steep cliffs. California sea lions that fail to establish a territory are driven out to sea or gather at a nearby beach.\nBefore mating begins, females gather into \"milling\" groups of 2\u201320 individuals. The females in these groups will mount each other as well as the males. These groups begin to disintegrate as the females begin to mate. The territorial and mating system of the California sea lion has been described as similar to a lek system, as females appear to choose their mates while moving through different territories. They avoid males that are too aggressive or energetic. Males are usually unable to prevent females from leaving their territories, particularly in water. Mating may occur outside the rookeries, between non-territorial males and females, as the latter move to and from the mating site. In some rookeries, copulation may be monopolized by a few males, while at others, a single male may sire no more than four pups.\nFemale California sea lions have a 12-month reproductive cycle, consisting of a 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups onshore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups for up to a day. Pups left onshore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.\nCommunication.\nCalifornia sea lions communicate with a range of vocalizations. The most commonly used one is their characteristic bark. Territorial males are the loudest and most continuous callers, and barks are produced constantly during the peak of the breeding season. California sea lions bark especially rapidly when excited. The barks of territorial and non-territorial males sound similar, although those of the former are deeper. Males may bark when threatening other males or during courtship. The only other vocalization made by territorial males is a \"prolonged hoarse grunt sound\" made when an individual is startled by a human. This vocalization is also made by groups of non-reproductive males.\nFemale California sea lions are less vocal. Their barks, high-pitched and shorter than those made by males, are used in aggressive situations. Other aggressive vocalizations given by females include the \"squeal\", the \"belch\", and the \"growl\". The sound a female California sea lion gives when calling her pups is called a \"pup-attraction call\", described as \"loud\" and \"brawling\". Pups respond with a \"mother-response call\", which is similar in structure. Pups will also bleat or bark when playing or in distress. California sea lions can produce vocalizations underwater. These include \"whinny\" sounds, barks, buzzings, and clicks.\nNonbreeding activities.\nOutside the breeding season, males migrate to the northern ends of the species range to feed, while females forage near the breeding rookeries. California sea lions can stay at sea for as long as two weeks at a time. They make continuous dives, returning to the surface to rest. California sea lions may travel alone or in groups while at sea and haul-out between each sea trip. Adult females and juveniles molt in autumn and winter; adult males molt in January and February. California sea lions in the Gulf of California do not migrate; they stay in the Gulf of California year-round.\nIntelligence and trainability.\nMarine biologist Ronald J. Schusterman and his research associates have studied the California sea lions' cognitive ability. They have discovered that California sea lions are able to recognize relationships between stimuli based on similar functions or connections made with their peers, rather than only the stimuli's common features. California sea lions have demonstrated the ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language. However, California sea lions rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In 2011, a California sea lion named Ronan was recorded bobbing her head in synchronization to musical rhythms.\nThis \"rhythmic entrainment\" was previously seen only in humans, parrots and other birds possessing vocal mimicry.\nBecause of their intelligence and trainability, California sea lions have been used by circuses and marine mammal parks to perform various tricks such as throwing and catching balls on their noses, running up ladders, or honking horns in a musical fashion. Trainers reward their animals with fish, which motivates them to perform. For ball balancing, trainers toss a ball at a California sea lion so it may accidentally balance it or hold the ball on its nose, thereby gaining an understanding of what to do. A California sea lion may go through a year of training before performing a behavior for the public. However, its memory allows it to perform a behavior even after three months of resting. Some organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and World Animal Protection, object to using California sea lions and other marine mammals for entertainment, claiming the tricks are \"exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors\" and distract the audience from the animal's unnatural environment.\nThe California sea lion is used in military applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals can swim behind divers approaching a US naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say California sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. However, the Navy insists that California sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.\nStatus.\nThe IUCN lists the California sea lion as Least Concern due to \"its large and increasing population size.\" The estimated population is 238,000\u2013241,000 for the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, 75,000\u201385,000 for the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and 31,393 for the population in the Gulf of California. Off the Pacific coast of the United States, California sea lions are so numerous that they are close to carrying capacity, while the Gulf of California population declined by 20% by 2008. California sea lions may be killed when in conflict with fishermen, by poaching, and by entanglements in human-made garbage. They are also threatened by pollutants like DDT and PCB which accumulate in the marine food chain.\nIn the United States, the California sea lion is protected on the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), passed in 1972, which outlaws hunting, killing, capture, and harassment of the animal. In 1994 an amendment to the Act allowed for the possibility of limited lethal removal of pinnipeds preying on endangered salmonids should the level of predation be documented to have a significant adverse impact on the decline or recovery of ESA-listed salmonids. Applications have been granted for removal of several individual California sea lions at Ballard Locks and at the Bonneville Dam, where up to 92 California sea lions can be killed each year for a 5-year period. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted to ward off the sea lions using bombs, rubber bullets and bean bags. Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective.\nCritics have objected to the killing of the California sea lions, pointing out that the level of mortality permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon.\nThese animals exploit more human-made environments like docks for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting California sea lions which cause major tilting and other problems. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them.\n2015 Californian shore sea lions pups crisis.\nIn January and February 2015, 1450 malnourished or sick California sea lion pups were found along stretches of the California coast, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed to unprecedentedly warm Pacific coastal waters, related to Pacific decadal oscillation and El Ni\u00f1o, as the likely cause. Elevated water temperatures reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the California sea lion pup diet during nursery season. This caused many California sea lion pups to starve, while others died when they took to open waters in search of food at too early an age.\nSeveral months earlier, in the summer of 2014, a large number of Cassin's auklet chicks died during the fledging period due to similar circumstances brought about by elevated water temperatures.\nOregon and Washington state governments annual killings.\nIn November 2018, the State of Oregon obtained a permit to kill 93 California sea lions per year below Willamette Falls. Under a similar program, Oregon and Washington had killed over 150 California sea lions on the Columbia River by January 2019. In both cases, the purpose was to protect the local populations of fish (such as trout or salmon) from predation by the sea lions. In August 2020, the federal government authorized the states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho as well as six regional tribes to cull sea lions that preyed upon endangered species of fish in the Columbia River basin, allowing for the killing of up to 540 California sea lions and 176 Steller sea lions over the following five years. Between 2020 and April 2023, Oregon killed 99 sea lions as part of this program.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known above all for his \"Fables\", which provided a model for subsequent fabulists across Europe and numerous alternative versions in France, as well as in French regional languages.\nAfter a long period of royal suspicion, he was admitted to the \"Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise\" and his reputation in France has never faded since. Evidence of this is found in the many pictures and statues of the writer, later depictions on medals, coins and postage stamps.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nLa Fontaine was born at Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry close to the present-day north-eastern edge of \u00cele-de-France (Greater Paris) in France. His father was Charles de La Fontaine, (a kind of deputy-ranger) of the Duchy of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry. \nBoth his father and his mother, Fran\u00e7oise (n\u00e9e Pidoux) were of families of the highest provincial middle class; though they were not noble, his father was fairly wealthy.\nJean, the eldest child, was educated at the coll\u00e8ge (grammar school) of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, and at the end of his school days he entered the Oratory in May 1641, and the seminary of Saint-Magloire in October of the same year; but a very short sojourn proved to him that he had mistaken his vocation. He then apparently studied law, and is said to have been admitted as \"avocat\"/lawyer.\nFamily life.\nHe was, however, settled in life, or at least might have been so, somewhat early. In 1647 his father resigned his rangership in his favor, and arranged a marriage for him with Marie H\u00e9ricart, a girl of fourteen, who brought him 20,000 livres, and expectations. She seems to have been both beautiful and intelligent, but the two did not get along well together. There appears to be absolutely no ground for the vague scandal as to her conduct, which was, for the most part, raised long afterwards by gossip or personal enemies of La Fontaine. All that can be positively said against her is that she was a negligent housewife and an inveterate novel reader; La Fontaine himself was constantly away from home, was certainly not strict in point of conjugal fidelity, and was so bad a man of business that his affairs became involved in hopeless difficulty, and a financial separation of property (\"separation de biens\") had to take place in 1658. This was a perfectly amicable transaction for the benefit of the family; by degrees, however, the pair, still without any actual quarrel, ceased to live together, and for the greater part of the last forty years of de la Fontaine's life he lived in Paris while his wife remained in Ch\u00e2teau -Thierry which, however, he frequently visited. One son was born to them in 1653, and was educated and taken care of wholly by his mother.\nParis.\nEven in the earlier years of his marriage, La Fontaine seems to have been much in Paris, but it was not until about 1656 that he became a regular visitor to the capital. The duties of his office, which were only occasional, were compatible with this non-residence. It was not until he was past thirty that his literary career began. The reading of Malherbe, it is said, first awoke poetical fancies in him, but for some time he attempted nothing but trifles in the fashion of the time \u2013 epigrams, ballades, rondeaux, etc.\nHis first serious work was a translation or adaptation of the \"Eunuchus\" of Terence (1654). At this time the patron of French writing was the Superintendent Fouquet, to whom La Fontaine was introduced by Jacques Jannart, a connection of his wife's. Few people who paid their court to Fouquet went away empty-handed, and La Fontaine soon received a pension of 1000 livres (1659), on the easy terms of a copy of verses for each quarters receipt. He also began a medley of prose and poetry, entitled \"Le Songe de Vaux\", on Fouquet's famous country house.\nIt was about this time that his wife's property had to be separately secured to her, and he seems by degrees to have had to sell everything that he owned; but, as he never lacked powerful and generous patrons, this was of small importance to him. In the same year he wrote a ballad, \"Les Rieurs du Beau-Richard\", and this was followed by many small pieces of occasional poetry addressed to various personages from the king downwards. Fouquet fell out of favour with the king and was arrested. La Fontaine, like most of Fouquet's literary prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, showed some fidelity to him by writing the elegy \"Pleurez, Nymphes de Vaux\".\nJust at this time his affairs did not look promising. His father and he had assumed the title of esquire, to which they were not strictly entitled, and, some old edicts on the subject having been put in force, an informer procured a sentence against the poet fining him 2000 livres. He found, however, a new protector in the duke and still more in the Duchess of Bouillon, his feudal superiors at Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, and nothing more is heard of the fine.\nSome of La Fontaine's liveliest verses are addressed to the duchess Marie Anne Mancini, the youngest of Mazarin's nieces, and it is even probable that the taste of the duke and duchess for Ariosto had something to do with the writing of his first work of real importance, the first book of the \"Contes\", which appeared in 1664. He was then forty-three years old, and his previous printed productions had been comparatively trivial, though much of his work was handed about in manuscript long before it was regularly published.\nFame.\nIt was about this time that the quartet of the Rue du Vieux Colombier, so famous in French literary history, was formed. It consisted of La Fontaine, Racine, Boileau and Moli\u00e8re, the last of whom was almost of the same age as La Fontaine, the other two considerably younger. Chapelain was also a kind of outsider in the coterie. There are many anecdotes, some evidently apocryphal, about these meetings. The most characteristic is perhaps that which asserts that a copy of Chapelain's unlucky \"Pucelle\" always lay on the table, a certain number of lines of which was the appointed punishment for offences against the company. The coterie furnished under feigned names the personages of La Fontaine's version of the \"Cupid and Psyche\" story, which, however, with \"Adonis\", was not printed till 1669.\nMeanwhile, the poet continued to find friends. In 1664 he was regularly commissioned and sworn in as gentleman to the duchess dowager of Orl\u00e9ans, and was installed in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. He still retained his rangership, and in 1666 we have something like a reprimand from Colbert suggesting that he should look into some malpractices at Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry. In the same year appeared the second book of the \"Contes\", and in 1668 the first six books of the \"Fables\", with more of both kinds in 1671. In this latter year a curious instance of the docility with which the poet lent himself to any influence was afforded by his officiating, at the instance of the Port-Royalists, as editor of a volume of sacred poetry dedicated to the Prince of Conti.\nA year afterwards his situation, which had for some time been decidedly flourishing, showed signs of changing very much for the worse. The duchess of Orl\u00e9ans died, and he apparently had to give up his rangership, probably selling it to pay debts. But there was always a providence for La Fontaine. Madame de la Sabli\u00e8re, a woman of great beauty, of considerable intellectual power and of high character, invited him to make his home in her house, where he lived for some twenty years. He seems to have had no trouble whatever about his affairs thenceforward; and could devote himself to his two different lines of poetry, as well as to that of theatrical composition.\nAcademy.\nIn 1682 he was, at more than sixty years of age, recognized as one of the foremost men of letters of France. Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, one of the soundest literary critics of the time, and by no means given to praise mere novelties, had spoken of his second collection of \"Fables\" published in the winter of 1678 as divine; and it is pretty certain that this was the general opinion. It was not unreasonable, therefore, that he should present himself to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, and, though the subjects of his \"Contes\" were scarcely calculated to propitiate that decorous assembly, while his attachment to Fouquet and to more than one representative of the old Frondeur party made him suspect to Colbert and the king, most of the members were his personal friends.\nHe was first proposed in 1682, but was rejected for Marquis de Dangeau. The next year Colbert died and La Fontaine was again nominated. Boileau was also a candidate, but the first ballot gave the fabulist sixteen votes against seven only for the critic. The king, whose assent was necessary, not merely for election but for a second ballot in case of the failure of an absolute majority, was ill-pleased, and the election was left pending. Another vacancy occurred, however, some months later, and to this Boileau was elected. The king hastened to approve the choice effusively, adding, \"Vous pouvez incessamment recevoir La Fontaine, il a promis d'etre sage\".\nHis admission was indirectly the cause of the only serious literary quarrel of his life. A dispute took place between the academy and one of its members, Antoine Fureti\u00e8re, on the subject of the latter's French dictionary, which was decided to be a breach of the academy's corporate privileges. Fureti\u00e8re, a man of no small ability, bitterly assailed those whom he considered to be his enemies, and among them La Fontaine, whose unlucky \"Contes\" made him peculiarly vulnerable, his second collection of these tales having been the subject of a police condemnation. The death of the author of the \"Roman Bourgeois\", however, put an end to this quarrel.\nShortly afterwards La Fontaine had a share in a still more famous affair, the celebrated Ancient-and-Modern squabble in which Boileau and Charles Perrault were the chiefs, and in which La Fontaine (though he had been specially singled out by Perrault for better comparison with Aesop and Phaedrus) took the Ancient side. About the same time (1685\u20131687) he made the acquaintance of the last of his many hosts and protectors, Monsieur and Madame d'Hervart, and fell in love with a certain Madame Ulrich, a lady of some position but of doubtful character. This acquaintance was accompanied by a great familiarity with Vend\u00f4me, Chaulieu and the rest of the libertine coterie of the Temple; but, though Madame de la Sabli\u00e8re had long given herself up almost entirely to good works and religious exercises, La Fontaine continued an inmate of her house until her death in 1693. What followed is told in one of the best known of the many stories bearing on his childlike nature. Hervart on hearing of the death, had set out at once to find La Fontaine. He met him in the street in great sorrow, and begged him to make his home at his house. \"J'y allais\" was La Fontaine's answer.\nIn 1692, the writer had published a revised edition of the \"Contes\", although he suffered a severe illness. In that same year, La Fontaine converted to Christianity. A young priest, M. Poucet, tried to persuade him about the impropriety of the \"Contes\" and it is said that the destruction of a new play was demanded and submitted to as a proof of repentance. La Fontaine received the Viaticum, and the following years he continued to write poems and fables.\nA story is told of the young duke of Burgundy, F\u00e9nelon's pupil, who was then only eleven years old, sending 50 louis to La Fontaine as a present of his own motion. But, though La Fontaine recovered for the time, he was broken by age and infirmity, and his new hosts had to nurse rather than to entertain him, which they did very carefully and kindly. He did a little more work, completing his \"Fables\" among other things; but he did not survive Madame de la Sabli\u00e8re much more than two years, dying on 13 April 1695 in Paris, at the age of seventy-three. When the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery opened in Paris, La Fontaine's remains were moved there. His wife survived him nearly fifteen years.\nAnecdotes.\nThe curious personality of La Fontaine, like that of some other men of letters, has been enshrined in a kind of legend by literary tradition. At an early age his absence of mind and indifference to business gave a subject to G\u00e9d\u00e9on Tallemant des R\u00e9aux. His later contemporaries helped to swell the tale, and the 18th century finally accepted it; these anecdotes include: La Fontaine meeting his son, being told who he was, and remarking, \"Ah, yes, I thought I had seen him somewhere!\"; his insisting upon fighting a duel with a supposed admirer of his wife, and then cheerily imploring the same to visit at his house just as before; his going into company with his stockings wrong side out; &amp;c.\u2014with, for a contrast, other tales of his awkwardness and silence, if not positive rudeness, in company.\nIt ought to be remembered, as a comment on the unfavourable description by Jean de La Bruy\u00e8re, that La Fontaine was a special friend and ally of Benserade, La Bruyere's chief literary enemy. But after all deductions much will remain, especially when it is remembered that one of the chief authorities for these anecdotes is Louis Racine, a man who possessed intelligence and moral worth, and who received them from his father, La Fontaine's attached friend for more than thirty years. Perhaps the best worth recording of all these stories is one of the Vieux Colombier quartet, which tells how Moli\u00e8re, while Racine and Boileau were exercising their wits upon \"le bonhomme\" or \"le bon\" (by both which titles La Fontaine was familiarly known), remarked to a bystander, \"Nos beaux esprits ont beau faire, ils n'effaceront pas le bonhomme.\" They have not.\nWorks.\nThe numerous works of La Fontaine fall into three traditional divisions: the Fables, the Tales and the miscellaneous (including dramatic) works. He is best known for the first of these, in which a tradition of fable collecting in French verse reaching back to the Middle Ages was brought to a peak. Although these earlier works refer to Aesop in their title, they collected many fables from more recent sources. Among the foremost were Marie de France's \"Ysopet\" (1190) and Gilles Corrozet\u2019s \"Les Fables du tr\u00e8s ancien Esope, mises en rithme fran\u00e7oise\" (1542).\nThe publication of the twelve books of La Fontaine's \"Fables\" extended from 1668 to 1694. The stories in the first six of these derive for the most part from Aesop and Horace and are pithily told in free verse. Those in the later editions are often taken from more recent sources or from translations of Eastern stories and are told at greater length. The deceptively simple verses are easily memorised, yet display deep insights into human nature. Many of the lines have entered the French language as standard phrases, often proverbial. The fables are also distinguished by their occasionally ironical ambivalence. The fable of \"The Sculptor and the Statue of Jupiter\" (IX.6), for example, reads like a satire on superstition, but its moralising conclusion that \"All men, as far as in them lies,/Create realities of dreams\" might equally be applied to religion as a whole.\nThe second division of his work, the tales (\"Contes et nouvelles en vers\"), were at one time almost equally as popular and their writing extended over a longer period. The first were published in 1664 and the last appeared posthumously. They were particularly marked by their archly licentious tone.\nDepictions and legacy.\nWhile the Fables have an international reputation, celebration of their author has largely been confined to France. Even in his own lifetime, such was his renown, he was painted by three leading portraitists. It was at the age of 63, on the occasion of his reception into the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1684, that he was portrayed by Hyacinthe Rigaud. Nicolas de Largilli\u00e8re painted him at the age of 73, and a third portrait is attributed to Fran\u00e7ois de Troy (see below).\nTwo contemporary sculptors made head and shoulders busts of La Fontaine. Jean-Jacques Caffieri\u2019s was exhibited at the 1779 Salon and then given to the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise; Jean-Antoine Houdon\u2019s dates from 1782. There are in fact two versions by Houdon, one now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and another at the castle of his former patron Fouquet at Vaux-le-Vicomte (see below).\nIn Paris there is a full-length marble statue by Pierre Julien, now in the Louvre, that was commissioned in 1781 and exhibited at the 1785 Salon. The writer is represented in an ample cloak, sitting in contemplation on a gnarled tree on which a vine with grapes is climbing. On his knee is the manuscript of the fable of the fox and the grapes, while at his feet a fox is seated on his hat with its paw on a leather-bound volume, looking up at him. Small scale porcelain models were made of this by the S\u00e8vres pottery and in polychrome porcelain by the Frankenthal pottery. In the following century small models were made of the bronze statue by Etienne Marin Melingue, exhibited in Paris in 1840 and in London in 1881. In this the poet is leaning thoughtfully against a rock, hat in hand. Also in the Cour Napol\u00e9on of the Louvre is the 1857 standing stone statue by Jean-Louis Jaley.\nAnother commemorative monument to La Fontaine was set up at the head of the Parisian Jardin du Ranelagh in 1891. The bronze bust designed by Achille Dumil\u00e2tre was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889) before being placed on a high stone pedestal surrounded by various figures from the fables. The work was melted down, like many others during World War II, but was replaced in 1983 by Charles Correia's standing statue of the fabulist looking down at the fox and the crow on the steps and plinth below him.\nThere are more statues in Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, the town of the poet's birth. The most prominent is the standing statue by Charles-Ren\u00e9 Laiti\u00e9, which was ordered by command of Louis XVIII as a gift to the town. It was officially set in place in a square overlooking the Marne in 1824. During the Second Battle of the Marne it was damaged and was then moved about the town. Repaired now, its present position is in the square fronting the poet's former house. At his feet the race between the Tortoise and the Hare is taking place. The house itself has now been converted into a museum, outside which stands the life-sized statue created by Bernard Seurre. Inside the museum is Louis-Pierre Deseine\u2019s head and shoulders clay bust of La Fontaine.\nFurther evidence of La Fontaine's enduring popularity is his appearance on a playing card from the second year of the French Revolution. In this pack royalty is displaced by the rationalist free-thinkers known as Philosophes, and the ironical fabulist figures as the King of Spades. He was no less popular at the Bourbon Restoration, as is evidenced by the royal commission of his statue. Besides that, there was the 1816 bronze commemorative medal depicting the poet's head, designed by Jacques-\u00c9douard Gatteaux, in the Great Men of France series. More recently there has been a sideways seated view of him in the \"Histoire de France series\".\nThe head of La Fontaine also appeared on a 100 franc coin to commemorate the 300th anniversary of his death, on the reverse of which the fable of the fox and the crow is depicted. Another commemoration that year included the strip of 2.80 euro fable stamps, in the composite folder of which appeared a detachable portrait without currency. In 1995 equally, the asteroid 5780 Lafontaine was named in his honour.\nOther appearances on postage stamps include the 55 centimes issue of 1938, with a medallion of the fable of The Wolf and the Lamb below him; and the Monaco 50-cent stamp commemorating the 350th anniversary of La Fontaine's birth in 1971, in which the head and shoulders of the fabulist appear below some of the more famous characters about which he wrote. Another coin series on which he appears is the annual \"Fables de La Fontaine\" celebration of the (Chinese) lunar new year. Issued since 2006, these bullion coins have had his portrait on the reverse and on the face each year's particular zodiac animal.\nFictional depictions have followed the fashionable view of La Fontaine at their period. As a minor character in Alexandre Dumas's novel \"The Vicomte of Bragelonne\", he appears as a bumbling and scatterbrained courtier of Nicolas Fouquet. In the 2007 film \"Jean de La Fontaine \u2013 le d\u00e9fi\", however, the poet resists the absolutist rule of Louis XIV after the fall of Fouquet.\nLa Fontaine\u2019s legacy also includes songs by composers such as Eugenie Santa Coloma Sourget, who set his texts to music.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution"}

They include animals such as cetaceans, pinnipeds, sirenians, sea otters and polar bears. They are an informal group, unified only by their reliance on marine environments for feeding and survival.\nMarine mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Pinnipeds are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. Sea otters tend to live in kelp forests and estuaries. In contrast, the polar bear is mostly terrestrial and only go into the water on occasions of necessity, and are thus much less adapted to aquatic living. The diets of marine mammals vary considerably as well; some eat zooplankton, others eat fish, squid, shellfish, or seagrass, and a few eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.\nMarine mammals were first hunted by aboriginal peoples for food and other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to a sharp decline in all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting led to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow, sea mink, Japanese sea lion and Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than being hunted, marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where for example they can become entangled in nets and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade Arctic environments.\nTaxonomy.\nClassification of extant species.\nThe term \"marine mammal\" encompasses all mammals whose survival depends entirely or almost entirely on the oceans, which have also evolved several specialized aquatic traits. In addition to the above, several other mammals have a great dependency on the sea without having become so anatomically specialized, otherwise known as \"quasi-marine mammals\". This term can include: the greater bulldog bat (\"Noctilio leporinus\"), the fish-eating bat (\"Myotis vivesi\"), the arctic fox (\"Vulpes lagopus\") which often scavenges polar bear kills, coastal gray wolf (\"Canis lupus\") populations which predominantly eat salmon and marine carcasses, the North Ronaldsay sheep (\"Ovis aries\") which normally eats seaweed outside the lambing season, the Eurasian otter (\"Lutra lutra\") which is usually found in freshwater but can be found along coastal Scotland, and others.\nEvolution.\nMarine mammals form a diverse group of 129 species that rely on the ocean for their existence. They are an informal group unified only by their reliance on marine environments for feeding. Despite the diversity in anatomy seen between groups, improved foraging efficiency has been the main driver in their evolution. The level of dependence on the marine environment varies considerably with species. For example, dolphins and whales are completely dependent on the marine environment for all stages of their life; seals feed in the ocean but breed on land; and polar bears must feed on land.\nThe cetaceans became aquatic around 50\u00a0million years ago (mya). Based on molecular and morphological research, the cetaceans genetically and morphologically fall firmly within the Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). The term \"Cetartiodactyla\" reflects the idea that whales evolved within the ungulates. The term was coined by merging the name for the two orders, Cetacea and Artiodactyla, into a single word. Under this definition, the closest living land relative of the whales and dolphins is thought to be the hippopotamuses.\nSirenians, the sea cows, became aquatic around 40\u00a0million years ago. The first appearance of sirenians in the fossil record was during the early Eocene, and by the late Eocene, sirenians had significantly diversified. Inhabitants of rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters, they were able to spread rapidly. The most primitive sirenian, \u2020\"Prorastomus\", was found in Jamaica, unlike other marine mammals which originated from the Old World (such as cetaceans). The first known quadrupedal sirenian was \u2020\"Pezosiren\" from the early middle Eocene. The earliest known sea cows, of the families \u2020Prorastomidae and \u2020Protosirenidae, were both confined to the Eocene, and were pig-sized, four-legged, amphibious creatures. The first members of Dugongidae appeared by the middle Eocene. At this point, sea cows were fully aquatic.\nPinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 mya during the Eocene. Their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of \u2020\"Puijila darwini\" in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, \u2020\"Puijila\" had a long tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers. The lineages of Otariidae (eared seals) and Odobenidae (walrus) split almost 28 mya. Phocids (earless seals) are known to have existed for at least 15 mya, and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae (monk seals) and Phocinae lineages 22 mya.\nFossil evidence indicates the sea otter (\"Enhydra\") lineage became isolated in the North Pacific approximately two mya, giving rise to the now-extinct \u2020\"Enhydra macrodonta\" and the modern sea otter, \"Enhydra lutris\". The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaid\u014d and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to marine life. In some respects though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.\nPolar bears are thought to have diverged from a population of brown bears, \"Ursus arctos\", that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula). The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000-to-110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the polar bear diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts.\nIn general, terrestrial amniote invasions of the sea have become more frequent in the Cenozoic than they were in the Mesozoic. Factors contributing to this trend include the increasing productivity of near-shore marine environments, and the role of endothermy in facilitating this transition.\nDistribution and habitat.\nMarine mammals are widely distributed throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. Species richness peaks at around 40\u00b0 latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to the highest levels of primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size is a result of the different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between marine mammal species richness and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.\nMost marine mammals, such as seals and sea otters, inhabit the coast. Seals, however, also use a number of terrestrial habitats, both continental and island. In temperate and tropical areas, they haul-out on to sandy and pebble beaches, rocky shores, shoals, mud flats, tide pools and in sea caves. Some species also rest on man-made structures, like piers, jetties, buoys and oil platforms. Seals may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation, and may even climb cliffs. Most cetaceans live in the open ocean, and species like the sperm whale may dive to depths of in search of food. Sirenians live in shallow coastal waters, usually living below sea level. However, they have been known to dive to to forage deep-water seagrasses. Sea otters live in protected areas, such as rocky shores, kelp forests, and barrier reefs, although they may reside among drift ice or in sandy, muddy, or silty areas.\nMany marine mammals seasonally migrate. Annual ice contains areas of water that appear and disappear throughout the year as the weather changes, and seals migrate in response to these changes. In turn, polar bears must follow their prey. In Hudson Bay, James Bay, and some other areas, the ice melts completely each summer (an event often referred to as \"ice-floe breakup\"), forcing polar bears to go onto land and wait through the months until the next freeze-up. In the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, polar bears retreat each summer to the ice further north that remains frozen year-round. Seals may also migrate to other environmental changes, such as El Ni\u00f1o, and traveling seals may use various features of their environment to reach their destination including geomagnetic fields, water and wind currents, the position of the sun and moon and the taste and temperature of the water. Baleen whales famously migrate very long distances into tropical waters to give birth and raise young, possibly to prevent predation by killer whales. The gray whale has the longest recorded migration of any mammal, with one traveling from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Baja Peninsula. During the winter, manatees living at the northern end of their range migrate to warmer waters.\nAdaptations.\nMarine mammals have a number of physiological and anatomical features to overcome the unique challenges associated with aquatic living. Some of these features are very species-specific. Marine mammals have developed a number of features for efficient locomotion such as torpedo-shaped bodies to reduce drag; modified limbs for propulsion and steering; tail flukes and dorsal fins for propulsion and balance. Marine mammals are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber, circulatory adjustments (counter-current heat exchange); and reduced appendages, and large size to prevent heat loss.\nMarine mammals are able to dive for long periods. Both pinnipeds and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems pushing large volumes of blood rich in myoglobin and hemoglobin, which serve to store greater quantities of oxygen. Other important reservoirs include muscles and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted (hypoxia), marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis.\nSound travels differently through water, and therefore marine mammals have developed adaptations to ensure effective communication, prey capture, and predator detection. The most notable adaptation is the development of echolocation in whales and dolphins. Toothed whales emit a focused beam of high-frequency clicks in the direction that their head is pointing. Sounds are generated by passing air from the bony nares through the phonic lips. These sounds are reflected by the dense concave bone of the cranium and an air sac at its base. The focused beam is modulated by a large fatty organ known as the 'melon'. This acts like an acoustic lens because it is composed of lipids of differing densities.\nMarine mammals have evolved a wide variety of features for feeding, which are mainly seen in their dentition. For example, the cheek teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid. In contrast, baleen whales have evolved baleen plates to filter feed plankton and small fish from the water.\nPolar bears, otters, and fur seals have long, oily, and waterproof fur in order to trap air to provide insulation. In contrast, other marine mammals\u2014such as whales, dolphins, porpoises, manatees, dugongs, and walruses\u2014have lost long fur in favor of a thick, dense epidermis and a thickened fat layer (blubber) to prevent drag. Wading and bottom-feeding animals (such as manatees) need to be heavier than water in order to keep contact with the floor or to stay submerged. Surface-living animals (such as sea otters) need the opposite, and free-swimming animals living in open waters (such as dolphins) need to be neutrally buoyant in order to be able to swim up and down the water column. Typically, thick and dense bone is found in bottom feeders and low bone density is associated with mammals living in deep water. Some marine mammals, such as polar bears and otters, have retained four weight-bearing limbs and can walk on land like fully terrestrial animals.\nEcology.\nDietary.\nAll cetaceans are carnivorous and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with other kinds of animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Orcas and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Killer whales have been known to paralyze great white sharks and other sharks and rays by flipping them upside down. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora similar to that of terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.\nBaleen whales use their baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, out of the water; there are two types of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the original volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.\nOtters are the only marine animals that are capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.\nPinnipeds mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and warm-blooded prey (like sea birds). Most species are generalist feeders, but a few are specialists. They typically hunt non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey when in groups. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.\nThe polar bear is the most carnivorous species of bear, and its diet primarily consists of ringed (\"Pusa hispida\") and bearded (\"Erignathus barbatus\") seals. Polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air; they only rarely catch seals on land or in open water. The polar bear's most common hunting method is still-hunting: The bear locates a seal breathing hole using its sense of smell, and crouches nearby for a seal to appear. When the seal exhales, the bear smells its breath, reaches into the hole with a forepaw, and drags it out onto the ice. The polar bear also hunts by stalking seals resting on the ice. Upon spotting a seal, it walks to within , and then crouches. If the seal does not notice, the bear creeps to within of the seal and then suddenly rushes to attack. A third hunting method is to raid the birth lairs that female seals create in the snow. They may also feed on fish.\nSirenians are referred to as \"sea cows\" because their diet consists mainly of seagrass. When eating, they ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although when this is impossible they feed on just the leaves. A wide variety of seagrass has been found in dugong stomach contents, and evidence exists they will eat algae when seagrass is scarce. West Indian manatees eat up to 60 different species of plants, as well as fish and small invertebrates to a lesser extent.\nKeystone species.\nSea otters are a classic example of a keystone species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. They keep the population of certain benthic (sea floor) herbivores, particularly sea urchins, in check. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest. Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California. However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.\nAn apex predator affects prey population dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (\"Vulpes lagopus\") and glaucous gulls (\"Larus hyperboreus\"), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears is so close that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, where there is no major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.\nKiller whales are apex predators throughout their global distribution, and can have a profound effect on the behavior and population of prey species. Their diet is very broad and they can feed on many vertebrates in the ocean including salmon, rays, sharks (even white sharks), large baleen whales, and nearly 20 species of pinniped. The predation of whale calves may be responsible for annual whale migrations to calving grounds in more tropical waters, where the population of killer whales is much lower than in polar waters. Prior to whaling, it is thought that great whales were a major food source; however, after their sharp decline, killer whales have since expanded their diet, leading to the decline of smaller marine mammals. A decline in Aleutian Islands sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbor seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now reduced by industrial whaling.\nWhale pump.\nA 2010 study considered whales to be a positive influence to the productivity of ocean fisheries, in what has been termed a \"whale pump\". Whales carry nutrients such as nitrogen from the depths back to the surface. This functions as an upward biological pump, reversing an earlier presumption that whales accelerate the loss of nutrients to the bottom. This nitrogen input in the Gulf of Maine is more than the input of all rivers combined emptying into the gulf, some each year.\nWhales defecate at the ocean's surface; their excrement is important for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen. The whale feces are liquid and instead of sinking, they stay at the surface where phytoplankton feed off it.\nUpon death, whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep-sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots, such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents. Deterioration of whale carcasses happens through a series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms, such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge soft tissue at a rapid rate over a period of months to as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulphide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.\nInteractions with humans.\nThreats.\nDue to the difficulty to survey populations, 38% of marine mammals are data deficient, especially around the Antarctic Polar Front. In particular, declines in the populations of completely marine mammals tend to go unnoticed 70% of the time.\nExploitation.\nMarine mammals were hunted by coastal aboriginal humans historically for food and other resources. These subsistence hunts still occur in Canada, Greenland, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, and several nations in the Caribbean. The effects of these are only localized, as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Commercial hunting took this to a much greater scale and marine mammals were heavily exploited. This led to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (\"Hydrodamalis gigas\"), sea mink (\"Neogale macrodon\"), Japanese sea lion (\"Zalophus japonicus\"), and the Caribbean monk seal (\"Neomonachus tropicalis\"). Today, populations of species that were historically hunted, such as blue whales (\"Balaenoptera musculus\") and the North Pacific right whale (\"Eubalaena japonica\"), are much lower than their pre-whaling levels. Because whales generally have slow growth rates, are slow to reach sexual maturity, and have a low reproductive output, population recovery has been very slow.\nA number of whales are still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling set under the terms of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). There are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke whales are harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.\nThe most profitable furs in the fur trade were those of sea otters, especially the northern sea otter which inhabited the coastal waters between the Columbia River to the south and Cook Inlet to the north. The fur of the Californian southern sea otter was less highly prized and thus less profitable. After the northern sea otter was hunted to local extinction, maritime fur traders shifted to California until the southern sea otter was likewise nearly extinct. The British and American maritime fur traders took their furs to the Chinese port of Guangzhou (Canton), where they worked within the established Canton System. Furs from Russian America were mostly sold to China via the Mongolian trading town of Kyakhta, which had been opened to Russian trade by the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta.\nCommercial sealing was historically just as important as the whaling industry. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced the length of the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and remains only in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.\nPolar bears can be hunted for sport in Canada with a special permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an important source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.\nOcean traffic and fisheries.\nBy-catch is the incidental capture of non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds are most vulnerable as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.\nVessel strikes cause death for a number of marine mammals, especially whales. In particular, fast commercial vessels such as container ships can cause major injuries or death when they collide with marine mammals. Collisions occur both with large commercial vessels and recreational boats and cause injury to whales or smaller cetaceans. The critically endangered North Atlantic right whale is particularly affected by vessel strikes. Tourism boats designed for whale and dolphin watching can also negatively impact on marine mammals by interfering with their natural behavior.\nThe fishery industry not only threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large-scale fisheries have led to the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated in a number of areas in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.\nShellfish aquaculture takes up space so in effect creates competition for space. However, there is little direct competition for aquaculture shellfish harvest. On the other hand, marine mammals regularly take finfish from farms, which creates significant problems for marine farmers. While there are usually legal mechanisms designed to deter marine mammals, such as anti-predator nets or harassment devices, individuals are often illegally shot.\nHabitat loss and degradation.\nHabitat degradation is caused by a number of human activities. Marine mammals that live in coastal environments are the most likely to be affected by habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.\nContaminants that are discharged into the marine environment accumulate in the bodies of marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that are found in the tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.\nNoise pollution from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This is a problem because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used for a variety of purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.\nTwo changes to the global atmosphere due to anthropogenic activity threaten marine mammals. The first is increases in ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion, and this mainly affects the Antarctic and other areas of the Southern Hemisphere. An increase in ultraviolet radiation has the capacity to decrease phytoplankton abundance, which forms the basis of the food chain in the ocean. The second effect of global climate change is global warming due to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Raised sea levels, rising sea temperatures and changed currents are expected to affect marine mammals by altering the distribution of important prey species, and changing the suitability of breeding sites and migratory routes. The Arctic food chain would be disrupted by the near extinction or migration of polar bears. Arctic sea ice is the polar bear's habitat. It has been declining at a rate of 13% per decade because the temperature is rising at twice the rate of the rest of the world. By the year 2050, up to two-thirds of the world's polar bears may vanish if the sea ice continues to melt at its current rate.\nA study by evolutionary biologists at the University of Pittsburgh showed that the ancestors of many marine mammals stopped producing a certain enzyme that today protects against some neurotoxic chemicals called organophosphates, including those found in the widely used pesticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon. Marine mammals may be increasingly exposed to these compounds due to agricultural runoff reaching the world's oceans.\nProtection.\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) was passed on October 21, 1972, under president Richard Nixon to prevent the further depletion and possible extinction of marine mammal stocks. It prohibits the taking (\"the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such\") of any marine mammal without a permit issued by the Secretary. Authority to manage the MMPA was divided between the Secretary of the Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), and the Secretary of Commerce, which is delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and NOAA to better implement the MMPA. The Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of sea otters and marine otters, walruses, polar bears, the three species of manatees, and dugongs; and NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds (excluding walruses) and cetaceans.\nThe Act was updated on 1 January 2016 with a clause banning \"the import of fish from fisheries that cannot prove they meet US standards for protecting marine mammals\". The requirement to show that protection standards are met is hoped to compel countries exporting fish to the US to more strictly control their fisheries that no protected marine mammals are adversely affected by fishing.\nThe 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) is the only global organization that conserves a broad range of animals, which includes marine mammals. Of the agreements made, three of them deal with the conservation of marine mammals: ACCOBAMS, ASCOBANS and the Wadden Sea Agreement. In 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) adopted a pollution prevention approach to conservation, which many other conventions at the time also adopted.\nThe Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic area (ACCOBAMS), founded in 1996, specifically protects cetaceans in the Mediterranean area, and \"maintains a favorable status\", a direct action against whaling. There are 23 member states.\nThe Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic and North Seas (ASCOBANS) was adopted alongside ACCOBAMS to establish a special protection area for Europe's increasingly threatened cetaceans. Other anti-whaling efforts include a ten-year moratorium in 1986 by the IWC on all whaling, and an environmental agreement (a type of international law) the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which controlled commercial, scientific and subsistence whaling.\nThe Agreement on the Conservation of Seals in the Wadden Sea, enforced in 1991, prohibits the killing or harassment of seals in the Wadden Sea, specifically targeting the harbor seal population.\nThe 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears between Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway (Svalbard), the United States and the Soviet Union outlawed the unregulated hunting of polar bears from aircraft and icebreakers, as well as protecting migration, feeding and hibernation sites.\nVarious non-governmental organizations participate in marine conservation activism, wherein they draw attention to and aid in various problems in marine conservation, such as pollution, whaling, bycatch, and so forth. Notable organizations include the Greenpeace who focus on overfishing and whaling among other things, and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society who are known for taking direct-action tactics to expose illegal activity.\nAs food.\nFor thousands of years, indigenous peoples of the Arctic have depended on whale meat and seal meat. The meat is harvested from legal, non-commercial hunts that occur twice a year in the spring and autumn. The meat is stored and eaten throughout the winter. The skin and blubber (muktuk) taken from the bowhead, beluga, or narwhal is also valued, and is eaten raw or cooked. Whaling has also been practiced in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic since about the time of the first Norse settlements on the islands. Around 1,000 long-finned pilot whales are still killed annually, mainly during the summer. Today, dolphin meat is consumed in a small number of countries worldwide, which include Japan and Peru (where it is referred to as \"chancho marino\", or \"sea pork\"). In some parts of the world, such as Taiji (in Japan) and the Faroe Islands, dolphins are traditionally considered food, and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts.\nThere have been human health concerns associated with the consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of methylmercury. There are no known cases of mercury poisoning as a result of consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis. Similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Faroe Islands population was exposed to methylmercury largely from contaminated pilot whale meat, which contained very high levels of about 2 mg methylmercury/kg. However, the Faroe Islands populations also eat significant amounts of fish. The study of about 900 Faroese children showed that prenatal exposure to methylmercury resulted in neuropsychological deficits at 7 years of age\u2014\u200a\nRinged seals were once the main food staple for the Inuit. They are still an important food source for the people of Nunavut and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. Seal meat is an important source of food for residents of small coastal communities. The seal blubber is used to make seal oil, which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada's raw seal oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores.\nIn captivity.\nAquariums.\nCetaceans.\nVarious species of dolphins are kept in captivity. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks and dolphinariums, such as SeaWorld. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train and have a long lifespan in captivity. Hundreds of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. The dolphin \"smile\" makes them popular attractions, as this is a welcoming facial expression in humans; however, the smile is due to a lack of facial muscles and subsequent lack of facial expressions.\nOrganizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation campaign against the practice of keeping cetaceans, particularly killer whales, in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60\u201390% of male killer whales. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their twenties. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70\u201380 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50\u201360 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Captive life is also stressful due to the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior, as well as restricting pool size. Wild killer whales may travel up to in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Dolphins are often trained to do several anthropomorphic behaviors, including waving and kissing\u2014behaviors wild dolphins would rarely do.\nPinnipeds.\nThe large size and playfulness of pinnipeds make them popular attractions. Some exhibits have rocky backgrounds with artificial haul-out sites and a pool, while others have pens with small rocky, elevated shelters where the animals can dive into their pools. More elaborate exhibits contain deep pools that can be viewed underwater with rock-mimicking cement as haul-out areas. The most common pinniped species kept in captivity is the California sea lion as it is abundant and easy to train. These animals are used to perform tricks and entertain visitors. Other species popularly kept in captivity include the grey seal and harbor seal. Larger animals like walruses and Steller sea lions are much less common. Pinnipeds are popular attractions because they are \"disneyfied\", and consequently, people often anthropomorphize them with a curious, funny, or playful nature.\nSome organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and World Animal Protection, object to keeping pinnipeds and other marine mammals in captivity. They state that the exhibits could not be large enough to house animals that have evolved to be migratory, and a pool could never replace the size and biodiversity of the ocean. They also oppose using sea lions for entertainment, claiming the tricks performed are \"exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors\" and distract the audience from the animal's unnatural environment.\nSea otter.\nSea otters can do well in captivity, and are featured in over 40 public aquariums and zoos. The Seattle Aquarium became the first institution to raise sea otters from conception to adulthood with the birth of Tichuk in 1979, followed by three more pups in the early 1980s. In 2007, a YouTube video of two cute sea otters holding paws drew 1.5\u00a0million viewers in two weeks, and had over 20\u00a0million views as of \u00a02015[ [update]]. Filmed five years previously at the Vancouver Aquarium, it was YouTube's most popular animal video at the time, although it has since been surpassed. Otters are often viewed as having a \"happy family life\", but this is an anthropomorphism.\nSirenians.\nThe oldest manatee in captivity was Snooty, at the South Florida Museum's Parker Manatee Aquarium in Bradenton, Florida. Born at the Miami Aquarium and Tackle Company on July 21, 1948, Snooty was one of the first recorded captive manatee births. He was raised entirely in captivity, and died at the age of 69. Manatees can also be viewed in a number of European zoos, such as the Tierpark in Berlin, the Nuremberg Zoo, in ZooParc de Beauval in France, and in the Aquarium of Genoa in Italy. The River Safari at Singapore features seven of them.\nMilitary.\nBottlenose dolphins and California sea lions are used in the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they would not be able to discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins) and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.\nThe use of marine mammals by the Navy, even in accordance with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for in accordance with accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60258", "revid": "45494756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60258", "title": "Sea lion", "text": "Subfamily of aquatic mammals\nSea lions are pinnipeds characterized by external ear flaps, long foreflippers, the ability to walk on all fours, short and thick hair, and a big chest and belly. Together with the fur seals, they make up the family Otariidae, eared seals. The sea lions have six extant and one extinct species (the Japanese sea lion) in five genera. Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, with the notable exception of the northern Atlantic Ocean. \nSea lions have an average lifespan of 20\u201330 years. A male California sea lion weighs on average about and is about long, while the female sea lion weighs and is long. The largest sea lions are Steller's sea lions, which can weigh and grow to a length of . Sea lions consume large quantities of food at a time and are known to eat about 5\u20138% of their body weight (about ) at a single feeding. Sea lions can move around in water and at their fastest they can reach a speed of about . Three species, the Australian sea lion, the Gal\u00e1pagos sea lion and the New Zealand sea lion, are listed as endangered.\nTaxonomy.\nSea lions are related to walruses and seals. Together with the fur seals, they constitute the family Otariidae, collectively known as eared seals. Until recently, sea lions were grouped under a single subfamily called Otariinae, whereas fur seals were grouped in the subfamily Arcocephalinae. This division was based on the most prominent common feature shared by the fur seals and absent in the sea lions, namely the dense underfur characteristic of the former. Recent genetic evidence, suggests \"Callorhinus\", the genus of the northern fur seal, is more closely related to some sea lion species than to the other fur seal genus, \"Arctocephalus\". Therefore, the fur seal/sea lion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many taxonomies.\nNonetheless, all fur seals have certain features in common: the fur, generally smaller sizes, farther and longer foraging trips, smaller and more abundant prey items, and greater sexual dimorphism. All sea lions have certain features in common, in particular their coarse, short fur, greater bulk, and larger prey than fur seals. For these reasons, the distinction remains useful. The family Otariidae (Order Carnivora) contains the 15 extant species of fur seals and sea lions. Traditional classification of the family into the subfamilies Arctocephalinae (fur seals) and Otariinae (sea lions) is not supported, with the fur seal \"Callorhinus ursinus\" having a basal relationship relative to the rest of the family. This is consistent with the fossil record which suggests that this genus diverged from the line leading to the remaining fur seals and sea lions about 6 million years ago (mya). Similar genetic divergences between the sea lion clades as well as between the major Arctocephalus fur seal clades, suggest that these groups underwent periods of rapid radiation at about the time they diverged from each other. The phylogenetic relationships within the family and the genetic distances among some taxa highlight inconsistencies in the current taxonomic classification of the family.\n\"Arctocephalus\" is characterized by ancestral character states such as dense underfur and the presence of double rooted cheek teeth and is thus thought to represent the most \"primitive\" line. It was from this basal line that both the sea lions and the remaining fur seal genus, \"Callorhinus\", are thought to have diverged. The fossil record from the western coast of North America presents evidence for the divergence of \"Callorhinus\" about 6 mya, whereas fossils in both California and Japan suggest that sea lions did not diverge until years later.\nPhysiology.\nDiving adaptations.\nThere are many components that make up sea lion physiology and these processes control aspects of their behavior. Physiology dictates thermoregulation, osmoregulation, reproduction, metabolic rate, and many other aspects of sea lion ecology including but not limited to their ability to dive to great depths. The sea lions' bodies control heart rate, gas exchange, digestion rate, and blood flow to allow individuals to dive for a long period of time and prevent side effects of high pressure at depth.\nThe high pressures associated with deep dives cause gases such as nitrogen to build up in tissues which are then released upon surfacing, possibly causing death. One of the ways sea lions deal with the extreme pressures is by limiting the amount of gas exchange that occurs when diving. The sea lion allows the alveoli to be compressed by the increasing water pressure thus forcing the surface air into cartilage lined airway just before the gas exchange surface. This process prevents any further oxygen exchange to the blood for muscles, requiring all muscles to be loaded with enough oxygen to last the duration of the dive. However, this shunt reduces the amount of compressed gases from entering tissues therefore reducing the risk of decompression sickness. \nThe collapse of alveoli does not allow for any oxygen storage in the lungs, however. This means that sea lions must mitigate oxygen use in order to extend their dives. Oxygen availability is prolonged by the physiological control of heart rate in sea lions. By reducing heart rate to well below surface rates, oxygen is saved by reducing gas exchange as well as reducing the energy required for a high heart rate. Bradycardia is a control mechanism to allow a switch from pulmonary oxygen to oxygen stored in the muscles which is needed when the sea lions are diving to depth. Another way sea lions mitigate the oxygen obtained at the surface in dives is to reduce digestion rate. Digestion requires metabolic activity and therefore energy and oxygen are consumed during this process; however, sea lions can limit digestion rate and decrease it by at least 54%. This reduction in digestion results in a proportional reduction in oxygen use in the stomach and therefore a correlated oxygen supply for diving. Digestion rate in these sea lions increases back to normal rates immediately upon resurfacing. \nOxygen depletion limits dive duration, but carbon dioxide (CO2) build-up also plays a role in the dive capabilities of many marine mammals. After a sea lion returns from a long dive, CO2 is not expired as fast as oxygen is replenished in the blood, due to the unloading complications with CO2. However, having elevated levels of CO2 in the blood does not seem to adversely affect dive behavior. Compared to terrestrial mammals, sea lions have a higher tolerance to storing CO2 which is what normally tells mammals that they need to breathe. This ability to ignore a response to CO2 is likely brought on by increased carotid bodies which are sensors for oxygen levels that let the animal know its available oxygen supply. Yet, the sea lions cannot avoid the effects of gradual CO2 build-up which eventually causes the sea lions to spend more time at the surface after multiple repeated dives to allow for enough built up CO2 to be expired.\nParasites and diseases.\nGalapagos sea lions (\"Zalophus wollebaeki\") can be infected with \"Philophthalmus zalophi\", an eye fluke. These infections have heavy impacts on the survival of juveniles. The disease appears to be compounded by global warming, as the number of infectious stages of different parasites species has a strong correlation with temperature change. The Galapagos Islands go through seasonal changes in sea surface temperatures, which consist of high temperatures from the beginning of January through the month of May and lower temperatures throughout the rest of the year. Parasites surfaced in large numbers when the sea temperature was at its highest. Furthermore, data published in 2015 was collected by capturing sea lions in order to measure and determine their growth rates. Their growth rates were noted along with the sightings of parasites which were found under the eyelid. The results were that sea lions are affected by the parasites from the early ages of 3 weeks old up until the age of 4 to 8 months. \nThe parasites found in the eye fluke did serious damage to the eye. From the data collected, 21 of the 91 survived; with a total of 70 deaths in just a span of two years. The parasites are attacking the pups at such young ages and causing the pups to not reach the age of reproduction. The death rates of the pups is surpassing the fertility rate by far. Since most pups are unable to reach the age of reproduction, the population is not growing fast enough to keep the species out of endangerment. Other parasites, like \"Anisakis\" and heartworm, can also infect sea lions.\nAustralian sea lions (\"Neophoca cinerea\") are also being affected by more frequent parasitic infections. The same method was used for the sea pups as on the Galapagos Islands, but in addition, the researchers in Australia took blood samples. The pups in Australia were being affected by hookworms, but they were also coming out in large numbers with warmer temperatures. New Zealand sea lion pups (\"Phocarctos hookeri\") were also affected in really early ages by hookworms (Uncinaria). The difference is that in New Zealand researchers took the necessary steps and began treatment. The treatment seemed to be effective on the pups who have taken it. They found no traces of this infection afterwards. However, the percentage of pups who do have it is still relatively high at about 75%. Those pups who were treated had much better growth rates than those who did not. Overall parasites and hookworms are killing off enough pups to place them in endangerment. Parasites affect sea pups in various areas of the world. Reproductive success reduces immensely, survival methods, changes in health and growth have also been affected.\nSimilarly, climate change has resulted in increased toxic algae blooms in the oceans. These toxins are ingested by sardines and other fish which are then eaten by the sea lions, causing neurological damage and diseases such as epilepsy.\nGene expressions and diet.\nGene expressions are being used more often to detect the physiological responses to nutrition, as well as other stressors. In a study done with four Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), three of the four sea lions underwent a 70-day trial which consisted of unrestricted food intake, acute nutritional stress, and chronic nutritional stress. Results showed that individuals under nutritional stress down-regulated some cellular processes within their immune response and oxidative stress. Nutritional stress was considered the most proximate cause of population decline in this species. In New Zealand sea lions, north-to south gradients driven by temperature differences were shown to be key factors in the prey mix. Adult California sea lions eat about 5% to 8% of their body weight per day ().\nCalifornia sea lions feed mainly offshore in coastal areas. They eat a variety of prey\u2014such as squid, anchovies, mackerel, rockfish, and sardines\u2014found in upwelling areas. They also may take fish from commercial fishing gear, sport fishing lines, and fish passage facilities at dams and rivers.\nGeographic variation.\nGeographic variation for sea lions have been determined by the observations of skulls of several Otariidae species; a general change in size corresponds with a change in latitude and primary productivity. Skulls of Australian sea lions from Western Australia were generally smaller in length whereas the largest skulls are from cool temperate localities. Otariidae are in the process of species divergence, much of which may be driven by local factors, particularly latitude and resources. Populations of a given species tend to be smaller in the tropics, increase in size with increasing latitude, and reach a maximum in sub-polar regions. In a cool climate and cold waters, there should be a selective advantage in the relative reduction of body surface area resulting from increased size, since the metabolic rate is related more closely to body surface area than to body weight.\nBreeding and population.\nBreeding methods and habits.\nSea lions, with three groups of pinnipeds, have multiple breeding methods and habits over their families but they remain relatively universal. Otariids, or eared sea lions, raise their young, mate, and rest in more earthly land or ice habitats. Their abundance and haul-out behavior have a direct effect on their on land breeding activity. Their seasonal abundance trend correlates with their breeding period between the austral summer of January to March. Their rookeries populate with newborn pups as well as male and female otariids that remain to defend their territories. At the end of the breeding period males disseminate for food and rest while females remain for nurturing. Other points in the year consist of a mix of ages and genders in the rookeries with haul-out patterns varying monthly.\nSteller sea lions, living an average of 15 to 20 years, begin their breeding season when adult males establish territories along the rookeries in early May. Male sea lions reach sexual maturity from ages 5 to 7 and do not become territorial until around 9 to 13 years of age. The females arrive in late May bringing in an increase of territorial defense through fighting and boundary displays. After a week births consist most usually of one pup with a perinatal period of 3 to 13 days.\nSteller sea lions have exhibited multiple competitive strategies for reproductive success. Sea lion mating is often polygamous as males usually mate with different females to increase fitness and success, leaving some males to not find a mate at all. Polygamous males rarely provide parental care towards the pup. Strategies used to monopolize females include the resource-defense polygyny, or occupying important female resources. This involves occupying and defending a territory with resources or features attractive to females during sexually receptive periods. Some of these factors may include pupping habitat and access to water. Other techniques include potentially limiting access of other males to females.\nPopulation.\n\"Otaria flavescens\" (South American sea lion) lives along the Chilean coast with a population estimate of 165,000. According to the most recent surveys in northern and southern Chile the sealing period of the middle twentieth century that left a significant decline in sea lion population is recovering. The recovery is associated with less hunting, otariids rapid population growth, legislation on nature reserves, and new food resources. Haul-out patterns change the abundance of sea lions at particular times of the day, month, and year. Patterns in migration relate to temperature, solar radiation, and prey and water resources. Studies of South American sea lions and other otariids document maximum population on land during early afternoon, potentially due to haul-out during high air temperatures. Adult and subadult males do not show clear annual patterns, maximum abundance being found from October to January. Females and their pups hauled-out during austral winter months of June to September.\nInteractions with humans.\nSouth American sea lions have been greatly impacted by human exploitation. During the late Holocene period to the middle of the twentieth century, hunter-gatherers along the Beagle Channel and northern Patagonia had greatly reduced the number of sea lions due to their hunting of the species and exploitation of the species' environment. Although sealing has been put to a halt, in many countries, such as Uruguay, the sea lion population continues to decline because of the drastic effects humans have on their ecosystems. As a result, South American sea lions have been foraging at higher tropical latitudes than they did prior to human exploitation. \nFishermen play a key role in the endangerment of sea lions. Sea lions rely on fish, like pollock, as a food source and have to compete with fishermen for it. When fishermen are successful at their job, they greatly reduce the sea lion's food source, which in turn endangers the species. Also, human presence and human recreational activities can cause sea lions to engage in violent and aggressive actions. When humans come closer than 15 meters of a sea lion, the sea lions' vigilance increases because of the disturbance of humans. These disturbances can potentially cause sea lions to have psychological stress responses that cause the sea lions to retreat, sometimes even abandon their locations, and decreases the amount of time sea lions spend hauling out. \nNew Zealand sea lions were also exploited from hunting and sealing, and as a result were extirpated from New Zealand's mainland for over 150 years, with their population being restricted to the subantarctic. In 1993, a female New Zealand sea lion gave birth on the mainland for the first time, and since then, they have slowly been recolonizing. These sea lions are the only pinnipeds that regularly move up to inland into forests. As consequence, they have been hit by cars on roads, deliberately killed, and been disturbed by dogs. Females need to move inland as a way to protect their pups, so roads, fences, residential areas, and private lands can inhibit their dispersal and breeding success. They have also adapted to commercial pine forests, and have given birth or nursed pups in residents' backyards and on golf courses. As one of the world's rarest sea lions, and an endangered and endemic species, efforts are being made to facilitate coexistence between them and humans.\nSea lion attacks on humans are rare, but when humans come within approximately , it can be very unsafe. In a highly unusual attack in 2007 in Western Australia, a sea lion leapt from the water and seriously mauled a 13-year-old girl surfing behind a speedboat. The sea lion appeared to be preparing for a second attack when the girl was rescued. An Australian marine biologist suggested that the sea lion may have viewed the girl \"like a rag doll toy\" to be played with. In San Francisco, where an increasingly large population of California sea lions crowds docks along San Francisco Bay, incidents have been reported in recent years of swimmers being bitten on the legs by large, aggressive males, possibly as territorial acts. In April 2015, a sea lion attacked a 62-year-old man who was boating with his wife in San Diego. The attack left the man with a punctured bone. In May 2017, a sea lion grabbed and pulled a girl into the water by her dress before retreating. The child was sitting on a pier side in British Columbia while tourists were illegally feeding the sea lions when the incident took place. She was pulled out of the water with minor injuries and received antibiotic prophylactic treatment for seal finger infection from the superficial bite injury.\nThere have also been documented events of sea lions assisting humans. One such notable instance of this is when Kevin Hines jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in a suicide attempt and was helped to stay afloat by a sea lion until he was rescued by the Coast Guard.\nSea lions have also been a focus of tourism in Australia and New Zealand. One of the main sites to view sea lions is in the Carnac Island Nature Reserve near Perth in Western Australia. This tourist site receives over 100,000 visitors, many of whom are recreational boaters and tourists, who can watch the male sea lions haul out on to the shore. They have sometimes been called \"the unofficial welcoming committee of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As with all ear seals, the males are significantly larger and heavier than the females. The males are dark brown in color, the females are lighter. In contrast to the other ear seals, the males do not have a clearly defined mane. In the Galapagos species the males weigh about 250\u00a0kg with a length of 250 to 270\u00a0cm, while the females weigh from 60 to 100\u00a0kg with a length of between 150 and 170\u00a0cm.\nThey have a streamlined body, with a layer of fat under the skin, to provide warmth and buoyancy. The coat is brown. They have large eyes that help compensate for low light levels in the underwater environment, while their whiskers increase their sense of touch. The nostrils close automatically once they touch the water. Their long front fins rotate outward for better movement on land, and propel them forward in the water, where they stay as long as possible.\nSystematics.\nFor a long time, specialists debated whether the 3 taxa that make up this genus were three full, monotypic species, or instead a single species with three subspecies; in the latter case, by priority, this species would be \"Zalophus californianus\".\nAs early as 1953, the zoologist Erling Sivertsen created a new indicative classification, after he investigated and catalogued again, in the Oslo Museum, skulls and archaeological remains, collected by the Norwegian expedition ship MK Norvegia between 1928 and 1929. Traditionally, the three populations were listed as subspecies of a common species, but this was controversial. Wilson &amp; Reeder classified the three populations as separate species. A molecular genetic study by Wolf et al. (2007) came to the same conclusion based on mitochondrial DNA and cell nucleus DNA SNPs. Furthermore, according to a molecular clock reconstruction, the Californian and Gal\u00e1pagos sea lions separated around 2.3 (\u00b1 0.5) million years ago.\nSpecies.\nIt includes these species, of which one became recently extinct:\nEcology.\nThese seals go to rest on the coasts. When looking for food, they dive up to 40 meters deep and prey on fish and octopus. During the breeding season, the males establish strictly guarded territories on the coasts and try to gain a harem from several females.\nThey feed on fish and mollusks. They are very sociable and are found in large groups, on cliffs, coasts, and even on human constructions, such as piers and navigation bowls.\nReproduction.\nUnlike fur seals (\"Arctocephalus\") which live in well-structured social groups, the species of the genus \"Zalophus\" form variable groups lacking in organization, although the males are also territorial and usually form harems of about fifteen females each. Males make loud sounds to mark territory. They usually mate between May and January depending on the species. Females give birth to only one young, which is born on land or water after a gestation that lasts between 342 and 365 days. They are the only mammals whose milk does not contain lactose. Females wean their young after 11 to 12 months, but some nurse their one-year-old pups alongside their newborns.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60260", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60260", "title": "Proper noun", "text": "Grammatical concept\nA proper noun is a noun that identifies a single entity and is used to refer to that entity (\"Africa\"; \"Jupiter\"; \"Sarah\"; \"Microsoft\") as distinguished from a common noun, which is a noun that refers to a class of entities (\"continent, planet, person, corporation\") and may be used when referring to instances of a specific class (a \"continent\", another \"planet\", these \"persons\", our \"corporation\"). Some proper nouns occur in plural form (optionally or exclusively), and then they refer to \"groups\" of entities considered as unique (the \"Hendersons\", the \"Everglades\", the \"Azores\", the \"Pleiades\"). Proper nouns can also occur in secondary applications, for example modifying nouns (the \"Mozart\" experience; his \"Azores\" adventure), or in the role of common nouns (he's no \"Pavarotti\"; a few would-be \"Napoleons\"). The detailed definition of the term is problematic and, to an extent, governed by convention.\nA distinction is normally made in current linguistics between \"proper nouns\" and \"proper names\". By this strict distinction, because the term \"noun\" is used for a class of single words (\"tree\", \"beauty\"), only single-word proper names are proper nouns: \"Peter\" and \"Africa\" are both proper names and proper nouns; but \"Peter the Great\" and \"South Africa\", while they are proper names, are not proper nouns. The term \"common name\" is not much used to contrast with \"proper name\", but some linguists have used it for that purpose. While proper names are sometimes called simply \"names\", this term is often used more broadly: \"An earlier name for tungsten was \"wolfram\".\" Words derived from proper names are occasionally called \"proper adjectives\" (or \"proper adverbs\", and so on), but not in mainstream linguistic theory. Not every noun phrase that refers to a unique entity is a proper name. For example, \"chastity\" is a common noun even though chastity is considered a unique abstract entity (constrasted with the personal name \"Chastity\", which is a proper name).\nFew proper names have only one possible referent: there are many places named \"New Haven\"; \"Jupiter\" may refer to a planet, a god, a ship, a city in Florida, or as part of the name of a symphony (\"the Jupiter Symphony\"); at least one person has been named \"Mata Hari\", as well as a racehorse, several songs, several films, and other objects; there are towns and people named \"Toyota\", as well as the company. In English, proper names in their primary application cannot normally be modified by articles or another determiner, although some may be taken to include the article \"the\", as in \"the Netherlands\", \"the Roaring Forties\", or \"the Rolling Stones\". A proper name may appear to have a descriptive meaning, even though it does not (the Rolling Stones are not stones and do not roll; a woman named \"Rose\" is not a flower). If it once had a descriptive meaning, it may no longer be descriptive; a location previously referred to as \"the new town\" may now have the proper name \"Newtown\" though it is no longer new and is now a city rather than a town.\nIn English and many other languages, proper names and words derived from them are associated with capitalization, but the details are complex and vary from language to language (French \"lundi\", \"Canada\", \"un homme canadien\", \"un Canadien\"; English \"Monday\", \"Canada\", \"a Canadian man\", \"a Canadian\"; Italian \"luned\u00ec\", \"Canada\", \"un uomo canadese\", \"un canadese\"). The study of proper names is sometimes called \"onomastics\" or \"onomatology\", while a rigorous analysis of the semantics of proper names is a matter for philosophy of language.\nOccasionally, what would otherwise be regarded as a proper noun is used as a common noun, in which case a plural form and a determiner are possible. Examples are in cases of ellipsis (\"the three Kennedys\" = \"the three members of the Kennedy family\") and metaphor (\"the new Gandhi\", likening a person to Mahatma Gandhi).\nProper names.\nCurrent linguistics makes a distinction between \"proper nouns\" and \"proper names\" but this distinction is not universally observed and sometimes it is observed but not rigorously. When the distinction is made, proper nouns are limited to single words only (possibly with \"the\"), while proper names include all proper nouns (in their primary applications) as well as noun phrases such as \"the United Kingdom\", \"North Carolina\", \"Royal Air Force\", and \"the White House\". Proper names can have a common noun or a proper noun as their head; \"the United Kingdom\" is a proper name with the common noun \"kingdom\" as its head, and \"North Carolina\" is headed by the proper noun \"Carolina\". Especially as titles of works, but also as nicknames and the like, some proper names contain no noun and are not formed as noun phrases (the 1979 film \"Being There\"; \"Hi De Ho\" as a nickname for Cab Calloway and as the title of a 1947 film about him).\nProper names are also referred to (by linguists) as \"naming expressions\". Sometimes they are called simply \"names\"; but that term is also used more broadly (as in \"\"chair\" is the name for something we sit on\"); \"common name\" is sometimes used, to make a distinction from \"proper name\".\nCommon nouns (like \"agency\", \"boulevard\", \"city\", \"day\", \"edition\") are frequently used as components of proper names. In such cases the common noun may determine the kind of entity, and a modifier determines the unique entity itself:\n(common-noun senses throughout)\n(in this sentence, \"Probe 17\" is the proper name of a vessel, and \"South Pole\" is a proper name referring to Earth's south pole)\n(the road that runs along the beach)\n(as a proper name, Beach Road may have nothing to do with the beach; it may be any distance from the waterfront)\n(no indication of the name of the university or its medical school)\nProper nouns, and all proper names, differ from common nouns grammatically in English. They may take titles, such as \"Mr Harris\" or \"Senator Harris\". Otherwise, they normally only take modifiers that add emotive coloring, such as \"old Mrs Fletcher, poor Charles\", or \"historic York\"; in a formal style, this may include \"the\", as in \"the inimitable Henry Higgins\". They may also take \"the\" in the manner of common nouns in order to establish the context in which they are unique: \"the young Mr Hamilton\" (not the old one), \"the Dr Brown I know\"; or as proper nouns to define an aspect of the referent: \"the young Einstein\" (Einstein when he was young). The indefinite article \"a\" may similarly be used to establish a new referent: \"the column was written by a [\"or\" one] Mary Price\". Proper names based on noun phrases differ grammatically from common noun phrases. They are fixed expressions, and cannot be modified internally: \"beautiful King's College\" is acceptable, but not \"King's famous College\".\nAs with proper nouns, so with proper names more generally: they may only be unique within the appropriate context. India has a ministry of home affairs (a common-noun phrase) called the Ministry of Home Affairs (its proper name); within the context of India, this identifies a unique organization. However, other countries may also have ministries of home affairs called \"the Ministry of Home Affairs\", but each refers to a unique object, so each is a proper name. Similarly, \"Beach Road\" is a unique road, though other towns may have their own roads named \"Beach Road\" as well. This is simply a matter of the pragmatics of naming, and of whether a naming convention provides identifiers that are unique; and this depends on the scope given by context.\nProper names and the definite article.\nBecause they are used to refer to an individual entity, proper names are by their very nature definite; so many regard a definite article as redundant, and personal names (like \"John\") are used without an article or other determiner. However, some proper names are normally used with the definite article. Grammarians divide over whether the definite article becomes part of the proper name in these cases, or \"precedes\" the proper name. \"The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language\" terms these \"weak proper names\", in contrast with the more typical \"strong proper names\", which are normally used without an article.\nEntities with proper names that use the definite article include geographical features (\"the Mediterranean\", \"the Thames\"), buildings (\"the Parthenon\"), institutions (\"the House of Commons\"), cities and districts (\"The Hague\", \"the Bronx\"), works of literature (\" the Bible\"), newspapers and magazines (\"The Times\", \"The Economist\", \"the New Statesman\"), and events (\"the '45\", \"the Holocaust\"). In standard use, plural proper names take the definite article (\"the Himalayas\", \"the Hebrides\"). Among the few exceptions are the names of certain bands (Heavy Metal Kids, L.A. Guns, Manic Street Preachers).\nHowever, if adjectives are used, they are placed after the definite article (\"the \"mighty\" Yangtze\"). When such proper nouns are grouped together, sometimes only a single definite article will be used at the head (\"\"the\" Nile, Congo, and Niger\"). And in certain contexts, it is grammatically permissible or even mandatory to drop the article.\nThe definite article is not used in the presence of preceding possessives (\"\"Da Vinci's\" Mona Lisa\", \"\"our\" United Kingdom\"), demonstratives (\"life in \"these\" United States\", \"\"that\" spectacular Alhambra\"), interrogatives (\"\"whose\" Mediterranean: Rome's or Carthage's?\"), or words like \"no\" or \"another\" (\"that dump is \"no\" Taj Mahal\", \"neo-Nazis want \"another\" Holocaust\").\nAn indefinite article phrase voids the use of the definite article (\"\"a\" restored Sistine Chapel\", \"\"a\" Philippines free from colonial masters\").\nThe definite article is omitted when such a proper noun is used attributively (\"\"Hague\" residents are concerned ...\", \"... eight pints of \"Thames\" water ...\"). If a definite article is present, it is for the noun, not the attributive (\"\"the\" Amazon \"jungle\", \"the\" Bay of Pigs \"debacle\"\").\nNouns of address with a proper name also have the article dropped (\"jump that shark, \"Fonz\"!\", \"\"O Pacific Ocean\", be pacific for us as we sail on you\", \"Go, \"Bears\"!\", \"\"U-S-A\"! \"U-S-A\"!\").\nOnly a single definite article is used where the construction might seem to require two (\"the 'The Matterhorn' at Disneyland is not the actual mountain of that name\"). In a grouping, a single definite article at the start may be understood to cover for the others (\"\"the\" Germany of Hitler, British Empire of Churchill, United States of Roosevelt, and Soviet Union of Stalin\").\nHeadlines, which often simplify grammar for space or punchiness, frequently omit both definite and indefinite articles. \nDefinite articles used in the title of a map might be omitted in labels within the map itself (Maldives, Sahara, Arctic Ocean, Andes, Elbe; though typically The Wash, The Gambia). It is also customary to drop the definite article in tables (of nations or territories with population, area, and economy, or of rivers by length).\nVariants.\nProper names often have a number of variants, for instance a formal variant (\"David\", \"the United States of America\") and an informal variant (\"Dave\", \"the United States\").\nCapitalization.\nIn languages that use alphabetic scripts and that distinguish lower and upper case, there is usually an association between proper names and capitalization. In German, all nouns are capitalized, but other words are also capitalized in proper names (not including composition titles), for instance: (the Great Bear, Ursa Major). For proper names, as for several other kinds of words and phrases, the details are complex, and vary sharply from language to language. For example, expressions for days of the week and months of the year are capitalized in English, but not in Spanish, French, Swedish, or Finnish, though they might still be considered proper names. Languages differ in whether most elements of multiword proper names are capitalized (American English has \"House of Representatives\", in which lexical words are capitalized) or only the initial element (as in Slovenian , \"National Assembly\"). In Czech, multiword settlement names are capitalized throughout, but non-settlement names are only capitalized in the initial element, though with many exceptions.\nHistory of capitalization.\nEuropean alphabetic scripts only developed a distinction between upper case and lower case in medieval times so in the alphabetic scripts of ancient Greek and Latin proper names were not systematically marked. They are marked with modern capitalization, however, in many modern editions of ancient texts.\nIn past centuries, orthographic practices in English varied widely. Capitalization was much less standardized than today. Documents from the 18th century show some writers capitalizing all nouns, and others capitalizing certain nouns based on varying ideas of their importance in the discussion. Historical documents from the early United States show some examples of this process: the end (but not the beginning) of the Declaration of Independence (1776) and all of the Constitution (1787) show nearly all nouns capitalized; the Bill of Rights (1789) capitalizes a few common nouns but not most of them; and the Thirteenth Constitutional Amendment (1865) capitalizes only proper nouns.\nIn Danish, from the 17th century until the orthographic reform of 1948, all nouns were capitalized.\nModern English capitalization of proper nouns.\nIn modern English orthography, it is the norm for recognized proper names to be capitalized. The few clear exceptions include \"summer\" and \"winter\" (contrast \"July\" and \"Christmas\"). It is also standard that most capitalizing of common nouns is considered incorrect, except of course when the capitalization is simply a matter of text styling, as at the start of a sentence or in titles and other headings. See Letter case \u00a7 Title case.\nAlthough these rules have been standardized, there are enough gray areas that it can often be unclear both whether an item qualifies as a proper name and whether it should be capitalized: \"the Cuban missile crisis\" is often capitalized (\"Cuban Missile Crisis\") and often not, regardless of its syntactic status or its function in discourse. Most style guides give decisive recommendations on capitalization, but not all of them go into detail on how to decide in these gray areas if words are proper nouns or not and should be capitalized or not.\nWords or phrases that are neither proper nouns nor derived from proper nouns are often capitalized in present-day English: \"Dr\", \"Baptist\", \"Congregationalism\", \"His\" and \"He\" in reference to the Abrahamic deity (God). For some such words, capitalization is optional or dependent on context: \"northerner\" or \"Northerner\"; \"aboriginal trees\" but \"Aboriginal land rights in Australia\". When \"the\" comes at the start of a proper name, as in \"the White House\", it is not normally capitalized unless it is a formal part of a title (of a book, film, or other artistic creation, as in \"The Keys to the Kingdom\").\nNouns and noun phrases that are not proper may be uniformly capitalized to indicate that they are definitive and regimented in their application (compare brand names, discussed below). \"Mountain Bluebird\" does not identify a unique individual, and it is not a proper name but a so-called common name (somewhat misleadingly, because this is not intended as a contrast with the term \"proper name\"). Such capitalization indicates that the term is a conventional designation for exactly that species (\"Sialia currucoides\"), not for just any bluebird that happens to live in the mountains.\nWords or phrases derived from proper names are generally capitalized, even when they are not themselves proper names. \"Londoner\" is capitalized because it derives from the proper name \"London\", but it is not itself a proper name (it can be limited: \"the Londoner\", \"some Londoners\"). Similarly, \"African\", \"Africanize\", and \"Africanism\" are not proper names, but are capitalized because \"Africa\" is a proper name. Adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and derived common nouns that are capitalized (\"Swiss\" in \"Swiss cheese\"; \"Anglicize\"; \"Calvinistically\"; \"Petrarchism\") are sometimes loosely called \"proper adjectives\" (and so on), but not in mainstream linguistics. Which of these items are capitalized may be merely conventional. \"Abrahamic\", \"Buddhist\", \"Hollywoodize\", \"Freudianism\", and \"Reagonomics\" are capitalized; \"quixotic\", \"bowdlerize\", \"mesmerism\", and \"pasteurization\" are not; \"aeolian\" and \"alpinism\" may be capitalized or not.\nSome words or some homonyms (depending on how a body of study defines \"word\") have one meaning when capitalized and another when not. Sometimes the capitalized variant is a proper noun (the \"Moon\"; dedicated to \"God\"; \"Smith\"'s apprentice) and the other variant is not (the third \"moon\" of Saturn; a Greek \"god\"; the \"smith\"'s apprentice). Sometimes neither is a proper noun (a \"swede\" in the soup; a \"Swede\" who came to see me). Such words that vary according to case are sometimes called capitonyms (although only rarely: this term is scarcely used in linguistic theory and does not appear in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\").\nBrand names.\nIn most alphabetic languages, proprietary terms that are nouns or noun phrases are capitalized whether or not they count as proper names. Not all brand names are proper names, and not all proper names are brand names.\nAlternative marking of proper names.\nIn non-alphabetic scripts, proper names are sometimes marked by other means.\nIn Egyptian hieroglyphs, parts of a royal name were enclosed in a cartouche: an oval with a line at one end.\nIn Chinese script, a proper name mark (a kind of underline) has sometimes been used to indicate a proper name. In the standard Pinyin system of romanization for Mandarin Chinese, capitalization is used to mark proper names, with some complexities because of different Chinese classifications of nominal types, and even different notions of such broad categories as \"word\" and \"phrase\".\nSanskrit and other languages written in the Devanagari script, along with many other languages using alphabetic or syllabic scripts, do not distinguish upper and lower case and do not mark proper names systematically.\nAcquisition and cognition.\nThere is evidence from brain disorders such as aphasia that proper names and common names are processed differently by the brain.\nThere also appear to be differences in language acquisition.\nAlthough Japanese does not distinguish overtly between common and proper names, two-year-old children learning Japanese distinguished between expressions for categories into which objects fall (common) and expressions referring to individuals (proper). When a previously unknown label was applied to an unfamiliar object, the children assumed that the label designated the class of object, regardless of whether the object was animate or inanimate. But if the object already had an established name, there was a difference between inanimate objects and animals: \nIn English, children employ different strategies depending on the type of referent but also rely on syntactic cues, such as the presence or absence of the determiner \"the\" to differentiate between common and proper nouns when first learned.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals), with 34 extant species and more than 50 extinct species described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic group (descended from one ancestor). Pinnipeds belong to the suborder Caniformia of the order Carnivora; their closest living relatives are musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks and red pandas), having diverged about 50\u00a0million years ago.\nSeals range in size from the and Baikal seal to the and southern elephant seal. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism. They have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not as fast in the water as dolphins, seals are more flexible and agile. Otariids primarily use their front limbs to propel themselves through the water, while phocids and walruses primarily use their hind limbs for this purpose. Otariids and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land. By comparison, terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more cumbersome. Otariids have visible external ears, while phocids and walruses lack these. Pinnipeds have well-developed senses\u2014their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have an advanced tactile system in their whiskers or vibrissae. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in cold water, and, other than the walrus, all species are covered in fur.\nAlthough pinnipeds are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend most of their lives in water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or to avoid ocean predators, such as sharks and orcas. Seals mainly live in marine environments but can also be found in fresh water. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; a few, such as the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), though the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.\nThe meat, blubber and skin of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, climate change and conflicts with local people.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"pinniped\" derives from the Latin words 'fin' and 'foot'. The common name \"seal\" originates from the Old English word , which is in turn derived from the Proto-Germanic .\nTaxonomy.\nThe German naturalist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger was the first to recognize the pinnipeds as a distinct taxonomic unit; in 1811 he gave the name Pinnipedia to both a family and an order. American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen reviewed the world's pinnipeds in an 1880 monograph, \"History of North American pinnipeds, a monograph of the walruses, sea-lions, sea-bears and seals of North America\". In this publication, he traced the history of names, gave keys to families and genera, described North American species and provided synopses of species in other parts of the world. In 1989, Annalisa Berta and colleagues proposed the unranked clade Pinnipedimorpha to contain the fossil genus \"Enaliarctos\" and modern seals as a sister group. Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and the suborder Caniformia (known as dog-like carnivorans). Of the three extant families, the Otariidae and Odobenidae are grouped in the superfamily Otarioidea, while the Phocidae belong to the superfamily Phocoidea. There are 34 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 fossil species of pinnipedimorphs.\nOtariids are also known as eared seals due to their pinnae. These animals swim mainly using their well-developed fore-flippers. They can also \"walk\" on land by shifting their hind-flippers forward under the body. The front end of an otariid's frontal bone protrudes between the nasal bones, with a large and flattened supraorbital foramen. An extra spine splits the supraspinatous fossa and bronchi that are divided in the front. Otariids consist of two types: sea lions and fur seals; the latter typically being smaller, with pointier snouts, longer fore-flippers and heavier fur coats. Five genera and seven species (one now extinct) of sea lion are known to exist, while two genera and nine species of fur seal exist. While sea lions and fur seals have historically been considered separate subfamilies (Otariinae and Arctocephalinae respectively), genetic and molecular evidence has refuted this, indicating that the northern fur seal is basal to other otariids and the Australian sea lion and New Zealand sea lion are more closely related to \"Arctocephalus\" than to other sea lions.\nOdobenidae has only one living member: the walrus. This animal is noticeable from its larger size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin, flattened snout and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, walruses can walk on land with their hind limbs. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind limbs for locomotion, while its forelimbs are used for steering. Also, it has no outer ears. The epipterygoid of the jaw is well developed and the back of the nasal bones are horizontal. In the feet, the calcaneuses protrude in the middle.\nPhocids are known as true or \"earless\" seals. These animals lack outer ears and cannot position their hind-flippers to move on land, making them more cumbersome. This is because of their massive ankle bones and flatter heels. In water, true seals rely on the side-to-side motion of their hind-flippers and lower body to move forward. The phocid's skull has thickened mastoids, puffed up entotympanic bones, nasal bones with a pointed tip in the back and a non-existent supraorbital foramen. The hip has a more converse ilium. A 2006 molecular study supports the division of phocids into two monophyletic subfamilies: Monachinae, which consists of elephant seals, monk seals and Antarctic seals; and Phocinae, which consists of all the rest.\nEvolution.\nOne popular hypothesis suggested that pinnipeds are diphyletic (descended from two ancestral lines), with walruses and otariids sharing a recent common ancestor with bears; and phocids sharing one with Musteloidea. However, morphological and molecular evidence support a monophyletic origin. A 2021 genetic study found that pinnipeds are more closely related to musteloids. Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50\u00a0million years ago (mya) during the Eocene. The earliest fossils of pinnipeds date back to the Late Oligocene. Fossil animals representing basal lineages include \"Puijila\", of the Early Miocene in Arctic Canada. It resembled a modern otter, but shows evidence of quadrupedal swimming\u2014retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that led to those employed by modern pinnipeds. \"Potamotherium\", which lived in the same period in Europe, was similar to \"Puijila\" but more aquatic. The braincase of \"Potamotherium\" shows evidence that it used its whiskers to hunt, like modern seals. Both \"Puijila\" and \"Potamotherium\" fossils have been found in lake deposits, suggesting that seal ancestors were originally adapted for fresh water.\n\"Enaliarctos\", a fossil species of late Oligocene/early Miocene (24\u201322\u00a0mya) California, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic life with flippers and a flexible spine. Its teeth were more like land predators in that they were more adapted for shearing. Its hind-flippers may have allowed it to walk on land, and it probably did not leave coastal areas as much as its modern relatives. \"Enaliarctos\" was likely more of a fore-flipper swimmer, but could probably swim with either pair. One species, \"Enaliarctos emlongi\", exhibited notable sexual dimorphism, suggesting that this physical characteristic may have been an important driver of pinniped evolution. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was \"Pteronarctos\", which lived in Oregon 19\u201315 mya. As in modern seals, the maxilla or upper jaw bone of \"Pteroarctos\" intersects with the orbital wall. The extinct family Desmatophocidae lived 23\u201310\u00a0mya in the North Pacific. They had long skulls that with large orbits, interlocked zygomatic bones and rounded molars and premolars. They also were sexually dimorphic and may have been capable of swimming with both or either pair of flippers. They are grouped with modern pinnipeds, but there is debate as to whether they are more closely related to phocids or to otariids and walruses. A 2024 study places them within Phocidae, specifically Phocinae.\nThe ancestors of the Otarioidea and Phocoidea diverged around 25\u00a0mya. Phocids are known to have existed for at least 15\u00a0million years, and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae and Phocinae lineages around this time. The fossil genera \"Monotherium\" and \"Leptophoca\" of southeastern North America represent the earliest members of Monachinae and Phocinae respectively. Both lineages may have originated in the North Atlantic, and likely reached the Pacific via the Central American Seaway. Phocines mainly stayed in the Northern Hemisphere, while the monachines diversified southward. The lineages of Otariidae and Odobenidae split around 20\u00a0mya. The earliest fossil records of otariids are in North Pacific and dated to around 11\u00a0mya. Early fossil genera include \"Pithanotaria\" and \"Thalassoleon\". The \"Callorhinus\" lineage split the earliest, followed by the \"Eumetopias\"/\"Zalophus\" lineage and then the rest, which colonized the Southern Hemisphere. The earliest fossils of Odobenidae\u2014\"Prototaria\" of Japan and \"Proneotherium\" of Oregon\u2014date to 18\u201316\u00a0mya. These primitive walruses had normal sized canines and fed on fish instead of mollusks. Later taxa like \"Gomphotaria\", \"Pontolis\" and \"Dusignathus\" had longer canines on both the upper and lower jaw. The familiar long upper tusks developed in the genera \"Valenictus\" and \"Odobenus\". The lineage of the modern walrus may have spread from the North Pacific to the North Atlantic through the Caribbean and Central American Seaway 8\u20135\u00a0mya, and then back to the North Pacific via the Arctic 1\u00a0mya, or to the Arctic and subsequently the North Atlantic during the Pleistocene.\nAnatomy and physiology.\nPinnipeds have streamlined, spindle-shaped bodies with small or non-existent ear flaps, rounded heads, short muzzles, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers and small tails. The mammary glands and genitals can withdraw into the body. Seals are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are mostly shaped by the maxilla and are not contained by certain facial bones. Compared to land carnivores, pinnipeds have fewer teeth, which are pointed and cone-shaped. They are adapted for holding onto slippery prey rather than shearing meat like the carnassials of other carnivorans. The walrus has unique tusks which are long upper canines.\nPinnipeds range in size from the and Baikal seal to the and southern elephant seal. Overall, they tend to be larger than other carnivores. Several species have male-biased sexual dimorphism that depends on how polygynous a species is: highly polygynous species like elephant seals are extremely sexually dimorphic, while less polygynous species have males and females that are closer in size, or, in the case of Antarctic seals, females are moderately bigger. Males of sexually dimorphic species also tend to have secondary sex characteristics, such as larger or more prominent heads, necks, chests, crests, noses/proboscises and canine teeth as well as thicker fur and manes. Though more polygynous species tend to be sexually dimorphic, some evidence suggests that size differences between the sexes originated due to ecological differences, with polygyny developing later.\nAlmost all pinnipeds have fur coats, the exception being the walrus, which is only sparsely covered. Even some fully furred species (particularly sea lions) are less furry than land mammals. Fur seals have lush coats consisting of an undercoat and guard hairs. In species that live on ice, young pups have thicker coats than adults. The individual hairs on the coat, known collectively as lanugo, can trap heat from sunlight and keep the pup warm. Pinnipeds are typically countershaded, and are darker colored dorsally and lighter colored ventrally, which serves to counter the effects of self-shadowing caused by light shining over the ocean water. The pure white fur of harp seal pups conceals them in their Arctic environment. Several species have clashing patterns of light and dark pigmentation. All fully furred species molt; the process of which may be quick or gradual depending on the species. Seals have a layer of subcutaneous fat, known as blubber, that is particularly thick in phocids and walruses. Blubber serves both to keep the animals warm and to provide energy and nourishment when they are fasting. It can constitute as much as 50% of a pinniped's mass. Newborn pups have a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.\nThe simple stomach of pinnipeds is typical of carnivores. Most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the small intestine. Small intestine lengths range from 8\u00a0times (California sea lion) to 25\u00a0times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, allowing for more room in the digestive tract for partially digested food. An appendix is absent in seals. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into lobes and filter out excess salt.\nLocomotion.\nPinnipeds have two pairs of flippers on the front and back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers. Their elbows and ankles are not externally visible. Pinnipeds are not as fast as cetaceans, typically swimming at compared to around for several species of dolphin. Seals are more agile and flexible, and some otariids, such as the California sea lion, can make dorsal turns as the back of their heads can touch their hind flippers. Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and cut through the water. The hair erector muscles are absent, so their fur can be streamlined as they swim.\nWhen swimming, otariids rely on their fore-flippers for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke. Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limb bones of otariids are reduced in length, giving them less resistance at the elbow joint as the flippers flap; the hind-flippers maneuver them. Phocids and walruses swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side, while their fore-flippers are mainly used for maneuvering. Some species leap out of the water, and \"ride\" waves.\nPinnipeds can move around on land, though not as well as terrestrial animals. Otariids and walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and under the body so they can \"walk\" on all fours. The fore-flippers move along a transverse plane, rather than the sagittal plane like the limbs of land mammals. Otariids create momentum by laterally swaying their heads and necks. Sea lions have been recorded climbing up flights of stairs. Phocids lack the ability to walk on their hind-flippers, and must flop and wriggle their bodies forward as their fore-flippers keep them stable. In some species, the fore-flippers may act like oars pushing against the ground. Phocids can move faster on ice, as they are able to slide.\nSenses.\nThe eyes of pinnipeds are relatively large for their size and are positioned near the front of the head. Only the smaller eyes of the walruses are located on each side of the head; since they forage at the bottom for sedentary mollusks. A seal's eye is suited for seeing both underwater and in air. Most of the retina is equidistant around the spherical lens. The cornea has a flattened center where refraction does not change between air and water. The vascular iris has a strong dilator muscle. A contracted pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more horizontal. Compared to deep-diving elephant seals, the iris of shallower species, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, does not change much in size between constriction and dilation. Seals are able to see in relative darkness with a \"tapetum lucidum\", a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. \nOn land, pinnipeds are near-sighted in dim light. This is reduced in bright light as the contracted pupil decreases the ability of the lens and the cornea to refract (bend) light. Polar living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can withstand the bright light that reflects off snow and ice, which would otherwise cause snow blindness. Color vision requires at least two types of visual pigments with different spectral sensitivities but since pinnipeds lack short-wavelength-sensitive cone cells, they are generally considered to be color-blind. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The walrus can project its eyes out from its sockets in both a forward and upward direction due to its advanced extraocular muscles and absence of an orbital roof. The seal eye is durable as the corneal epithelium is hardened by keratin, and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. Seals also secrete mucus from the lacrimal gland to protect their eyes. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.\nThe pinniped ear is adapted for hearing underwater, where it can hear sound frequencies of up to 70,000\u00a0Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While their airborne hearing sensitivity is generally weaker than humans', they still have a wide frequency range. One study of three species\u2014the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal\u2014found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the elephant seal for underwater hearing and the harbor seal was equally adapted for both. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless under water as their nostrils are closed.\nThe whiskers or vibrissa are normally smooth in otariids and walruses, while those of most phocids are wavey. The whiskers of some otariids grow quite long\u2014those of the Antarctic fur seal can reach \u2013 while walruses have the most vibrissae, at 600\u2013700\u00a0individual hairs. Compared to terrestrial mammals, the vibrissae of pinnipeds have ten times more nerve connections, allowing them to effectively detect vibrations in the water. These vibrations are generated, for example, when a fish swims through water. Detecting vibrations is useful when the animals are foraging, and may add to or even replace vision, particularly in darkness. \nHarbor seals can follow hydrodynamic paths made minutes earlier, similar to a dog following a scent trail, and can even discriminate the size and type of object responsible for the trail. Unlike terrestrial mammals, such as rodents, pinnipeds do not sweep their whiskers over an object when examining it, but can protract the hairs forward while holding them steady, maximizing their detection. The vibrissa's angle relative to the flow seems to be the most important contributor to detection ability. Whiskers may also play a role in navigation; spotted seals appear to use them to detect breathing holes in the ice.\nDiving adaptations.\nTo dive, a pinniped must first exhale much of the air out of its lungs and shut its nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. The airways are supported by cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and the chest muscles and alveoli can completely deflate during deeper dives. While land mammals generally cannot empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after alveolar collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their lungs is shifted to the bronchioles and trachea, which stops gas exchange with the blood, and thereby prevents them from developing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.\nThe circulatory system of pinnipeds is large and elaborate; retia mirabilia line the inside of the trunk and limbs, allowing for greater oxygen storage during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have large amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored in their blood and muscles respectively. This provides enough oxygen storage for them to stay submerged for long periods. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that represent up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate, and blood flow is mostly restricted to the heart, brain and lungs. Pinnipeds have bulb-shaped ascending aortas which are largest in deeper and longer diving species, allowing them to better maintain their blood pressure.\nThermoregulation.\nPinnipeds keep warm by having large, thick bodies, insulating blubber and fur, and fast metabolism. Their idle body temperature is around against the ocean water. Metabolic rates of different species vary between 1.5 and 3 times that of land mammals. Also, the blood vessels in their flippers are adapted for countercurrent exchange; small veins surround arteries transporting blood from the body core, capturing heat from them. While blubber and fur keep the seal warm in water, they can also overheat the animal when it is on land. To counteract overheating, many species cool off by covering themselves in sand. Monk seals may even dig up the cooler layers. The northern fur seal cools off by panting.\nSleep.\nPinnipeds spend many months at a time at sea, so they must sleep in the water. Scientists have recorded elephant seals sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators, as well as surface for air without fully waking. When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go into sleep mode.\nDistribution and habitat.\nLiving pinnipeds are widespread in cold oceanic waters; particularly in the North Atlantic, the North Pacific and the Southern Ocean. By contrast, the consistently warm Indomalayan waters have no seals. Monk seals and some otariids live in tropical and subtropical waters. Seals usually require cool, nutrient-rich waters with temperatures lower than . Even in more tropical climates, lower temperatures and biological productivity may be provided by currents. Only monk seals live in waters that generally lack these features. The Caspian seal and Baikal seal are found in large landlocked bodies of water (the Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal respectively).\nAs a whole, pinnipeds can be found in a variety of aquatic habitats, mostly coastal water, but also open ocean, deep waters near offshore islands, brackish waters and even freshwater lakes and rivers. The Baikal seal is the only exclusively freshwater species. Pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and substrates, both continental and island. In non-polar regions, they haul out on to rocky shores, sandy and pebble beaches, sandbanks, tidal flats or pools, and in sea caves. Some species also rest on man-made structures built along the coast or offshore. Pinnipeds may move further from the water using sand dunes or vegetation, or even rocky cliffs. New Zealand sea lions may travel to forests from the ocean. In polar regions, seals haul out on to both fast ice and drift ice. Some even den underneath the ice, particularly in pressure ridges and crevasses.\nBehavior and life history.\nPinnipeds have an amphibious lifestyle; they are mostly aquatic, but haul out to breed, molt, rest, sun or to avoid aquatic predators. Several species are known to migrate over vast distances, particularly in response to environmental changes. Elephant seals are at sea for most of the year and there are vast distances between their breeding and molting sites. The northern elephant seal is one of farthest mammalian migraters, traveling . Otariids tend to migrate less than phocids, especially tropical species. Traveling seals may reach their destination using geomagnetic fields, water and wind currents, solar and lunar positions and the temperature and chemical makeup of the water.\nPinnipeds may dive during foraging or to avoid predators. When foraging, for example, the Weddell seal typically dives for no more than 15\u00a0minutes and deep, but can dive for as long as 73\u00a0minutes and reach deep. Northern elephant seals often dive for as long as 20\u00a0minutes. They can also dive and for over an hour. The dives of otariids tend to be shorter and less deep. They typically last 5\u20137\u00a0minutes with average depths to . However, the New Zealand sea lion has been recorded diving to a maximum of and have submerged for as long as 12 minutes. The diet of walruses does not require them to dive very deep or very long. Pinnipeds generally live 25\u201330\u00a0years.\nForaging and predation.\nAll pinnipeds are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, they mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, but also consume crustaceans, bivalves, zooplankton and endothermic (warm-blooded) prey like sea birds. While most species have generalist diets, a few are specialists. Examples are krill-eating crabeater seals, crustacean-eating ringed seals, squid specialists like the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, and the bearded seal and walrus, which specialize on benthic invertebrates.\nPinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, immobile or sluggish invertebrates and endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually hunt in coastal or shallow water. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which hunts deep in the open ocean for fish. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups. For large schools of fish or squid, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, will hunt alongside sea birds and cetaceans.\nSeals typically swallow their food whole, and will rip apart prey that is too big. The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently shake its prey to death. Complex serrations in the teeth of filter-feeding species, such as crabeater seals, allow water to leak out as they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by suction feeding, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the shell. While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from their food.\nPinnipeds themselves are subject to predation. Most species are preyed on by the orca. To subdue and kill seals, orcas strike them with their heads or tails\u2014the latter causing them to fly in the air\u2014or simply bite into them and rip them apart. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer whales, but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals. All age classes may be targeted, but pups most of all. Large sharks are another major predator of pinnipeds\u2014usually the great white shark but also the tiger shark and mako shark. Sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below. Injured seals that escape are usually able to recover from their wounds. Otariids that have been targeted in the hindquarters are more likely to survive, while phocids are more likely to survive with forequarters injures. Pinnipeds are also preyed on by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is a major predator of Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears may seek out seals, or simply wait for them to come by. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. \nPinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines; adult walruses are particularly risky prey for polar bears. Cape fur seals will even mob white sharks. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive out of the reach of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts.\nInterspecific predation among pinnipeds does occur. The leopard seal is known to prey on many other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, particularly from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions, particularly pups and small adults. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.\nReproductive behavior.\nThe mating system of pinnipeds varies from extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Species that breed on land are usually more polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with them as well as defend them from rivals. These species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds prefer to mate on islands where there are fewer land predators. Suitable islands are in short supply and tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land to monopolize females; and may fast for months as they would lose their position if they went to feed at sea. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur\u2014all traits that equip males for combat. Larger males have more blubber and thus more energy reserves for fasting.\nOther seals, like the walrus and most phocids, breed on ice and copulate in the water\u2014a few land-breeding species also mate in water. Females of these species tend to be more spaced out and there is less site fidelity, since ice is less stable than solid land. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, whose distribution of food forces females closer together. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on drift ice. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In Antarctic seals, there is some size bias in favor of females. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.\nAdult male pinnipeds have several strategies to ensure reproductive success. Otariid males gain access to females by establishing territories where females can bask and give birth and contain valuable resources such as shade, tide pools or access to water. Territories are usually marked by natural barriers, and some may be fully or partially underwater. Males defend their territorial boundaries with threatening vocalizations and postures, but physical fights are usually not very violent, and are mostly limited to early in the season. Individuals also return to the same territorial site each breeding season. In certain species, like the Steller sea lion and northern fur seal, a dominant male can maintain a territory for as long as 2\u20133 months. Females can usually move freely between territories and males are unable to coerce females who are intent on leaving, but in some species such as the northern fur seal, South American sea lion and Australian sea lion, males keep females in their territories with threatening displays and even violence. In some phocid species, like the harbor seal, Weddell seal and bearded seal, the males establish \"maritories\" and patrol and defend the waters bordering female haul-out areas, waiting for a female to enter. These are also maintained by vocalizations. The maritories of Weddell seal males include entries to female breathing holes in the ice.\nLek systems are known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males gather near female herds and try to attract them with elaborate courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals, grey seals and non-lekking walruses, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males, in particular, establish dominance hierarchies via displays and fights, with the highest ranking males having a near monopoly on reproductive success. An alpha male can have a harem of 100 females. Grey seal males usually place themselves among a cluster of females whose members may change over time, while males of some walrus populations guard female herds. Male ringed, crabeater, spotted and hooded seals follow and defend nearby females and mate with them when they reach estrus. These may be lone females or small groups. South American sea lions are considered to be both a territory-defending and female-defending species. Males start the season establishing and defending territories but then claim, gather and defend pre-estrus females when they arrive.\nYounger or subdominant male pinnipeds may attempt to achieve reproductive success in other ways including sneakiness, harassment of departing females or even group raids. Female pinnipeds do appear to have some choice in mates, particularly in lek-breeding species like the walrus, but also in elephant seals where the males try to dominate all the females that they want to mate with. When a female elephant seal or grey seal is mounted by an unwanted male, she tries to resist and get away. This commotion attracts other males to the scene, and the most dominant will take over and mate with female himself. Dominant female elephant seals stay in the center of the colony where they are in the domain of a more dominant male, while marginal females are left with subordinates. Female Steller sea lions may solicit their territorial males for mating.\nBirth and parenting.\nOtariids enter estrus shortly after giving birth, while phocids can mate again during late lactation or when their young is weaned and walruses have five- to six-year gaps between births. All species have delayed implantation, in which the embryo does not enter the uterus for weeks or months. Delayed implantation allows the female to wait until conditions are right for birthing. Gestation in seals (including delayed implantation) typically lasts a year. For most species, birthing takes place in spring and summer. Usually, single pups are born; twins are rare and have high mortality rates. Pups of most species are born relatively developed and precocial.\nPinniped milk has \"little to no lactose\". Mother pinnipeds have different strategies for maternal care and lactation. Phocids such as elephant seals, grey seals and hooded seals have a lactation period that lasts days or weeks, during which they fast and nurse their pups on land or ice. The milk of these species consists of up to 60% fat, allowing the young to grow quickly. Each day until they are weaned, northern elephant seal pups gain . Some pups gain weight more quickly than others by stealing extra milk from other mothers. Alloparenting occurs in these fasting species; while most northern elephant seal mothers nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own.\nFor otariids and some phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups for a few days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females forage at sea while the young stay behind onshore. If there is enough food close to shore, a female can be gone for as little as a day, but otherwise may be at sea for as long as three weeks. Lactation in otariids may last 6\u201311 months; in the Gal\u00e1pagos fur seal it can last up to three years. Pups of these species are weaned at heavier weights than their phocid counterparts, but the latter grow quicker. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. Young pinnipeds typically start swimming on their own and some species can even swim as newborns. Young may wait days or weeks before entering the water; elephant seals start swimming weeks after weaning.\nMale pinnipeds generally play little role in raising the young. Male walruses may help inexperienced young as they learn to swim, and have even been recorded caring for orphans. When a group is threatened, all the adults may protect the young. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats to the safety of pups, particularly during fights. Pups of some species may be abducted, assaulted and killed by males, possibly due to sexual frustration.\nCommunication.\nPinnipeds can produce a number of vocalizations. While most vocals are audible to the human ear, Weddell seals have been recorded in Antarctica making ultrasonic calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce infrasonic vibrations. Vocals are produced both in air and underwater; the former are more common among otariids and the latter among phocids. Antarctic seals are noisier on land or ice than Arctic seals due to the absence of polar bears. Male vocals are usually deeper than those of the females. Vocalizations are particularly important during the breeding seasons. Dominant male elephant seals display their status and power with \"clap-threats\" and loud drum-like calls that may be modified by the proboscis. Male otariids have strong barks, growls and roars. Male walruses are known to produce gong-like calls when attempting to attract females, these are amplified underwater with inflatable throat sacs.\nThe Weddell seal has perhaps the most extensive vocal repertoire, producing both airborne and underwater sounds. Trilling, gluping, chirping, chugging and knocking are some examples of the calls produced underwater. When warning other seals, the calls may be pronounced by \"prefixes\" and \"suffixes\". The underwater vocals of Weddell seals can last 70 seconds, which is long for a marine mammal call. Some calls have about seven rhythm patterns and could be categorized as \"songs\". Similar calls have been recorded in other Antarctic seals and in bearded seals. In some pinniped species, there appear to be regional dialects or even individual variations in vocalizations. These differences are likely important for territorial males recognizing their neighbors and mothers and pups who need to remain in contact on crowded beaches. Female seals emit a \"pulsed, bawling\" contact call, while pups respond by squawking. Contact calls are particularly important for otariid mothers returning from sea. Other vocalizations produced by seals include grunts, rasps, rattles, creaks, warbles, clicks and whistles.\nNon-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when they feel threatened, hauled-out harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap themselves with their flippers to create a warning sound. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings by pinnipeds. Visual displays also occur: Ross seals resting on the ice will show the stripes on their chests and bare their teeth to a perceived threat, while swimming Weddell seals will make an S-shaped posture to intimidate rivals under the ice. Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.\nIntelligence.\nIn a match-to-sample task study, a single California sea lion was able to demonstrate an understanding of symmetry, transitivity and equivalence; a second seal was unable to complete the tasks. They demonstrate the ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language, though they only rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In 2011, a captive California sea lion named Ronan was recorded bobbing its head in synchrony to musical rhythms. This \"rhythmic entrainment\" was previously seen only in humans, parrots and other birds possessing vocal mimicry. Harbor seals have been found to adapt quickly when presented with changes to stimuli in regards to rewards and non-rewards. Adult male elephant seals can recognize each other's vocalizations by remembering the rhythm and timbre. In the 1970s, a captive harbor seal named Hoover was trained to imitate human speech and laughter.\nFor sea lions used in entertainment, trainers toss a ball at the animal or simply place the object on its nose, so it will eventually understand the behavior desired. A sea lion may need a year of training before it can publicly perform. Its long-term memory allows it to perform a trick after as much as three months of non-performance.\nHuman relations.\nIn culture.\nVarious human cultures have for millennia depicted pinnipeds. In Homer's \"Odyssey\", the sea god Proteus shepherds a colony of seals. In northern Scotland, Celts of Orkney and the Hebrides believed in selkies\u2014seals that could change into humans and walk on land. In Inuit mythology, they are associated with the goddess Sedna, who sometimes transformed into a seal. It was believed that marine mammals, including seals, came from her severed fingers. In modern culture, pinnipeds are thought of as cute, playful and comical figures.\nIn captivity.\nPinnipeds can be found in facilities around the world, as their size and playfulness make them popular attractions. Seals have been kept in captivity since at least ancient Rome and their trainability was noticed by Pliny the Elder. Zoologist Georges Cuvier noted during the 19th century that wild seals show considerable affection for humans and stated that they are second only to some monkeys among wild animals in their easy tamability. Francis Galton noted in his seminal work on domestication that seals were a spectacular example of an animal that would most likely never be domesticated, despite their friendliness, survivability and \"desire for comfort\", because they serve no practical use for humans.\nSome modern exhibits have a pool with artificial haul-out sites and a rocky background, while others have seals housed in shelters located above a pool which they can jump into. More elaborate exhibits contain deep pools that can be viewed underwater with rock-mimicking cement as haul-out areas. The most popular captive pinniped is the California sea lion, due to its trainability and adaptability. Other commonly kept species include the grey seal and harbor seal. Larger animals like walruses and Steller sea lions are much less common. Some organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and World Animal Protection, object to keeping marine mammals in captivity. They state that the exhibits could not be large enough to house animals that have evolved to be migratory, and a pool could never replace the size and biodiversity of the ocean. They also state that the tricks performed for audiences are \"exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors\" and distract the people from the animal's unnatural environment.\nCalifornia sea lions are used in military applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals have been trained to swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their job is done.\nHunting.\nHumans have hunted seals since the Stone Age. Originally, seals were merely hit with clubs during haul-out. Eventually, more lethal weapons were used, like spears and harpoons. They were also trapped in nets. The use of firearms in seal hunting during the modern era drastically increased the number of killings. Pinnipeds are typically hunted for their meat and blubber. The skins of fur seals and phocids are made into coats, and the tusks of walruses have been used as ivory. There is a distinction made between the subsistence hunting of seals by indigenous peoples of the Arctic and commercial hunting: subsistence hunters depend on seal products for survival. National and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of killing are seen as more sustainable and smaller in scope. However indigenous people have recently used more modern technology and are profiting more from seal products in the marketplace. Some anthropologists argue that the term \"subsistence\" should also apply to these activities, as long as they are local in scale. More than 100,000\u00a0phocids (especially ringed seals) as well as around 10,000\u00a0walruses are harvested annually by native hunters.\nCommercial sealing rivaled whaling as an important industry throughout history. Harvested species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. After the 1960s, the harvesting of seals decreased substantially as an industry after the Canadian government implemented measures to protect female seals and restrict the hunting season. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may have reached their pre-harvesting numbers. The northern elephant seal nearly went extinct in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of the Mediterranean and its current range is still limited.\nSeveral species of pinniped continue to be exploited. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals protects species within the Antarctic and surrounding waters, but allows restricted hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. Weddell seal hunting is forbidden between September and February if the animal is older than a year, to ensure healthy population growth. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents argue that it is irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.\nThe Caribbean monk seal has been killed and exploited by European settlers and their descendants since 1494, starting with Christopher Columbus himself. The seals were easy targets for organized sealers, fishermen, turtle hunters and buccaneers because they evolved with little pressure from terrestrial predators and were thus \"genetically tame\". In the Bahamas, as many as 100 seals were slaughtered in one night. The species was considered to be already extinct by the mid-nineteenth century until a small colony was found near the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in 1866. Seal killings continued, and the last reliable report of the animal alive was in 1952 at Serranilla Bank. The IUCN declared it extinct in 1996. The Japanese sea lion was common around the Japanese islands, but overexploitation and competition from fisheries drastically decreased the population in the 1930s. The last recorded individual was a juvenile in 1974.\nConservation issues.\nAs of 2021, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 36 pinniped species. With the Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal recently extinct, ten more are considered at risk. They are ranked as:\nPinnipeds face various threats. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur seals and Cape fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. Organic chemicals tend to accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, and decreased fertility and immunity to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.\nSpecies that live in polar habitats are vulnerable to the effects of climate change on oceans, particularly declines in sea ice. In 2010 and 2011, sea ice in the Northwest Atlantic was at or near an all-time low and harp seals as well as ringed seals that bred on thin ice saw increased death rates. In the Antarctic, the decreased duration and extent of the sea ice and nutrient availability could potentially reduce the survival of Weddell seal pups and may have important implications for population growth rates. Antarctic fur seals in South Georgia in the South Atlantic saw major decreases over a 20-year study, during which scientists measured increased sea surface temperature anomalies.\nSome species have become so numerous that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better resist sea lion use. Inland-living New Zealand sea lions face unique human conflicts such as road mortality and run-ins with human infrastructure. Seals also conflict with fisheries; a 2024 metastudy found that globally pinnipeds affected over 33 percent of fishing days and stole over 13 percent of catches. In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam. In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fishermen demanded that brown fur seals be culled, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling fur seals would actually have a negative effect on the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Self began as a dialect of Smalltalk, being dynamically typed and using just-in-time compilation (JIT) with the prototype-based approach to objects: it was first used as an experimental test system for language design in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2006, Self was still being developed as part of the Klein project, which was a Self virtual machine written fully in Self. The latest version, 2024.1 was released in August 2024.\nSeveral just-in-time compilation techniques were pioneered and improved in Self research as they were required to allow a very high level object oriented language to perform at up to half the speed of optimized C. Much of the development of Self took place at Sun Microsystems, and the techniques they developed were later deployed for Java's HotSpot virtual machine.\nAt one point a version of Smalltalk was implemented in Self. Because it was able to use the JIT, this also gave extremely good performance.\nHistory.\nSelf was designed mostly by David Ungar and Randall Smith in 1986 while working at Xerox PARC. Their objective was to advance the state of the art in object-oriented programming language research, once Smalltalk-80 was released by the labs and began to be taken seriously by the industry. They moved to Stanford University and continued work on the language, building the first working Self compiler in 1987. Then, focus changed to working to build a full system for Self, in contrast to only the language.\nThe first public release was in 1990, and the next year the team moved to Sun Microsystems where they continued work on the language. Several new releases followed until falling largely dormant in 1995 with version 4.0. In 2006, version 4.3 was released, for Mac OS X and Solaris. in 2010, a new release, version 4.4, was developed by a group comprising some of the original team and independent programmers, for Mac OS X and Linux, as are all later versions. In January 2014, a follow-up, 4.5 was released, and three years later, version 2017.1 was released in May 2017.\nThe Morphic user interface construction environment was originally developed by Randy Smith and John Maloney for the Self programming language. Morphic has been ported to other notable programming languages including Squeak, JavaScript, Python, and Objective-C.\nSelf also inspired a number of languages based on its concepts. Most notable, perhaps, were NewtonScript for the Apple Newton and JavaScript used in all modern browsers. Other examples include Io, Lisaac and Agora. The IBM Tivoli Framework's distributed object system, developed in 1990, was, at the lowest level, a prototype based object system inspired by Self.\nPrototype-based programming languages.\nTraditional class-based OO languages are based on a deep-rooted duality:\nFor example, suppose objects of the codice_1 class have a \"name\" and the ability to perform various actions, such as \"drive to work\" and \"deliver construction materials\". codice_2 is a particular object (instance) of the class codice_1, with the name \"Bob's car\". In theory one can then send a message to codice_2, telling it to \"deliver construction materials\".\nThis example shows one of the problems with this approach: Bob's car, which happens to be a sports car, is not able to carry and deliver construction materials (in any meaningful sense), but this is a capability that codice_1s are modelled to have. A more useful model arises from the use of subclassing to create specializations of codice_1; for example codice_7 and codice_8. Only objects of the class codice_8 need provide a mechanism to \"deliver construction materials\"; sports cars, which are ill-suited to that sort of work, need only \"drive fast\". However, this deeper model requires more insight during design, insight that may only come to light as problems arise.\nThis issue is one of the motivating factors behind prototypes. Unless one can predict with certainty what qualities a set of objects and classes will have in the distant future, one cannot design a class hierarchy properly. All too often the program would eventually need added behaviours, and sections of the system would need to be re-designed (or refactored) to break out the objects in a different way. Experience with early OO languages like Smalltalk showed that this sort of issue came up again and again. Systems would tend to grow to a point and then become very rigid, as the basic classes deep below the programmer's code grew to be simply \"wrong\". Without some way to easily change the original class, serious problems could arise.\nDynamic languages such as Smalltalk allowed for this sort of change via well-known methods in the classes; by changing the class, the objects based on it would change their behaviour. However, such changes had to be done very carefully, as other objects based on the same class might be expecting this \"wrong\" behavior: \"wrong\" is often dependent on the context. (This is one form of the fragile base class problem.) Further, in languages like C++, where subclasses can be compiled separately from superclasses, a change to a superclass can actually break precompiled subclass methods. (This is another form of the fragile base class problem, and also one form of the fragile binary interface problem.)\nIn Self, and other prototype-based languages, the duality between classes and object instances is eliminated.\nInstead of having an \"instance\" of an object that is based on some \"class\", in Self one makes a copy of an existing object, and changes it. So codice_2 would be created by making a copy of an existing \"Vehicle\" object, and then adding the \"drive fast\" method, modelling the fact that it happens to be a Porsche 911. Basic objects that are used primarily to make copies are known as \"prototypes\". This technique is claimed to greatly simplify dynamism. If an existing object (or set of objects) proves to be an inadequate model, a programmer may simply create a modified object with the correct behavior, and use that instead. Code which uses the existing objects is not changed.\nDescription.\nSelf objects are a collection of \"slots\". Slots are accessor methods that return values, and placing a colon after the name of a slot sets the value. For example, for a slot called \"name\",\nmyPerson name\nreturns the value in name, and\nmyPerson name:'foo'\nsets it.\nSelf, like Smalltalk, uses \"blocks\" for flow control and other duties. Methods are objects containing code in addition to slots (which they use for arguments and temporary values), and can be placed in a Self slot just like any other object: a number for example. The syntax remains the same in either case.\nNote that there is no distinction in Self between fields and methods: everything is a slot. Since accessing slots via messages forms the majority of the syntax in Self, many messages are sent to \"self\", and the \"self\" can be left off (hence the name).\nBasic syntax.\nThe syntax for accessing slots is similar to that of Smalltalk. Three kinds of messages are available:\nAll messages return results, so the receiver (if present) and arguments can be themselves the result of other messages. Following a message by a period means Self will discard the returned value. For example:\n'Hello, World!' print.\nThis is the Self version of the \"Hello, World!\" program. The codice_14 syntax indicates a literal string object. Other literals include numbers, blocks and general objects.\nGrouping can be forced by using parentheses. In the absence of explicit grouping, the unary messages are considered to have the highest precedence followed by binary (grouping left to right) and the keywords having the lowest. The use of keywords for assignment would lead to some extra parenthesis where expressions also had keyword messages, so to avoid that Self requires that the first part of a keyword message selector start with a lowercase letter, and subsequent parts start with an uppercase letter.\nvalid: base bottom\n between: ligature bottom + height\n And: base top / scale factor.\ncan be parsed unambiguously, and means the same as:\nvalid: ((base bottom)\n between: ((ligature bottom) + height)\n And: ((base top) / (scale factor))).\nIn Smalltalk-80, the same expression would be written as:\nvalid := self base bottom\n between: self ligature bottom + self height\n and: self base top / self scale factor.\nassuming codice_15, codice_16, codice_17 and codice_18 were not instance variables of codice_19 but were, in fact, methods.\nMaking new objects.\nConsider a slightly more complex example:\nlabelWidget copy label: 'Hello, World!'.\nmakes a copy of the \"labelWidget\" object with the copy message (no shortcut this time), then sends it a message to put \"Hello, World\" into the slot called \"label\". Now to do something with it:\n(desktop activeWindow) draw: (labelWidget copy label: 'Hello, World!').\nIn this case the codice_20 is performed first, returning the active window from the list of windows that the desktop object knows about. Next (read inner to outer, left to right) the code we examined earlier returns the labelWidget. Finally the widget is sent into the draw slot of the active window.\nDelegation.\nIn theory, every Self object is a stand-alone entity. Self has neither classes nor meta-classes. Changes to a particular object do not affect any other, but in some cases it is desirable if they did. Normally an object can understand only messages corresponding to its local slots, but by having one or more slots indicating \"parent\" objects, an object can delegate any message it does not understand itself to the parent object. Any slot can be made a parent pointer by adding an asterisk as a suffix. In this way Self handles duties that would use inheritance in class-based languages. Delegation can also be used to implement features such as namespaces and lexical scoping.\nFor example, suppose an object is defined called \"bank account\", that is used in a simple bookkeeping application. Usually, this object would be created with the methods inside, perhaps \"deposit\" and \"withdraw\", and any data slots needed by them. This is a prototype, which is only special in the way it is used since it also happens to be a fully functional bank account.\nTraits.\nMaking a clone of this object for \"Bob's account\" will create a new object which starts out exactly like the prototype. In this case we have copied the slots including the methods and any data. However a more common solution is to first make a more simple object called a traits object which contains the items that one would normally associate with a class.\nIn this example the \"bank account\" object would not have the deposit and withdraw method, but would have as a parent an object that did. In this way many copies of the bank account object can be made, but we can still change the behaviour of them all by changing the slots in that root object.\nHow is this any different from a traditional class? Well consider the meaning of:\nmyObject parent: someOtherObject.\nThis excerpt changes the \"class\" of myObject at runtime by changing the value associated with the 'parent*' slot (the asterisk is part of the slot name, but not the corresponding messages). Unlike with inheritance or lexical scoping, the delegate object can be modified at runtime.\nAdding slots.\nObjects in Self can be modified to include additional slots. This can be done using the graphical programming environment, or with the primitive '_AddSlots:'. A primitive has the same syntax as a normal keyword message, but its name starts with the underscore character. The _AddSlots primitive should be avoided because it is a leftover from early implementations. However, we will show it in the example below because it makes the code shorter.\nAn earlier example was about refactoring a simple class called Vehicle in order to be able to differentiate the behaviour between cars and trucks. In Self one would accomplish this with something like this:\n_AddSlots: (| vehicle &lt;- (|parent* = traits clonable|) |).\nSince the receiver of the '_AddSlots:' primitive isn't indicated, it is \"self\". In the case of expressions typed at the prompt, that is an object called the \"lobby\". The argument for '_AddSlots:' is the object whose slots will be copied over to the receiver. In this case it is a literal object with exactly one slot. The slot's name is 'vehicle' and its value is another literal object. The \"&lt;-\" notation implies a second slot called 'vehicle:' which can be used to change the first slot's value.\nThe \"=\" indicates a constant slot, so there is no corresponding 'parent:'. The literal object that is the initial value of 'vehicle' includes a single slot so it can understand messages related to cloning. A truly empty object, indicated as (| |) or more simply as (), cannot receive any messages at all.\nvehicle _AddSlots: (| name &lt;- 'automobile'|).\nHere the receiver is the previous object, which now will include 'name' and 'name:' slots in addition to 'parent*'.\n_AddSlots: (| sportsCar &lt;- vehicle copy |).\nsportsCar _AddSlots: (| driveToWork = (\"some code, this is a method\") |).\nThough previously 'vehicle' and 'sportsCar' were exactly alike, now the latter includes a new slot with a method that the original doesn't have. Methods can only be included in constant slots.\n_AddSlots: (| porsche911 &lt;- sportsCar copy |).\nporsche911 name:'Bobs Porsche'.\nThe new object 'porsche911' started out exactly like 'sportsCar', but the last message changed the value of its 'name' slot. Note that both still have exactly the same slots even though one of them has a different value.\nEnvironment.\nOne feature of Self is that it is based on the same sort of virtual machine system that earlier Smalltalk systems used. That is, programs are not stand-alone entities as they are in languages such as C, but need their entire memory environment in order to run. This requires that applications be shipped in chunks of saved memory known as \"snapshots\" or \"images\". One disadvantage of this approach is that images are sometimes large and unwieldy; however, debugging an image is often simpler than debugging traditional programs because the runtime state is easier to inspect and modify. (The difference between source-based and image-based development is analogous to the difference between class-based and prototypical object-oriented programming.)\nIn addition, the environment is tailored to the rapid and continual change of the objects in the system. Refactoring a \"class\" design is as simple as dragging methods out of the existing ancestors into new ones. Simple tasks like test methods can be handled by making a copy, dragging the method into the copy, then changing it. Unlike traditional systems, only the changed object has the new code, and nothing has to be rebuilt in order to test it. If the method works, it can simply be dragged back into the ancestor.\nPerformance.\nSelf VMs achieved performance of approximately half the speed of optimised C on some benchmarks.\nThis was achieved by just-in-time compilation techniques which were pioneered and improved in Self research to make a high level language perform this well.\nGarbage collection.\nThe garbage collector for Self uses generational garbage collection which segregates objects by age. By using the memory management system to record page writes a write-barrier can be maintained. This technique gives excellent performance, although after running for some time a full garbage collection can occur, taking considerable time.\nOptimizations.\nThe run time system selectively flattens call structures. This gives modest speedups in itself, but allows extensive caching of type information and multiple versions of code for different caller types. This removes the need to do many method lookups and permits conditional branch statements and hard-coded calls to be inserted- often giving C-like performance with no loss of generality at the language level, but on a fully garbage collected system.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Despite the protagonist's scepticism, the deal seems to have the support of Russian security-chief Colonel Stok and Hallam at the Home Office. The fake documentation for Semitsa needs to be precisely specified.

The dialogue went on to say the Home Office was hampered from taking action by vested interests, and mentioned Brock's Fireworks, a UK company, by name. Brock's objected to this, and sued for libel. The complaint was upheld, and the 1972 Penguin edition had the dialogue deleted. This ruling did not affect books published elsewhere, which continued to contain the offending material.\nAdaptation.\nA film version of \"Funeral in Berlin\" was made in 1966, starring Michael Caine and directed by Guy Hamilton. In 1973, the TV series \"Jason King\" (starring Peter Wyngarde), used the plot from \"Funeral in Berlin\" to smuggle an individual out of East Germany. The book is shown at the end of the episode.

It was first published serially in \"McClure's Magazine\" from December 1900 to October 1901 as well as in \"Cassell's Magazine\" from January to November 1901, and first published in book form by Macmillan &amp; Co. Ltd in October 1901. The novel is notable for its detailed portrait of the people, culture, and varied religions of India: \"The book presents a vivid picture of India, its teeming populations, religions, and superstitions, and the life of the bazaars and the road.\" The story unfolds against the backdrop of the Great Game, the political conflict between Russia and Britain in Central Asia. The novel popularized the phrase and idea of the Great Game.\nSynopsis.\nThe story is set after the Second Anglo-Afghan War (which ended in 1881), and before the Third (1919), probably in the period of 1893 to 1898.\nKim (Kimball O'Hara) is the orphaned son of an Irish soldier (Kimball O'Hara Sr., a former colour sergeant) and an Irish mother. Living a vagabond existence in India under British rule in the late 19th century, Kim lives by begging and running small errands on the streets of Lahore. He occasionally works for Mahbub Ali, a Pashtun horse trader who is one of the native operatives of the British secret service. Kim is so tanned and immersed in the local culture that few realise he is white.\nKim befriends an aged Tibetan lama on a quest to free himself from the Wheel of Things by finding the legendary \"River of the Arrow\". Kim becomes his \"chela\" (disciple) and accompanies him on his journey, initially walking along the Grand Trunk Road. On the way, Kim learns about the Great Game and is recruited by Mahbub Ali to carry a message to the head of the British Secret Service in Umballa.\nKim encounters and recognises his father's regiment on the march. Curious, he sneaks in when the soldiers camp for the night. He is caught and mistaken for a thief, but the regimental chaplain identifies Kim by his Masonic certificate, which is sewn into an amulet that he wears around his neck. Upon learning of Kim's connection to the regiment, the lama insists that the boy comply with the chaplain's plan to send him to an English school in Lucknow. The lama, a former abbot, pays for Kim's education.\nThroughout his years at school, Kim remains in contact with the holy man he has come to love. He is also trained in espionage (to be a surveyor) while on vacation from school by Lurgan Sahib, a sort of benevolent Fagin, at his jewellery shop in Simla. As part of his training, Kim is given brief looks at a tray full of mixed objects and notes which have been added or taken away, a pastime still called Kim's Game, also called the Jewel Game. Other parts of this training are disguise and the careful study of the Indian population, and the characteristic dress, behaviour and \"even how they spit\" in order to go undercover or to uncover those in disguise. He also accompanies Mahbub Ali on one school break; when he proves apt at spying on and evaluating how to capture the city of Bikanir, Mahbub Ali persuades his superior, a skeptical Colonel Creighton, that the boy is ready.\nAfter three years of schooling, Kim begins to take part in the Great Game, joining the Secret Service at 20 rupees a month. Kim rejoins the lama and at the behest of Kim's superior, Hurree Chunder Mookherjee, they make a trip to the Himalayas so they can try to find out what a couple of Russian intelligence agents, one Russian and one Frenchman, are doing there. Kim obtains maps, papers and other important items from the Russian agents, who are working to undermine British control of the region. Mookherjee persuades the Russian agents to hire him as a guide. When the Russian strikes the lama in the face, Kim attacks the man, then flees when shot at, while the outraged porters abandon the party and take the lama away to safety.\nThe lama realises that he has gone astray. His search for the River of the Arrow should be taking place in the plains, not in the mountains, and he orders the porters to take them back. Here Kim and the lama are nursed back to health after their arduous journey. Kim delivers the Russian documents to Hurree, and a concerned Mahbub Ali comes to check on Kim.\nThe lama becomes convinced he has found his river and will achieve Enlightenment, and wants to share it with Kim.\nCritical assessment.\nConsidered by many to be Kipling's masterpiece, opinion is varied about its consideration as children's literature or not. Roger Sale, in his history of children's literature, concludes \"\"Kim\" is the apotheosis of the Victorian cult of childhood, but it shines now as bright as ever, long after the Empire's collapse...\"\nAbout a reissue of the novel in 1959 by Macmillan, the reviewer writes \"\"Kim\" is a book worked at three levels. It is a tale of adventure...It is the drama of a boy having entirely his boy's own way...and it is the mystical exegesis of this pattern of behaviour...\" This reviewer concludes \"\"Kim\" will endure because it is a beginning like all masterly ends...\"\nNirad C. Chaudhuri considered it the best story (in English) about India \u2013 noting Kipling's appreciation of the ecological force of \"the twin setting of the mountains and the plain...an unbreakable articulation between the Himalayas and the Indo-Gangetic plain\".\nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked \"Kim\" No. 78 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, the book was listed on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's \"best-loved novel\".\nTributes.\nThe town of Kim, Colorado, is named in honour of the book.\nBritish spy and defector Kim Philby was born Harold Philby in Ambala, then in British India. His father, a member of the Indian Civil Service, gave him the nickname \"Kim\" on account of his fraternisation with the servants.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nEditions.\nThe Sussex edition is standard for Kipling's works.

{"id": "60280", "revid": "26910586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60280", "title": "Margaret Atwood", "text": "Canadian writer (born 1939)\nMargaret Eleanor Atwood (born November 18, 1939) is a Canadian novelist, poet, literary critic, and inventor. Since 1961, she has published 18 books of poetry, 18 novels, 11 books of nonfiction, nine collections of short fiction, eight children's books, two graphic novels, and a number of small press editions of both poetry and fiction. Her best-known work is the 1985 dystopian novel \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" Atwood has won numerous awards and honors for her writing, including two Booker Prizes, the Arthur C. Clarke Award, the Governor General's Award, the Franz Kafka Prize, the Prince of Asturias Award for literature, and the National Book Critics and PEN Center USA Lifetime Achievement Awards. A number of her works have been adapted for film and television.\nAtwood's works encompass a variety of themes including gender and identity, religion and myth, the power of language, climate change, and power politics. Many of her poems are inspired by myths and fairy tales which interested her from a very early age.\nAtwood is a founder of the Griffin Poetry Prize and the Writers' Trust of Canada. She is also a Senior Fellow of Massey College, Toronto. She is the inventor of the LongPen device and associated technologies that facilitate remote robotic writing of documents.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and education.\nAtwood was born on November 18, 1939, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the second of three children of Carl Edmund Atwood, an entomologist, and Margaret Dorothy (n\u00e9e Killam), a former dietitian and nutritionist from Woodville, Nova Scotia. Because of her father's research in forest entomology, Atwood spent much of her childhood in the backwoods of northern Quebec, and travelling back and forth between Ottawa, Sault Ste. Marie and Toronto.\nShe did not attend school full-time until she was 12 years old. She became a voracious reader of literature, Dell pocketbook mysteries, \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\", Canadian animal stories, and comic books. She attended Leaside High School in Leaside, Toronto, and graduated in 1957. Atwood began writing plays and poems at the age of 6.\nAs a child, she also participated in the Brownie program of Girl Guides of Canada. Atwood has written about her experiences in Girl Guides in several of her publications.\nAtwood realized she wanted to write professionally when she was 16. In 1957, she began studying at Victoria College in the University of Toronto, where she published poems and articles in \"Acta Victoriana\", the college literary journal, and participated in the sophomore theatrical tradition of \"The Bob Revue\". Her professors included Jay Macpherson and Northrop Frye. She graduated in 1961 with a Bachelor of Arts in English (honours) and minors in philosophy and French.\nIn 1961, Atwood began graduate studies at Radcliffe College of Harvard University, with a Woodrow Wilson fellowship. She obtained a master's degree (MA) from Radcliffe in 1962 and pursued doctoral studies for two years, but did not finish her dissertation, \"The English Metaphysical Romance\".\nPersonal life.\nAtwood has a sister, Ruth Atwood, born in 1951, and a brother who is two years older, Harold Leslie Atwood. She has claimed that, according to her grandmother (maiden name Webster), the 17th-century witchcraft-lynching survivor Mary Webster might have been an ancestor: \"On Monday, my grandmother would say Mary was her ancestor, and on Wednesday she would say she wasn't\u2026 So take your pick.\" Webster is the subject of Atwood's poem \"Half-Hanged Mary\", as well as the subject of Atwood's dedication in her novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (1985).\nAtwood married Jim Polk, an American writer, in 1968, but they divorced in 1973. She formed a relationship with fellow novelist Graeme Gibson soon afterward and moved to a farm near Alliston, Ontario, where their daughter, Eleanor Jess Atwood Gibson, was born in 1976.\nThe family returned to Toronto in 1980. Atwood and Gibson were together until September 18, 2019, when Gibson died after suffering from dementia. She wrote about Gibson in the poem \"Dearly\" and in an accompanying essay on grief and poetry published in \"The Guardian\" in 2020. Atwood said about Gibson \"He wasn't an egotist, so he wasn't threatened by anything I was doing. He said to our daughter towards the end of his life, 'Your mum would still have been a writer if she hadn't met me, but she wouldn't have had as much fun'\".\nAlthough she is an accomplished writer, Atwood says that she is \"a terrible speller\" who writes both on a computer and by hand.\nAtwood maintains a summer home on Pelee Island in Lake Erie.\nCareer.\n1960s.\nAtwood's first book of poetry, \"Double Persephone\", was published as a pamphlet by John Robert Colombo's Hawkshead Press in 1961, and won the E. J. Pratt Medal. While continuing to write, Atwood was a lecturer in English at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, from 1964 to 1965, Instructor in English at the Sir George Williams University in Montreal from 1967 to 1968, and taught at the University of Alberta in Edmonton from 1969 to 1970. In 1966, \"The Circle Game\" was published, winning the Governor General's Award. This collection was followed by three other small press collections of poetry: \"Kaleidoscopes Baroque: a poem\", Cranbrook Academy of Art (1965); \"Talismans for Children\", Cranbrook Academy of Art (1965); and \"Speeches for Doctor Frankenstein\", Cranbrook Academy of Art (1966); as well as \"The Animals in That Country\" (1968). Atwood's first novel, \"The Edible Woman\", was published in 1969. As a social satire of North American consumerism, many critics have often cited the novel as an early example of the feminist concerns found in many of Atwood's works.\n1970s.\nAtwood taught at York University in Toronto from 1971 to 1972 and was a writer in residence at the University of Toronto during the 1972/1973 academic year. Atwood published six collections of poetry over the course of the decade: \"The Journals of Susanna Moodie\" (1970), \"Procedures for Underground\" (1970), \"Power Politics\" (1971), \"You Are Happy\" (1974), \"Selected Poems 1965\u20131975\" (1976), and \"Two-Headed Poems\" (1978). Atwood also published three novels during this time: \"Surfacing\" (1972); \"Lady Oracle\" (1976); and \"Life Before Man\" (1979), which was a finalist for the Governor General's Award. \"Surfacing\", \"Lady Oracle\", and \"Life Before Man\", like \"The Edible Woman\", explore identity and social constructions of gender as they relate to topics such as nationhood and sexual politics. In particular, \"Surfacing\", along with her first non-fiction monograph, \"\" (1972), helped establish Atwood as an important and emerging voice in Canadian literature. In 1977 Atwood published her first short story collection, \"Dancing Girls\", which was the winner of the St. Lawrence Award for Fiction and the award of The Periodical Distributors of Canada for Short Fiction.\nBy 1976, there was such interest in Atwood, her works, and her life that \"Maclean's\" declared her to be \"Canada's most gossiped-about writer.\"\n1980s.\nAtwood's literary reputation continued to rise in the 1980s with the publication of \"Bodily Harm\" (1981); \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (1985), winner of the Arthur C. Clarke Award and 1985 Governor General's Award and finalist for the 1986 Booker Prize; and \"Cat's Eye\" (1988), finalist for both the 1988 Governor General's Award and the 1989 Booker Prize. Despite her distaste for literary labels, Atwood has since conceded to referring to \"The Handmaid's Tale\" as a work of science fiction or, more precisely, speculative fiction. As she has repeatedly noted, \"There's a precedent in real life for everything in the book. I decided not to put anything in that somebody somewhere hadn't already done.\"\nWhile reviewers and critics have been tempted to read autobiographical elements of Atwood's life in her work, particularly \"Cat's Eye\",xxx in general Atwood resists the desire of critics to read too closely for an author's life in their writing. Filmmaker Michael Rubbo's \"\" (1984) details the filmmaker's frustration in uncovering autobiographical evidence and inspiration in Atwood's works.\nDuring the 1980s, Atwood continued to teach, serving as the MFA Honorary Chair at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, 1985; the Berg Professor of English, New York University, 1986; Writer-in-Residence, Macquarie University, Australia, 1987; and Writer-in-Residence, Trinity University, San Antonio, Texas, 1989. Regarding her stints with teaching, she has noted, \"Success for me meant no longer having to teach at university.\"\n1990s.\nAtwood's reputation as a writer continued to grow with the publication of the novels \"The Robber Bride\" (1993), finalist for the 1994 Governor General's Award and shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. Award, and \"Alias Grace\" (1996), winner of the 1996 Giller Prize, finalist for the 1996 Booker Prize, finalist for the 1996 Governor General's Award, and shortlisted for the 1997 Orange Prize for Fiction. Although vastly different in context and form, both novels use female characters to question good and evil and morality through their portrayal of female villains. As Atwood noted about \"The Robber Bride\", \"I'm not making a case for evil behavior, but unless you have some women characters portrayed as evil characters, you're not playing with a full range.\" \"The Robber Bride\" takes place in contemporary Toronto, while \"Alias Grace\" is a work of historical fiction detailing the 1843 murders of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper Nancy Montgomery. \nAtwood had previously written the 1974 CBC made-for-TV film \"The Servant Girl\", about the life of Grace Marks, the young servant who, along with James McDermott, was convicted of the crime. Atwood continued her poetry contributions by publishing \"Snake Woman\" in 1999 for the Women's Literature journal Kalliope.\n2000s.\nNovels.\nIn 2000, Atwood published her tenth novel, \"The Blind Assassin\", to critical acclaim, winning both the Booker Prize and the Hammett Prize in 2000. \"The Blind Assassin\" was also nominated for the Governor General's Award in 2000, Orange Prize for Fiction, and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2002. In 2001, Atwood was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.\nAtwood followed this success with the publication of \"Oryx and Crake\" in 2003, the first novel in a series that also includes \"The Year of the Flood\" (2009) and \"MaddAddam\" (2013), which would collectively come to be known as the MaddAddam Trilogy. The apocalyptic vision in the MaddAddam Trilogy engages themes of genetic modification, pharmaceutical and corporate control, and man-made disaster. As a work of speculative fiction, Atwood notes of the technology in \"Oryx and Crake\", \"I think, for the first time in human history, we see where we might go. We can see far enough into the future to know that we can't go on the way we've been going forever without inventing, possibly, a lot of new and different things.\" She later cautions in the acknowledgements to \"MaddAddam\", \"Although \"MaddAddam\" is a work of fiction, it does not include any technologies or bio-beings that do not already exist, are not under construction or are not possible in theory.\"\nIn 2005, Atwood published the novella \"The Penelopiad\" as part of the Canongate Myth Series. The story is a retelling of \"The Odyssey\" from the perspective of Penelope and a chorus of the twelve maids murdered at the end of the original tale. \"The Penelopiad\" was given a theatrical production in 2007.\nIn 2016, Atwood published the novel \"Hag-Seed\", a modern-day retelling of Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\", as part of Penguin Random House's Hogarth Shakespeare Series.\nOn November 28, 2018, Atwood announced that she would publish \"The Testaments\", a sequel to \"The Handmaid's Tale\", in September 2019. The novel features three female narrators and takes place fifteen years after the character Offred's final scene in \"The Handmaid's Tale\". The book was the joint winner of the 2019 Booker Prize.\nNonfiction.\nIn 2008, Atwood published \"\", a collection of five lectures delivered as part of the Massey Lectures from October 12 to November 1, 2008. The book was released in anticipation of the lectures, which were also recorded and broadcast on CBC Radio One's \"Ideas\".\nChamber opera.\nIn March 2008, Atwood accepted a chamber opera commission. Commissioned by City Opera of Vancouver, \"Pauline\" is set in Vancouver in March 1913 during the final days of the life of Canadian writer and performer Pauline Johnson. \"Pauline\", composed by Tobin Stokes with libretto by Atwood, premiered on May 23, 2014, at Vancouver's York Theatre.\nGraphic fiction.\nIn 2016, Atwood began writing the superhero comic book series \"Angel Catbird\", with co-creator and illustrator Johnnie Christmas. The series protagonist, scientist Strig Feleedus, is victim of an accidental mutation that leaves him with the body parts and powers of both a cat and a bird. As with her other works, Atwood notes of the series, \"The kind of speculative fiction about the future that I write is always based on things that are in process right now. So it's not that I imagine them, it's that I notice that people are working on them and I take it a few steps further down the road. So it doesn't come out of nowhere, it comes out of real life.\"\nFuture Library project.\nWith her novel \"Scribbler Moon\", Atwood is the first contributor to the Future Library project. The work, completed in 2015, was ceremonially handed over to the project on May 27 of the same year. The book will be held by the project until its eventual publishing in 2114. She thinks that readers will probably need a paleo-anthropologist to translate some parts of her story. In an interview with the \"Guardian\" newspaper, Atwood said, \"There's something magical about it. It's like \"Sleeping Beauty\". The texts are going to slumber for 100 years and then they'll wake up, come to life again. It's a fairytale length of time. She slept for 100 years.\"\nInvention of the LongPen.\nIn early 2004, while on the paperback tour in Denver for her novel \"Oryx and Crake\", Atwood conceived the concept of a remote robotic writing technology, what would later be known as the LongPen, that would enable a person to remotely write in ink anywhere in the world via tablet PC and the Internet, thus allowing her to conduct her book tours without being physically present. She quickly founded a company, Unotchit Inc., to develop, produce and distribute this technology. By 2011, the company shifted its market focus into business and legal transactions and was producing a range of products, for a variety of remote writing applications, based on the LongPen technologies. In 2013, the company renamed itself to Syngrafii Inc. In 2021, it is cloud-based and offers electronic signature technology. As of May 2021, Atwood is still a director of Syngrafii Inc. and holder of various patents related to the LongPen and related technology.\nPoetry.\nIn November 2020 Atwood published \"Dearly,\" a collection of poems exploring absences and endings, ageing and retrospection, and gifts and renewals. The central poem, \"Dearly\", was also published in \"The Guardian\" newspaper along with an essay exploring the passing of time, grief, and how a poem belongs to the reader; this is accompanied by an audio recording of Atwood reading the poem on the newspaper's website.\nRecurring themes and cultural contexts.\nTheory of Canadian identity.\nAtwood's contributions to the theorizing of Canadian identity have garnered attention both in Canada and internationally. Her principal work of literary criticism, \"\", is considered somewhat outdated, but remains a standard introduction to Canadian literature in Canadian studies programs internationally. Writer and academic Joseph Pivato has criticised the continued reprinting of \"Survival\" by Anansi Press as a view-narrowing disservice to students of Canadian literature.\nIn \"Survival\", Atwood postulates that Canadian literature, and by extension Canadian identity, is characterized by the symbol of survival. This symbol is expressed in the omnipresent use of \"victim positions\" in Canadian literature. These positions represent a scale of self-consciousness and self-actualization for the victim in the \"victor/victim\" relationship. The \"victor\" in these scenarios may be other humans, nature, the wilderness or other external and internal factors which oppress the victim. Atwood's \"Survival\" bears the influence of Northrop Frye's theory of garrison mentality; Atwood uses Frye's concept of Canada's desire to wall itself off from outside influence as a critical tool to analyze Canadian literature. According to her theories in works such as \"Survival\" and her exploration of similar themes in her fiction, Atwood considers Canadian literature as the expression of Canadian identity. According to this literature, Canadian identity has been defined by a fear of nature, by settler history, and by unquestioned adherence to the community. In an interview with the Scottish critic Bill Findlay in 1979, Atwood discussed the relationship of Canadian writers and writing to the 'Imperial Cultures' of America and Britain.\nAtwood's contribution to the theorizing of Canada is not limited to her non-fiction works. Several of her works, including \"The Journals of Susanna Moodie\", \"Alias Grace\", \"The Blind Assassin\" and \"Surfacing\", are examples of what postmodern literary theorist Linda Hutcheon calls \"historiographic metafiction\". In such works, Atwood explicitly explores the relation of history and narrative and the processes of creating history.\nAmong her contributions to Canadian literature, Atwood is a founding trustee of the Griffin Poetry Prize, as well as a founder of the Writers' Trust of Canada, a non-profit literary organization that seeks to encourage Canada's writing community.\nFeminism.\nAtwood's work has been of interest to feminist literary critics, despite Atwood's unwillingness at times to apply the label 'feminist' to her works. Starting with the publication of her first novel, \"The Edible Woman\", Atwood asserted, \"I don't consider it feminism; I just consider it social realism.\"\nDespite her rejection of the label at times, critics have analyzed the sexual politics, use of myth and fairytale, and gendered relationships in Atwood's work through the lens of feminism. Before the 1985 publication of \"The Handmaid's Tale\", Atwood gave an interview to feminist theorist Elizabeth Meese in which she defined feminism as a \"belief in the rights of women\" and averred that \"if practical, hardline, anti-male feminists took over and became the government, I would resist them.\" In 2017, she clarified her discomfort with the label \"feminism\" by stating, \"I always want to know what people mean by that word [feminism]. Some people mean it quite negatively, other people mean it very positively, some people mean it in a broad sense, other people mean it in a more specific sense. Therefore, in order to answer the question, you have to ask the person what they mean.\" Speaking to \"The Guardian\", she said \"For instance, some feminists have historically been against lipstick and letting transgender women into women's washrooms. Those are not positions I have agreed with\", a position she repeated to \"The Irish Times\". In an interview with Penguin Books, Atwood stated that the driving question throughout her writing of \"The Handmaid's Tale\" was \"If you were going to shove women back into the home and deprive them of all of these gains that they thought they had made, how would you do it?\", but related this question to totalitarianism, not feminism.\nIn January 2018, Atwood penned the op-ed \"Am I a Bad Feminist?\" for \"The Globe and Mail\". The piece was in response to social media backlash related to Atwood's signature on a 2016 petition calling for an independent investigation into the firing of Steven Galloway, a former University of British Columbia professor accused of sexual harassment and assault by a student. While feminist critics denounced Atwood for her support of Galloway, Atwood asserted that her signature was in support of due process in the legal system. She has been criticized for her comments surrounding the #MeToo movement, particularly that it is a \"symptom of a broken legal system\".\nIn 2018, following a partnership between Hulu's adaptation of \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and women's rights organisation Equality Now, Atwood was honored at their 2018 Make Equality Reality Gala. In her acceptance speech she said:\nI am, of course, not a real activist\u2014I'm simply a writer without a job who is frequently asked to speak about subjects that would get people with jobs fired if they themselves spoke. You, however, at Equality Now are real activists. I hope people will give Equality Now lots and lots of money, today, so they can write equal laws, enact equal laws and see that equal laws are implemented. That way, in time, all girls may be able to grow up believing that there are no avenues that are closed to them simply because they are girls.\nIn 2019, Atwood partnered with Equality Now for the release of \"The Testaments\".\nSpeculative and science fiction.\nAtwood has resisted the suggestion that \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Oryx and Crake\" are science fiction, suggesting to \"The Guardian\" in 2003 that they are speculative fiction: \"Science fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen.\" She told the Book of the Month Club: \"\"Oryx and Crake\" is a speculative fiction, not a science fiction proper. It contains no intergalactic space travel, no teleportation, no Martians.\" On \"BBC Breakfast\", she explained that science fiction, as opposed to what she herself wrote, was \"talking squids in outer space.\" The latter phrase particularly rankled advocates of science fiction and frequently recurs when her writing is discussed.\nIn 2005, Atwood said that she did at times write social science fiction and that \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Oryx and Crake\" could be designated as such. She clarified her meaning on the difference between speculative and science fiction, admitting that others used the terms interchangeably: \"For me, the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can't yet do\u00a0... Speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand and that takes place on Planet Earth.\" She said that science fiction narratives give a writer the ability to explore themes in ways that realistic fiction cannot.\nAtwood further clarified her definitions of terms in 2011, in a discussion with science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin: \"What Le Guin means by 'science fiction' is what I mean by 'speculative fiction', and what she means by 'fantasy' would include what I mean by 'science fiction'.\" She added that genre borders were increasingly fluid, and that all forms of \"SF\" might be placed under a common umbrella.\nReception.\nIn 2024 the Republican-dominated Utah Legislature passed a law mandating the removal of books deemed objectionable from all Utah public schools. On August 2, 2024, the Utah State School Board released its first list of objectionable books. One book on this list was penned by Atwood (\"Oryx and Crake\").\nAnimal rights.\nAtwood repeatedly makes observations about the relationships of humans to animals in her works. A large portion of the dystopia Atwood creates in \"Oryx and Crake\" concerns the genetic modification and alteration of animals and humans, resulting in hybrids such as pigoons, rakunks, wolvogs and Crakers, raising questions on the limits and ethics of science and technology, and on what it means to be human.\nIn \"Surfacing\", one character remarks about eating animals: \"The animals die that we may live, they are substitute people\u00a0... And we eat them, out of cans or otherwise; we are eaters of death, dead Christ-flesh resurrecting inside us, granting us life.\" Some characters in her books link sexual oppression to meat-eating and consequently give up meat-eating. In \"The Edible Woman\", Atwood's character Marian identifies with hunted animals and cries after hearing her fianc\u00e9's experience of hunting and eviscerating a rabbit. Marian stops eating meat but then later returns to it.\nIn \"Cat's Eye\", the narrator recognizes the similarity between a turkey and a baby. She looks at \"the turkey, which resembles a trussed, headless baby. It has thrown off its disguise as a meal and has revealed itself to me for what it is, a large dead bird.\" In Atwood's \"Surfacing\", a dead heron represents purposeless killing and prompts thoughts about other senseless deaths.\nAtwood is a pescetarian. In a 2009 interview she stated that \"I shouldn't use the term vegetarian because I'm allowing myself gastropods, crustaceans and the occasional fish. Nothing with fur or feathers though\".\nPolitical involvement.\nAtwood has indicated in an interview that she considers herself a Red Tory in what she sees as the historical sense of the term, saying that \"The Tories were the ones who believed that those in power had a responsibility to the community, that money should not be the measure of all things.\" She has also stated on Twitter that she is a monarchist. In the 2008 federal election, she attended a rally for the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a Quebec pro-independence party, because of her support for their position on the arts; she said she would vote for the party if she lived in Quebec, and that the choice was between the Bloc and the Conservatives. In an editorial in \"The Globe and Mail\", she urged Canadians to vote for any party other than the Conservatives to prevent them gaining a majority.\nAtwood has strong views on environmental issues, and she and Graeme Gibson were the joint honorary presidents of the Rare Bird Club within BirdLife International. Atwood celebrated her 70th birthday at a gala dinner at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario. She stated that she had chosen to attend the event because the city has been home to one of Canada's most ambitious environmental reclamation programs: \"When people ask if there's hope (for the environment), I say, if Sudbury can do it, so can you. Having been a symbol of desolation, it's become a symbol of hope.\" Atwood has been chair of the Writers' Union of Canada and helped to found the Canadian English-speaking chapter of PEN International, a group originally started to free politically imprisoned writers. She held the position of PEN Canada president in the mid 1980s and was the 2017 recipient of the PEN Center USA's Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite calls for a boycott by Gazan students, Atwood visited Israel and accepted the $1,000,000 Dan David Prize along with Indian author Amitav Ghosh at Tel Aviv University in May 2010. Atwood commented that \"we don't do cultural boycotts.\"\nIn her dystopian novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (1985), all the developments take place near Boston in the United States, now known as Gilead, while Canada is portrayed as the only hope for an escape. To some this reflects her status of being \"in the vanguard of Canadian anti-Americanism of the 1960s and 1970s\". Critics have seen the mistreated Handmaid as Canada. During the debate in 1987 over a free-trade agreement between Canada and the United States, Atwood spoke out against the deal and wrote an essay opposing it. She said that the 2016 United States presidential election led to an increase in sales of \"The Handmaid's Tale\". Amazon reported that \"The Handmaid's Tale\" was the most-read book of 2017. \"The Handmaid's Tale\" sequel, \"The Testaments\", also saw a rapid increase of sales immediately following the 2024 United States presidential election, with \"The Handmaid's Tale\" reaching third in Amazon's bestseller's list. Following this election, Atwood wrote on X, \"Despair is not an option. It helps no one.\"\nTV cameos.\nIn 2024, Atwood had a cameo in a season 17 episode of \"Murdoch Mysteries\" as Lorin Quinelle, an amateur ornithologist.\nActivism.\nIn 2018, Atwood signed an appeal of the American PEN Center in defense of Ukrainian director Oleg Sentsov, a political prisoner in Russia.\nIn July 2020, Atwood was one of the 153 signers of the \"Harper's Letter\" (also known as \"A Letter on Justice and Open Debate\") that expressed concern that \"the free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted.\"\nOn February 24, 2022, Atwood briefly covered the war in Ukraine at the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and published a link to the state aid fund on Twitter. She continues to publish information about the war in Ukraine on the social network.\nIn 2024, Atwood worked with Climate Words, a nonprofit that is dedicated to bridging gaps in climate communication and breaking down barriers to meaningful dialogue about climate justice, on the meaning behind the term circumpollutionarity. Atwood refers to circumpollutionarity as the pollution of circumpolar lands and waters.\nAdaptations.\nAtwood's novel \"Surfacing\" (1972) was adapted into a 1981 film of the same name written by Bernard Gordon and directed by Claude Jutra. It received poor reviews; one reviewer wrote that it made \"little attempt to find cinematic equivalents for the admittedly difficult subjective and poetic dimensions of the novel.\"\nAtwood's novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (1985) has been adapted several times. A 1990 film, directed by Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff, with a screenplay by Harold Pinter, received mixed reviews. A musical adaptation resulted in the 2000 opera, written by Poul Ruders, with a libretto by Paul Bentley. It premiered at the Royal Danish Opera in 2000, and was staged in 2003 at London's English National Opera and the Minnesota Opera. Boston Lyric Opera mounted a production in May 2019, described by \"The New York Times\" as \"a triumph\". A television series by Bruce Miller began airing on the streaming service Hulu in 2017. The first season of the show earned eight Emmys in 2017, including Outstanding Drama Series. Season two premiered on April 25, 2018, and it was announced on May 2, 2018, that Hulu had renewed the series for a third season. Atwood appears in a cameo in the first episode as one of the Aunts at the Red Center. In 2019, a graphic novel () based on the book and with the same title was published by Ren\u00e9e Nault.\nIn 2003, six of Atwood's short stories were adapted by Shaftesbury Films for the anthology television series \"The Atwood Stories\".\nAtwood's 2008 Massey Lectures were adapted into the documentary \"Payback\" (2012), by director Jennifer Baichwal. Commentary by Atwood and others such as economist Raj Patel, ecologist William E. Rees, and religious scholar Karen Armstrong, are woven into various stories that explore the concepts of debt and payback, including an Armenian blood feud, agricultural working conditions, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\nThe novel \"Alias Grace\" (1996) was adapted into a six-part 2017 miniseries directed by Mary Harron and adapted by Sarah Polley. It premiered on CBC on September 25, 2017, and the full series was released on Netflix on November 3, 2017. Atwood makes a cameo in the fourth episode of the series as a disapproving churchgoer.\n\"In the Wake of the Flood\" (released in October 2010), a documentary film by the Canadian director Ron Mann, followed Atwood on the unusual book tour for her novel \"The Year of the Flood\" (2009). During this innovative book tour, Atwood created a theatrical version of her novel, with performers borrowed from the local areas she was visiting.

It is distinguished from earlier dip pens by using an internal reservoir to hold ink, eliminating the need to repeatedly dip the pen in an inkwell during use. The pen draws ink from the reservoir through a feed to the nib and deposits the ink on paper via a combination of gravity and capillary action. Filling the reservoir with ink may be achieved manually, via the use of an eyedropper or syringe, or via an internal filling mechanism that creates suction (for example, through a piston mechanism) or a vacuum to transfer ink directly through the nib into the reservoir. Some pens employ removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges.\nHistory.\nEarly prototypes of reservoir pens.\nAccording to Qadi al-Nu'man al-Tamimi (d.\u2009974) in his \"Kitab al-Majalis wa 'l-musayarat\", the Fatimid caliph Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah (reigned 953\u2013975) in Arab Egypt demanded a pen that would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen that held ink in a reservoir, allowing it to be held upside-down without leaking.\nThere is compelling evidence that a working fountain pen was constructed and used during the Renaissance by artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo's journals contain drawings with cross-sections of what appears to be a reservoir pen that works by both gravity and capillary action. Historians also took note of the fact that the handwriting in the inventor's surviving journals is of a consistent contrast throughout, rather than exhibiting the characteristic fading pattern typical of a quill pen caused by expending and re-dipping. While no physical item survives, several working models were reconstructed in 2011 by artist Amerigo Bombara that have since been put on display in museums dedicated to Leonardo.\nEuropean reservoir models.\nThe fountain pen was available in Europe in the 17th century and is shown by contemporary references. In \"Delici\u00e6 Physico-Mathematic\u00e6\" (a 1636 magazine), German inventor Daniel Schwenter described a pen made from two quills. One quill served as a reservoir for ink inside the other quill. The ink was sealed inside the quill with cork. Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point. In 1663 Samuel Pepys referred to a metal pen \"to carry ink\". Noted Maryland historian Hester Dorsey Richardson (1862\u20131933) documented a reference to \"three silver fountain pens, worth 15 shillings\" in England during the reign of Charles II, c. 1649\u20131685. By the early 18th century such pens were already commonly known as \"fountain pens\". Hester Dorsey Richardson also found a 1734 notation made by Robert Morris the elder in the ledger of the expenses of Robert Morris the younger, who was at the time in Philadelphia, for \"one fountain pen\". Perhaps the best-known reference, however, is that of Nicholas Bion (1652\u20131733), whose illustrated description of a \"plume sans fin\" was published in 1709 in his treatise published in English in 1723 as \"The Construction and Principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments\". The earliest datable pen of the form described by Bion is inscribed 1702, while other examples bear French hallmarks as late as the early 19th century.\nFirst patents.\nProgress in developing a reliable pen was slow until the mid-19th century because of an imperfect understanding of the role that air pressure plays in the operation of pens. Furthermore, most inks were highly corrosive and full of sedimentary inclusions. The first English patent for a fountain pen was issued in May 1809 to Frederick F\u00f6lsch, with a patent covering (among other things) an improved fountain pen feed issued to Joseph Bramah in September 1809. John Scheffer's patent of 1819 was the first design to see commercial success, with a number of surviving examples of his \"Penographic\" known. Another noteworthy pioneer design was John Jacob Parker's, patented in 1832 \u2013 a self-filler with a screw-operated piston. The Romanian inventor Petrache Poenaru received a French patent on 25 May 1827, for the invention of a fountain pen with a barrel made from a large swan quill.\nMass-manufactured nibs.\nIn 1828, Josiah Mason improved a cheap and efficient slip-in nib in Birmingham, England, which could be added to a fountain pen. In 1830, with the invention of a new machine, William Joseph Gillott, William Mitchell, and James Stephen Perry devised a way to mass manufacture robust, cheap steel pen nibs (Perry &amp; Co.). This boosted the Birmingham pen trade and by the 1850s, more than half the steel-nib pens manufactured in the world were made in Birmingham. Thousands of skilled craftsmen were employed in the industry. Many new manufacturing techniques were perfected, enabling the city's factories to mass-produce their pens cheaply and efficiently. These were sold worldwide to many who previously could not afford to write, thus encouraging the development of education and literacy.\nNew patents and inventions.\nIn 1848, American inventor Azel Storrs Lyman patented a pen with \"a combined holder and nib\". In 1849 Scottish inventor Robert William Thomson invented the refillable fountain pen. From the 1850s, there was a steadily accelerating stream of fountain pen patents and pens in production. However, it was only after three key inventions were in place that the fountain pen became a widely popular writing instrument. Those were the iridium-tipped gold nib, hard rubber, and free-flowing ink.\nThe first fountain pens making use of all these key ingredients appeared in the 1850s. In the 1870s Duncan MacKinnon, a Canadian living in New York City, and Alonzo T. Cross of Providence, Rhode Island, created stylographic pens with a hollow, tubular nib and a wire acting as a valve. Stylographic pens are now used mostly for drafting and technical drawing but were very popular in the decade beginning in 1875. In the 1880s the era of the mass-produced fountain pen finally began. The dominant American producers in this pioneer era were Waterman, of New York City, and Wirt, based in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Waterman soon outstripped Wirt, along with many companies that sprang up to fill the new and growing fountain pen market. Waterman remained the market leader until the early 1920s.\nAt this time, fountain pens were almost all filled by unscrewing a portion of the hollow barrel or holder and inserting the ink by means of a dropper \u2013 a slow and messy procedure. Pens also tended to leak inside their caps and at the joint where the barrel opened for filling. Now that the materials' problems had been overcome and the flow of ink while writing had been regulated, the next problems to be solved were the creation of a simple, convenient self-filler and the problem of leakage. Self-fillers began to gain in popularity around the turn of the century; the most successful of these was probably the Conklin crescent-filler, followed by A. A. Waterman's twist-filler. The tipping point, however, was the runaway success of Walter A. Sheaffer's lever-filler, introduced in 1912, paralleled by Parker's roughly contemporary button-filler.\nPen leakage.\nMeanwhile, many inventors turned their attention to the problem of leakage. Some of the earliest solutions to this problem came in the form of a \"safety\" pen with a retractable point that allowed the ink reservoir to be corked like a bottle. Horton, Moore, and Caw's were the earliest makers of such pens, all starting in the 1890s.\nIn 1898, George Safford Parker released the Parker Jointless, so named because its barrel was single-piece with no section joint to leak and stain the writer's fingers. The nib and feed assembly fit into the barrel's end like a cork stopper.\nIn 1908, Waterman began marketing a popular safety pen of its own. For pens with non-retractable nibs, the adoption of screw-on caps with inner caps that sealed around the nib by bearing against the front of the section effectively solved the leakage problem (such pens were also marketed as \"safety pens\", as with the Parker Jack-Knife Safety and the Swan Safety Screw-Cap).\nFurther innovation.\nIn Europe, the German office supplies company Gunther Wagner, founded in 1838, introduced their Pelikan in 1929, the first modern screw piston-filling fountain pen. This was based upon the acquisition of patents for solid-ink fountain pens from the factory of Slavoljub Penkala from Croatia (patented 1907, in mass production since 1911), and the patent of the Hungarian Theodor Kovacs for the modern piston filler by 1925.\nThe decades that followed saw many technological innovations in the manufacture of fountain pens. Celluloid gradually replaced hard rubber, which enabled production in a much wider range of colors and designs. At the same time, manufacturers experimented with new filling systems. The inter-war period saw the introduction of some of the most notable models, such as the Parker Duofold and Vacumatic, Sheaffer's Lifetime Balance series, and the Pelikan 100.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, fountain pens retained their dominance: early ballpoint pens were expensive, were prone to leaks and had irregular inkflow, while the fountain pen continued to benefit from the combination of mass production and craftsmanship. (B\u00edr\u00f3's patent, and other early patents on ball-point pens often used the term \"ball-point fountain pen,\" because at the time the ball-point pen was considered a type of fountain pen; that is, a pen that held ink in an enclosed reservoir.)\nThis period saw the launch of innovative models such as the Parker 51, the Aurora 88, the Sheaffer Snorkel, and the Eversharp Skyline, while the Esterbrook J series of lever-fill models with interchangeable steel nibs offered inexpensive reliability to the masses.\nPopular usage.\nBy the 1960s, refinements in ballpoint pen production gradually ensured its dominance over the fountain pen for casual use. Although cartridge-filler fountain pens are still in common use in France, Italy, Germany, Austria, India, and the United Kingdom, and are widely used by young students in most private schools in England, at least one private school in Scotland, and public elementary schools in Germany, a few modern manufacturers (especially Conway Stewart, Montblanc, Graf von Faber-Castell, and Visconti) now depict the fountain pen as a collectible item or a status symbol, rather than an everyday writing tool. However, fountain pens continue to have a growing following among many who view them as superior writing instruments due to their relative smoothness and versatility. Retailers continue to sell fountain pens and inks for casual and calligraphic use. During the 2010s, fountain pens have made a resurgence, with some retailers, such as Goulet Pens, saying it is because of renewed consumer interest in analog products. This has led to a new wave of casual use fountain pens and custom ink manufacturers, who utilize online stores to easily sell fountain pens to a wider audience.\nFeed.\nThe feed of a fountain pen is the component that connects the nib of the pen with its ink reservoir. It not only allows the ink to flow to the nib (in what is often described as a \"controlled leak\") but also regulates the amount of air flowing backwards up to the reservoir to replace this lost ink.\nThe feed uses a series of narrow channels or \"fissures\" that run down its lower edge. As ink flows down these fissures, air is simultaneously allowed to flow upwards into the reservoir in an even exchange of volumes. The feed allows ink to flow when the pen is being put to paper but ensures ink does not flow when the pen is not in use. The feed makes use of capillary action; this is noticeable when a pen is refilled with a brightly coloured ink. The ink is taken up and into the feed by way of capillary action (and is often visible in clear demonstrator pens), but is not dispensed onto the paper until the nib makes contact.\nHow the feed is shaped may determine the wetness and flow of a particular pen. For this reason, feed material alone and its surface roughness may have a significant effect on the way two pens of the same nib size write.\nPen feeds are crucial to preventing ink from dripping or leaking. Feeds often feature finned structures intended for buffering fountain pen ink. Buffering is the capacity to catch and temporarily hold an overflow of ink, caused by conditions other than writing. When a fountain pen nib receives such an overflow it will result in ink blobbing or dripping also known as burping. A pen with a misconfigured feed might fail to deposit any ink whatsoever.\nFiber feeds.\nSome fountain pens use a fiber wick underneath the nib. They often have a plastic part that looks like a feed that is only used to hold the fiber wick in place and does not assist with ink flow. The mechanism of action is like a felt pen, just with a fountain pen nib on top of it. The fiber feeds offer plenty of ink flow and can stay wet for extended periods. Cleaning fiber feed pens can require longer soaking in water.\nNibs.\nThe modern fountain pen nib is a direct descendant of the iridium-tipped gold dip pen nibs of the 19th century. The earliest attempts at adding a hard and long-wearing tipping material to a gold nib utilized materials such as ruby. A more successful approach exploited the discovery of the platinum group of metals, including ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. From the mid-1830s gold dip pen nibs tipped with iridium were produced in rapidly increasing quantities, first in England and soon thereafter in the United States. The first mass-produced fountain pens used gold nibs sourced from established makers of gold dip pen nibs, some of the most prominent being Mabie Todd, Fairchild, and Aikin Lambert. \nToday, nibs are usually made of stainless steel or gold, with the most popular gold alloys being 14 carat (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;58+1\u20443%) and 18 carat (75%). Titanium is a less common metal used for making nibs. Gold is considered the optimum metal for its flexibility and its resistance to corrosion, although gold's corrosion resistance is less of an issue than in the past because of better stainless steel alloys and less corrosive inks.\nPalladium alloys have been used occasionally in the past, usually as a money-saving alternative to white gold. As long as palladium remains more valuable than gold, however, it is unlikely to see much use for nib manufacture.\nNib plating.\nFurther gold plating provides favorable wettability, which is the ability of a solid surface to reduce the surface tension of a liquid in contact with it such that it spreads over the surface.\nNib tipping.\nGold and most steel and titanium nibs are tipped with a hard, wear-resistant alloy that typically includes metals from the platinum group. These metals share qualities of extreme hardness and corrosion resistance. The tipping material is often called \"iridium\", but few if any nib manufacturers have used tipping alloys containing iridium since the mid-1950s. The metals osmium, rhenium, ruthenium, and tungsten are used instead, generally as an alloy, produced as tiny pellets which are welded onto the nib's tip prior to cutting the nib slit and grinding the tip into its final shape. Untipped steel and titanium points will wear more rapidly due to abrasion by the paper.\nCapillary action.\nThe nib usually has a tapering or parallel slit cut down its centre, to convey the ink down the nib by capillary action, as well as a \"breather hole\" of varying shape. The breather hole's intended function is to allow air exchange with the ink reservoir through the channels of the feed, though some modern authorities believe this is a misconception and such venting is unnecessary. Some fountain pens come without a breather hole such as the Camlin Trinity, Monami Olika, Pelikan Pelikano, and Platinum Preppy. The breather hole's other main function is to provide an endpoint to the nib slit and an indexing point for slit cutting. The breather hole also acts as a stress relieving point, preventing the nib from cracking longitudinally from the end of the slit as a result of repeated flexing during use.\nThe nib narrows to a point where the ink is transferred to the paper. Extremely broad calligraphy pens may have several slits in the nib to increase ink flow and help distribute it evenly across the point, but such designs are more commonly found on dip pens. Nibs divided into three 'tines' are commonly known as music nibs. This is because their line, which can be varied from broad to fine, is suited for writing musical scores.\nTypes of nibs.\nAlthough the most common nibs end in a round point of various sizes (extra fine, fine, medium, broad), various other nib shapes are available. Examples of this are double broad, music, oblique, reverse oblique, stub, italic, and 360-degree nibs.\nBroader nibs are used for less precise emphasis, with the benefit of a greater level of ink shading, a property wherein ink pools in parts of a stroke to cause variations in color or sheen \u2013 where dyes in ink crystallize on a page instead of absorbing into the paper, which leads to a different color being seen on less absorbent paper due to thin film interference. Finer nibs (e.g. extra fine and fine) may be used for intricate corrections and alterations, at the expense of shading and sheen. Oblique, reverse oblique, stub, and italic nibs may be used for calligraphic purposes or for general handwritten compositions. The line width of a particular nib may vary based on its country of origin; Japanese nibs are often thinner in general.\nNib flexibility.\nFlexibility is a function of several factors. One is the nib material's resilience; another is its thickness. Finally there is the nib's shape, with longer tines offering more flexibility than short tines, while greater curvature increases stiffness. Contrary to common belief, material alone does not determine a nib's flexibility. Gold alloys of greater purity (18K, or 750/1000 gold) will on average be softer and less springy than alloys of lower purity (14K, or 585/1000 gold), but whatever the alloy its resilience can be altered considerably in manufacture by means of controlled work-hardening.\nFountain pens dating from the first half of the 20th century are more likely to have flexible nibs, suited to the favored handwriting styles of the period (e.g. Copperplate script and Spencerian script). By the 1940s, writing preferences had shifted towards stiffer nibs that could withstand the greater pressure required for writing through carbon paper to create duplicate documents.\nFurthermore, competition between the major pen brands such as Parker and Waterman, and the introduction of lifetime guarantees, meant that flexible nibs could no longer be supported profitably. In countries where this rivalry was not present to the same degree, such as the UK and Germany, flexible nibs are more common.\nNowadays, stiff nibs are the norm as people exchange between fountain pens and other writing modes. These more closely emulate the ballpoint pens most modern writers are experienced with. Despite being rigid and firm, the idea that steel nibs write \"horribly\" is a misconception. More flexible nibs can be easily damaged if excessive pressure is applied to them. Ideally, a fountain pen's nib glides across the paper using the ink as a lubricant, and writing requires no pressure.\nGood quality nibs that have been used appropriately are long lasting, often lasting longer than the lifetime of the original owner. Many vintage pens with decades-old nibs can still be used today.\nDifferent nib styles.\nOther styles of fountain pen nibs include hooded (e.g. Parker 51, Parker 61, 2007 Parker 100, Lamy 2000, and Hero 329), inlaid (e.g. Sheaffer Targa or Sheaffer P.F.M) or integral Nib (Parker T-1, Falcon, and Pilot Myu 701), .\nUsers are often cautioned not to lend or borrow fountain pens as the nib \"wears in\" at an angle unique to each individual person. A different user is likely to find that a worn-in nib does not write satisfactorily in their hand and, furthermore, creates a second wear surface, ruining the nib for the original user. This, however, is not a point of concern in pens with modern, durable tipping material, as these pens take many years to develop any significant wear.\nFilling mechanisms.\nEyedropper filler.\nThe reservoirs of the earliest fountain pens were mostly filled by eyedropper (\"dropper\" was the term used at the time). This could be messy, spurring development of so-called \"self-filling\" pens equipped with internal filling mechanisms. Though self-fillers had largely displaced dropper-fillers by the 1920s, they never went out of production, and there has been a revival of interest in recent years. For some, the simplicity, reliability, and large ink capacity of the dropper-filler provide ample compensation for its inconveniences.\nAfter the eyedropper-filler era came the first generation of mass-produced self-fillers, almost all using a rubber sac to hold the ink. The sac was compressed and then released by various mechanisms to fill the pen.\nSelf-filling designs.\nThe Conklin crescent filler, introduced c. 1901, was one of the first mass-produced self-filling pen designs. The crescent-filling system employs an arch-shaped crescent attached to a rigid metal pressure bar, with the crescent portion protruding from the pen through a slot and the pressure bar inside the barrel. A second component, a C-shaped hard rubber lock ring, is located between the crescent and the barrel. In normal use the ring blocks the crescent from being depressed. To fill the pen, the ring is turned until the gap in the ring is aligned with the crescent, allowing the crescent to be depressed, thus compressing the sac.\nMany other variations on the basic sac and pressure bar mechanism were introduced in the first decades of the 20th century, such as the coin-filler (with a slot on the barrel, allowing the pressure bar to be depressed by use of a coin), the matchstick-filler (with a round hole, for a matchstick) and the blow-filler (with a hole at the end of the barrel, through which one blew to compress the sac).\nPiston filling innovation.\nIn 1908 Walter A. Sheaffer received a patent for an improved lever-filling pen. Introduced in 1912, Sheaffer's pens sold in rapidly increasing numbers and by 1920 Sheaffer had become one of the largest fountain pen makers in the United States.\nParker introduced the button filler, which had a button hidden beneath a blind cap on the end of the barrel; when pressed, it acted on a pressure bar inside to depress the ink sac.\nOne of the most complex filling mechanisms was introduced in 1952 with the Sheaffer Snorkel. The Snorkel had an axial tube below the nib that could be extended, allowing the pen to be filled from a bottle without needing to immerse the nib or to wipe it off after filling. With the advent of the modern plastic ink cartridge in the early 1950s most of these filling systems were phased out.\nScrew-mechanism piston-fillers were made as early as the 1820s, but the mechanism's modern popularity begins with the original Pelikan of 1929, based upon a patent that was initially licensed to a Croatian company Moster-Penkala by inventor Theodore Kovacs. The basic idea is simple and intuitive: turn a knob at the end of the pen and a screw mechanism draws a piston up the barrel, sucking in ink. Pens with this mechanism remain very popular today. Some of the earlier models had to dedicate as much as half of the pen length to the mechanism.\nThe advent of telescoping pistons has improved this; the Touchdown Filler was introduced by Sheaffer in 1949. It was advertised as an \"Exclusive Pneumatic Down-stroke Filler.\"\nTo fill it, a knob at the end of the barrel is unscrewed and the attached plunger is drawn out to its full length. The nib is immersed in ink, the plunger is pushed in, compressing and then releasing the ink sac by means of air pressure. The nib is kept in the ink for approximately 10 seconds to allow the reservoir to fill. This mechanism is very closely modeled after a similar pneumatic filler introduced by Chilton over a decade earlier.\nModern filling mechanisms.\nA capillary filling system was introduced by Parker in the Parker 61 in 1956. There were no moving parts: the ink reservoir within the barrel was open at the upper end, but contained a tightly rolled length of slotted, flexible plastic. To fill, the barrel was unscrewed, the exposed open end of the reservoir was placed in ink and the interstices of the plastic sheet and slots initiated capillary action, drawing up and retaining the ink. The outside of the reservoir was coated with Teflon, a repellent compound that released excess ink as it was withdrawn. Ink was transferred through a further capillary tube to the nib. No method of flushing the device was offered, and because of problems from clogging with dried and hardened ink, production was eventually stopped.\nAround the year 2000, Pelikan introduced a filling system involving a valve in the blind end of the pen, which mates with a specially designed ink bottle. Thus docked, ink is then squeezed into the pen barrel (which, lacking any mechanism other than the valve itself, has nearly the capacity of an eyedropper-fill pen of the same size). This system had been implemented only in their \"Level\" line, which was discontinued in 2006.\nMost pens today use either a piston filler, squeeze-bar filler or cartridge. Many pens are also compatible with a \"converter\", which has the same fitting as the pen's cartridge and has a filling mechanism and a reservoir attached to it. This enables a pen to fill either from cartridges or from a bottle of ink. The most common type of converters are piston-style, but many other varieties may be found today. Piston-style converters generally have a transparent round tubular ink reservoir. Fountain pen inks feature differing surface tensions that can cause an ink to adhere or \"stick\" against the inside of the reservoir. Common solutions for this problem are adding a small (rust-proof) ink agitating object like a 316L or 904L stainless steel or zirconium dioxide bearing ball, spring or hollow tube in the tubular reservoir to mechanically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. Adding a very small amount of surfactant such as Triton X-100 used in Kodak Photo-Flo 200 wetting agent to the ink will chemically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. However, ink might react adversely to adding a surfactant.\nVacuum fillers, such as those used by Pilot in the Custom 823, utilize air pressure to fill the ink chamber. In this case, while the nib is submerged in ink, a plunger is pushed down the empty chamber to create a vacuum in the space behind it. The end of the chamber has a section wider than the rest, and when the plunger passes this point, the difference in air pressure in the area behind the plunger and the area ahead of it is suddenly evened out and ink rushes in behind the plunger to fill the chamber.\nConverters are also available in several different types such as piston, plunger, squeeze and push button in rare cases.\nCartridges.\nThe first commercially successful ink cartridge system for fountain pens was patented in 1890 by the Eagle Pencil Company, using glass cartridges. In the 1920s the John Hancock pen featured cartridges made from thin copper tubing. From the 1930s on, Waterman sold pens in France that used glass cartridges. Cartridge-filling pens only became truly popular in the 1950s, however, with the advent of plastic cartridges. The first was the Italian LUS Atomica in 1952, but it was the Waterman C/F in 1953 that brought cartridge filling to the attention of the international market. \nModern plastic cartridges can contain small ridges on the inside to promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. Often cartridges are closed with a small ball that gets pressed into the cartridge during insertion into the pen. This ball also aids free movement of the contained ink.\nStandard international.\nMost European fountain pen brands (for example Conway Stewart, Caran d'Ache, Faber-Castell, Michel Perchin, S.T. Dupont, Montegrappa, Stipula, Pelikan, Montblanc, Europen, Sigma, Delta, Italix, and Rotring) and some pen brands of other continents (for example Acura, Bexley, Esterbrook, Retro51, Tombow, and Platinum (with adaptor)) use so called \"international cartridges\" (AKA \"European cartridges\" or \"standard cartridges\" or \"universal cartridges\"), in short (38\u00a0mm in length, about 0.75 ml of capacity) or long (72\u00a0mm, 1.50 ml) sizes, or both. It is to some extent a standard, so the international cartridges of any manufacturer can be used in most fountain pens that accept international cartridges.\nAlso, converters that are meant to replace international cartridges can be used in most fountain pens that accept international cartridges. Some very compact fountain pens (for example Waterman Ici et La and Monteverde Diva) accept only short international cartridges. Converters can not be used in them (except for so-called mini-converters by Monteverde). Some pens (such as the modern Waterman models) have intentional fittings which prevent the usage of short cartridges. Such pens can only take a proprietary cartridge from the same manufacturer, in this case the long Waterman cartridges.\nProprietary offerings.\nMany fountain pen manufacturers have developed their own proprietary cartridges, for example Parker, Lamy, Sheaffer, Cross, Sailor, Platinum, Platignum, Waterman, and Namiki. Fountain pens from Aurora, Hero, Duke, and Uranus accept the same cartridges and converters that Parker uses and vice versa (Lamy cartridges, though not officially, are known to interchange with Parker cartridges also). Cartridges of Aurora are slightly different from cartridges by Parker.\nCorresponding converters to be used instead of such proprietary cartridges are usually made by the same company that made the fountain pen itself. Some very compact fountain pens accept only proprietary cartridges made by the same company that made that pen, such as Sheaffer Agio Compact and Sheaffer Prelude Compact. It is not possible to use a converter in them at all. In such pens the only practical way to use another brand of ink is to fill empty cartridges with bottled ink using a syringe.\nStandard international cartridges are closed by a small ball, held inside the ink exit hole by glue or by a very thin layer of plastic. When the cartridge is pressed into the pen, a small pin pushes in the ball, which falls inside the cartridge. The Parker and Lamy cartridges do not have such a ball. They are closed by a piece of plastic, which is broken by a sharp pin when inserted in the pen.\nConcerns and alternatives.\nPen manufacturers that produce proprietary cartridges (which in almost all cases are the more expensive ones like the ones mentioned above) tend to discourage the use of cheaper internationally standardised short/long cartridges or adaptations thereof due to their variance in ink quality in the cartridges which may not offer as much performance, or be of lesser quality than the pen's ink cartridge that has been designed specifically for the pen itself. Due to potential additive deficits such as glycerides or uneven pigmentation, cheaper ink may also skip or produce uneven colour on the page and \"feather\" (spread out of the originally written line) more on thinner grades of paper (e.g. 75 gsm).\nWhile cartridges are more convenient to refill than bottle filling, converter and bottle filling systems are still sold. Non-cartridge filling systems tend to be slightly more economical in the long run since ink is generally less expensive in bottles than in cartridges. Advocates of bottle-based filling systems also cite less waste of plastic for the environment, a wider selection of inks, easier cleaning of pens (as drawing the ink in through the nib helps dissolve old ink), and the ability to check and refill inks at any time.\nInks.\nInks intended for use with fountain pens are water-based. These inks are commonly available in bottles. Plastic cartridges came into use in the 1950s, but bottled inks are still the mainstay for many fountain pen enthusiasts. Bottled inks usually cost less than an equivalent amount in cartridges and afford a wider variety of colours and properties.\nFountain pens are not as tightly coupled with their inks as ballpoints or gel pens are, yet some care must be taken when selecting their inks. Contemporary fountain pen inks are almost exclusively dye-based because pigment particles usually clog the narrow passages.\nTraditional iron gall inks intended for dip pens are not suitable for fountain pens as they will corrode the pen (a phenomenon known as flash corrosion) and destroy the functionality of the fountain pen. Instead, modern surrogate iron gall formulas are offered for fountain pens. These modern iron gall inks contain a small amount of ferro gallic compounds that are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still be corrosive if left in the pen for a long period. To avoid corrosion on delicate metal parts and ink clogging, a more thorough than usual cleaning regime \u2013 which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water \u2013 is sometimes advised by manufacturers or resellers.\nSome pigmented inks do exist for fountain pens, such as \"Carbon Black\" and \"Chou Kuro\" made by the brand Platinum as well as Rohrer &amp; Klingner and De Atramentis inks from Germany, but these are uncommon. Normal India ink cannot be used in fountain pens because it contains shellac as a binder which would very quickly clog such pens.\nInks ideally should be fairly free-flowing, free of sediment, and non-corrosive, though this generally excludes permanence and prevents large-scale commercial use of some colored dyes. Proper care and selection of ink will prevent most problems.\nToday.\nWhile no longer the primary writing instrument in modern times, fountain pens are used for important official works such as signing valuable documents. Today, fountain pens are often treated as luxury goods and sometimes as status symbols. Fountain pens may serve as an everyday writing instrument, much like the common ballpoint pen. Good quality steel and gold pens are available inexpensively today, particularly in Europe and China, and there are \"disposable\" fountain pens such as the Pilot Varsity. In France and Germany, in particular, the use of fountain pens is widespread, since in many European countries children still begin to learn writing with this kind of writing device. To avoid mistakes, special ink can be used that can be made invisible by applying an ink eraser.\nFountain pens can serve various artistic purposes such as expressive penmanship and calligraphy, pen and ink artwork, and professional art and design. Many users also favor the perceived elegance, personalization, and sentimentality associated with fountain pens, which computers and ballpoint pens seem to lack, and often state that once they start using fountain pens, ballpoints become awkward to use due to the extra motor effort needed and lack of expressiveness. For ergonomics, fountain pens may relieve physiological stress from writing; alternatives such as the ballpoint pen can induce more pain and damage to those with arthritis. Some also believe they could improve academic performance.\nIn some countries, fountain pens are usual in lower school grades, believed to teach children better control over writing as many common mistakes of people not used to handwriting (like too much pressure or incorrect hold) feel unnatural or are almost impossible when using traditional pen tips.\nFountain pens are a popular collectable. Fancier pens have been made of precious metals and sometimes even inlaid with jewels. Some are decorated with lacquer, including Japanese maki-e. Avid communities of pen enthusiasts collect and use antique and modern pens and also collect and exchange information about old and modern inks, ink bottles, and inkwells. Collectors may decide to use the antiques in addition to showcasing them in closed spaces such as glass displays.\nNews outlets report that rather than declining, fountain pen sales have been steadily rising over the last decade. There is a clear resurgence in the appeal and culture of the fountain pen, whether for purposes of collection, enjoyment or as a \"lifestyle item\". Many agree that the \"personal touch\" of a fountain pen has led to such a resurgence with modern consumers looking for an alternative in a world of digital products and services.\nAmazon reported \"sales so far this year [2012] have doubled compared with the same period in 2011. They are four times higher than 2010.\" The popularity of fountain pens continues to show growth. The market-research firm Euromonitor reported that fountain pen retail sales were up 2.1% in 2016 from a year earlier, reaching $1.046\u00a0billion.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The artist or writer dips the brush, quill, or dip pen into the inkwell as needed or uses the inkwell as the source for filling the reservoir of a fountain pen. An inkwell usually has a lid to prevent contamination, evaporation, accidental spillage, and excessive exposure to air. A type known as the travelling inkwell was fitted with a secure screw lid so a traveller could carry a supply of ink in their luggage without the risk of leakage.\nOrigins.\nThe inkwell's origins may be traced back to Ancient Egypt where scribes would write on papyrus. Knowledge of hieroglyphs was at the time highly restricted. Only scribes knew the full array of hieroglyphs and would write on the behalf of their employers, usually the pharaoh. After Rome invaded Egypt, inkwells became more popular in Italy as a larger percentage of the population were capable of writing.\nInkwells gradually fell out of use in the early part of 20th century as the reservoir fountain pen (which needs to be filled only occasionally) replaced the dip pen, which needed to be dipped in ink after writing a few lines. Old school desks had round holes for inkwells.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the past, it was an alloy of tin and as much as 40% lead, but most modern pewter, in order to prevent lead poisoning, is not made with lead. Pewter has a low melting point, around , depending on the exact mixture of metals. The word \"pewter\" is possibly a variation of \"spelter\", a term for zinc alloys (originally a colloquial name for zinc).\nHistory.\nPewter was first used around the beginning of the Bronze Age in the Near East. The earliest known piece of pewter was found in an Egyptian tomb, c.\u20091450\u00a0BC, but it is unlikely that this was the first use of the material. Pewter was used for decorative metal items and tableware in ancient times by the Egyptians and later the Romans, and came into extensive use in Europe from the Middle Ages until the various developments in pottery and glass-making during the 18th and 19th centuries. Pewter was a leading material for producing plates, cups, and bowls before the wide adoption of porcelain. Mass production of pottery, porcelain and glass products have almost universally replaced pewter in daily life, although pewter artifacts continue to be produced, mainly as decorative or specialty items. Pewter was also used around East Asia. Although some items still exist, ancient Roman pewter is rare.\nLidless mugs and lidded tankards may be the most familiar pewter artifacts from the late 17th and 18th centuries, although the metal was also used for many other items including porringers (shallow bowls), plates, dishes, basins, spoons, measures, flagons, communion cups, teapots, sugar bowls, beer steins (tankards), and cream jugs. In the early 19th century, changes in fashion caused a decline in the use of pewter flatware. At the same time, production increased of both cast and spun pewter tea sets, whale-oil lamps, candlesticks, and so on. Later in the century, pewter alloys were often used as a base metal for silver-plated objects.\nIn the late 19th century, pewter came back into fashion with the revival of medieval objects for decoration. New replicas of medieval pewter objects were created, and collected for decoration. Today, pewter is used in decorative objects, mainly collectible statuettes and figurines, game figures, aircraft and other models, (replica) coins, pendants, plated jewellery and so on. Certain athletic contests, such as the United States Figure Skating Championships, award pewter medals to fourth-place finishers.\nTypes.\nIn antiquity, pewter was tin alloyed with lead and sometimes also copper. Older pewters with higher lead content are heavier, tarnish faster, and their oxidation has a darker, silver-gray color. Pewters containing lead are no longer used in items that will come in contact with the human body (such as cups, plates, or jewelry), due to the toxicity of lead. Modern pewters are available that are completely free of lead, although many pewters containing lead are still being produced for other purposes.\nA typical European casting alloy contains 94% tin, 1% copper and 5% antimony. A European pewter sheet would contain 92% tin, 2% copper, and 6% antimony. Asian pewter, produced mostly in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, contains a higher percentage of tin, usually 97.5% tin, 1% copper, and 1.5% antimony. This makes the alloy slightly softer.\nThe term \"Mexican pewter\" is used for any of various alloys of aluminium that are used for decorative items.\nPewter is also used to imitate platinum in costume jewelry.\nProperties.\nPewter, being a softer material, can be manipulated in various ways such as being cast, hammered, turned, spun and engraved.\nGiven that pewter is soft at room temperature, a pewter bell does not ring clearly. Cooling it in liquid nitrogen hardens it and enables it to ring, but also makes it more brittle.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60289", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60289", "title": "Homeobox", "text": "DNA pattern affecting anatomy development\nA homeobox is a DNA sequence, around 180 base pairs long, that regulates large-scale anatomical features in the early stages of embryonic development. Mutations in a homeobox may change large-scale anatomical features of the full-grown organism.\nHomeoboxes are found within genes that are involved in the regulation of patterns of anatomical development (morphogenesis) in animals, fungi, plants, and numerous single cell eukaryotes. Homeobox genes encode homeodomain protein products that are transcription factors sharing a characteristic protein fold structure that binds DNA to regulate expression of target genes. Homeodomain proteins regulate gene expression and cell differentiation during early embryonic development, thus mutations in homeobox genes can cause developmental disorders. \nHomeosis is a term coined by William Bateson to describe the outright replacement of a discrete body part with another body part, e.g. antennapedia\u2014replacement of the antenna on the head of a fruit fly with legs. The \"homeo-\" prefix in the words \"homeobox\" and \"homeodomain\" stems from this mutational phenotype, which is observed when some of these genes are mutated in animals. The homeobox domain was first identified in a number of \"Drosophila\" homeotic and segmentation proteins, but is now known to be well-conserved in many other animals, including vertebrates.\nDiscovery.\nThe existence of homeobox genes was first discovered in \"Drosophila\" by isolating the gene responsible for a homeotic transformation where legs grow from the head instead of the expected antennae. Walter Gehring identified a gene called \"antennapedia\" that caused this homeotic phenotype. Analysis of \"antennapedia\" revealed that this gene contained a 180 base pair sequence that encoded a DNA binding domain, which William McGinnis termed the \"homeobox\". The existence of additional \"Drosophila\" genes containing the \"antennapedia\" homeobox sequence was independently reported by Ernst Hafen, Michael Levine, William McGinnis, and Walter Jakob Gehring of the University of Basel in Switzerland and Matthew P. Scott and Amy Weiner of Indiana University in Bloomington in 1984. Isolation of homologous genes by Edward de Robertis and William McGinnis revealed that numerous genes from a variety of species contained the homeobox. Subsequent phylogenetic studies detailing the evolutionary relationship between homeobox-containing genes showed that these genes are present in all bilaterian animals.\nHomeodomain structure.\nThe characteristic homeodomain protein fold consists of a 60-amino acid long domain composed of three alpha helices. The following shows the consensus homeodomain (~60 amino acid chain):\nHelix 2 and helix 3 form a so-called helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure, where the two alpha helices are connected by a short loop region. The N-terminal two helices of the homeodomain are antiparallel and the longer C-terminal helix is roughly perpendicular to the axes of the first two. It is this third helix that interacts directly with DNA via a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, as well as indirect interactions via water molecules, which occur between specific side chains and the exposed bases within the major groove of the DNA.\nHomeodomain proteins are found in eukaryotes. Through the HTH motif, they share limited sequence similarity and structural similarity to prokaryotic transcription factors, such as lambda phage proteins that alter the expression of genes in prokaryotes. The HTH motif shows some sequence similarity but a similar structure in a wide range of DNA-binding proteins (e.g., cro and repressor proteins, homeodomain proteins, etc.). One of the principal differences between HTH motifs in these different proteins arises from the stereochemical requirement for glycine in the turn which is needed to avoid steric interference of the beta-carbon with the main chain: for cro and repressor proteins the glycine appears to be mandatory, whereas for many of the homeotic and other DNA-binding proteins the requirement is relaxed.\nSequence specificity.\nHomeodomains can bind both specifically and nonspecifically to B-DNA with the C-terminal recognition helix aligning in the DNA's major groove and the unstructured peptide \"tail\" at the N-terminus aligning in the minor groove. The recognition helix and the inter-helix loops are rich in arginine and lysine residues, which form hydrogen bonds to the DNA backbone. Conserved hydrophobic residues in the center of the recognition helix aid in stabilizing the helix packing. Homeodomain proteins show a preference for the DNA sequence 5'-TAAT-3'; sequence-independent binding occurs with significantly lower affinity. The specificity of a single homeodomain protein is usually not enough to recognize specific target gene promoters, making cofactor binding an important mechanism for controlling binding sequence specificity and target gene expression. To achieve higher target specificity, homeodomain proteins form complexes with other transcription factors to recognize the promoter region of a specific target gene.\nBiological function.\nHomeodomain proteins function as transcription factors due to the DNA binding properties of the conserved HTH motif. Homeodomain proteins are considered to be master control genes, meaning that a single protein can regulate expression of many target genes. Homeodomain proteins direct the formation of the body axes and body structures during early embryonic development. Many homeodomain proteins induce cellular differentiation by initiating the cascades of coregulated genes required to produce individual tissues and organs. Other proteins in the family, such as NANOG are involved in maintaining pluripotency and preventing cell differentiation. \nRegulation.\nHox genes and their associated microRNAs are highly conserved developmental master regulators with tight tissue-specific, spatiotemporal control. These genes are known to be dysregulated in several cancers and are often controlled by DNA methylation. The regulation of Hox genes is highly complex and involves reciprocal interactions, mostly inhibitory. Drosophila is known to use the polycomb and trithorax complexes to maintain the expression of Hox genes after the down-regulation of the pair-rule and gap genes that occurs during larval development. Polycomb-group proteins can silence the Hox genes by modulation of chromatin structure.\nMutations.\nMutations to homeobox genes can produce easily visible phenotypic changes in body segment identity, such as the Antennapedia and Bithorax mutant phenotypes in \"Drosophila\". Duplication of homeobox genes can produce new body segments, and such duplications are likely to have been important in the evolution of segmented animals. \nEvolution.\nPhylogenetic analysis of homeobox gene sequences and homeodomain protein structures suggests that the last common ancestor of plants, fungi, and animals had at least two homeobox genes. Molecular evidence shows that some limited number of Hox genes have existed in the Cnidaria since before the earliest true Bilatera, making these genes pre-Paleozoic. It is accepted that the three major animal ANTP-class clusters, Hox, ParaHox, and NK (MetaHox), are the result of segmental duplications. A first duplication created MetaHox and ProtoHox, the latter of which later duplicated into Hox and ParaHox. The clusters themselves were created by tandem duplications of a single ANTP-class homeobox gene. Gene duplication followed by neofunctionalization is responsible for the many homeobox genes found in eukaryotes. Comparison of homeobox genes and gene clusters has been used to understand the evolution of genome structure and body morphology throughout metazoans.\nTypes of homeobox genes.\nHox genes.\nHox genes are the most commonly known subset of homeobox genes. They are essential metazoan genes that determine the identity of embryonic regions along the anterior-posterior axis. The first vertebrate Hox gene was isolated in \"Xenopus\" by Edward De Robertis and colleagues in 1984. The main interest in this set of genes stems from their unique behavior and arrangement in the genome. Hox genes are typically found in an organized cluster. The linear order of Hox genes within a cluster is directly correlated to the order in which they are expressed in both time and space during development. This phenomenon is called colinearity. \nMutations in these homeotic genes cause displacement of body segments during embryonic development. This is called ectopia. For example, when one gene is lost the segment develops into a more anterior one, while a mutation that leads to a gain of function causes a segment to develop into a more posterior one. Famous examples are \"Antennapedia\" and bithorax in \"Drosophila\", which can cause the development of legs instead of antennae and the development of a duplicated thorax, respectively.\nIn vertebrates, the four paralog clusters are partially redundant in function, but have also acquired several derived functions. For example, HoxA and HoxD specify segment identity along the limb axis. Specific members of the Hox family have been implicated in vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and disease by orchestrating changes in matrix degradation, integrins, and components of the ECM. HoxA5 is implicated in atherosclerosis. HoxD3 and HoxB3 are proinvasive, angiogenic genes that upregulate b3 and a5 integrins and Efna1 in ECs, respectively. HoxA3 induces endothelial cell (EC) migration by upregulating MMP14 and uPAR. Conversely, HoxD10 and HoxA5 have the opposite effect of suppressing EC migration and angiogenesis, and stabilizing adherens junctions by upregulating TIMP1/downregulating uPAR and MMP14, and by upregulating Tsp2/downregulating VEGFR2, Efna1, Hif1alpha and COX-2, respectively. HoxA5 also upregulates the tumor suppressor p53 and Akt1 by downregulation of PTEN. Suppression of HoxA5 has been shown to attenuate hemangioma growth. HoxA5 has far-reaching effects on gene expression, causing ~300 genes to become upregulated upon its induction in breast cancer cell lines. HoxA5 protein transduction domain overexpression prevents inflammation shown by inhibition of TNFalpha-inducible monocyte binding to HUVECs.\nLIM genes.\nLIM genes (named after the initial letters of the names of three proteins where the characteristic domain was first identified) encode two 60 amino acid cysteine and histidine-rich LIM domains and a homeodomain. The LIM domains function in protein-protein interactions and can bind zinc molecules. LIM domain proteins are found in both the cytosol and the nucleus. They function in cytoskeletal remodeling, at focal adhesion sites, as scaffolds for protein complexes, and as transcription factors.\nPax genes.\nMost Pax genes contain a homeobox and a paired domain that also binds DNA to increase binding specificity, though some Pax genes have lost all or part of the homeobox sequence. Pax genes function in embryo segmentation, nervous system development, generation of the frontal eye fields, skeletal development, and formation of face structures. Pax 6 is a master regulator of eye development, such that the gene is necessary for development of the optic vesicle and subsequent eye structures.\nPOU genes.\nProteins containing a POU region consist of a homeodomain and a separate, structurally homologous POU domain that contains two helix-turn-helix motifs and also binds DNA. The two domains are linked by a flexible loop that is long enough to stretch around the DNA helix, allowing the two domains to bind on opposite sides of the target DNA, collectively covering an eight-base segment with consensus sequence 5'-ATGCAAAT-3'. The individual domains of POU proteins bind DNA only weakly, but have strong sequence-specific affinity when linked. The POU domain itself has significant structural similarity with repressors expressed in bacteriophages, particularly lambda phage.\nPlant homeobox genes.\nAs in animals, the plant homeobox genes code for the typical 60 amino acid long DNA-binding homeodomain or in case of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) homeobox genes for an atypical homeodomain consisting of 63 amino acids. According to their conserved intron\u2013exon structure and to unique codomain architectures they have been grouped into 14 distinct classes: HD-ZIP I to IV, BEL, KNOX, PLINC, WOX, PHD, DDT, NDX, LD, SAWADEE and PINTOX. Conservation of codomains suggests a common eukaryotic ancestry for TALE and non-TALE homeodomain proteins.\nHuman homeobox genes.\nThe Hox genes in humans are organized in four chromosomal clusters:\nParaHox genes are analogously found in four areas. They include CDX1, CDX2, CDX4; GSX1, GSX2; and PDX1. Other genes considered Hox-like include EVX1, EVX2; GBX1, GBX2; MEOX1, MEOX2; and MNX1. The NK-like (NKL) genes, some of which are considered \"MetaHox\", are grouped with Hox-like genes into a large ANTP-like group.\nHumans have a \"distal-less homeobox\" family: DLX1, DLX2, DLX3, DLX4, DLX5, and DLX6. Dlx genes are involved in the development of the nervous system and of limbs. They are considered a subset of the NK-like genes.\nHuman TALE (Three Amino acid Loop Extension) homeobox genes for an \"atypical\" homeodomain consist of 63 rather than 60 amino acids:\nIRX1, IRX2, IRX3, IRX4, IRX5, IRX6; MEIS1, MEIS2, MEIS3; MKX; PBX1, PBX2, PBX3, PBX4; PKNOX1, PKNOX2; TGIF1, TGIF2, TGIF2LX, TGIF2LY.\nIn addition, humans have the following homeobox genes and proteins:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60290", "revid": "38788892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60290", "title": "Fisting", "text": "Sex act\nFisting (also known as fist fucking (FF) and handballing) is a sexual activity that involves inserting one or more hands into the rectum (anal fisting) or the vagina (vaginal fisting). Fisting may be performed on oneself (self-fisting) or performed on one person by another. People who engage in fisting are often called \"fisters\".\nFisters have developed a distinct subculture with its own history, norms, and values, including literature and clubs for sexual, social, and spiritual exploration.\nHistory.\nFisting's emergence as a sexual practice is commonly attributed to gay male culture. However, its precise origin is disputed. Some claim fisting began in the twentieth century, whereas others assert the practice dates back to the eighteenth century or earlier. Sex educator Robert Morgan Lawrence, for example, claimed the practice dates back thousands of years.\nFisting gained visibility and popularity around the time of the gay liberation movement. Whereas until the 1960s fisting was generally confined to the bedroom, by 1969 men openly engaged in fisting at gay bathhouses such as St. Mark's Baths in New York. The hanky code and personal advertisements allowed fisters to safely and discreetly signal their interest to potential partners around the world. By 1973, gay bars, bathhouses and clubs such as the Red Star Saloon in South of Market, San Francisco were publicly advertising fisting. Sex clubs dedicated to fisting quickly emerged, including the Catacombs, Handball Express, and Red Hanky Express.\nBy 1980, associations had formed in major cities around the world for fisters to meet, play, and socialize with like-minded men, including \"Fist Fuckers of America\" (FFA), \"Total Ass Involvement League\" (TAIL), and \"Mid America Fists In Action\" (MAFIA). Founded in the late 1960s, FFA established chapters in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, Philadelphia, Miami, and Washington, D.C. FFA registered as a non-profit under the pseudonym \"Fall Festival Association.\" TAIL was founded in the early 1970s and included members in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia. MAFIA was founded in Chicago in 1978 and remains active as of 2025.\nFisting parties became a major social activity for \"dedicated handballers,\" some of whom attended as many as three each month. Parties tended to be held at gay bathhouses with carefully controlled guest lists ranging from eight to eighty people. In 1975, approximately 300 men gathered for a two-day fisting convention and contest organized by FFA in Ossining, New York. In addition to arranging sex parties, associations organized social events including dinners, games, cook-outs and bar meet-ups.\nCrisco was commonly used as a fisting lubricant since it was inexpensive and widely available, as depicted in pornographic films such as \"Erotic Hands\" (1974). As a result, Crisco became a euphemism for fisting in gay slang.\nThe onset of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s claimed the lives of countless fisters, many of whom were particularly vulnerable due to the common pairing of fisting with unprotected anal sex and drugs. In response to the AIDS crisis, safe sex advocates launched public health campaigns to promote the use of gloves. Meanwhile, cities such as San Francisco and New York forcibly closed gay establishments that\u2014accurately or not\u2014were believed to permit unsafe sex, including fisting. Consequently, many popular venues for fisting permanently closed. Although closures were supported by some members of the gay community, many regarded the closures as a product of anti-gay hysteria as well as anti-sex attitudes and disapproval of gay sexual activity in particular. The gay press, San Francisco AIDS Foundation, and San Francisco Human Rights Commission criticized the closures as counterproductive and a violation of civil liberties.\nFisting's visibility and popularity has grown in the twenty-first century, likely due in large part to the internet and greater HIV prevention and treatment options. Fisting pornography is now widely available online and fisters can easily meet via social media platforms, some of which are tailored for fisting (e.g. Recon). Gay bathhouses have made a comeback, with some once again hosting and advertising fisting parties.\nTechniques.\nTrust between partners is generally imperative to ensure physical and psychological safety and enjoyment. A common technique, particularly for beginners, is to extend four fingers straight with thumb tucked beneath. Some refer to this technique as the \"silent duck.\" In more vigorous forms of fisting, often referred to as \"punching\" or \"punch fisting\", the hand is partly or fully clenched into a fist before, during, and/or after insertion. Oftentimes, hands are inserted up to the wrist. Some experienced fisters enjoy deeper penetration, referred to as \"depth play\", in which hands may be inserted as far as (or past) the elbow. Taking two hands at once is referred to as \"double fisting\". In the case of double fisting, pleasure may be derived more from the stretching of the anus or vagina than from the in-and-out movement of hands. In rare cases, experienced fisters are capable of taking three hands.\nLubricants designed specifically for fisting or with fisting as an intended use are widely available in some countries. Fisters commonly use sex toys to loosen the anus or vagina before or during a fisting session. Sometimes a penetrative partner may insert their penis or a sex toy at the same time as their hand(s), to masturbate inside the receptive partner's rectum or vagina.\nDouching is common before anal fisting both for aesthetic purposes and to reduce risk of fecal contamination.\nTerminology.\nAccording to \"The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English,\" \"fisting\" and \"fist fuck\" entered the American slang lexicon no later than 1969. Common fisting-related terms include:\nIn medical contexts, fisting is sometimes referred to brachioproctic eroticism or brachioproctic/brachiovaginal insertion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^A \"Fisting\" and \"handballing\" are often used interchangeably, but some consider the former term to be crude or violent and perceive the latter as more closely associated with \"intimate love-making and spiritual communion.\"\nRisks.\nSafe enjoyment of fisting requires an understanding of potential risks and techniques for mitigating them. Fisting carries a risk of transmitting sexually transmitted infections. When practiced improperly, fisting can cause serious injuries, including perforation of the vagina, perineum, rectum, or colon, that in rare cases can result in death. Sexual activities that force air into the vagina can lead to a fatal air embolism, predominantly during pregnancy.\nA 2021 study found that men who practiced anal fisting were more likely to experience fecal incontinence than men who engaged in other forms of anal sex, but more research is required to establish a causal link and determine whether this is temporary or long-term.\nAccording to Barcelos, \"clinical and forensic research has over-inflated the 'dangers' of fisting without an understanding of contexts in which fisting takes place\", and that anal and vaginal fisting present \"low to no risk\" of sexually transmitted infections. Gloves, lubricant, and fingernail trimming can help reduce risk.\nIn popular culture.\nReferences to fisting can be found in art, music, cinema and other forms of popular culture. Examples include:\nInternational Fisting Day.\nIn 2011, adult performers Jiz Lee and Courtney Trouble designated October 21 as \"International Fisting Day\" to promote visibility and to protest pornography companies' refusal to distribute films depicting fisting.\nIn 2025, Fist Club Europe e.V. designated May 5 as a second date of observance for the holiday. Whereas the October observance addresses censorship and representation in pornography in the United States, the May observance \"focuses on the lived practices of the global gay community.\" As the fifth day of the fifth month, May 5 (5/5) symbolizes the five fingers of each hand.\nLegal status.\nIn some nations, fisting\u2014particularly anal fisting\u2014has historically been censored and criminalized due to its association with gay sex and characterization by critics as an obscene and deviant act.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, performing fisting and fisting pornography are both legal. However, until 2019, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considered publication of fisting material to be grounds for prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 and Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, the latter of which prohibits so-called \"extreme pornography.\" In 1998, the University of Central England was involved in a controversy when a library book by Robert Mapplethorpe was confiscated from a student by the police, who informed the university that two photographs in the book (including one involving fisting) would have to be removed. If the university agreed to the removal (which it did not) the book would be returned. The two photographs, which were deemed possibly prosecutable as obscenity, included \"Helmut and Brooks, NYC, 1978\", which shows anal fisting. However, after a delay of about six months, the affair came to an end when Peter Knight, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, was informed that no legal action would be taken. The book was returned to the university library without removal of the photos. In \"R v Peacock\" (2012), the jury found Michael Peacock not guilty of breaching the Obscene Publications Act for selling DVDs containing anal fisting. That same year, a jury took less than 90 minutes to acquit Simon Walsh for possession of images of anal fisting that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) alleged constituted illegal, extreme pornography. In 2019, the CPS declared it would no longer prosecute pornography produced by consenting adults engaging in legal acts, including fisting.\nUnited States.\nFisting was historically subject to censorship in the United States. For example, in the 1970s, the Los Angeles Police Department forced director Wakefield Poole to remove depictions of fisting from his films as a precondition for airing them in the city. Fisting was included on the Cambria List, meant to be a list of sex acts that carry risk of prosecution under U.S. obscenity law, created by Paul Cambria in 2001 to help producers avoid obscenity lawsuits. However, as of 2019, the Cambria List is generally regarded as obsolete within the American pornography industry.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The third film in Smith's View Askewniverse series, the film is about a male comic artist (Affleck) who falls in love with a lesbian (Adams), to the displeasure of his best friend (Lee).\nThe film was inspired by a brief scene from an early film by a friend of Smith's. In Guinevere Turner's \"Go Fish\", one of the lesbian characters imagines her friends passing judgment on her for \"selling out\" by sleeping with a man. Smith was dating Adams at the time he was writing the script, which was also partly inspired by her.\nThe film received mostly positive reviews which praised the humor, the performances and Kevin Smith's direction. The film won two awards at the 1998 Independent Spirit Awards (Best Screenplay for Smith and Best Supporting Actor for Lee). Characters from the film would go on to appear in later Askewniverse films \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001) and \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\" (2019), direct spin-offs of \"Chasing Amy\", with Affleck, Lee, Adams and Dwight Ewell reprising their roles in cameo appearances; Smith described the characters' roles in \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\" as being an \"eight-page sequel\" to \"Chasing Amy\".\nPlot.\nWhile promoting their comic \"Bluntman and Chronic\" at a comic book convention in the Manhattan borough of New York City, comic book artists and lifelong best friends Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards meet Alyssa Jones. A struggling writer working on her own comic \"Idiosyncratic Routine\", Alyssa is friends with Hooper, an African-American activist writer who militantly masks his flamboyantly gay personality to promote his comic \"White-Hating Coon\". Immediately attracted to her, Holden soon discovers her lesbianism while at an East Village bar called the Meow Mix.\nHolden and Alyssa soon bond, as they grew up in the same area of New Jersey, with Holden and Banky being natives of Highlands and Alyssa being a native of Middletown. This upsets the homophobic Banky, who resents Alyssa for intervening in their affairs. The duo's business partnership also suffers, as they had almost signed a lucrative deal to adapt \"Bluntman and Chronic\" into an animated television series, and Banky feels that Holden has abandoned their project.\nUnable to conceal his feelings any longer, Holden eventually confesses his love to Alyssa. She is initially angry and upset with him, but they later reconcile and begin a romantic relationship that night, which worsens things with Banky when he encounters them sleeping on his couch in the duo's shared studio Bank-Hold-Up in Red Bank the next morning. Banky encounters an old friend of his, who grew up with Alyssa and tells him she participated in a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with two boys back in high school, which earned her the nickname \"Finger Cuffs\". Banky relays the story to Holden, who becomes deeply disturbed by the revelation, having believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with.\nBelieving that Banky is jealously in love with Holden, disguising his true feelings with macho sexual banter, Hooper advises Holden to be honest and truthful and ask Alyssa about her past. The following night at a hockey game, Holden confronts her and clumsily attempts to bait her into confessing, which she eventually does, and she storms out of the arena. In the parking lot, she angrily confirms the threesome but defends her past sexual experiences, wanting to continue their relationship. Holden leaves feeling unsure.\nLater, Holden meets Jay and Silent Bob, the inspirations for the characters Bluntman and Chronic, for lunch at a local diner. He hands them their monthly residual pay for book sales and discusses his troubles regarding Alyssa. The normally-mute Bob reveals that a couple of years earlier, he had a girlfriend named Amy in a relationship mirroring Holden's. Although he loved her, his insecurities about her past promiscuity caused him to break up with her. He regretted it and has since spent a long time \"chasing Amy\".\nInspired by Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his fractured friendship with Banky. He invites them over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend while telling Banky that he realizes that he is in love with Holden, kissing him passionately to prove it. He proposes a threesome, which he believes will both end his envy towards Alyssa's broader experiences and resolve Banky's issues with them being a couple. The initially shocked Banky agrees to participate, but is relieved when an appalled Alyssa declines, reasoning that the offensive proposal will not salvage their relationship. Alyssa and Banky both silently depart.\nOne year later, at a convention, Banky, while promoting his own comic \"Baby Dave\", reveals to a fan that he now owns the publishing and creative rights to \"Bluntman and Chronic\", having dissolved his partnership with Holden. Holden silently congratulates Banky on the success of \"Baby Dave\", and Banky gestures him over to a booth hosted by Alyssa, encouraging him to speak to her. During their brief emotional conversation, Holden gives her a copy of \"Chasing Amy\", his new comic based on their failed relationship, and asks her to contact him if she has anything to say about it. After he departs, Alyssa's new girlfriend arrives and asks about him. Smiling and teary-eyed, Alyssa feigns indifference, casually moves his comic aside, and dismissively replies, \"Oh, just some guy I knew.\"\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*Ben Affleck as Holden McNeil\nProduction.\nKevin Smith has said over the years that \"Chasing Amy\" was inspired by his brother being gay, his relationship with Joey Lauren Adams, whom he was dating during the making of the film, and a crush his producing partner Scott Mosier had on lesbian filmmaker Guinevere Turner. Turner met Mosier and Smith at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival where their respective films, \"Go Fish\" and \"Clerks\", had premiered. After the festival, Mosier and Turner kept in touch, with Mosier developing unrequited feelings for Turner. Smith told Mosier to channel his heartbreak into a movie about a guy who falls in love with a lesbian, but the filmmakers felt it was too lean a story, so Smith added his own experiences into the character of Holden. Smith wrote, \"The character of Holden is the closest to me I've ever written (casting Ben was aesthetically wishful thinking perhaps).\" Smith, who said he \"didn't really know that much about gay culture, and specifically lesbian culture\", had Turner look at drafts of the script for her input. Turner helped find the location for the bar scenes, which were shot at the since-closed Meow Mix in downtown Manhattan.\nMiramax Films initially offered Smith a $2 million budget on the condition that he cast David Schwimmer, Drew Barrymore, and Jon Stewart as the leads. Smith rejected this offer in favor of a $250,000 budget with a cast of his choosing.\nRelease.\nThe film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 1997.\nOn a budget of $250,000, the film grossed a total of $12,021,272 in theaters. \"Chasing Amy\" played at three locations and earned $52,446 upon its opening weekend in the United States. The following week, the film was expanded to a further 22 theaters where it grossed $302,406. During the 18\u201320 April 1997 weekend, \"Chasing Amy\" was screened at a further 494 locations, where it earned $1,642,402 and moved into the Top 10.\nReception.\n\"Chasing Amy\" received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 87% based on reviews from 87 critics, with a rating average of 7.30/10. According to the site's summary of the critical consensus, \u201cAlthough \"Chasing Amy\"'s depiction of queer sexuality is frustratingly clumsy, it handles an array of thorny themes with a mixture of sensitivity, raw honesty, and writer-director Kevin Smith's signature raunchy humor.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 based on 28 reviews. Audiences polled by Cinemascore gave the film a grade of \"A\u2212\".\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying: { Ebert believed the film was an improvement over Smith's previous effort \"Mallrats\" and he added that Adams was a discovery.\nCharles Taylor, writing for \"Salon\", quipped \"\"Chasing Amy\" isn't going to single-handedly save romantic comedy, but Smith (\"Clerks\") has made the only romantic comedy in quite a while that acknowledges, even celebrates, the fact that love and sex are emotional anarchy.\" Writing in \"Time Out New York\", Andrew Johnston observed: \"\"Chasing Amy,\" Kevin Smith's third feature, does to romantic comedy what Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's \"Spider-Man\" did to superhero comics in the '60s: It makes a tired genre newly relevant by giving its characters motivations and problems that seem real.\"\nQuentin Tarantino considered \"Chasing Amy\" his favorite movie of 1997.\nAnalysis.\nIn the book \"Sexual Fluidity: Understanding Women's Love and Desire\", Lisa M. Diamond cites the film as a notable example of female sexual fluidity in popular culture, writing that \"Chasing Amy\" \"depicts a lesbian becoming involved with a man, contrary to the more widespread depictions of heterosexual women becoming involved in same-sex relationships.\"\nThough the film has been praised as ahead of its time by some critics in its representation of sexual fluidity and the concept of the bromance, it also received criticism, particularly for its implication that a lesbian can go straight, even if just temporarily, as soon as she meets the right guy. The film was criticized by Judith Kegan Gardiner in the book \"Masculinity Studies and Feminist Theory\", describing \"Chasing Amy\" as representative of a \"fairly repulsive genre of films\" that feature a \"heterosexual conversion narrative\" that is \"set in motion by the desire of a heterosexual person for a seemingly unattainable gay person.\" The scene where Alyssa is shamed by her gay friends when they discover she is dating a man also received criticism from the lesbian community.\nOn the film's 20th anniversary, Smith said, \"For anyone who watches the movie now and goes, like, 'Ew, these sexual politics are ... not very subtle', you\u2019ve gotta remember: It was made by a 26-year-old, 27-year-old guy, who really didn\u2019t know anything and was learning in that moment. As much as it\u2019s a movie that\u2019s closely identified with the gay community, by virtue of the fact that the main character was gay, I really never think about it as such ... To me, it was about a boy who grows up to become a man but loses everything in the process \u2014 very bittersweet.\"\nIn 2023, queer filmmaker Sav Rodgers released the documentary \"Chasing Chasing Amy\", which discusses the impact the film had on his life.\nHome media.\n\"Chasing Amy\" was released by the Criterion Collection, first on Laserdisc in 1997, then on DVD in 2000. It includes audio commentary from cast and crew, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a theatrical trailer. The DVD adds an introduction from Kevin Smith, apologizing for saying \"fuck DVD\" in the commentary. Later reissues by Lionsgate and Paramount are repressings of the Criterion edition.\n\"Chasing Amy\" was released on Blu-Ray on November 17, 2009. This release includes a new commentary track, a Q&amp;A with the cast recorded at Vulgarthon 2005, a conversation between Kevin Smith and Joey Lauren Adams, and a feature-length documentary titled \"Tracing Amy\" that details the making of the film and its aftermath.\nIn 2020, ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Skydance) bought a 49% stake in Miramax (which was taken over by Qatari company beIN in 2016), with this deal giving Paramount worldwide distribution rights to \"Chasing Amy\" and the rest of the Miramax catalog. Paramount subsequently reissued the film on DVD and Blu-Ray in 2021, and made it available on their subscription streaming service Paramount+. It was also made available on Paramount's free streaming service Pluto TV.\nNovel.\nIn Japan, the screenplay of \"Chasing Amy\" was adapted into a novel by Kenichi Eguchi and published by Aoyama Publishing. The unique concept of the book is that it is roughly half-novel, half-manga, with Moyoko Anno providing the art for the comic book pages. In an episode of \"SModcast\", Smith revealed that while he was thrilled to have a manga based on his film, he was shocked when he read the novelization, as the characters' sexual histories, which are just mentioned in conversation in the film, are depicted in the novel's manga illustrations as sexually graphic flashbacks.\nSmith had the original screenplay published along with his \"Clerks\" script from Miramax Books.\nSoundtrack.\nThe film had no soundtrack album released; however, many songs appear in the movie, including \"Alive,\"; the song written and performed by Joey Lauren Adams in character as Alyssa, cover of The Cars' \"Let's Go\" performed by Ernie Isley, \"The Impression That I Get\" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, \"Run's House\" by Run-DMC and other songs by artists such as Public Enemy, The Hang Ups, Gwen Guthrie and Liz Phair.\nTwo songs by the band Soul Asylum are featured in the film: \"Lucky One\" and \"We 3\". The band had previously contributed the song \"Can't Even Tell\" to the soundtrack of Smith's 1994 debut film \"Clerks\". Frontman Dave Pirner composed the incidental music for the film along with the film's theme song, \"Tube of Wonderful,\" which plays over the opening credits. The song reappears in Smith's 2001 film \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\", as well as its 2019 reboot \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\", both times introducing the character Holden McNeil.\nThe music video for the song \"Have You Seen Mary\", performed by the band Sponge, features several scenes of the film. In \"Chasing Amy\", the song is played in the scene while Holden and Hooper are at Jack's Music Shoppe.\nCultural references.\nIn a scene originally written for \"Mallrats\", several principal characters share memories of sexual escapades gone awry. This scene reveals the character's own emotional \"sex scars\" and was purposefully created\u2014down to the style of dialogue and set dressing\u2014to mirror a scene from Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\" in which Quint and Hooper share the physical scars they've both earned from encounters with sharks. However, in this film it's used with Alyssa and Banky.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He came to prominence with the low-budget buddy comedy film \"Clerks\" (1994), which he wrote, directed, co-produced, and acted in as the character Silent Bob of stoner duo Jay and Silent Bob. These characters also appeared in Smith's later films \"Mallrats\" (1995), \"Chasing Amy\" (1997), \"Dogma\" (1999), \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001), \"Clerks II\" (2006), \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\" (2019), and \"Clerks III\" (2022) which are set primarily in his home state of New Jersey. While not strictly sequential, the films have crossover plot elements, character references, and a shared canon known as the \"View Askewniverse\", named after Smith's production company View Askew Productions, which he co-founded with Scott Mosier.\nOther non-\"View Askewniverse\" films written and directed by Smith include the comedy-drama \"Jersey Girl\" (2004), the sex comedy \"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\" (2008), the horror \"Red State\" (2011), and the comedy horror \"Tusk\" (2014). He has directed numerous episodes of television for series such as \"The Flash\" (2016\u20132018), \"Supergirl\" (2017\u20132018), and \"The Goldbergs\" (2017\u20132019), and created the animated television series ' (2000) and Netflix's ' (2021\u20132024).\nSmith owns Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash in Red Bank, New Jersey, a comic book store which became the setting for the reality television show \"Comic Book Men\" (2012\u20132018). As a podcaster, Smith co-hosts several shows on his SModcast Podcast Network, including \"SModcast\", \"Fatman Beyond\", and the live show \"Hollywood Babble-On\". He is known for participating in long, humorous Q&amp;A sessions that are often filmed for release, beginning with the DVD release of \"An Evening with Kevin Smith\" (2002).\nEarly life.\nKevin Patrick Smith was born on August 2, 1970, in Red Bank, New Jersey, the son of Grace (n\u00e9e Schultz), a homemaker, and Donald E. Smith (1936\u20132003), a postal worker. He has two siblings: an older sister, Virginia, and an older brother, Donald Jr. He was raised in a Catholic household in the nearby clamming town of Highlands.\nSmith's childhood was scheduled around his father's late shifts at the post office. His father grew to despise his job, which greatly influenced Smith, who remembers his father finding it difficult on some days to get up and go to work. Smith vowed never to work at something that he did not enjoy.\nSmith attended Henry Hudson Regional High School, where he was a B and C student, videotaped basketball games, and produced \"Saturday Night Live\"-style sketch comedy. An overweight teen, he developed into a comedic observer of life to socialize with friends and girls. After high school, Smith attended The New School in New York City, but did not graduate. Smith met Jason Mewes while working at a youth center; they became friends after discovering a mutual interest in comic books.\nCareer.\nAs a filmmaker.\nOn his 21st birthday, Smith saw Richard Linklater's comedy \"Slacker\". Impressed that Linklater set and shot the film in his hometown of Austin, Texas, rather than on a soundstage in a major city, Smith was inspired to become a filmmaker, and to set films where he lived. He has said: \"It was the movie that got me off my ass; it was the movie that lit a fire under me, the movie that made me think, 'Hey, I could be a filmmaker.' And I had never seen a movie like that before ever in my life.\" He assembled a library of independent filmmakers like Linklater, Jim Jarmusch, Spike Lee and Hal Hartley to draw from.\nSmith attended Vancouver Film School for four months, where he met longtime collaborators Scott Mosier and Dave Klein. Unlike them, Smith left halfway through the course, figuring he knew enough to proceed and wanting to save money for his first film.\nSmith moved back to New Jersey and got his old job back at a convenience store in Leonardo. He decided to set his film, \"Clerks\", at the store, borrowing the a-day-in-the-life structure from the Spike Lee film \"Do the Right Thing\". Smith maxed out more than a dozen credit cards, and sold his much-treasured comic book collection, to raise $27,575 to make the film, while saving money by casting friends and acquaintances in most roles. \"Clerks\" was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 1994, where it won the Filmmaker's Trophy. At a restaurant following the screening, Miramax Films executive Harvey Weinstein invited Smith to join him at his table, where he offered to buy the film. In May 1994, it went to the Cannes International Film Festival, where it won both the Prix de la Jeunesse and the International Critics' Week Prize. Released in October 1994 in two cities, the film went on to play in 50 markets, never playing on more than 50 screens at any given time. Despite the limited release, it was a critical and financial success, earning $3.1 million. Initially, the film received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA for sexually graphic language. Miramax hired Alan Dershowitz to sue the MPAA. At an appeals screening, a jury of members of the National Association of Theatre Owners reversed the MPAA's decision, and the film was given an R rating. The movie had a profound effect on the independent film community. According to producer and author John Pierson, it is considered one of the two most influential film debuts in the 1990s, along with \"The Brothers McMullen\".\nSmith's second film, \"Mallrats\", Jason Lee's debut as a leading man, did not fare as well as expected. It received a critical drubbing and earned only $2.2 million at the box office despite playing on more than 500 screens. \"Mallrats\" was more successful in the home video market.\nWidely hailed as Smith's best film, 1997's \"Chasing Amy\" marked what Quentin Tarantino called \"a quantum leap forward\" for Smith. Starring \"Mallrats\" alumni Jason Lee, Joey Lauren Adams and Ben Affleck, the $250,000 film earned $12 million at the box office, wound up on a number of critics' year-end best lists, and won two Independent Spirit Awards (for Screenplay and Supporting Actor for Lee). The film received some criticism from members of the lesbian community, who felt that it reinforced the perception that lesbians merely need to find the right man. Smith, whose brother Donald is gay, found this accusation frustrating, as he has endeavored to be a pro-LGBT filmmaker, believing that sexuality is more fluid, with social taboos, not sexual desire, preventing more people from expressing bisexuality.\nSmith's fourth film, \"Dogma\" (1999), featured an all-star cast and was mired in controversy. A religious-themed comedy that starred a post-\"Good Will Hunting\" Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, as well as Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, George Carlin, Alan Rickman, Linda Fiorentino, and Lee and Mewes, it was criticized by the Catholic League. The film debuted at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, out of competition. Released on 800 screens in November 1999, the $10 million film earned $30 million.\nSmith then focused the spotlight on the two characters who had appeared in supporting roles in his previous four films. \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" featured an all-star cast, with many familiar faces returning from those four films. Affleck and Damon appear as themselves filming a mock sequel to \"Good Will Hunting\". The $20 million film earned $30 million at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\"Jersey Girl\", with Affleck, Liv Tyler, George Carlin, and Raquel Castro, Smith's first film outside the View Askewniverse, marked a new direction in Smith's career. The film took a critical beating as it was seen as, in Smith's own words, \"Gigli 2\", because it co-starred Affleck and his then girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez. Smith heavily reedited the film to reduce Lopez's role to just a few scenes, but the film did poorly at the box office. Budgeted at $35 million, it earned $36 million.\nIn the 2006 sequel \"Clerks II\", Smith revisited the Dante and Randal characters from his first film. Roundly criticized before its release, the film won favorable reviews as well as two awards (the Audience Award at the Edinburgh Film Festival and the Orbit Dirtiest Mouth Award at the MTV Movie Awards). It marked Smith's third trip to the Cannes International Film Festival, where it received an eight-minute standing ovation. The $5 million film, starring Jeff Anderson, Brian O'Halloran, Rosario Dawson, Mewes, Jennifer Schwalbach and Smith reprising his role as Silent Bob, earned $25 million.\n\"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\" was originally announced in March 2006 as Smith's second non-Askewniverse film. The film began shooting on January 18, 2008, in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, and wrapped on March 15, 2008. It stars Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks as the title characters who decide to make a low-budget pornographic film to solve their money problems. It was released on October 31, 2008, and ran into many conflicts getting an \"R\" rating. Rogen said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's a really filthy movie. I hear they are having some problems getting an R rating from an NC-17 rating, which is never good. They [fight against] sex stuff. Isn't that weird? It's really crazy to me that \"Hostel\" is fine, with people gouging their eyes out and shit like that, but you can't show two people having sex\u2014that's too much. Smith took the film through the MPAA's appeals process and received an R rating without having to make any edits. \"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\" was considered a box-office \"flop\". It was hurt by \"tepid media advertising for a movie with the title PORNO\". In the aftermath of the film's performance, Smith's and Weinstein's business relationship became \"frayed\". \"Zack and Miri\" opened #2 behind \"\" with $10,682,000 from 2,735 theaters, an average of $3,906. The \"bankable\" Rogen experienced his \"worst box-office opening ever\". In an interview with Katla McGlynn of the \"Huffington Post\", Smith said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was depressed, man. I wanted that movie to do so much better. I'm sitting there thinking 'That's it, that's it, I'm gone, I'm out. The movie didn't do well and I killed Seth Rogen's career! This dude was on a roll until he got in with the likes of me. I'm a career killer! Judd [Apatow]'s going to be pissed, the whole Internet's going to be pissed because they all like Seth, and the only reason they like me anymore is because I was involved with Seth! And now I fuckin' ruined that. It was like high school. I was like, 'I'm a dead man. I'll be the laughing stock.'\nIt was announced in 2009 that Smith had signed on to direct \"A Couple of Dicks\", a buddy-cop comedy written by the Cullen Brothers and starring Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan. Due to controversy surrounding the original title, it was changed to \"A Couple of Cops\", then reverted to its original title due to negative reaction, before finally settling on the title \"Cop Out\". The film, shot from June to August 2009, involves a pair of veteran cops tracking down a stolen vintage baseball card, and was released on February 26, 2010, to poor reviews; it was the first film Smith directed but did not write. \"Cop Out\" opened at number two at the box office and was mired in controversy, mostly over reported conflicts on the set between Smith and Willis. It was the last time Smith worked with a major studio, leading him to return to his independent film roots.\nIn September 2010, Smith started work on \"Red State\", an independently financed horror film loosely inspired by the Westboro Baptist Church and its pastor, Fred Phelps. Weinstein and his brother Bob, who had been involved in the distribution of Smith's films except \"Mallrats\" and \"Cop Out\", declined to support \"Red State\". The film stars Michael Parks, John Goodman and Melissa Leo. Smith had said he would auction off rights to the $4 million film at a controversial event following its debut screening at Sundance but instead kept the rights to the film himself and self-distributed it under the SModcast Pictures banner. The January 2011 premiere drew protests from a half-dozen members of the church, along with many more who counter-protested Westboro members. Smith explained his decision as a way to return to an era when marketing a film did not cost four times as much as the film itself, a situation he called \"decadent and deadening\".\"Red State\" was a box office bomb, earning just $1,104,682, and opened to poor reviews; the critical consensus (according to Rotten Tomatoes) was \"\"Red State\" is an audacious and brash affair that ultimately fails to provide competent scares or thrills.\" In April 2011, Smith said that \"Red State\" had made its budget back by making $1 million on the first leg of the tour, $1.5 million from a handful of foreign sales and $3 million from a domestic distribution deal for VOD.\nSmith had said before \"Red State\" that he would soon retire from directing, and announced that his last movie would be \"Clerks III\". In December 2013, he said he would continue to make films, but only ones that were uniquely his, as opposed to generic ones \"anybody could make\".\nIn 2013, Smith directed \"Tusk\", a horror film inspired by a story Smith and Mosier read about a Gumtree ad for a man who rents out a room in his house for free on the condition that the respondent dresses as a walrus for two hours per day. The project began pre-production in September 2013, and was shot in November of that year.&lt;ref name=\"twitter.com/ThatKevinSmith\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Released September 19, 2014, it received mixed reviews.\nBefore \"Tusk\"'s release, Smith wrote the script for a spin-off of the film, which he titled \"Yoga Hosers\". The film began filming in August 2014, and was released in 2016. It stars Smith's daughter, Harley Quinn Smith, and Lily-Rose Depp, reprising their two minor characters from \"Tusk\", with Johnny Depp playing his inspector character from the earlier film.\nSmith revealed at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con that he had written the script for a film called \"Moose Jaws\", which he described as \"\"Jaws\" with a moose\", and which is planned to be the third film in his \"True North\" trilogy.\nSmith wrote and directed one segment, \"Halloween\", of the 2016 horror anthology film \"Holidays\", in which each segment takes place during a different holiday.\nIn June 2017, Smith started shooting \"KillRoy Was Here\", a horror film based on the graffiti phenomenon. Directed by Smith, the script was co-written with Andrew McElfresh, marking the first time he shared writing credit. It represents a retooling of their \"Anti-Claus\" film, which was initially canceled after the release of \"Krampus\", due to the two stories' similarity. The film crew was mostly made up of students of the Ringling College of Art and Design, with shooting continuing over every semester break.\nIn 2017, due to obstacles getting \"Clerks 3\" or \"Mallrats 2\" produced, Smith decided to write and direct a \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" sequel instead, \"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot\". It was scheduled to be filmed in September 2017, but shooting was postponed to February and March 2019. The first trailer for the film was released on July 18, 2019. Smith announced a tour to accompany the film.\nOn October 1, 2019, Smith announced on Instagram that \"Clerks III\" was happening and that Jeff Anderson, who had retired, had agreed to reprise his role as Randal. The film was released on September 13, 2022.\nIn 2024, Smith released \"\", focusing on a group of teenagers in the 1980s who spent a day \"theatre-hopping\", in Monmouth County, New Jersey.\nRelationship with Harvey Weinstein.\nWith the exception of \"Mallrats\", all of Smith's films until 2008 were financed and/or distributed by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob, via their companies Miramax, Dimension Films, and The Weinstein Company. In 2008 Smith's relationship with Harvey Weinstein soured due to the financial failure of \"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\", which Smith blamed on a lack of marketing. Nonetheless, they continued to discuss potential funding for other Smith projects, and The Weinstein Company co-produced Smith's 2016 talk show \"Geeking Out\". Smith named the independent production company he created for the 2011 film \"Red State\" \"The Harvey Boys\" in Weinstein's honor. Smith is considered one of the writer-directors whose career Weinstein nurtured, a group that also includes Quentin Tarantino and David O. Russell.\nSmith severed professional ties with Weinstein when he was informed of his assault on Rose McGowan. Soon after allegations of rape and sexual assault by Weinstein publicly surfaced in October 2017, Smith said on Twitter that he was \"ashamed\" of his relationship with Weinstein. On his \"Hollywood Babble-On\" podcast, he said: \"My entire career is tied up with the man\", adding: \"No fucking movie is worth all this.\" He lamented that in addition to working with Weinstein, \"I sat out there talking about this man like he was a hero, like he was my friend, like he was my father.\" He pledged to donate all his future residuals from his Weinstein-produced films to the nonprofit organization Women in Film, which advocates for the inclusion of more women in film production. Smith later announced that, due to the declining appeal of his earlier films, the residuals from Weinstein-funded films may be lower than expected; he decided that he would instead donate $2,000 a month to Women in Film.\nFrequent collaborators.\nSmith regularly casts the same actors in his film projects. Jason Mewes has been in nine of his films, his wife Jennifer Schwalbach Smith in eight and Ben Affleck in seven.\nWriter.\nIn 1997, New Line Cinema hired Smith to rewrite \"Overnight Delivery\", which was expected to be a blockbuster teen film. Smith's then-girlfriend Joey Lauren Adams almost took the role of Ivy in the movie, instead of the female lead in \"Chasing Amy\". Eventually, she lost out to Reese Witherspoon, and \"Overnight Delivery\" was quietly released directly to video in April 1998. Smith was not credited for his contributions. He has said that the only scene that really used his dialogue was the opening scene, which includes a reference to longtime Smith friend Bryan Johnson.\nSmith was an uncredited screenwriter on the 2000 comedy-drama film \"Coyote Ugly\".\nComics and magazines.\nSmith has been a regular contributor to \"Arena\" magazine. In 2005, Miramax Books released Smith's first book, \"Silent Bob Speaks\", a collection of previously published essays (most from \"Arena\") dissecting pop culture, the film business, and Smith's personal life. His second book, \"My Boring-Ass Life: The Uncomfortably Candid Diary of Kevin Smith\", published by Titan Books, was another collection of previously published essays (this time blogs from Smith's website silentbobspeaks.com) and reached No. 32 on \"The New York Times\" Best Sellers List. Titan released Smith's third book, \"Shootin' the Sh*t with Kevin Smith: The Best of the SModcast\", on September 29, 2009.\nA lifelong comic book fan, Smith's early forays into comic books dealt with previously established View Askew characters, and were published by Oni Press. He wrote a short Jay and Silent Bob story about Walt Flanagan's dog in \"Oni Double Feature\" No. 1, and followed it with a Bluntman and Chronic story in \"Oni Double Feature\" #12. He followed these with a series of \"Clerks\" comics. The first was \"Clerks: The Comic Book\", which told of Randal's attempts to corner the market on \"Star Wars\" toys. The second was \"Clerks: Holiday Special\", where Dante and Randal discover that Santa Claus lives in an apartment between the Quick Stop and RST Video. Third was \"Clerks: The Lost Scene\", showing what happened inside Poston's Funeral Parlor. This story was later animated in the TV series style and included as an extra on the 10th Anniversary \"Clerks\" DVD.\nSmith wrote the miniseries \"Chasing Dogma\", which tells the story of Jay and Silent Bob between the films \"Chasing Amy\" and \"Dogma\". He has written the trade paperback \"Bluntman and Chronic\", published by Image, which purports to be a collection of the three issues of the series done by Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards (of \"Chasing Amy\"). It includes a color reprinting of the story from \"Oni Double Feature\" No. 12, purported to be an early appearance by McNeil and Edwards. These stories have been collected in \"Tales From the Clerks\" (Graphitti Designs, ), which includes a new \"Clerks\" story tying into the \"Clerks 2\" material, and the story from \"Oni Double Feature\" #1. They were previously collected by Image Comics in three separate volumes, one each for \"Clerks\", \"Chasing Dogma\" and \"Bluntman and Chronic\". In 1999, Smith won a Harvey Award, for Best New Talent in comic books.\nIn 1999, Smith wrote \"\", an eight-issue story arc of \"Daredevil\" for Marvel Comics illustrated by Joe Quesada. He produced a 15-issue tenure on \"Green Arrow\" for DC Comics that saw the return of Oliver Queen from the dead and the introduction of Mia Dearden, a teenage girl who would become Speedy after Smith's run had ended.\nSmith returned to Marvel for two miniseries, ' and ', both of which debuted in 2002. The former was six issues long, but problems arose when the third issue was published two months after the initially scheduled release date. As a result, the final issues were delayed for at least three years, prompting Marvel to release an \"in case you missed it\" reprinting of the first three issues as one book before the remaining issues were released. The delay in part was due to Smith's work on \"Jersey Girl\" and \"Clerks II\", causing him to shelve completion of the miniseries until the films were completed. He was announced as the writer of an ongoing \"Black Cat\" series and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" in 2002, but because of the delays on \"Evil That Men Do\" and \"The Target\", the plan was changed so that Smith would start a third Spider-Man title, launched in 2004 by Mark Millar instead. \"Spider-Man/Black Cat\" was completed in 2005, but \"Daredevil/Bullseye: The Target\" remains unfinished, with one issue published.\nSmith wrote the limited series \"\", with art by friend Walt Flanagan, which ran from November 2008 to January 2009. The series featured the villains Onomatopoeia (a character created by Smith during his run at Green Arrow), The Joker, Maxie Zeus, and Victor Zsasz. The trade paperback of \"Batman: Cacophony\" became a \"New York Times\" Bestseller in their Hardcover Graphic Books section.\nIn 2010, Smith wrote a six-issue Batman miniseries, ', for DC, drawn by Walt Flanagan. The series was initially planned as 12 issues, with a long break planned between issues six and seven. After issue six was published, Smith and Flanagan's work on their reality show, \"Comic Book Men\", extended this planned break longer than expected. It was decided in the interim to release the remaining issues as a separate series, ', scheduled for 2016, but it remains unreleased.\nAlso in 2010, Smith published a Green Hornet story for Dynamite Entertainment based on an unused script he wrote for a \"Green Hornet\" film that never came to fruition.\nIn August 2011, Dynamite Entertainment debuted Smith's \"The Bionic Man\", which was based on a 1998 script he wrote that Universal rejected for being \"more like a comic book than a movie.\"\nIn 2014, Smith and Ralph Garman released a six-issue \"Batman '66\" crossover featuring Batman and Green Hornet, \"Batman '66 Meets the Green Hornet\".\nOn March 7, 2022, it was announced that Dark Horse and Smith would be teaming up to publish the books of Secret Stash Press, a new publishing line by Smith. The first two books of the line include \"Maskerade\", written by Smith and Andy \"McElfresh,\" and \"Stops\", written by Smith and set within the View Askewniverse.\nTelevision.\nIn 1998, Smith shot two TV commercials for Coca-Cola in New Jersey.\nIn 2000, Smith and Mosier teamed up with television writer David Mandel to develop an animated television show based on \"Clerks\" called \"\". Only the first two episodes aired, on ABC in May 2000, before the series was canceled due to poor ratings. The six produced episodes were released on DVD in 2001.\nDuring the mid-1990s, Smith directed and starred in a series of commercials for MTV, alongside Jason Mewes, in which they reprised their roles as Jay and Silent Bob. In 1998, he directed Mewes as \"Gary Lamb \u2013 Ground Activist\" in a series of Nike commercials. That same year, he shot commercials for Diet Coke. Two years later, he directed \"Star Wars\" toy commercials for Hasbro. He has directed and starred in commercials for Panasonic. In 2004, he shot a public service announcement for the Declare Yourself organization, which promotes youth voter registration. These advertisements brought Jay and Silent Bob out of their \"semi-retirement.\"\nOn February 27, 2002, Smith released a short film for \"The Tonight Show\", \"The Flying Car\".\nSmith directed the pilot for The CW supernatural comedy series \"Reaper\". He described it as \"less \"Brimstone\" or \"Dead Like Me\" and more like \"Shaun of the Dead\" than anything else\". He added that he took the job because he had always wanted to direct something he did not write, but never had an interest in doing it on the big screen.\nSmith produced and appeared in the AMC reality television series \"Comic Book Men\", which is set inside Smith's comic book shop, Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash, in Red Bank, New Jersey. The show ran for seven seasons, from 2012 to 2018.\nA second series of \"Spoilers\" aired on The Comedy Network in Canada.\nSmith has directed three episodes of \"The Flash\" (\"The Runaway Dinosaur\", \"Killer Frost\", and \"Null and Annoyed\"), four episodes of \"Supergirl\" (\"Supergirl Lives\", \"Distant Sun\", \"Damage\" and \"Bunker Hill\") and three episodes of \"The Goldbergs\" (\"The Dynamic Duo\", \"Graduation Day\" and \"Our Perfect Strangers\").\nIn February 2017, Smith was announced to write, direct, and executive produce a TV series based on the Image Comics title \"Sam and Twitch\" for BBC America.\nIn February 2019, Smith was announced to cowrite, with Dave Willis, an animated web series based on Marvel Comics' \"Howard the Duck\" for Hulu. In January 2020, it was announced that the \"Howard the Duck\" series was scrapped.\nIn 2022, Smith guest starred as himself on the Nickelodeon sitcom \"Warped!\", in the episode \"Plagiarized!\"; in the episode, Smith announces to the lead characters what his new film would be, and the two leads believe Smith stole their similar idea and try to stop him.\nAbandoned and stalled TV and film projects.\nIn 1996, Smith worked on a script for a planned Superman film tentatively titled \"Superman Lives\". He wrote several drafts but was dropped from the project when Tim Burton was hired to direct and brought his own team to write the script; Burton's attempt was later abandoned as well. Smith publicly discussed his experience working on the script at a Q&amp;A session at Clark University shown on the 2002 DVD \"An Evening with Kevin Smith\". In the Q&amp;A, he said the experience was positive overall, since he loves Superman and was paid well. But he listed a number of unusual demands that producer Jon Peters made, including that Superman not be shown flying or wearing tights, and that he should battle a giant spider at the end of the film. Smith noted that he went to see the 1999 film \"Wild Wild West\", which Peters produced, and was surprised to see a giant mechanical spider at the end of the film, presumably Peters's handiwork. Smith's description of his experience gained a life of its own, with film critic A.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" calling it \"extraordinary\". In the 2007 direct-to-DVD animated film \"\", Smith has a cameo as an onlooker in a crowd that alludes to this anecdote: after Superman defeats Toyman's giant mechanical robot, Smith scoffs, \"Yeah, like we really needed him to defeat that giant spider. Heh. \"Lame!\"\"\nIn the early '00s, Smith was said to be writing \"Fletch Won\", a prequel to the Chevy Chase film \"Fletch\", and was set to direct with Jason Lee in the lead role, but the plans ultimately came to nothing. Smith cited Miramax not seeing Lee's box-office appeal (in an \"Entertainment Weekly\" article covering the delays, Smith claimed Harvey Weinstein continually refused it personally or suggested he focus more on the disguises of the character in a matter similar to \"Austin Powers\", Smith admitting incredulity that Harvey refused even after Lee was frequently seen in billboards and posters in the city at the time, to promote his new show \"My Name is Earl\", but admitting that Harvey's vision for the film clearly did not include Lee) as a reason for its abandonment. For a time, Ben Affleck was considered for the role, with Chase framing the action as the narrator, looking back on his early adventures.\nIn 2004, Smith wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation of \"The Green Hornet\", and announced that he intended to direct it. The project died after the poor box office of \"Jersey Girl\"; the screenplay was later turned into a \"Green Hornet\" comic book miniseries. (A live-action film adaptation, \"The Green Hornet\", was released in 2011, with no involvement from Smith.)\nAt the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that Smith would write and direct an episode of the \"Heroes\" spin-off \"\", but the project was canceled because of the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike.\nSmith planned to direct a hockey drama-comedy based on Warren Zevon's song \"Hit Somebody (The Hockey Song)\". The song, about a hockey player famous for fighting in the rink, was co-written by Mitch Albom, who worked with Smith on the project. Smith announced at the 2011 Sundance premiere of \"Red State\" that \"Hit Somebody\" would be the last film he directed, but that he would continue to tell stories in other media. In August 2011, \"Hit Somebody\" was announced as a two-part film titled \"Hit Somebody: Home\" and \"Hit Somebody: Away\", with part one rated PG-13 and part two rated R, but later it became one film again. In December 2012, Smith announced that, due to difficulties finding funding, \"Hit Somebody\" would be a six-part miniseries on an as-yet unknown network. Smith announced in March 2015 that \"Hit Somebody\" would film from September to Christmas 2015, but this did not happen.\nOn March 12, 2015, Smith said he would film \"Clerks III\" in May 2015, followed in early 2016 by \"Moose Jaws\" and \"Anti-Claus\" (a story inspired by the Krampus tradition), which he confirmed the next day.\nOn April 8, 2015, Smith said that \"Mallrats 2\" would instead be his next film. Most of the original film's cast (16 of the 18) signed on to appear in the sequel. In June 2016, Smith revealed that because Universal owns the rights to the \"Mallrats\" title a sequel would not be made; instead, it would be turned into a ten-episode TV series produced by Universal Television. He also confirmed that the film's entire cast would reprise their roles in the series. Toward the end of the month, Smith announced that he had closed a deal with Universal Television to pitch the series to networks and streaming services in August.\nIn January 2016, Smith wrapped production on a pilot episode for a planned half-hour comedy series, \"Hollyweed\". He wrote and directed the pilot, which starred Smith and Donnell Rawlings, along with Kristin Bauer van Straten, Frankie Shaw, Jason Mewes, Ralph Garman, Adam Brody, Hina Abdullah, Pete Pietrangeliand and Harley Quinn Smith. The pilot was not picked up. In July 2018, it was released as the inaugural pilot on the new TV crowdsourcing site Rivit TV, in hopes of getting funded as a web series.\nIn May 2016, Smith announced that he was adapting the 1984 film \"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension\" for television through MGM and said he and the company were shopping it around to networks. In July 2016, it was revealed that Amazon Studios was close to closing a deal to produce the series, but in November 2016, during a Facebook Live Stream, Smith said he would walk away from the series after MGM filed a lawsuit against the original creators, but would be willing to come back on board if they wanted him.\nActing roles.\nAs an actor, Smith is best known for his role as Silent Bob in \"Clerks\", \"Mallrats\", \"Chasing Amy\", \"Dogma\", \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\", \"Clerks II, Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, and Clerks III.\" He made a cameo appearance in the horror film \"Scream 3\", and was featured along with Jason Mewes in several \"\" episodes, including a special, \"Jay and Silent Bob Do Degrassi\" (also as a fictional version of himself).\nSmith played the role of Paul, a cynical divorced man, in a Showtime television series pilot, \"Manchild\", filmed in December 2006.

In the episodes, portraying a fictionalized version of himself, he visited the school to work on the fictional film \"Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!\" All three episodes were collected on the DVD \"Jay and Silent Bob Do Degrassi\". Smith and Mewes reappeared in two episodes the following season, in which they returned to Degrassi for the Toronto premiere of the movie.

The show gives college students ideas for things to do on the weekends.\nIn 2006, Smith guest reviewed on \"Ebert &amp; Roeper\", in place of Roger Ebert, who was recovering from thyroid cancer treatment. These spots were notable for the arguments between Smith and Richard Roeper over certain films, with Smith often citing Roeper's negative review of \"Jersey Girl\" to discredit his review of the film at hand. On one appearance, Smith compared Craig Brewer's \"Black Snake Moan\" to the works of William Faulkner.\nSmith was featured as one of the interview subjects in \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\", a 2006 documentary about the Motion Picture Association of America's process of rating films. Smith discussed how \"Jersey Girl\" receiving an R rating, on the basis of a conversation two characters in that film have about masturbation, which MPAA head Joan Graves told Smith she would not feel comfortable having her 16-year-old daughter watching. Smith's response was to question whether Graves' daughter had not already masturbated or learned about masturbation, arguing that his film was not teaching 16-year-olds anything they did not already know.\nSmith teamed with AMC and The Weinstein Company to co-host a late night talk show with Greg Grunberg, \"Geeking Out\", which premiered in July 2016, covering San Diego Comic-Con with 8 subsequent episodes running weekly.\nIn February 2019, he made his second appearance on \"The Big Bang Theory\" in season 12 episode 16, \"The D&amp;D Vortex\", alongside other guests stars, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, William Shatner, and Joe Manganiello in a storyline where they get together at the home of recurring star Wil Wheaton, to play \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\".

The original store was moved to a defunct ice cream parlor at 35 Broad St. after Smith sold the Monmouth Street property. The New Jersey location was managed by Smith's long-time friend Walt Flanagan, who appears frequently in Smith's films. On November 25, 2020, Smith announced on his Twitter account that he was closing the Red Bank store at 35 Broad Street on December 28, and moving the store down the block to a long-vacant corner location at 65 Broad Street.

An ambulance rushed him to the nearby Glendale Adventist Medical Center for emergency surgery, from which he recovered. Following the episode, his doctor told him he needed to lose another . He adopted a vegan diet, also joining Weight Watchers and becoming a paid spokesperson for the brand.\nOn the fifth anniversary of his heart attack, Smith confirmed that he had quit using marijuana in early 2023 and had experienced a mental health crisis earlier in the year that led him to reassess his livelihood and identify as co-dependent.\nReligious beliefs.\nThough raised Catholic, Smith began to become disillusioned about his beliefs in his early 20s, and came to see Catholic Mass as \"dry and lip-servicey\". Seeking advice, Smith spoke to a priest, who analogized faith to liquid filling a shot glass, and explained that the glass grows in size as a person grows older, and thus the same knowledge that satisfies a person as a child can be insufficient as an adult. \nSmith researched Christianity thoroughly, explored other religions, read the Biblical apocrypha, and tried joining a Pentecostal congregation. The thoughts and ideas he explored during this time formed the inspiration for his film \"Dogma\", the beginning of which features characters using the shot glass metaphor used by the priest. Though Smith still regularly attended Mass as late as 1998, he stated on \"Back to the Well\", a feature on the \"Clerks II\" documentary, that he only goes to Mass on the day before he starts production of a film, and the day before it premieres. In September 2014, Smith said that he believed in God, stating: \"Proof of God is that I have a career.\"\nIn a 2015 interview, Smith said that he had left both Catholicism and theism behind, citing the death of his dog. He said that upon the dog's death, he realized that dogs do not have religious beliefs. This in turn made him decide that religion was something meant to comfort children who were afraid of death. As an adult, Smith decided he no longer needed religion if his dog did not. When asked about his religious beliefs in 2017, Smith said that he \"believes in people\".\nPhilanthropy.\nSmith co-founded \"The Wayne Foundation\", a charity supporting women affected by human trafficking and exploitation in 2010; as of 2025 it had its tax exempt status revoked by the IRS due to failure to file for 3 consecutive years.

Its range continues across the Northern Pacific and the Aleutian Islands, all the way to Kamchatka, Magadan Oblast, and the Sea of Okhotsk, south to Honshu's northern coastline. It is the sole member of the genus Eumetopias, and the largest of the so-called eared seals (Otariidae). Among pinnipeds, only the walrus and the two species of elephant seal are bigger. The species is named for the naturalist and explorer Georg Wilhelm Steller, who first described them in 1741. Steller sea lions have attracted considerable attention in recent decades, both from scientists and the general public, due to significant (and largely unexplained) declines in their numbers over an extensive portion of their northern range, notably in Alaska.\nDescription.\nAdult animals are lighter in color than most sea lions, ranging from pale yellow to tawny and occasionally reddish. Steller sea lion pups are born almost black, weighing around , and remain dark in coloration for several months. Females reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age, while males have a wider window, reaching maturity between three and eight years of age. Females and males both grow rapidly until the fifth year, after which female growth slows considerably. Adult females measure in length, on average being , and weigh , with an average of . Males continue to grow until their secondary sexual traits appear in their fifth to eighth year. Males are slightly longer than the females, growing to about long and averaging in length. Males have much wider chests, necks, and general forebody structure. Males can weigh between , weighing on average . Males are further distinguished from females by broader and higher foreheads, flatter snouts, and a thick mane of coarse hair around their large necks. Their Latin name translates roughly as \"maned one with the broad forehead\".\nRange.\nThe range of the Steller sea lion extends from the north shore of Honshu in Japan to the Gulf of Alaska in the north, down to A\u00f1o Nuevo Island off the coast of central California to the south. They formerly bred as far south as the Channel Islands, but have not been observed there since the 1980s. Based on genetic an\u0430lyses and local migration patterns, the global Steller sea lion population has traditionally been divided into an eastern and western stock at 144\u00b0W longitude, roughly through the middle of the Gulf of Alaska. Recent evidence suggests the sea lions in Russia in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands comprise a third Asian stock, while the sea lions on the eastern seaboard of Kamchatka and the Commander Islands belong to the western stock.\nIn the summer, Steller sea lions tend to shift their range somewhat southward. Therefore, though there are no reproductive rookeries in Japan, several consistent haul-out sites are found around Hokkaid\u014d in the winter and spring. Vagrants have been spotted in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Gulf and along the coast of the Korean Peninsula and China. The oldest fossil known of the species was found near Kanazawa, Japan and dates to the late Early Pleistocene, approximately 800,000 years ago.\nEcology.\nHabitat.\nSteller sea lions tend to live in the coastal waters of the subarctic because of the cooler temperate climate of the area. Like all otariids, Steller sea lions are amphibious and spend some time in water and some on land. Typically, Steller sea lions spend their time in the water feeding but haul-out onto land to reproduce, raise their pups, molt, and rest. Steller sea lions usually congregate on isolated islands because they are the ideal terrestrial habitat. These isolated islands are preferred by Steller sea lions because they can avoid predation from terrestrial predators, easily thermoregulate (by means of cooling winds), and access offshore prey more easily. Some haul-out sites, known as rookeries, are commonly used for reproduction while other haul-out sites are used for other purposes like molting. However, both biotic and abiotic factors can influence the amount of time that Steller sea lions spend on land. Haul-out sites and haul-out abundance of the Steller sea lion can be determined by prey availability, predator abundance, tide levels, weather, etc.\nForaging.\nSteller sea lions are skilled and opportunistic marine predators, feeding on a wide range of fish and cephalopod species. Important diet components include walleye pollock, Atka mackerel, halibut, herring, capelin, flatfish Pacific cod, rockfish, sculpins, Pacific salmon, sand lance, and cephalopods such as various squid and octopus, as well as bivalves and gastropods. They seem to prefer schooling fish and forage primarily between intertidal zones and continental shelves. They usually aggregate in groups of up to twelve in areas of prey abundance. They are known to aggregate near fishing vessels, preying on bycatch discards. Most of the data on their foraging comes from data collected off the coast of Alaska; little is known of their foraging behavior elsewhere.\nThe composition of the diet of Steller sea lions varies seasonally and geographically; as opportunistic predators, they concentrate on the locally most abundant prey species. In addition to their primary marine environment, they sometimes enter estuaries and feed on brackish-water fish such as sturgeon. Very occasionally, they have been known to prey on northern fur seals, ringed seals, harbor seals, and sea otter pups. Records suggest that the range of their prey species has broadened over time.\nPredation.\nSteller sea lions are top-tier carnivores, but are susceptible to predation, primarily by killer whales. Shark species are also possible predators: sleepers and great whites may prey on juvenile sea lions.\nBehavior and life history.\nReproduction.\nReproductively mature male sea lions gather together mid-spring on traditional, well-defined reproductive rookeries, usually on beaches on isolated islands. The larger, older males establish and defend distinct territories on the rookery. A week or so later, adult females arrive, accompanied occasionally by sexually immature offspring, and form fluid aggregations throughout the rookery. Like all other otariids, Steller sea lions are polygynous. However, unlike some other species, they do not coerce individual females into harems, but control spatial territories among which females freely move. Steller sea lions have used aquatic, semiaquatic, and terrestrial territories. Males with semiaquatic territories have the most success in defending them. The boundaries are defined by natural features, such as rocks, faults, or ridges in rocks, and territories can remain stable for\u00a060 days. Though Steller sea lion males are generally tolerant of pups, one male filmed on Medny Island in Russia was documented killing and eating several pups in a first-ever recorded incident of cannibalism. Though researchers are uncertain as to the motives or reasons behind said attacks, it is suggested that the bull involved may have an abnormal personality akin to being psychotic.\nPregnant females give birth soon after arriving on a rookery, and copulation generally occurs one to two weeks after giving birth, but the fertilized egg does not become implanted in the uterus until the fall. A fertilized egg may remain in embryonic diapause for up to three months before implanting and beginning to divide. Twins are rare. After a week or so of nursing without leaving the rookery, females begin to take progressively longer and more frequent foraging trips leaving their pups behind until at some point in late summer, when both the mother and pup leave the rookery together. This maternal attendance pattern is common in otariids. As pups get older the amount of time spent by females foraging out at sea increases. This continues until pups obtain the ideal body weight and energy reserves to eat on their own. A study conducted by the University of California, Santa Cruz found that on average male pups consume more milk than females. This may be due to the sexual dimorphism common to otariids. Reproductive males fast throughout the reproductive season, often without entering the water once from mid-May until August, when the structure of the reproductive rookeries begins to fall apart and most animals leave for the open seas and disperse throughout their range.\nThe age at weaning is highly variable; pups may remain with their mothers for as long as four years. Incidents of mothers feeding daughters that are simultaneously feeding their own newborn pups have been documented, which is an extremely rare occurrence among mammals. A study done at A\u00f1o Nuevo in 1983 found that female attendance and time spent with their pup was shaped by increasing nutritional demands of the pup and the pups suckling efficiency. Females averaged 21 hours ashore and 36 hours at sea. As the pups aged, females began to spend more time at sea again. As the pups matured, specifically at the sixth week past birth, the mother's sea time declined by 30 percent. There was no relationship between the pups' activity or physical excursion and their suckling time, age, or sex. Their suckling time, and age, and sex are unrelated to their use of energy. Labeled water studies showed that the pups' milk intake had a direct relationship to their size. Pups that consumed more milk were heavier than those that did not. These findings show that the amount of time females spend onshore with their pups is based on their pup's suckling efficiency and nutritional demands.\nIn the past, the low pup production has been tied to an increase in nutritional stress found in females. This was believed to have contributed to the decline in Steller sea lions common to Alaska.\nLocomotion.\nThe largest of the eared seals, Steller sea lions are quick swimmers, about as fast as the smaller California sea lions. Glide velocity of individual Steller sea lions has been measured as 2.9\u20133.4 meters or 1.2\u20131.5 body lengths per second, which is close to the optimal swim velocity of 1.4 body lengths per second based on the minimum cost of transport for California sea lions.\nA 2007 study of Steller sea lions found that a majority of thrust was produced during the drive phase of the fore flipper stroke cycle. Although previous findings on eared seals suggested that thrust was generated by the initial outward movement of the foreflippers or the terminal drag-based paddling phase, the 2007 study found that little or no thrust was generated during those phases. Swimming performance in sea lions is modulated by changes in the duration and intensity of movements without changing their sequence. Using criteria based on velocity and the minimum radius of turns, Steller sea lions' maneuverability is similar to that of other eared seals, superior to that of cetaceans, and inferior to that of many fish.\nDiving.\nTo be able to dive for a long period of time, Steller sea lions exhibit apnea, bradycardia, and peripheral vasoconstriction. This allows them to maximize their oxygen stores and efficiently forage during their dives. In addition to those adaptations, their thick blubber layer and outer fur layer keep their body insulated during dives.\nTrained Steller sea lions from Vancouver Aquarium were placed in the open ocean at the University of British Columbia's Open Water Research Station to study their diving metabolism and behavior. Steller sea lions' dives are more energetically costly if they perform dive bouts. The aerobic diving limit of Steller sea lions was observed to be affected by their nutritional state and feeding.\nCommunication.\nLike most otariids, Steller sea lions are vocal in air. Mature male sea lions have a range of vocalizations as part of their territorial behaviors, including belches, growls, snorts, and hisses that serve as warnings to others. Both males and females also produce underwater noises similar to their above water sounds, described as clicks, barks, and belches. The primary function of their vocalizations is for social behavior. Sonogram readings reported that Steller Sea Lions make discrete, low frequency pulses underwater that resemble the male \"belching\" territorial noise made in air. These underwater vocalizations have an average of 20\u201330 pulses per second.\nVocalizations are critical to mother-pup pairs, as the mothers must find their pups in a crowded breeding area when they return from foraging. The mother and pup both use distinctive calls, like names, to help differentiate themselves among the crowd of other sea lions. Their aerial vocalizations have been described as similar to the bleats of sheep, and bellows.\nBecause Steller sea lions are sexually dimorphic in size, their hearing differs in sensitivity, possibly due to differences in size of the hearing structures. Females have a higher sensitivity than males, perhaps to hear the higher frequency calls of their pups. The Steller sea lion's hearing range also suggests that they are capable of hearing the underwater calls of one of their main predators, the killer whale.\nInteractions with humans.\nSteller sea lion were hunted for meat and other commodities by prehistoric communities everywhere their range intersected with human communities. Aside from food and clothing, their skin was used to cover baidarkas and kayaks. A subsistence harvest on the order of 300 animals or less continues to this day in some native communities in Alaska.\nHistorically, the sea lion has had only very slight commercial value. For example, in the 19th century their whiskers sold for a penny apiece for use as tobacco-pipe cleaners.\nSteller sea lions are sometimes killed intentionally by fishermen, as they are seen as competitors and a threat to fish stocks. Killing sea lions is strictly prohibited in the US and Russia; however, in Japan, a fixed number are still harvested annually, ostensibly to protect their fisheries. In Canada, commercial hunting is prohibited, but limited hunting permits are occasionally granted for First Nations communities, or if local culling is deemed necessary, for example, nuisance animals destroying fish farms.\nIn recent years, Steller sea lions have been known to enter the Columbia River estuary and feed on white sturgeon, several salmon species, and rainbow trout, some of which are also listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. They are found in the Columbia River nearly year round, with the exception of early summer, going as far upstream as Bonneville Dam. Though not as abundant as the California sea lion, there is still concern amongst agencies tasked with managing and monitoring the fish populations; as the Steller sea lions are, themselves, protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, managers are implored to use non-harmful, non-lethal deterrence methods (such as rubber bullets, bullhorns and other noisemakers). Interference or deterrence by the general public is unlawful, unregulated, and considered to be stressful (even disruptive) to the animals and their habits. Additionally, the massive size of the Steller sea lion\u2014and potential for aggression\u2014poses a real threat for humans; thus, the interfering with, molestation or frightening of marine mammals is strictly forbidden. Offenders are subject to varying fines, court appearances and even jail time.\nRecent decline and subsequent recovery.\nWhile the populations of the eastern and Asian stocks appear stable, the population of the western stock, particularly along the Aleutian Islands, was estimated to have fallen by 70\u201380% since the 1970s. As a consequence, in 1997 the western stock of Steller sea lions was listed as endangered and the eastern stock was listed as threatened under the United States Endangered Species Act. They have since been the object of intense study and the focus of much political and scientific debate in Alaska.\nOne suspected cause of their precipitous decline was the overfishing of Alaska pollock, herring, and other fish stocks in the Gulf of Alaska. This stems largely from the \"junk-food hypothesis\" representing a shift in their diet from fatty herring and capelin to leaner fare such as pollock and flounder, thereby limiting their ability to consume and store fat. Other hypotheses include increased predation by orcas and sharks, indirect effects of prey species composition shifts due to changes in climate, effects of disease or contaminants, shooting by fishermen, and others. The decline is certainly due to a complex of interrelated factors which have yet to be defined by the research effort.\nAnother possible reason for decline in this species has been tied to the nutritional stress hypothesis. The lack of prey corresponds to the decrease in population. In females specifically, obtaining an insufficient amount of nutrients has resulted in the failure to complete their pregnancies to full term.\nIn October 2013, the eastern Steller sea lion was taken off the U.S. Endangered Species List after a major population comeback over the past several years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

So What! is the third studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on January 19, 1988, by Capitol Records. It was the band's only album recorded with drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, both of whom were fired from the band in early 1989, several months after the completion of the album's world tour. \"So Far, So Good... So What!\" features music performed at fast tempos with technical ability; lyrically, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine addresses a variety of topics, including nuclear holocaust and freedom of speech.\n\"So Far, So Good... So What!\" was well received by critics upon its release, although retrospective analysis has been less favorable. It managed to enter the top-thirty of the \"Billboard\" 200 (although it received no commercial radio play), and charted in several other countries as well. The album was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA, and indicated Megadeth's forthcoming emergence from the underground music scene.\nBackground and production.\nGuitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson had been both fired from the band following the conclusion of the \"Peace Sells\" tour for disruptive behavior, including Poland's habit of pawning band equipment to pay for drugs. Samuelson was immediately replaced by his drum technician, Chuck Behler (although Slayer's Dave Lombardo considered joining). However, a new guitarist would take longer to emerge. At first, the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice, but Reynolds was not up to the task of recording, and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young. Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret for the way he handled Reynolds's firing. Other guitarists considered included Slash from Guns N' Roses.\nWork on the album started while Reynolds was in the band, but continued after the induction of Young. To mix the album, the label turned to Paul Lani, who had remixed the band's previous album, \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?.\" Mustaine was initially skeptical, and later became very irate with Lani's \"eccentricities\" and his way of handling things. To mix the album, Lani relocated himself and Mustaine to Bearsville Studios, near Woodstock, New York, ostensibly for the purpose of inspiration. Mustaine decided that he had his limits when he, having just awakened and made coffee, noticed Lani outside in his underwear feeding an apple to a deer. Mustaine flew back to Los Angeles later that day and fired Lani, who was replaced by Michael Wagener. Mustaine has since criticized Wagener's \"pedestrian\" mixing efforts, citing the album's \"muddy feel\", in particular. Mustaine was able to recruit Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones to perform guitar parts on \"Anarchy in the U.K.\"\nMusic and lyrics.\nAccording to music critic J. D. Considine of \"Spin\", \"So Far, So Good... So What!\" displays music performed at \"volumes approaching the threshold of pain\". This was the first album where another band member other than Mustaine contributed to writing, with bassist David Ellefson contributing to either lyrics or music on half of the album's songs. The album features fast guitar solos, multiple tempo changes and technical dexterity. Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic observed that the album offers the classic \"take no prisoners\" style which is commonly associated with Megadeth; however, he noted that the sound does not differ much from the other underground metal bands from that period. Jim Farber of \"Rolling Stone\" called Mustaine's vocals \"bloodthirsty\" and praised the musicianship for keeping rhythmic pace even at the \"most anarchic moments\". \"Los Angeles Times\" journalist Dennis Hunt noted that the music was filled with extensive and \"torrid\" instrumentals and described Mustaine's singing as a combination of extreme shrieking and screaming. Despite the positive overview, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" received some negative criticism, partially because it was perceived to lack the rebelliousness of the original version.\nThe lyrical themes on the album explore a variety of subjects, from nuclear holocaust (\"Set the World Afire\") to revisionism and censorship (\"Hook in Mouth\"). Still, the majority of the songs are accompanied by the same sentiment of disillusion and nihilism as their previous two albums. Unlike traditional topics related to heavy metal music, the song \"In My Darkest Hour\" contains emotional lyrics which deal with loneliness and isolation. Dave Mustaine revealed that he tried to write about subject matters that were in touch with reality, including social issues and taboo topics. The lyrics on Megadeth's cover of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" were slightly mistaken because Mustaine claimed he had heard them incorrectly.\nSongs.\nThe album's first track, \"Into the Lungs of Hell\", is an instrumental composition which features synthesized horns, winds and percussion. \"Set the World Afire\" is the first song Dave Mustaine wrote for Megadeth after being fired from Metallica. He was a member of Metallica from 1981 to 1983, and was dismissed just before Metallica recorded its debut album \"Kill 'Em All\". He later said that he wrote the lyrics during his journey home from the departure. Inspiration for the song came from a pamphlet he read while on the bus back to California. The initial lyrics were reportedly written with a borrowed pencil on a cupcake wrapper, leading some fans to refer to \"Set the World Afire\" as \"the cupcake song\", though Mustaine indicated in a 2019 interview with NME that the lyrics were written on the backing of a Sno Balls cake. The beginning of the song contains a sample of \"I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire\", a 1941 song by The Ink Spots.\n\"Anarchy in the U.K.\" is a Sex Pistols cover, which quickly became a staple of the band's live set. Over the years, the song was dropped from the set list because of its [perceived] anti-Christian viewpoint. \"Mary Jane\" tells a story about a young witch buried alive by her father near the Loon Lake cemetery in Minnesota. According to the legend, anyone who dared to disturb her grave was doomed to a prompt death. It was included on the bands 1983 demo. The song features descending guitar lines and begins with Mustaine summoning her spirit during the introduction.\n\"502\" is about breaking laws and driving fast cars. The title is a reference to the police code in California for drunk driving; Mustaine himself would be arrested for drunk driving in March the following year when he crashed into a police car. \"In My Darkest Hour\" was written by Mustaine shortly after the death of Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. Mustaine had found out through word of mouth, as his former bandmates never contacted him about the tragic event that occurred in Europe. He later recalled that he was extremely unhappy that day and wrote the song in one sitting. \"Liar\" is a diss song directed at past member Chris Poland, who Mustaine claimed was stealing guitars and selling them for heroin money. \"Hook in Mouth\" criticizes censorship and the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). Mustaine elaborated that the lyrics were aimed at those who were \"fucking around with our constitutional rights and trying to take away our freedom of speech\".\nCritical reception.\nThe album received positive feedback from music critics at the time of its release. In a contemporary review, Holger Stratmann from \"Rock Hard\" hailed the album as \"the new masterpiece of Megadeth\" and asserted that the band had created a great follow-up to their highly acclaimed \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" Jim Farber of \"Rolling Stone\" also gave the album a favorable review, saying it propelled the group \"right at the top of the thrash-rock heap\". He concluded his review by saying, \"amid today's narcoleptic pop scene, albums like \"So Far, So Good ... So What!\" offer a disruptive noise that's welcome indeed\". Writing for \"Spin\", J. D. Considine felt that the record showed a \"genuine maturity\" for the band. In \"The Village Voice\", Robert Christgau reacted toward the album with tepid positivity, and wrote that Megadeth garnered \"its modest portions of profit and respect\" with their latest studio release. He praised \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", commenting that Mustaine covers the Sex Pistols \"like a champ\".\nRetrospective reviews, however, tend to be more critical of the album. AllMusic's Steve Huey criticized the album for lacking \"the conceptual unity and musical bite\" of its predecessor. According to him, the album \"wants to sound threatening but mostly comes off as forced and somewhat juvenile\", citing the cover track as an example.\nConversely, Adrien Begrand from \"MSN Music\" opined that the record was \"somehow ignored\" in the band's discography.\nTouring.\nThe tour that followed the album's release was the first to feature new band members Chuck Behler and Jeff Young. Bassist David Ellefson said that previous members Gar Samuelson and Chris Poland were tired of constantly being on the road and their departure was inevitable. He further revealed that drummer Behler was appointed shortly before because the band feared that Samuelson would not be able to continue touring. However, some problems occurred during the Australian leg of the tour. The band was forced to cancel some of these shows because of drug issues. Mustaine claimed that the group returned home because guitarist Young \"ran out of heroin\", which Young denied, stating that it was Mustaine who wanted to go back to Los Angeles and seek rehabilitation. Both Young and Behler were eventually fired from the band in 1989.\nMegadeth started performing the album's songs live before the record was released. During 1987 they toured with other thrash metal bands such as Kreator and Overkill at a number of European venues. The following year Megadeth appeared with more established heavy metal acts such as Dio and Savatage for some shows in North America. They also headlined a European tour, with support from Testament and Sanctuary. Later in 1988 the group made an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival, but were dropped from the line-up after one show; Megadeth was replaced by Testament. Dave Mustaine explained that the band toured quite often because they were not receiving much media exposure: \"We do a lot of shows and sell records by word-of-mouth\". \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that \"So Far, So Good... So What!\" sold 400,000 copies one month after its release, becoming Megadeth's fastest selling album at that point. The record eventually went platinum and indicated Megadeth's forthcoming emergence from the underground scene.\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written and composed by Dave Mustaine, except where noted.\nPersonnel.\nProduction and performance credits are adapted from the album liner notes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the first Megadeth album to feature guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza. The songs \"Hangar 18\" and \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" were released as singles. A remixed and remastered version of the album featuring four bonus tracks was released in 2004.\nSince its release, \"Rust in Peace\" has often been named as one of the best thrash metal records of all time, by publications such as \"Decibel\" and \"Kerrang!\", and listed in the reference book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 33rd Grammy Awards. At the 1991 Foundations Forum, the album received a Concrete Foundations Award for \"Top Radio Album\" and the single \"Hangar 18\" won \"Top Radio Cut\" award.\nBackground and production.\nIn 1988, Megadeth appeared at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park in the UK, alongside Iron Maiden, Kiss, Helloween, Guns N' Roses, and David Lee Roth. The band performed to an audience of more than 100,000 people and was soon added to the \"Monsters of Rock\" European tour, but dropped out after the first show due to bassist David Ellefson's drug problems. Further issues within the band caused frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine to fire drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, and cancel their scheduled 1988 Australian tour. Nick Menza, previously Behler's drum tech, was hired as the band's new drummer. The search for a new guitarist was a drawn out process; Mustaine examined a number of guitarists for the job, including Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, who was initially offered the job before declining, as he requested that his brother, Pantera drummer Vinnie Paul, also be hired. Jeff Waters of Annihilator was also considered. Mustaine had asked original Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland to rejoin the band, with Poland tracking lead guitar parts on demo versions of all the songs that ended up on the studio album. According to Poland, he was \"99 percent going to join\" the band but was talked out of it by his manager. According to Mustaine, one of the last guitarists he had heard about, Marty Friedman, had sent him a copy of \"Dragon's Kiss\", on which Friedman played. Upon listening to the record, Mustaine had Friedman come in to audition and hired him. This would become the band's first stable line-up and, as recognized by fans, the 'classic' Megadeth lineup.\nThe album title \"Rust in Peace\" was inspired by a bumper sticker that Mustaine saw on the back of a vehicle while driving home from Lake Elsinore, California. The sticker read: \"May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace\". Mustaine liked the concept and decided to use it as a title for Megadeth's upcoming album. \"Rust in Peace\" was recorded at Rumbo Recorders with producer Mike Clink, while the mixing was handled by Max Norman. Clink was brought in for his work on both Guns N' Roses' \"Appetite for Destruction\" and UFO's \"Strangers in the Night\". The producer's work dealt mostly with the bass, drums and Friedman's guitar. In a 2002 interview, Mustaine declared that they \"really didn't make the record with [Clink]\" as at the time he was focused on Guns N' Roses' \"Use Your Illusion I\" and \"II\" \u2013 which were also being recorded at Rumbo \u2013 and stated most of the work in the album was done by himself, Norman, and engineer Micajah Ryan.\nArtwork.\nThe album artwork was created by artist Ed Repka, who previously had done the cover for \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" in 1986. It references \"Hangar 18\", and depicts band mascot Vic Rattlehead and world leaders of the era viewing an alien body. In addition to creating the album's cover, Repka also supplied artwork for the album's two singles. The object Rattlehead is holding was confirmed by Mustaine to be a material resembling Kryptonite.\nThe men featured on the cover are, from left to right: an unidentified British representative, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, German President Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and United States President George H. W. Bush.\nComposition.\nThe album features multiple lyrical themes: religion, politics and warfare, as well as Mustaine's personal issues, such as his fight against drug and alcohol addiction, UFO conspiracy theories and even the Marvel Comics character Punisher.\nThe opening song, \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" finds its thematic inspiration derived from the Northern Ireland conflict, in which the largely Catholic nationalist community were in conflict with the mainly Protestant loyalist community over the sovereignty of the six counties of Northern Ireland. Mustaine has said that at a show in Antrim, Northern Ireland, he discovered bootlegged Megadeth T-shirts were on sale. He was dissuaded from taking action to have them removed on the basis that they were part of fund raising activities for \"The Cause\", explained as something to bring equality to Catholics and Protestants in the region. Liking how \"The Cause\" sounded as was explained to him, Mustaine dedicated a performance of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" to it, causing the audience to riot. The band were escorted in a bulletproof bus back to their hotel in Dublin after the show. This incident, along with Marvel's Punisher, inspired Mustaine to write the song.\n\"Rust in Peace... Polaris\", addresses the topic of nuclear warfare, with \"Polaris\" referring to the Cold War-era Lockheed UGM-27 Polaris intercontinental ballistic missile. Mustaine has revealed that the song, originally titled \"Child Saint\", was one of his earlier compositions, having been written before his tenure with Metallica (1981\u201383). Menza proposed the concept for \"Hangar 18\", a song about UFO conspiracies and Area 51. Musically, the song features twin guitar solos after the verse.\nIn 2017, more than 25 years after the album was released, Dave Mustaine revealed the majority of \"Holy Wars\" tabs on the web did not transcribe the main riff correctly, and posted the correct transcription himself.\nRelease and reception.\n\"Rust in Peace\" was released on September 24, 1990, by Capitol Records. In 1994, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping one million copies in the United States. \"Rust in Peace\", along with the rest of Megadeth's Capitol-released studio albums, was remixed and remastered in 2004.\nUpon release, the album received widespread critical acclaim. Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called it Megadeth's most accomplished album, praising its \"instrumental virtuosity, thoughtful lyricism and punkish rage\".\nRobert Palmer of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that the album is demonstration of how far the \"nasty speed thrash\" concept can go without being \"formulaic and boring\". Reviewing the album for \"Entertainment Weekly\", Jim Farber described the music as \"sheer velocity, combined with dexterity\" and Mustaine's lyrics as \"nihilistic whimsy\". Mike Stagno from Sputnikmusic agreed that the songwriting was \"top notch\" on the album, as well as the fast and technical musicianship. He also spoke highly of Friedman's and Mustaine's guitar performance, calling them \"one of the most potent duos in the scene\".\n\"Spin\" reviewer Tom Nordlie praised the album, deeming it a \"mature, complex, surprisingly consonant and sparely produced album\", and concluded that Rust in Peace \"never sleeps\". Music journalist Kim Cooper also noted the album's maturity and wrote that \"Rust in Peace\" \"transcended the hard rock genre and raised the bar to a whole new level\". Another positive reaction came from \"Rock Hard\", whose writer Holger Stratmann stated that the record was \"pure Megadeth\", filled with \"razor sharp guitars\" and \"snotty vocals\".\nLegacy and influence.\nIn retrospective analysis, \"Rust in Peace\" has been cited as having a large impact on its genre. Heavy metal magazine \"Decibel\" labeled the album as a \"genre-defining work\", while \"Kerrang!\" wrote that the record \"set a new standard for heavy metal in the 90s\". IGN named \"Rust in Peace\" the fourth most influential heavy metal album of all time, commenting that the album \"displays Dave Mustaine's finest writing ever\". Additionally, Martin Popoff ranked it eleventh among the best heavy metal albums of all time. In a reader poll organized by MusicRadar in 2010, \"Rust in Peace\" was voted as the sixth best metal album ever. The MusicRadar staff explained that the record saw Megadeth moving \"into the big league\", while staying true to their intricate sound and lyricism. In a list compiled by Chad Bowar of About.com, \"Rust in Peace\" was placed as the best heavy metal album of the 1990s and named a \"thrash masterpiece\". The album was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 33rd Grammy Awards. The album was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\nThe tracks \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" and \"Hangar 18\" have become staples of Megadeth's live set, and are fan favorites. The guitar solo on \"Tornado of Souls\" is considered to be one of the greatest solos in heavy metal music. In 2010, the band announced a 22-show North American tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of \"Rust in Peace\". The band performed the entire album at every show. Dates in South and Central America were later added to the tour, due to positive response from fans. In 2010, Shout! Factory released a live recording filmed on the Hollywood Palladium stop of the tour, entitled \"Rust in Peace Live\". It was released on September 7, 2010, in Blu-ray, CD and DVD formats, and debuted at number 161 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number two on the Billboard DVD charts.\n\"Rust in Peace\" in its entirety was released as purchasable downloadable content in the rhythm game \"Rock Band\", a part of their \"\"Rust in Peace\" Download Package\". It was released a little more than a year after the release of \"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\" on the game's download store. A cover version of \"Holy Wars\" by Steve Ouimette was featured in \"Rock Revolution\". \"Holy Wars\" was also featured in \"\", while \"Hangar 18\" was featured in \"Guitar Hero II\" and as downloadable content for \"Guitar Hero 5\". Both songs have been described as amongst the most difficult songs in the series' history. \"Holy Wars\", \"Hangar 18\" and \"Tornado of Souls\" were also released as downloadable content for \"Rocksmith 2014\"\nA sequel to \"Hangar 18\" titled \"Return to Hangar\" later featured on Megadeth's ninth studio album, \"The World Needs a Hero\".\nIn 2015, satire website \"The Onion\" published an article titled \"Humanity Still Producing New Art As Though Megadeth's \"Rust In Peace\" Doesn't Already Exist\".\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written and composed by Dave Mustaine, except where noted.\nPersonnel.\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60302", "revid": "41953911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60302", "title": "Countdown to Extinction", "text": "1992 studio album by Megadeth\nCountdown to Extinction is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth, released on July 14, 1992, through Capitol Records. It was the group's second studio release to feature the \"classic\" lineup of Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, David Ellefson and Nick Menza, with all of them contributing to songwriting on the album. The album features some of the band's best known songs such as \"Symphony of Destruction\", \"Sweating Bullets\", and \"Skin o' My Teeth\", which enjoyed significant chart success and made a great musical impact.\n\"Countdown to Extinction\" received positive reviews from music critics, who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound in comparison to their previous record. The album entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number two, the band's highest position ever. It eventually achieved double platinum status and became their most commercially successful album. The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, while the album's title track won the Humane Society's Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues.\nIn 2012, in recognition of the album's 20th anniversary, Megadeth kicked off a 20th anniversary tour in South America, playing the album in its entirety. In addition, a 20th anniversary special edition of the album was released in November 2012, and featuring a performance of the full album was released in September 2013.\nProduction and musical style.\n\"Countdown to Extinction\" is Megadeth's fifth studio album, and the second to feature the line-up of Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, David Ellefson and Nick Menza. In an interview for \"Billboard\" at the time, Mustaine admitted that he fired past members Chuck Behler and Jeff Young because they resisted his pleas to seek rehabilitative counseling. He added that it was a \"major accomplishment\" that all four members of Megadeth contributed material to the album, unlike their earlier releases which were \"nearly all Mustaine\". Mustaine also revealed that producer Max Norman had significant input to the album by making \"a lot of suggestions and a lot of great artistic ideas\". However, Norman later accused Mustaine of attempting to steal some credit from him. Guitarist Marty Friedman said that unlike \"Rust in Peace\", the creation of this record was \"completely different\". He further stated that the band had changed the songs \"a million times\" before recording them on demo and entering the studio.\nThe music for \"Countdown to Extinction\" was written in two different sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, in the fall of 1991. The album was recorded in the first half of 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o'clock because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: \"There\u2019s nothing worse than getting a creative moment and you have to leave. It was like a school bell ringing.\" The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that \"Countdown to Extinction\" \"was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and you just know it\". He also said that it didn't take the band a long time to record the album because \"records were a lot easier to make back then because the pressure wasn't quite as hard\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe'd take a break and go outside with a basketball and shoot some hoops and walk back in, and Dave would pick his guitar up, and out fell the riff to \"Sweating Bullets\".\n\u2014 David Ellefson, on composing the music\nFollowing Metallica's mainstream breakthrough in 1991 with the success of their eponymous album which saw them strip down their sound, Mustaine decided to follow suit, though the music remained as technically perfectionist as their previous releases. Drummer Nick Menza explained: \"Metallica has definitely opened the doors for other bands to step through. We're obviously the next band to step through that doorway.\" Musically, \"Countdown to Extinction\" saw Megadeth beginning to incorporate more melody and mid-tempos into its traditional sound. Bassist David Ellefson noted that the band's goal was to \"create music that had more of a groove to it,\" capitalizing on the melodic playing style employed by Friedman, and further assisted by the input of producer Norman. Author Thomas Harrison wrote that with this album, Megadeth's music became \"more virtuosic than noisy and took the next step toward widespread acceptance\".\nLyrics.\nLike its predecessor, many of the songs on the album have political and military undertones. However, the opening track \"Skin o' My Teeth\" was speculated being about suicide, a theme which differs from the rest of the album.\n\"Symphony of Destruction\", with lyrics written by Dave Mustaine inspired in part by the movie The Manchurian Candidate, details a story about a regular citizen as the head of a puppet regime, as the country is run by a phantom government. The song was noted by critics for its great social and philosophical impact. \"Architecture of Aggression\" explores the nature of global conflict; Mustaine revealed that the song was about former Iraq president Saddam Hussein, who was engaged in the Gulf War at the time. \"Foreclosure of a Dream\" deals with economic concerns and social inequality. According to music critic Eduardo Rivaldivia, \"perhaps no other Megadeth song in history deals as directly and soberly\" with these issues. The song sampled then-U.S. president George H. W. Bush's infamous \"\" speech, making a statement about taxation endangering the \"American Dream\". \"Billboard\" praised the track, along with \"Symphony of Destruction\", for being \"socially conscious\" and described them as \"powerful statements for hard rockers\".\nThe fifth track, \"Sweating Bullets\", shows Mustaine's battle with his inner selves, which is presented throughout a conversational singing style. \"Sweating Bullets\" was written during the second recording session and was released as the album's third single. Its lyrical theme deals with paranoia. David Ellefson commented that the song's lyrics were \"psychotically perfect\" and sounded like \"the inside of a crazed lunatic's mind\". The title track was inspired by environmental concerns about the future of the planet, as well as criticisms of trophy hunting and the negative impact that it has. The name was suggested by Nick Menza, who had read a story in \"Time\" magazine entitled \"The Countdown to Extinction\". \"High Speed Dirt\" focuses on skydiving. \"Captive Honour\" is a song about prison and abuse that happens there, such as rape on new inmates, while \"Psychotron\" was written about the Marvel Comics character Deathlok. The album's closing track, \"Ashes in Your Mouth\", concentrates on the negative aftermath of war. The longest song on the record, it is performed at intense tempo and features shredding guitar leads.\nCritical reception.\n\"Countdown to Extinction\" received generally positive reaction from critics. \"Spin\" wrote that the album \"may just be the finest thrash metal album ever made, although purists may find it a bit too polished and easy to swallow\". AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that \"Megadeth guns for arena thrash success and gets it on \"Countdown to Extinction\"\". However, Huey noted the simplification of Megadeth's sound on the album in response to Metallica's commercially successful self-titled album released the previous year. Sputnikmusic reviewer Mike Stagno praised Mustaine's vocals as well as a number of the album's tracks. Despite calling this effort \"Megadeth's first step into the world of mainstream music\", he also noted that \"the band still maintains its identity\". Reflex described the sound as \"impressively clean, streamlined, and sharp, brimming with killing riffs\". They highlighted the vocal delivery on the record, saying \"Mustaine's never sounded more confident, verbally and vocally\".\nPopmatters writer Craig Hayes opined that \"Countdown to Extinction\" was \"either an exemplary illustration of nimble-fingered thrash metal that introduced Megadeth to a legion of new fans\" or \"an unimaginative, artistically cynical stab at arena-baiting commercial success\". According to Greg Sandow from \"Entertainment Weekly\", Megadeth's \"music has lost its former hurricane verve but keeps its crunch, and feels more rooted, even more melodic\". Chad Bowar from About.com raved the album's 20th anniversary edition, describing the songs as \"more straightforward\" and the lyrics predominantly being \"politically charged\". Jon Hadusek, writing in Consequence of Sound, labeled \"Countdown to Extinction\" as Mustaine's \"political record\" and said that the record \"saw Megadeth moving away from thrash metal and closer to generic hard rock, a sonic shift they would embrace on subsequent albums\". In an unfavorable review, Karen Csengeri of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that \"while \"Countdown\" echoes the band's earlier work thematically, it's stylistically disappointing\". However, the magazine would later rank the album 33rd on their 2017 \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\" list. By contrast, Holger Stratmann of \"Rock Hard\" concluded that the disc is \"a compact album with a few strokes of genius\". Reviewing the album's deluxe edition for \"Record Collector\", journalist Joel McIver eulogized it as a \"masterpiece of technical, melodic thrash\" and a showcase of Megadeth \"at their best and most coherent\".\nSales and impact.\n\"Countdown to Extinction\" was released on July 14, 1992, through Capitol Records and debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first week sales of 128,000 copies. It was prevented from entering the chart at number one because of Billy Ray Cyrus' long chart-topping reign with \"Some Gave All\". The album was acknowledged as the band's commercial breakthrough, and according to authors Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist, Megadeth \"reached the heights of popularity and critical acclaim\" with this particular record. Two years after its original release, \"Countdown to Extinction\" was certified double platinum and became the band's most commercially successful album, confirming that they had retained their audience in the wake of grunge. The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, while the album's title track won the Humane Society's Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues.\nThe record enjoyed similar chart success outside of the United States. It managed to peak within the top 5 on the charts in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and charted for eight weeks on both of them. It also entered the top 10 on the Japanese and Norwegian albums chart, while it charted slightly lower in several other countries as well. It was eventually certified three times platinum from the Canadian Music Association for shipping 300,000 copies and received a silver award from the British Phonographic Industry for having a shipment of 300,000 copies. The album was also eventually certified Gold in Japan and sold 100,000 copies.\nAsked how does he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: \"I think it's timely and timeless at the same time, and I think that's one of the most difficult things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically it's heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic.\" In the liner notes of the album's 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that \"thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, \"Countdown to Extinction\" became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play.\" Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a \"seminal\" release and commented that it \"changed the game by preserving the band's thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen\". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that \"Countdown to Extinction\"'s \"status as a gateway metal album is indisputable\" and its \"popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon\".\nTouring.\nThe group started the \"Countdown to Extinction\" tour in 1992 with Pantera, Suicidal Tendencies and White Zombie as the opening acts. They headlined the Roskilde Festival in Denmark on June 27 the same year, and continued with dates in Europe during the summer. The tour carried on throughout 1993, with the band making appearances on a number of large festivals. In January they performed in the United States with Stone Temple Pilots as the supporting act. Although these two bands had scheduled tour dates in Japan during the month of May, the dates were subsequently canceled. In June 1993, Megadeth played at the Milton Keynes National Bowl with Diamond Head and later opened for Iron Maiden and Metallica on their European tour. After finishing their major European tour, the band began a US tour which eventually ended on December 8, 1993.\nMegadeth honored the 20-year jubilee of the album's release with a headlining tour on which they played the record in its entirety. The tour began in September 2012 with live performances in South America, and continued the following two months with shows in North America. During this tour, three songs from the record (\"Architecture of Aggression\", \"Psychotron\" and \"Captive Honour\") had their live premiere, and a couple of others (\"This Was My Life\" and \"High Speed Dirt\") have been performed for the first time in many years. David Ellefson shared his impressions from playing the set live with newer members Shawn Drover and Chris Broderick by saying that they \"executed [the songs] to 100% perfection\". A which features a performance of the full album was released on September 24, 2013.\nReissues.\nIn July 2004, Capitol Records released a remixed and remastered version of the album with four bonus tracks. The remixed edition was a part of the band's reissued catalog during their tenure at Capitol. Dave Mustaine himself was in charge during the remixing process. In June 2006, two audiophile remasters of the album were released; an Ultradisc II Gold CD version by the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and a 180 gram vinyl 2LP version, both mixed by Mustaine. A 20th anniversary edition was released on November 6, 2012. This release features the original album on disc one, omitting the bonus tracks from the 2004 re-release. Disc two features a recording of the band's performance at San Francisco's Cow Palace in 1992, a show never before released in its entirety. Additionally, a 24\" x 36\" poster and four collectible postcards are included in the package. The liner notes have also been written by music journalist Kory Grow, and the reissue includes a poster and four postcards featuring head shots of each member from the album's lineup.\nPersonnel.\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60303", "revid": "50297545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60303", "title": "Youthanasia", "text": "1994 studio album by Megadeth\nYouthanasia is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth, released on November 1, 1994, through Capitol Records. It is stylistically similar to their previous album, \"Countdown to Extinction\" (1992). The title is a play on words, implying that society is euthanizing its youth. The cover art features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothes line, a direct reference to a line in the title track.\n\"Youthanasia\" received positive reviews upon its release. It was commercially successful, peaking at number 4 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, and in 1995 was certified platinum for shipping one million copies in the United States. A remixed and remastered edition featuring several bonus tracks and detailed liner notes was reissued on July 27, 2004.\nBackground and recording.\nMegadeth's previous studio release, \"Countdown to Extinction\", became the band's biggest commercial accomplishment, entering the \"Billboard\" 200 at number two and eventually becoming double platinum. As a result, they continually sold-out arenas across North America, in addition to developing a strong following overseas. With \"Youthanasia\", the band moved to a more mainstream sound.\nIt was a time of problems and conflicts for Megadeth, that in every two weeks or so, according to frontman Dave Mustaine, there were \"outrageous emotional interventions\" in order to make the group a democracy. Many band meetings during this period concerned Mustaine's creative control over a \"successful formula\", so that the rest of the band could better exercise their creativity. Another problem was the indecision on where the recording would take place. Mustaine did not want to record in Los Angeles, so it was eventually decided to record in Phoenix, since the majority of the band resided in Arizona.\nThe sessions for the album initially began in Phase Four Studios (Tempe) in January 1994, after a few weeks the sessions were moved to Vintage Recorders in Phoenix and continued there into May. This studio is often the location for scenes in the \"Evolver\" video. Producer Max Norman suggested that they build a new self-dedicated studio, in cooperation with the band, Capitol and Norman's funding a modular studio was built in a warehouse in South Phoenix. Talking about the recording process, Mustaine said that \"Youthanasia\" was written solely in the studio. \"We weren't playing any old, cataloged material. None of the past really influenced the new record.\" He mentioned that he gave \"more freedom\" to the other members and called the album \"very much a total band effort\".\nOf interest is that this was hoped to be the first album recorded solely on hard drives, rather than magnetic tape. Both Norman and Mustaine were believers in being on the cutting edge of technology, Norman had long been using computers to sample, tune and comp tracks. Digidesign was working on expanding Pro Tools from a single track to multitracking and it was hoped that as many as 48 digital tracks could be synced and used to record. The computers used were mostly Macintosh Quadra and with a great effort by all, it was soon evident that magnetic tape would have to be used.\nArtwork and title.\nThe cover art by Hugh Syme features an elderly woman hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, \"We've been hung out to dry\". He explained that the title track \"was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about the young people who listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It's like you have a choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'.\" The title is a combination of the words \"youth\" and \"euthanasia\". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting. The live version of the artwork is also seen in \"Train of Consequences\" music video.\nLike its previous album \"Countdown to Extinction\", \"Youthanasia\" is the second album to not feature the band's mascot Vic Rattlehead on the front cover but on the back instead.\nMusical style.\n\"Youthanasia\" was not a large stylistic departure from the band's earlier recordings. According to \"Billboard\", from the drumbeat opening of \"Addicted to Chaos\" to the precise instrumentation of \"Train of Consequences\", Megadeth delivered \"trademark aggressive rage 'n' roll to powerful effect\". \"Billboard\" noted that even the slower songs such as \"A Tout le Monde\" were tending toward \"lusty explosion\". Authors Pete Prown and HP Newquist opined that lyrically, \"Youthanasia\" contained more thematic variations from Megadeth. They wrote that the record was musically diverse, from the \"slow-tempo acoustic lines\" of \"A Tout le Monde\" to the \"breakneck riffing\" of \"Train of Consequences\" and \"Family Tree\". \"Q\" found that Megadeth's \"trademark crunchy riffs, thundering drums and bitter vocals\" were still present on the album, with the lyrics being more introspective.\nMike Stagno said that \"Youthanasia\" features \"a more traditional type of metal\". He explained that even though the music on a number of tracks remains quite heavy, it was obvious that the thrash metal is \"very scarce\" on this record. Stephen Thomas Erlewine agreed that Megadeth have abandoned some of the more experimental, progressive elements in their music. Similarly, Chris Ayers of \"Exclaim!\" felt that with \"Youthanasia\", the band \"eroded their brilliant thrash to mid-paced chug\". According to the band's official website, \"\"Youthanasia\" marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following the footsteps of their previous album.\" Speaking about the stylistic direction of the album, then-guitarist Marty Friedman stated: \"We pretty much stick to our guns. It's not like we're gonna change our next album to try and follow the trend. We don't really change with the times.\" On the album's genre, Mustaine said: \"It's been called a thrash album, it's been called a rock album, and it's even been called an alternative album. To me it can only be called a Megadeth album. That should be enough.\"\nRelease and reception.\nThe album was released on 1 November 1994 through Capitol Records. Promotion included the first official website for a band, \"Megadeth, Arizona\", described by its conceiver, Robin Sloan Bechtel, as \u201ca virtual cybertown in cyberspace\" where fans gathered in an online community that among other things offered news regarding Megadeth's new album. A special promotional copy of the album was issued with an essay by suspense novelist Dean Koontz entitled \"Godzilla vs. Megadeth\". A remixed and remastered edition featuring several bonus tracks and detailed liner notes was reissued on July 27, 2004.\nThree singles were released from \"Youthanasia\": \"Reckoning Day\", \"Train of Consequences\" and \"A Tout le Monde\". The latter would later be re-recorded with Lacuna Coil vocalist Cristina Scabbia under the title \"\u00c0 Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)\". This version was also released as a single, and included on \"United Abominations\" (2007).\nCritical reception.\nThe album received positive reviews upon its release. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, reviewing the album for AllMusic, commented that, compared to \"Countdown to Extinction\" the album lacks focus. However, Erlewine suggested that the album's production quality made up for that. He also commented favorably on \"Train of Consequences\", calling out its \"jackhammer riffs\". Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic reviewed the album positively. Though noting that the album, like its predecessor, was a distinct move away from the sound heard on 1990s \"Rust in Peace\", Stagno suggested that the lack of a fast-tempo is made up for by the catchiness of the tracks.\nIn a contemporary review, \"Q\" magazine wrote that \"Youthanasia\" has \"greater depth and breadth than its predecessors\". Tom Sinclair of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave a brief review of the album saying that \"Youthanasia\" would \"impress, but not impact\". Neil Arnold of \"Metal Forces\" named the record \"the last true Megadeth opus before the mid-to-late 90s slump\". He further said that the album \"pales\" in comparison to the previous records, but still keeps the band in their element. Paul Corio, in a retrospective review for \"Rolling Stone\", wrote that the album features \"metal-machine music\" that is \"calibrated to kill\". He highlighted \"Elysian Fields\" and \"Victory\" as examples of Mustaine in his prime. Despite the outcry of some fans, Pete Prown called \"Youthanasia\" \"more than worthy follow-up\" to \"Countdown to Extinction\". In 2014, \"Guitar World\" ranked \"Youthanasia\" at number 29 on their list of \"Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994\".\nSales.\n\"Youthanasia\" was commercially successful, debuting and peaking at number 4 on the \"Billboard\" 200, with 143,000 units sold in its first week. This marked the band's second top five album, slightly below the number two peak of \"Countdown to Extinction\" in 1992, and the band would only reach such a landmark again in 2016 with \"Dystopia\". Several weeks after its release, the record was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping one million copies in the United States. The album also managed to enter into the top 10 in the United Kingdom and some other European countries as well. It eventually received a platinum certification from Music Canada and a silver award from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 100,000 and 60,000 copies, respectively. The singles \"Train of Consequences\" and \"A Tout le Monde\" both charted on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\nTouring and aftermath.\nMegadeth toured heavily in support of \"Youthanasia\". They started the tour in November 1994, with live performances in South America. The tour continued in 1995, with a number of opening acts such as Korn, Flotsam and Jetsam and Fear Factory. During this period Megadeth also visited Europe, where they stayed for eight weeks. Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans: \"So far, the audiences have been really good and it seems to me that heavy metal and especially Megadeth are very much at the forefront of music in Europe. It seems like the attendance is better than it has ever been\". The worldwide tour ended in September 1995, with the band performing at Monsters of Rock in South America with Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper as the headliners.\nIn the middle of 1995, the band underwent changes on the business side. Manager Ron Lafitte was hired by EMI Records and essentially disbanded his management company. Megadeth later signed with ESP Management and hired Bud Prager, a previous manager of Foreigner and Bad Company, to be the band's new creative manager. As with Max Norman before him, Prager would go on to be highly influential in shaping the direction of the band. In an interview for Hard Rock Examiner, Mustaine revealed that there was a possibility of Megadeth performing the album in its entirety in 2014, honoring the 20-year anniversary of the record's release.\nPersonnel.\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1989, Megadeth recorded a version of Alice Cooper's \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" for the soundtrack to the Wes Craven-directed horror film \"Shocker\". It marks drummer Nick Menza's recording debut with the band. The recording was released as a single and peaked at number\u00a013 on the UK Singles Chart in 1990. \"Go to Hell\" appeared on the in 1991. The song features the same prayer, \"Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep\", used in \"Enter Sandman\" by Metallica, and can be heard at the beginning of the track.\nThe band contributed three songs to soundtracks in 1993. \"Angry Again\", recorded during the sessions for \"Countdown to Extinction\", appeared on the soundtrack to \"Last Action Hero\" and received a nomination for \"Best Metal Performance\" at the 1993 Grammy Awards. The song has appeared on several of the band's compilations. \"Breakpoint\" appeared on the soundtrack for the \"Super Mario Bros.\" film. \"99 Ways to Die\" was recorded for the soundtrack to \"The Beavis and Butt-head Experience\" and released as a single and a music video. It was nominated in the \"Best Metal Performance\" category at the 1995 Grammy Awards.\n\"Diadems\" was released on the \"Demon Knight\" soundtrack in 1995. In addition to soundtrack contributions, the band submitted a cover of Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\" for the tribute album \"Nativity in Black\" in 1994. It was nominated for \"Best Metal Performance\" at the 1996 Grammy Awards. \"Problems\" is a Sex Pistols cover and was previously unreleased.\nRelease and reception.\nWhile initially released in Europe as a bonus disc for a special edition of \"Youthanasia\", \"Hidden Treasures\" was released as a stand-alone EP in Japan and the US on July 18, 1995. It debuted at number 90 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and sold 13,000 copies in its first week. By December 2005, \"Hidden Treasures\" sold 286,000 copies in the United States. It also appeared on album chart in the UK, but did not achieve notable success. The album has gone out of print in the US, but was reissued in 2007 for the Japanese and European markets.\nThe EP has received generally mediocre reaction from critics. \"AllMusic\"'s Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the EP does not have many \"first-rate songs\" and that only \"99 Ways to Die\" made an impression. The \"Rolling Stone Album Guide\" was dismissive of the EP; the staff reviewer commented that the album is worth hearing only for \"99 Ways to Die\". Dean Golemis of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote that the album is \"typical Megadeth\" featuring \"fast-forward riffing\" and \"snooty snarling\" vocals. Carlos Ramirez from \"Noisecreep\" felt that the album contains many underrated songs that \"also deserve their time in the spotlight\" and highlighted the dueling guitar leads by Mustaine and Friedman featured in \"Go to Hell\". Despite the negative reviews, material featured on the EP has been credited with helping expand the group's MTV audience in the early 1990s.\nTrack listing.\nAll credits adapted from the \"Hidden Treasures\" liner notes.\nPersonnel.\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes.\nMegadeth\nProduction\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60306", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60306", "title": "Cryptic Writings", "text": "1997 studio album by Megadeth\nCryptic Writings is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth. Released on June 17, 1997, through Capitol Records, it was the band's last studio album to feature drummer Nick Menza. His departure would mark the end of the band's longest lasting lineup to date, having recorded four studio albums. Megadeth decided to produce the record with Dann Huff in Nashville, Tennessee, because they were not satisfied with their previous producer Max Norman. The album features twelve tracks with accessible song structures, specifically aimed for radio airplay. The lyrics were also altered, in order to make the music more inclusive for wider audience. These changes were met with mixed opinions from music critics, who noted the band moving away from their thrash metal roots.\nThe album debuted at number 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in October 1997 for shipping 500,000 copies in the United States. The first 500,000 copies of \"Cryptic Writings\" in the U.S. were released with silver background album cover. A remixed and remastered version, featuring four bonus tracks, was released in 2004. Seven years after its original release, the album sold 850,000 copies in the United States and won widespread praise from rock radio programmers. The song \"Trust\" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1998 Grammy Awards and became the band's highest charting song on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock Tracks.\nBackground and recording.\nIn 1992, Megadeth released \"Countdown to Extinction\", which contained songs with compact, accessible structures that resulted in strong sales and significant radio airplay. 1994's \"Youthanasia\" and 1997's \"Cryptic Writings\" followed a similar route, with the latter spawning four top 20 hits. Frontman Dave Mustaine, speaking about the band's commercial breakthrough, said: \"I think a lot of our success now has to do with the fact that we're willing to study the marketplace and educate ourselves. Most musicians don't get the opportunity to go into the market with educated strategy. Fortunately, for us, our management educated us on how to study what's current without losing our integrity and to keep on edge while staying at the forefront of what's important right now.\"\nAccording to guitarist Marty Friedman, it took the band a year to prepare the record \"from note one to mixing\". A lot of the material was written during the tour and some of it afterwards. As Friedman said, the songs came together naturally because the band wasn't rushed to get a record out. The album was produced by Dann Huff, who had his producing debut with Megadeth. The band chose to work with Huff because they were not satisfied with Max Norman, the producer of their previous record. Mustaine explained why he decided to quit the collaboration with Norman: \"Max came up with this bullshit formula that every song had to be 120 beats per minute to get on the radio. When people make drastic decisions to do things like that and it backfires, it usually ends up, in one way or another, costing them their jobs.\"\nBefore the start of the recording sessions, bassist David Ellefson stated that the band doesn't want their seventh studio album to sound like anything they have already recorded. Instrumentally, the band introduced a more melodic mix than the previous albums, filled with crunchy riffs and speedy guitar solos. In addition, Mustaine re-evaluated the band's songwriting techniques, recasting some lyrics to better reflect the sales and radio airplay environment of then's rock arena. According to him, many of the song's lyrics were altered in order to make the music \"a little more inclusive of people who aren't into dying and evil\". Ellefson commented that this album was a natural progression in Megadeth's sound. He further stated that they were not trying to leave behind their thrash metal and heavy metal roots, but to broaden their musical horizons.\nArtwork and release.\nThe symbol depicted on the cover is a veve, a voodoo sign. According to Ellefson, the original concept for the album's cover was very different, however, it was changed at the last minute. According to Menza, \"The original album title was going to be \"Needles and Pins\". The cover was supposed to be a girl holding a Kewpie with a bunch of pins in it... she's stabbing the doll with a syringe in the chest. That didn't fly.\" The title derives from the song \"Needles and Pins\" by The Searchers, used as incidental music in \"Use the Man\". Aside from being a lyric, Ellefson stated that there was not really any correlation between the title and the music on the album. The first 500,000 copies of \"Cryptic Writings\" in the United States were released with an album cover featuring a silver background. These releases also included a Vic Rattlehead collectible card which promoted \"The Cryptic Writings Of Megadeth\", an issue run by Chaos Comics. Later US pressings features the same artwork with a black background instead. The black background album cover is also featured in the remasters.\nThe album sold 75,000 copies in its first week of release and debuted at number 10 on \"Billboard\" 200. Four months after its release, the record was certificated gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping half million copies in the US, of which 383,000 were sold according to Nielsen Soundscan. Two years after its original release, the album sold 850,000 copies in the United States and won widespread praise from rock radio programmers. However, \"Cryptic Writings\" did not enjoy particular chart success on international level. It only managed to peak at number two on the Finnish Albums Chart, where it charted for eleven weeks. Elsewhere, it didn't enter into the top 10. It eventually received a gold certification from the Canadian Music Association for shipping 50,000 copies.\nA remixed and remastered version, featuring four bonus tracks, was released in 2004 through Capitol Records as part of the group's reissued back catalogue. According to the liner notes of the remastered version of \"Cryptic Writings\", Dave Mustaine had to alter many lyrics at the request of their new manager, Bud Prager. The liner notes suggest that Mustaine was not a fan of the changes, but other interviews indicate the band actively sought and eventually accepted Prager's advice for the album. \"I figured maybe this guy (Prager) could help me get that intangible number one record I wanted so badly\", Mustaine wrote in the liner notes.\nIt is the first Megadeth album not to feature the band's classic logo on the front cover, but it appears on the album's remastered version.\nComposition.\nMustaine pointed out that four of the album's 12 tracks are \"fast, hard and crunchy\". Referring to the musical direction of the album, MTV's writer P.R. Flack noted that \"The Disintegrators\" and \"FFF\" were rooted in the thrash metal genre, and ranked them among the fastest tracks on the record. Neil Arnold of \"Metal Forces\" highlighted the tune \"Vortex\", which according to him, features some of the album's best guitar work. However, a number of songs, particularly \"I'll Get Even\" and \"Use the Man\", carried a more rock-oriented sound, which contributed to the album's diverse style. Lyrically, the album does not have a distinct subject matter, but focuses on numerous themes instead. \"She-Wolf\" tells of a \"wicked temptress with mystic lips and lusting eyes.\" Mustaine has also stated that the song is about \"An ex-wife and an ex-friend.\" \"Mastermind\" has been stated by Mustaine as being about \"the computerization of the world.\"\n\"Trust\" was released as the record's lead single. The song was developed from \"Absolution\", an instrumental track recorded on a demo during the studio sessions of their previous album. \"Trust\" peaked at number five on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, thus becoming the band's highest charting song on that chart. It was nominated for \"Best Metal Performance\" at the 1998 Grammy Awards. \"Almost Honest\" was the second single of the album, and like its predecessor, entered the top ten on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock chart, peaking at number eight. Mustaine stated that the song is about how people treat one another, which contains a message that \"it's difficult for people to be honest\". \"Billboard\"'s Chuck Taylor commented that the song contains catchy hooks and the band's \"signature guitar howl\" and classified it \"somewhere between Def Leppard and Bon Jovi\". \"Use the Man\" and \"A Secret Place\" were released as the third and fourth single, respectively. \"Use the Man\" (which started with a snippet of The Searchers' \"Needles and Pins\", which was removed in the 2004 remaster) is about drug addiction, while \"A Secret Place\" describes losing touch with reality. \"Have Cool, Will Travel\" is about school shootings; in the remastered version, a snippet of the schoolyard song \"The Wheels on the Bus\" was added to its introduction.\nThree extended plays were released in support of \"Cryptic Writings\". Two of these featured live recordings from the ensuing tour while the other was a studio EP which featured instrumental versions of several album tracks. The live releases were entitled \"Live Trax\" and \"Live Trax II\", the first being released on June 30, 1998.\nCritical reception.\nMusic critics were divided on the record. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, reviewing the album for AllMusic, reacted unenthusiastically toward it. He criticized Mustaine's ability to write more \"ambitious\" material and opined that the band \"sounds better playing thrash.\" However, Erlewine did admire the band's desire to experiment with their sound. \"Rolling Stone\" was more generous toward \"Cryptic Writings\". Reviewer Jon Wiederhorn commented that the album \"should thrill Metallica fans who felt screwed by that band's thrashless 1996 album, \"Load\".\" Dean Golemis of the \"Chicago Tribune\" panned the album for being \"predictable and annoying\" and assumed that Megadeth were \"destined to follow Metallica's leap into mainstream sounds\". Author Thomas Harrison also noted the album for not making as much impact as their previous studio releases.\nConsumable Online's Simon Speichert wrote positively about the record, qualifying it as \"pure, solid heavy metal\". He noted that the album contains various kinds of tunes and named it \"one of the best metal records of 1997\". Neil Arnold from \"Metal Forces\" observed that \"Cryptic Writings\" is not \"a bad record\", though it comes \"pale\" in comparison to their 1994 opus \"Youthanasia\". Arnold went on to comment that the album confirms Megadeth are \"no longer a thrash band\". Wolfgang Sch\u00e4fer, from the German metal magazine \"Rock Hard\", stated that \"Cryptic Writings\" followed the musical direction of its predecessors. He described the album as a \"balanced mix of typical Megadeth rockers and some experimental songs\". Shane Mehling of \"Decibel\" reflected that the \"nearly thrashless\" \"Cryptic Writings\", alongside Metallica's \"Load\" and \"Reload\" (1997), left the \"metal community [...] trying to pick up the pieces\".\nTouring.\nMegadeth supported the album with a world tour that started in the summer of 1997. The Misfits were the opening act of these live shows, one of which was the band's first all-acoustic performance that took place in Argentina. The following summer, the group participated in Ozzfest '98 for the dates in the United States. These live shows were the last for drummer Nick Menza, who was fired subsequently. Menza began to suffer knee problems and escalating pain during the tour. He was diagnosed with a tumor and underwent surgery which waylaid him briefly. However, the tumor was benign and Menza was eager to rejoin his bandmates, who had continued the tour with Jimmy DeGrasso. Although DeGrasso was hired as a temporary replacement, he stayed with the band for the recording of their next two studio albums. Menza stated that Mustaine had dismissed him from the band two days after his knee surgery via phone call telling him that his services \"were no longer needed\". On the other hand, Dave Mustaine believed that Menza had lied about his injury.\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written and composed by Dave Mustaine except where noted.\nNOTE: \u2013 \"Reckoning Day\" &amp; \"Peace Sells\" were joined together as one track with the running length of 8:19.\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60307", "revid": "50297545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60307", "title": "Risk (Megadeth album)", "text": "1999 studio album by Megadeth\nRisk is the eighth studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth, released on August 31, 1999, by Capitol Records, the band's last album to be released by the label. The first Megadeth album since 1990 to feature a lineup change, \"Risk\" marks the studio debut of drummer Jimmy DeGrasso with the band, as well as the final appearance of longtime guitarist Marty Friedman, who announced his departure a year later. Meant to be a breakthrough on alternative rock radio, \"Risk\" received a mixed response because of the great deviation from the band's traditional sound. The backlash ultimately resulted in the band returning to a heavier sound on their next album, \"The World Needs a Hero\".\nMegadeth frontman Dave Mustaine has blamed the record's lack of success on the fact that it was released under the \"Megadeth\" moniker: \"if anybody else's name was on 'Risk', it would have sold\". The album debuted at number 16 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. As with the rest of Megadeth's studio records released by Capitol, the album was remixed and remastered in 2004, with several bonus tracks added. This reissue also featured a different cover.\nBackground and release.\n\"Risk\" followed the band's 1997 release \"Cryptic Writings\", which according to Nielsen Soundscan, had sold 850,000 copies and won widespread praise from rock radio programmers. Referring to the upcoming record, Rob Gordon, a VP of marketing at Capitol Records, stated that \"before the last record, we'd maybe had one track at rock radio, and it would be over. With this record, like the last one, I think we'll have four-plus again.\"\nThe title stems from a comment by Dave Mustaine's former Metallica bandmate Lars Ulrich, who suggested to Mustaine that he should take more \"risks\" with his music. According to Mustaine, he was also encouraged to experiment by Marty Friedman's desire to indulge in his pop sensibilities. On the other hand, newcomer Jimmy DeGrasso wanted to do a \"heavy record\", unlike the rest of the band who wanted to try out something different. As bassist David Ellefson recalls, the band's manager Bud Prager had told them that they needed \"to do something that will make all of their contemporaries knock themselves on the head and say, 'Why didn't we think of that'?\". This decision resulted in mixed reviews for both the band and the album; a good portion did not favor the new sound and image, while others were more receptive to the band's attempts at experimenting with their sound and trying something different.\nMegadeth chose to produce the album once again with Dann Huff in Nashville, satisfied with the success of their previous record. The band started writing the songs right after finishing the tour in support of \"Cryptic Writings\". It took them five to six weeks to write the songs, and they went to Nashville in January 1999 to record the album. The recording process lasted four months, and according to Ellefson, it was a \"long haul\". Mixing on the album began April 23 and finished May 21 at Masterfonics in Nashville, Tennessee. The original American pressing of the album was released as an enhanced CD, and featured a brief documentary about the making of the album as bonus content. Several European editions of the album contained a \"No Risk Disk\" as a bonus item, featuring one song from each of Megadeth's previous six major label albums. Lastly, the Japanese version of the album includes a bonus track, an instrumental cover version of the theme of the video game \"Duke Nukem 3D\". In 2004, a remixed and remastered version of the album was released, featuring three bonus tracks, all different mixes of songs on the album. The cover for the remaster was noticeably different from the original, featuring a scene from the music video for \"Insomnia\". Vic Rattlehead's face can be seen on the mousetrap of this cover, while he did not appear on the original. In addition, a couple of tracks have slightly different song durations\u2014some shorter, some longer\u2014with the most noticeable one being \"I'll Be There,\" which features an additional 53 seconds.\nLike the band's previous album \"Cryptic Writings\", it is the second Megadeth album not to feature the band's classic logo on the front cover, but it appears on the album's remastered version.\nSongs.\nThree singles were released in support of the album: \"Crush 'Em\", \"Breadline\", and \"Insomnia\". All three received music videos. Additionally, \"Crush 'Em\" was featured in Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1999 movie \"\". Mustaine originally wrote the song hoping that it would be adopted at arenas nationwide as a new sports anthem. After its release as a single, the song has been broadcast during NHL games and pro wrestling events.\nJeff Treppel spoke positively about the album's opener \"Insomnia\", naming it \"one of the best Megadeth songs of the past 15 years\". The song features swirling Middle Eastern strings, crunching guitar line and, according to Treppel, some of Mustaine's most demented lyrics. Treppel further described \"Ecstasy\" as \"grunge ballad\" and noted that it sounds like a \"reject from \"Cryptic Writings\"\". He had mixed feelings about \"Seven\", and observed \"The Doctor Is Calling\" like a tune that \"aims for creepy, but hits cheesy instead\". By contrast, DeGrasso felt that \"The Doctor Is Calling\" along with \"Prince of Darkness\" were \"definitely heavy songs\" with \"really dark lyrics on them\". Ellefson described the tracks \"Breadline\" and \"Wanderlust\" as \"melodic\" with \"very modern-sounding\" grooves. Neil Arnold from \"Metal Forces\" opined that \"Breadline\" is \"as melodic and commercial as Megadeth gets\", while noting that \"Wanderlust\" and \"I'll Be There\" are \"probably two of the band's most underrated songs\".\nAll of the released singles charted on the Billboard's Mainstream Rock Chart, with \"Crush 'Em\" and \"Breadline\" breaking into the Top 10. Aside from just being released as a conventional single, \"Breadline\" was also released as its own EP in Japan featuring several versions of the song, and remixes of other songs from \"Risk\" and Megadeth's back catalog. After leaving Megadeth, Friedman would later cover this song on his solo album \"Future Addict\".\nCritical reception.\nThe album received a mixed response from music critics. AllMusic's reviewer Steve Huey gave a sympathetic, if not exactly favorable, review of the remixed and remastered 2004 pressing of \"Risk\". Huey stated that the album had \"aged gracefully,\" compared to Metallica's \"Load\" (1996) and \"ReLoad\" (1997). However, he did note that the band had lost their edge on the album. \"Entertainment Weekly\" reviewer Laura Morgan compared \"Insomnia\" to \"Broken\"-era Nine Inch Nails and gave the album a B\u2212, though she criticized Mustaine's vocal performance on the album. \"The New Rolling Stone Album Guide\" gave the album three stars out of five and noted that the album \"had its moments\". Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic, taking into account that the album has a different appeal, was somewhat positive in his review. Stagno cited the first few tracks as the album's \"harder edge\". However, he noted that some of the following softer tracks were \"standout tracks\" as well. Stagno did note, however, that some of the emotion on the album was \"cheesy\". Amy Sciarretto of \"CMJ New Music Report\" noted that \"Risk\" marked another significant change in Megadeth's sound and called it a \"logical stylistic progression\" from their previous album. According to her, Mustaine's \"biting lyrics\" and \"power riffs\" were toned down, finding Megadeth \"traveling out of thrash metal territory\". Steven Wells of \"NME\" panned the album, giving it a 0/10 score and saying that the album was the American equivalent of the retro stylings of Travis and Kula Shaker, as well as calling the album \"corporate mock rock\".\nIn a retrospective review, Jeff Treppel from \"Decibel\" wrote that \"Risk\" was \"definitely Megadeth's most adventurous record\" and characterized it as a \"decent hard rock album that should have never been put out under the Megadeth name\". Dave Mustaine has since expressed that, although he believes that \"Risk\" is a great record, it \"should not have had the name Megadeth on it, because if anybody else's name was on 'Risk,' it would have sold\". However, Mustaine has also stated that \"Crush 'Em\" was \"probably the dumbest\" song that the band has ever recorded and said that he was \"not too fond of\" it.\nWhen speaking to Eddie Trunk on his \"Trunk Nation LA Invasion: Live from the Rainbow Bar and Grill\" podcast in late November 2018, Mustaine said that the reason for \"Risk\" was him \"capitulating to Marty's desires to be more of an alternative band, and we kept slowing down and slowing down and slowing down.\" He would again mention that if the album was released under a different name, it would've sold well, but that \"People wanted a Megadeth record. They didn't wanna see Dave bending over backwards to keep Marty Friedman happy, 'cause Marty wanted us to sound like fucking Dishwalla.\" Mustaine says he doesn't regret making \"Risk\" or the song \"Crush 'Em\", and that he wanted Friedman and Nick Menza to be happy and remain in the band, \"And after a while, I just figured, 'I don't need this shit.' And Marty went this way, Nick went that way, and we just all kind of broke up.\" Additionally, Mustaine would later state that he believed \"Wanderlust\" to be one of the best songs he had ever written, noting the song's country rock influenced style.\nFriedman says that he has no regrets about \"Risk\", and that \"anything that needed to be said from me about that was probably said at the time. I haven't even thought about that since then, so I couldn't give you an intelligent answer. I'm barely thinking about what I did yesterday, much less back then.\" He would also say that everybody involved in the album \"was doing the best that they possibly could\" and assured that \"anything was done with the best of intentions and the hardest work.\"\nTrack listing.\nAll music composed by Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman except where noted.\nPersonnel.\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After the critical and commercial failure of the previous album \"Risk\" (1999), \"The World Needs a Hero\" represented a change back to a heavier musical direction. Subsequently, the album charted at number 16 on the \"Billboard\" 200 upon release.\nAfter parting with former label Capitol Records, the album was the first of two Megadeth studio albums to be released by Sanctuary. It was the last of two studio albums to feature drummer Jimmy DeGrasso, the last to feature bassist David Ellefson until \"Thirteen\" (2011), the only one to feature guitarist Al Pitrelli, and the last one before Megadeth's brief disbandment in 2002. It is also the first album to feature the band's mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover since \"Rust in Peace\" (1990), and the first to utilize Megadeth's classic logo since \"Youthanasia\" (1994).\nAt 57 minutes and 49 seconds, \"The World Needs a Hero\" was Megadeth's longest album until \"The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!\" (2022). It also contains Megadeth's longest song, \"When\", clocking in at 9 minutes and 14 seconds.\nBackground and production.\nIn 1999, Megadeth released their eighth studio album, \"Risk\". The album was noteworthy for being a drastic musical departure for the band, and the culmination of the band's increasing attempts for mainstream success throughout the 1990s, a trend starting with \"Countdown to Extinction\" (1992). \"The World Needs a Hero\" marks a stylistic transition towards the band's thrash metal roots. Furthermore, the album had been touted by the band as an \"antidote\" to \"Risk\" in a press release. However, the album has been noted by several music critics as still retaining some commercial feel from previous albums.\nAccording to frontman Dave Mustaine, the album title refers to stereotypical rock stars. When asked about the matter, and an earlier comment about Axl Rose having killed the traditional rock star image, Mustaine explained that \"People want heroes. Most bands look like average Joes, wearing gas-station shirts, have funky hair-dos and I think people wanna be able to go 'they may not be popular, but they're MY band.'\" Mustaine went on to say that many of contemporary rock music groups looked and sounded the same, and that the music industry needed a hero. He then proceeded to contrast a perceived lack of image of then current music scenes with the image of 1980s metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.\nIn another interview, Mustaine offered a more straightforward interpretation of the album title. Commenting on negative stories in the news, such as wars and natural disasters, Mustaine inferred that the world at that time was in need of a hero to solve various problems around the planet.\nThe album cover by Hugh Syme shows Megadeth's mascot Vic Rattlehead bursting out of Mustaine's chest, reminiscent of the 1979 film \"Alien\".\nSongs.\nThe album's lead single was \"Moto Psycho\", and a video was also made for this song. The song is about people who commute every day to work, spending a lot of time on the road. \"Dread and the Fugitive Mind\" was released on the \"\" compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth's former label, Capitol Records. The album's opener, \"Disconnect\", is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and \"the person I want you to think that I am and the person inside that I really know I am.\" \"Coming Home\" was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the \"Warchest\" box set and the 2019 reissue of the album. Mustaine has stated that concept for \"Promises\" is \"prejudiced relationships,\" such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, \"it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care. It just means that if we can't be together in this life, maybe we'll make it in the next.\"\nWhen asked if \"Recipe for Hate... Warhorse\" was written about any particular person, Mustaine said that there were \"a whole bunch of people that'd probably deserve that song,\" but didn't single out anyone in particular. \"Silent Scorn\" is an instrumental song which is often played over the sound system at concerts; this can be heard on the band's live album \"Rude Awakening\" (2002) right after the final song in the set, \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\". \"Return to Hangar\" is a sequel to \"Hangar 18\" from \"Rust in Peace\"; the captive aliens from the first song escape and kill their captors. On the live albums \"Rude Awakening\" and \"\" (2007) it is played back-to-back with \"Hangar 18\". The main riff and structure of \"When\", the album's closing number, is reminiscent of \"Am I Evil?\" by Diamond Head, which Mustaine said was intentional. \"When\" is also Megadeth's longest song to date, clocking in at 9 minutes and 14 seconds.\nRelease and promotion.\nThe album was released on May 15, 2001, in the United States and sold 61,000 copies in its first week of release, entering the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 16. The album sold another 25,000 copies in its second week, falling to number 59. The album also charted in Poland (#17), Germany (#36), Sweden (#38), and Switzerland (#55) as well. By December 2005, \"The World Needs a Hero\" had sold about 219,000 copies in the United States. Megadeth commenced a tour to promote the album on June 8, 2001, at Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, where they were featured alongside acts such as AC/DC, The Offspring, and Queens of the Stone Age. After Mustaine suffered an arm injury that prevented him from playing guitar, Megadeth temporarily disbanded in 2002. Six of the album's songs appeared on \"Still Alive... and Well?\", a 2002 compilation combining studio tracks from \"The World Needs a Hero\", with six live tracks.\nA remastered version of this album, along with \"The System Has Failed\", was re-issued on CD, vinyl and digital download on February 15, 2019. The remastered edition includes an additional bonus track \"Coming Home\" and revised album artwork.\nCritical reception.\n\"The World Needs a Hero\" received mixed to positive reviews and was regarded as a \"return to roots\" by critics. Writing for AllMusic, reviewer Steve Huey opined that Mustaine \"tries to conjure memories\" of \"Rust in Peace\" and \"Countdown to Extinction\", but while comparing \"Dread and the Fugitive Mind\" to \"Sweating Bullets\" (from \"Countdown to Extinction\") said that much of the material \"feels like rehashed Megadeth\". Huey critiqued the production as still being \"radio-friendly\" and said because of that, the group \"never quite kicks up the fury or flash of past glories\". Neil Arnold of \"Metal Forces\" wrote that even though the album was \"lacking the menace of the band\u2019s earlier work\", it was still a more accomplished effort than the previous record. He concluded that Megadeth were \"clearly opting for melody over aggression\", albeit rarely breaking into \"thrash mode\".\nMeanwhile, reviewer Greg Pratt of \"Brave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles\" was more sympathetic towards the album. Pratt, after briefly critiquing the lack of a thrashy sound, positively compared the record to \"Youthanasia\" (1994) and \"Countdown to Extinction\" (1992). Additionally, he commented that even in the absence of longtime members Nick Menza and Marty Friedman, that the band still sounded good. Pratt reacted positively to a number of the album's songs, but cited \"Recipe for Hate... Warhorse\" as being the album's \"most intense moment\". Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic had mixed feelings about the music on the record. While Stagno noted that the album was advertised as a return towards the band's roots, he explained that those who were hoping for an album in the style of the band's first four records would be disappointed. Stagno ultimately defined the album as \"more of an all-out metal record\".\n\"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" described the album as \"sluggish\" and \"retrograde\" and called it a \"step back for the band\". \"Orlando Weekly\"'s John Engels felt that the void left by former guitarist Marty Friedman was successfully filled by Al Pitrelli. However, he noted that the album occasionally sounds repetitive, and criticized a number of songs for their \"childish\" lyrics. Friedman stated he was \"a little disappoint[ed]\" by the album. Friedman specifically singled out the album's cover for criticism, though he also commented that he thought that the music was \"very well done\".\nPersonnel.\nProduction and performance credits are adapted from the album liner notes, except where otherwise noted.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Isis Whit, a young but important member of a small, quirky cult in Scotland, narrates. The community suspects that Isis' cousin Morag is in danger, and sends Isis out to help.\nPlot summary.\nIsis, otherwise The Blessed Very Reverend Gaia-Marie Isis Saraswati Minerva Mirza Whit of Luskentyre, Beloved Elect of God III, is the 19-year-old granddaughter and designated spiritual heir of Salvador Whit, patriarch of the Luskentyrians. They are a religious cult who live in a commune in Stirlingshire and reject most technology. They run their lives according to a collection of beliefs and rituals \"revealed\" to Salvador after he washed ashore on Harris in the Western Isles and \"married\" two young Asian ladies (Aasni and Zhobelia Asis). (Haggis pakora becomes a staple of the cult's cuisine.)\nThe novel opens shortly before the Luskentyrian Festival of Love, held every four years, about nine months before every leap year day (29 February). The Luskentyrians believe that those born on that day have special power. This includes Isis herself, Elect of God, and expected to take over leadership of the cult.\nThe bulk of the novel tells of Isis' voyages in the world of \"the Unsaved\" (also known as \"the Obtuse\", \"the Wretched\", \"the Bland\" and \"the Asleep\"), through Scotland and southern England in search of Morag, who is feared to have rejected the cult.\nWhile searching for her cousin, Isis meets Rastas, policemen, white power skinheads, and other characters of a sort she has never encountered before, and tells the story of the cult and the rationale behind its rules. Isis' maternal grandmother, Yolanda, a feisty Texan woman, appears and lends her support to Isis' quest. Isis' friend Sophi, although not part of the cult, is very close to her. Isis meets her whenever she goes to her house to use the Luskentyrian method of free (if laborious) telephone communication, using coded rings.\nReturning with enhanced maturity and a lot more information, Isis must decide what to tell the other members of the cult.\nLiterary significance and criticism.\nLike many of Banks' characters, from Frank Cauldhame in \"The Wasp Factory\" to Prentice McHoan in \"The Crow Road\", Isis engages in a half-unconscious search for knowledge which will inevitably turn her world upside down. The novel thus becomes a type of \"Bildungsroman\".\nBanks portrays the cult largely sympathetically, especially given its publication shortly after the Waco Siege in 1993 (which Yolanda discusses within the novel). Banks ensures that the Luskentyrian theology (in which Isis fervently believes at the start of the book) has coherence and consistency, even as events cause her to start to doubt.\nBanks has called it:\na book about religion and culture written by a dedicated evangelical atheist \u2013 I thought I was very kind to them... Essentially, Isis makes the recognition that the value of the Luskentyrian cult is in their community values rather than their religious ones. She recognises that efficiency isn't everything, that people not profit are what matters."}

The album was released by Sanctuary Records in 2002, and is the last release before the band broke up in 2002. It was released in both CD and DVD formats.\nThe album was originally going to be recorded live at a concert in Argentina, but due to the September 11, 2001 attacks, the band decided to record it live in the United States.\nTracks on the album are taken from two live concerts, performed two nights in a row in November 2001. The first night was at the Rialto Theater in Tucson, Arizona, followed the next day by an almost identical performance (to ensure clean audio and video footage, and for a variety of editing options), at the Web Theater in Phoenix, Arizona. Dave Mustaine dedicated the performance of \"A Tout le Monde\" to the victims of the September 11th attacks and mentions this before performing it. Two previously unreleased tracks from the concert, \"The Conjuring\" and \"Time: The Beginning\"/\"Use the Man\" were released on \"Still Alive... and Well?\" (which also features \"In My Darkest Hour\", \"Sweating Bullets\", \"Symphony of Destruction\" and \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\"). \"Silent Scorn\" can be heard as a tape outro for the band during \"Holy Wars\".\nThe tracks on the DVD are all from the second show at the Web Theater in Phoenix, Arizona on November 17, 2001. For the bonus features of the DVD they used recordings from the show in Tucson, Arizona,\nThis is the only Megadeth album which does not include the band logo or title on the immediate cover. It is located on the side bar of the album instead. The album's cover was designed by graphic designer Storm Thorgerson (noted for his work with Pink Floyd) and Peter Curzon.\nThis was the end of this line-up of the band. Al Pitrelli and Jimmy DeGrasso played their final show. Dave Ellefson left the band because he wasn't satisfied with his share of the band's earnings. In 2010 he returned to the band. The DVD was certified gold in the US and Canada.\nReception.\nBrian O'Neill of AllMusic rated Rude Awakening a 3 out of 5, opining that, while he believes the album is \"fraught with\" limitations, it is \"a far better encapsulation of the band's career to date than the spotty \"\" compilation.\"\nThe album won a 2002 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for Compilation/Live Album of the Year. Since it was generally believed to be Megadeth's swan song at the time (until their reformation in 2004), the magazine stated, \"Megadeth's farewell gets the recognition it deserves.\"\nPersonnel.\nCredits adapted from CD liner notes:\nMegadeth\nProduction\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Murdoch is best known for her novels about good and evil, sexual relationships, morality, and the power of the unconscious. Her first published novel, \"Under the Net\" (1954), was selected in 1998 as one of Modern Library's 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Her 1978 novel \"The Sea, The Sea\" won the Booker Prize. In 1987, she was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II for services to literature. In 2008, \"The Times\" ranked Murdoch twelfth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".\nHer other books include \"The Bell\" (1958), \"A Severed Head\" (1961), \"An Unofficial Rose\" (1962), \"The Red and the Green\" (1965), \"The Nice and the Good\" (1968), \"The Black Prince\" (1973), \"Henry and Cato\" (1976), \"The Philosopher's Pupil\" (1983), \"The Good Apprentice\" (1985), \"The Book and the Brotherhood\" (1987), \"The Message to the Planet\" (1989), and \"The Green Knight\" (1993).\nAs a philosopher, Murdoch's best-known work is \"The Sovereignty of Good\" (1970). She was married for 43 years, until her death, to the literary critic and author John Bayley.\nLife.\nMurdoch was born in Phibsborough, Dublin, Ireland, the daughter of Irene Alice (n\u00e9e Richardson, 1899\u20131985) and Wills John Hughes Murdoch. Her father, a civil servant, came from a mainly Presbyterian sheep farming family from Hillhall, County Down. In 1915, he enlisted as a soldier in King Edward's Horse and served in France during the First World War before being commissioned as a Second lieutenant. Her mother had trained as a singer before Iris was born, and was from a middle-class Church of Ireland family in Dublin. Iris Murdoch's parents first met in Dublin when her father was on leave and were married in 1918. Iris was the couple's only child. When she was a few weeks old the family moved to London, where her father had joined the Ministry of Health as a second-class clerk. She was a second cousin of the Irish mathematician Brian Murdoch.\nMurdoch was brought up in Chiswick and educated privately, entering the Froebel Demonstration School in 1925 and attending Badminton School in Bristol as a boarder from 1932 to 1938. In 1938, she went up to Somerville College, Oxford, with the intention of studying English, but switched to \"Greats\", a course of study combining classics, ancient history, and philosophy. At Oxford she studied philosophy with Donald M. MacKinnon and attended Eduard Fraenkel's seminars on \"Agamemnon\". She was awarded a first-class honours degree in 1942. After leaving Oxford she went to work in London for HM Treasury. In June 1944, she left the Treasury and went to work for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). At first, she was stationed in London at the agency's European Regional Office. In 1945, she was transferred first to Brussels, then to Innsbruck, and finally to Graz, Austria, where she worked in a refugee camp. She left the UNRRA in 1946.\nFrom 1947 to 1948, Iris Murdoch studied philosophy as a postgraduate at Newnham College, Cambridge. She met Ludwig Wittgenstein at Cambridge but did not hear him lecture, as he had left his Trinity College professorship before she arrived. In 1948 she became a fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford, where she taught philosophy until 1963. From 1963 to 1967, she taught one day a week in the General Studies department at the Royal College of Art.\nIn 1956, Murdoch married John Bayley, a literary critic, novelist, and from 1974 to 1992 Warton Professor of English at the University of Oxford, whom she had met in Oxford in 1954. The unusual romantic partnership lasted more than forty years until Murdoch's death. Bayley thought that sex was \"inescapably ridiculous.\" Murdoch in contrast had \"multiple affairs with both men and women which, on discomposing occasions, [Bayley] witnessed for himself.\" Notably she had a long and turbulent love relationship with writer Brigid Brophy.\nIris Murdoch's first novel, \"Under the Net\", was published in 1954. She had previously published essays on philosophy, and the first monograph about Jean-Paul Sartre published in English. She went on to produce 25 more novels and additional works of philosophy, as well as poetry and drama. In 1976 she was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in 1987 was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She was awarded honorary degrees by Durham University (DLitt, 1977), the University of Bath (DLitt, 1983), University of Cambridge (1993) and Kingston University (1994), among others. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982.\nThe house at 30 Charlbury Road where she lived with her husband from 1989 to her death has an Oxfordshire blue plaque. Her last novel, \"Jackson's Dilemma\", was published in 1995. Iris Murdoch was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1997 and died in 1999 in Oxford. There is a bench dedicated to her on the grounds of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she used to enjoy walking. Dublin City Council and the Irish postal service marked the centenary of Murdoch's birth in 2019 by unveiling a commemorative plaque and postage stamp at her birthplace.\nWork.\nPhilosophy.\nFor some time, Murdoch's influence and achievements as a philosopher were eclipsed by her success as a novelist, but recent appraisals have increasingly accorded her a substantial role in postwar Anglo-American philosophy, particularly for her unfashionably prescient work in moral philosophy and her reinterpretation of Aristotle and Plato. Martha Nussbaum has argued for Murdoch's \"transformative impact on the discipline\" of moral philosophy because she directed her analysis not at the once-dominant matters of will and choice, but at those of attention (how people learn to see and conceive of one another) and phenomenal experience (how the sensory \"thinginess\" of life shapes moral sensibility). Because as Calley A. Hornbuckle puts, \"For Murdoch, the most essential kind of knowledge is the knowledge that other people exist.\"\nAlthough first a student, and later a lecturer and scholar, of 20th century British analytic moral philosophy, Murdoch rejected most of what was characteristic of that tradition. With the rise of anti-metaphysical empiricism in general, and logical positivism in particular, emotivists like A. J. Ayer and prescriptivists like R. M. Hare settled the good independently of active cognitive practices and therefore not something to be attained by them. In \"The Sovereignty of Good\", Murdoch argues that such a criterion of reality follows from the adoption of an \"uncriticized conception of science.\" Such detachment from personal immersion in the reality of moral life was incompatible with her metaphysical commitments. Lawrence Blum concludes from such considerations that \"[s]he is thus a 'moral realist', 'moral objectivist' and 'moral cognitivist'[...].\"\nIn a recent survey of Murdoch's philosophical work, Justin Broackes points to several distinctive features of Murdoch's moral philosophy, including a \"moral realism or 'naturalism', allowing into the world cases of such properties as humility or generosity; an anti\u2010scientism; a rejection of Humean moral psychology; a sort of 'particularism'; special attention to the virtues; and emphasis on the metaphor of moral perception or 'seeing' moral facts.\" The reasons for this are unclear, but the Scottish literary critic G. S. Fraser notes that, in the late 1940s, the philosophers who were then occupying Murdoch's attention were late Victorian British idealists, such as T. H. Green, F. H. Bradley, and Bernard Bosanquet. Broackes also notes that Murdoch's influence on the discipline of philosophy was sometimes indirect since it impacted both her contemporaries and the following generation of philosophers, particularly Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Bernard Williams. She sent copies of her earlier novels to Anscombe, but there is nothing in Anscombe's writing which reflects any of these.\nHer philosophical work was influenced by Simone Weil (from whom she borrows the concept of 'attention'), and by Plato, under whose banner she claimed to fight. In re-animating Plato, she gives force to the reality of the Good, and to a sense of the moral life as a pilgrimage from illusion to reality. From this perspective, Murdoch's work offers perceptive criticism of Kant, Sartre, and Wittgenstein ('early' and 'late'). Her most central parable, which appears in \"The Sovereignty of Good\", asks us (in Nussbaum's succinct account), \"to imagine a mother-in-law, M, who has contempt for D, her daughter-in-law. M sees D as common, cheap, low. Since M is a self-controlled Englishwoman, she behaves (so Murdoch stipulates) with perfect graciousness all the while, and no hint of her real view surfaces in her acts. But she realises, too, that her feelings and thoughts are unworthy, and likely to be generated by jealousy and an excessively keen desire to hang on to her son. So she sets herself a moral task: she will change her view of D, making it more accurate, less marred by selfishness. She gives herself exercises in vision: where she is inclined to say 'coarse,' she will say, and see, 'spontaneous.' Where she is inclined to say 'common,' she will say, and see, 'fresh and naive.' As time goes on, the new images supplant the old. Eventually M does not have to make such an effort to control her actions: they flow naturally from the way she has come to see D.\" This is how M cultivates a pattern of behavior that leads her to view D \"justly or lovingly\". The parable is partly meant to show (against Oxford contemporaries including R. M. Hare and Stuart Hampshire) the importance of the \"inner\" life to moral action. Seeing another correctly can depend on overcoming jealousy, and discoveries about the world involve inner work.\nFiction.\nHer novels, in their attention and generosity to the inner lives of individuals, follow the tradition of novelists like Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, George Eliot, and Proust, besides showing an abiding love of Shakespeare. There is however great variety in her achievement, and the richly layered structure and compelling realistic comic imagination of \"The Black Prince\" (1973) is very different from the early comic works \"Under the Net\" (1954) or \"The Unicorn\" (1963). \"The Unicorn\" can be read as a sophisticated Gothic romance, or as a novel with Gothic trappings, or perhaps as a parody of the Gothic mode of writing. \"The Black Prince\", for which Murdoch won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, is a study of erotic obsession, and the text becomes more complicated, suggesting multiple interpretations, when subordinate characters contradict the narrator and the mysterious \"editor\" of the book in a series of afterwords. Though her novels differ markedly, and her style developed, themes recur. Her novels often include upper-middle-class male intellectuals caught in moral dilemmas, gay characters, refugees, Anglo-Catholics with crises of faith, empathetic pets, curiously \"knowing\" children and sometimes a powerful and almost demonic male \"enchanter\" who imposes his will on the other characters\u2014a type of man Murdoch is said to have modelled on her lover, the Nobel laureate Elias Canetti.\nMurdoch was awarded the Booker Prize in 1978 for \"The Sea, the Sea\", a finely detailed novel about the power of love and loss, featuring a retired stage director who is overwhelmed by jealousy when he meets his erstwhile lover after several decades apart. It was dedicated to archaeologist Rosemary Cramp, who had been a student at St Anne's. An authorised collection of her poetic writings, \"Poems by Iris Murdoch\", appeared in 1997, edited by Paul Hullah and Yozo Muroya. Several of her works have been adapted for the screen, including the British television series of her novels \"An Unofficial Rose\" and \"The Bell\". J. B. Priestley's dramatisation of her 1961 novel \"A Severed Head\" starred Ian Holm and Richard Attenborough.\nIn 1988 the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Murdoch its annual Shakespeare Prize in recognition of her life's work. In 1997, she was awarded the Golden PEN Award by English PEN for \"a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature\".\nHarold Bloom wrote in his 1986 review of \"The Good Apprentice\" that \"no other contemporary British novelist\" seemed of her \"eminence\". A. S. Byatt called her \"a great philosophical novelist.\" James Wood wrote in \"How Fiction Works\": \"In her literary and philosophical criticism, she again and again stresses that the creation of free and independent characters is the mark of a great novelist; yet her own characters never have this freedom.\" He stressed that some authors, \"like Tolstoy, Trollope, Balzac and Dickens\", wrote about people different from themselves by choice, whereas others, such as \"James, Flaubert, Lawrence, Woolf\", have more interest in the self. Wood called Murdoch \"poignant\", because she spent her whole life writing in the latter category, while she struggled to fit herself into the former.\nPolitical views.\nMurdoch won a scholarship to study at Vassar College in the US in 1946, but was refused a visa because she had joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1938, while a student at Oxford. She left the party in 1942, when she went to work at the Treasury, but remained sympathetic to communism for several years. In later years she was allowed to visit the United States, but always had to obtain a waiver from the provisions of the McCarran Act, which barred Communist Party members and former members from entering the country. In a 1990 \"Paris Review\" interview, she said that her membership of the Communist Party had made her see \"how strong and how awful it [Marxism] is, certainly in its organized form\".\nAside from her Communist Party membership, her Irish heritage is the sensitive aspect of Murdoch's political life that has attracted interest. Part of the interest revolves around the fact that, although Irish by both birth and traced descent on both sides, Murdoch did not display the full set of political opinions that are sometimes assumed to go with this origin. Biographer Peter Conradi wrote: \"No one ever agrees about who is entitled to lay claim to Irishness. Iris's Belfast cousins today call themselves British, not Irish ... [But] Iris has as valid a claim to call herself Irish as most North Americans have to call themselves American\". Conradi notes A. N. Wilson's record that Murdoch regretted the sympathetic portrayal of the Irish nationalist cause she had given earlier in \"The Red and the Green\", and a competing defence of the book at Caen in 1978. The novel, while broad of sympathy, is hardly an unambiguous celebration of the 1916 rising, dwelling upon bloodshed, unintended consequences and the evils of romanticism, besides celebrating selfless individuals on both sides. Later, of Ian Paisley, Murdoch stated \"[he] sincerely condemns violence and did not intend to incite the Protestant terrorists. That he is emotional and angry is not surprising, after 12\u201315 years of murderous IRA activity. All this business is deep in my soul, I'm afraid.\" In private correspondence with her close friend and fellow philosopher Philippa Foot, she remarked in 1978 that she felt \"unsentimental about Ireland to the point of hatred\" and, of a Franco-Irish conference she had attended in Caen in 1982, said that \"the sounds of all those Irish voices made me feel privately sick. They just couldn't help sympathising with the IRA, like Americans do. A mad bad world\".\nBiographies and memoirs.\nPeter J. Conradi's 2001 biography was the fruit of long research and authorised access to journals and other papers. It is also a labour of love, and of a friendship with Murdoch that extended from a meeting at her Gifford Lectures to her death. The book was well received. John Updike commented: \"There would be no need to complain of literary biographies [...] if they were all as good\". The text addresses many popular questions about Murdoch, such as how Irish she was and what her politics were. Though not a trained philosopher, Conradi's interest in Murdoch's achievement as a thinker is evident in the biography, and yet more so in his earlier work of literary criticism, \"The Saint and the Artist: A Study of Iris Murdoch's Works\" (Macmillan, 1986; HarperCollins, 2001). He also recalled his personal encounters with Murdoch in \"Going Buddhist: Panic and Emptiness, the Buddha and Me\" (Short Books, 2005). Conradi's archive of material on Murdoch, together with Iris Murdoch's Oxford library, is held at Kingston University.\nAn account of Murdoch's life with a different ambition is given by A. N. Wilson in his 2003 book \"Iris Murdoch as I Knew Her\". The work was described by Galen Strawson in \"The Guardian\" as \"mischievously revelatory\" and labelled by Wilson himself as an \"anti-biography\".\nDavid Morgan met Iris Murdoch in 1964, when he was a student at the Royal College of Art. His 2010 memoir \"With Love and Rage: A Friendship with Iris Murdoch\", describes their lifelong friendship.\nJohn Bayley wrote two memoirs of his life with Iris Murdoch. \"Iris: A Memoir\" was published in the United Kingdom in 1998, shortly before her death. The American edition, which was published in 1999, was called \"Elegy for Iris\". A sequel entitled \"Iris and Her Friends\" was published in 1999, after her death. Murdoch was portrayed by Kate Winslet and Judi Dench in Richard Eyre's film \"Iris\" (2001), based on Bayley's memories of his wife as she developed Alzheimer's disease.\nIn her centenary year, 2019, a collection of unpublished memoirs was published by Sabrestorm Press, entitled \"Iris Murdoch: A Centenary Celebration\", edited by Miles Leeson, who directs the Iris Murdoch Research Centre at the University of Chichester, UK.\nAdaptations.\nIn 2015, BBC Radio 4 broadcast an Iris Murdoch season, with several memoirs by people who knew her, and dramatisations of her novels:\nIn March 2019, the London-based production company Rebel Republic Films announced that it had optioned \"The Italian Girl\", and was developing a screenplay based on the book.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

VH1 ranked her the 53rd-greatest woman in rock and roll. In 2005, she was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.\nEarly life and education.\nMorissette was born on June 1, 1974, at Riverside Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the daughter of Georgia Mary Ann (n\u00e9e Feuerstein) and Alan Richard Morissette. Her elder brother, Chad (born 1971), is an entrepreneur, and her twin brother, Wade (12 minutes elder), is a musician. Alan is of French and Irish descent, while Georgia, who fled Hungary during the anti-Soviet uprising in 1956, has Jewish ancestry. Morissette ethnically identifies as \"a quarter Jewish\". On a 2024 episode of the American documentary television series \"Finding Your Roots\", Morissette stated that Alan and Georgia had never told their children about the family's Jewish ancestry; Morissette did not discover it until her late 20s.\nIn 1977, the family moved to Lahr, a city in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in what was then West Germany, and Alan and Georgia started working as teachers at the local base of Canadian Air Command. They returned to Ottawa in 1980, and Morissette started taking dance lessons the next year. Morissette had a Catholic upbringing. She attended Holy Family Catholic School for elementary school and Immaculata High School for seventh and eighth grades; she appeared on five episodes of the children's television sketch comedy series \"You Can't Do That on Television\" (1986) while attending the former. Morissette then attended and graduated from Glebe Collegiate Institute.\nCareer.\n1986\u20131993: \"Alanis\" and \"Now Is The Time\".\nMorissette is known for her emotive mezzo-soprano voice and confessional songwriting. She recorded her first demo called \"Fate Stay with Me\", produced by Lindsay Thomas Morgan at Marigold Studios in Toronto, and engineered by Rich Dodson of Canadian classic rock band The Stampeders. A second demo tape was recorded on cassette in August 1989 and sent to Geffen Records, but the tape has never been heard as it was stolen, among other records, in a burglary of the label's headquarters in October 1989.\nIn 1991, MCA Records Canada released Morissette's debut album, \"Alanis\", in Canada only. She co-wrote every track on the album with its producer, Leslie Howe. The dance-pop album went platinum, and its first single, \"Too Hot\", reached the top 20 on the \"RPM\" singles chart. Subsequent singles \"Walk Away\" and \"Feel Your Love\" reached the top 40. Morissette's popularity, style of music and appearance, particularly that of her hair, led her to become known as the Debbie Gibson of Canada; comparisons to Tiffany were also common. During the same period, she was a concert opening act for rapper Vanilla Ice. She was nominated for three 1992 Juno Awards: Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year (which she won), Single of the Year and Best Dance Recording (both for \"Too Hot\").\nIn 1992, Morisette released her second album, \"Now Is the Time\", a ballad-driven record that featured less glitzy production than \"Alanis\" and contained more thoughtful lyrics. She wrote the songs with its producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9. She said of the album, \"People could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But the way I look at it... people will like your next album if it's a kick-ass one.\" As with \"Alanis\", \"Now Is the Time\" was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles\u2014\"An Emotion Away\", the minor adult contemporary hit \"No Apologies\" as well as \"(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time\". The industry considered it a commercial failure since it sold only a little more than half the copies of her first album. By Morissette's account, she was dropped by MCA Canada thereafter as her musical identity was shifting in a direction that they weren't interested in developing.\n1994\u20131999: \"Jagged Little Pill\" and \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\".\nIn 1993, Morissette's publisher Leeds Levy at MCA Music Publishing introduced her to the manager Scott Welch. Welch told HitQuarters he was impressed by her \"spectacular\" voice, her character and her lyrics. At the time she was still living with her parents. Together they decided it would be best for her career to move to Toronto and start writing with other people. After graduating from high school, Morissette moved from Ottawa to Toronto. Her publisher funded part of her development and she spent her time there composing and rehearsing with a number of other musicians, looking to find a songwriting partner for her next album. Although a number of songs came out of these sessions, none would make an album cut and no lasting partnerships were formed.\nAfter Morissette moved to Los Angeles, she met the producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, who believed in her talent enough to let her use his studio. They wrote songs together, with him supporting her sound rather than trying to shape or mold it to his own tastes. In her newfound freeness of creative spirit, they wrote and recorded Morissette's first internationally released album, \"Jagged Little Pill\", and in 1995 she signed a deal with Maverick Records. According to Welch, every other label they approached declined to sign her.\nMaverick Records released \"Jagged Little Pill\" internationally in June 1995. It was expected only to sell enough for Morissette to make a follow-up, but the situation improved quickly when KROQ-FM, an influential Los Angeles modern rock radio station, began playing \"You Oughta Know\", the first single, featuring Flea and Dave Navarro from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The song instantly garnered attention for its scathing, explicit lyrics, and a subsequent music video went into heavy rotation on MTV and MuchMusic. In a 2008 interview, Dave Coulier said he was the ex-boyfriend who inspired \"You Oughta Know\"; in the 2021 documentary \"Jagged\", Morissette denied it is about him. In a 2019 appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Morissette mentioned that multiple people have taken credit for being the inspiration behind her song \"You Oughta Know\". She stated, \"I just think: If you're going to take credit for a song where I'm singing about someone being a douche or an asshole, you might not want to say, 'Hey! That's me!'\" She described the song as being written out of \"devastation\", reflecting a range of emotions that women often feel but are told to suppress, such as anger and sadness.\nAfter the success of \"You Oughta Know\", the album's other hits helped send \"Jagged Little Pill\" to the top of the charts. \"All I Really Want\" and \"Hand in My Pocket\" followed, and the fourth U.S. single, \"Ironic\", became Morissette's biggest hit. \"You Learn\" and \"Head over Feet\", the fifth and sixth singles, kept \"Jagged Little Pill\" (1995) in the top 20 on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart for more than a year. \"Jagged Little Pill\" sold more than 16 million copies in the U.S.; it sold 33 million worldwide, making it the second biggest-selling album by a female artist (behind Shania Twain's \"Come On Over\").\nMorissette's popularity grew significantly in Canada, where the album was certified twelve times platinum and produced four \"RPM\" chart-toppers: \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"Ironic\", \"You Learn\", and \"Head over Feet\". The album was also a bestseller in Australia and the United Kingdom.\nMorissette's success with \"Jagged Little Pill\" (1995) was credited with opening doors for female singers such as Meredith Brooks, Tracy Bonham and Patti Rothberg, and later Avril Lavigne and Pink. Morissette and the album won six Juno Awards in 1996: Album of the Year, Single of the Year (\"You Oughta Know\"), Female Vocalist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year and Best Rock Album. At the 16th Brit Awards she won Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act. At the 38th Annual Grammy Awards in 1996, she won Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Song (both for \"You Oughta Know\"), Best Rock Album and Album of the Year.\n\"Ironic\" got the instant success, though the lyrics were heavily criticized for their malapropism, and the music video received 6 nominations at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, where it won Best New Artist in a Video, Best Female Video and Best Editing in a Video (won by Scott Gray, Editor), and was also nominated for Viewer's Choice, Best Direction in a Video and Video of the Year. Rather than perform that song at the ceremony, Morrisette performed \"Your House\" instead, which is homage to Joni Mitchell. The song was also nominated for two 1997 Grammy Awards\u2014Record of the Year and Best Music Video, Short Form\u2014and won Single of the Year at the 1997 Juno Awards, where she also won Songwriter of the Year and the International Achievement Award.\nMorissette embarked on an 18-month world tour in support of \"Jagged Little Pill\", beginning in small clubs and ending in large venues. Taylor Hawkins, who later joined the Foo Fighters, was the tour's drummer. Radiohead joined as the opening act in mid-1996. The video \"Jagged Little Pill, Live\", which was co-directed by Morissette and is about the bulk of her tour won a 1998 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Long Form.\nFollowing the tour, Morissette began practicing Iyengar Yoga for balance. After the last December 1996 show, she went to India for six weeks, accompanied by Georgia, two aunts and two friends. The trip left her with an indelible impression and set the cornerstone for the concept of her next album.\nMorissette was featured as a guest vocalist on Ringo Starr's cover of \"Drift Away\" on his 1998 album, \"Vertical Man\", and on the songs \"Don't Drink the Water\" and \"Spoon\" on the Dave Matthews Band album \"Before These Crowded Streets\". She recorded the song \"Uninvited\" for the soundtrack to the 1998 film \"City of Angels\". Although the track was never commercially released as a single, it received widespread radio airplay in the U.S. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, it won in the categories of Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and was nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.\nIn November 1998, Morissette released her fourth album, \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\", which she wrote and co-produced with Glen Ballard. The label hoped to sell 1 million copies of the album on initial release; instead, it debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart with first-week sales of 469,000 copies\u2014a record, at the time, for the highest first-week sales of an album by a female artist. The wordy, personal lyrics on \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" alienated many fans, and after the album sold considerably less than \"Jagged Little Pill\" (1995), many labelled it an example of the sophomore jinx. It received positive reviews, including a four-star review from \"Rolling Stone\". In Canada, it won the Juno Award for Best Album and was certified four times platinum. \"Thank U\", the album's only major international hit single, was released in October 1998 and was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance; the music video, which featured Morissette nude, generated mild controversy. She directed the videos for \"Unsent\" and \"So Pure\", which won, respectively, the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Director and the Juno Award for Video of the Year.\nMorissette contributed vocals to four tracks on Jonathan Elias's project \"The Prayer Cycle\", which was released in 1999, where she paid homage to her roots by singing in Hungarian on \"Mercy\" and \"Faith\", and in French on \"Hope\" and \"Innocence\". The same year, she released the live acoustic album \"Alanis Unplugged\", which was recorded during her appearance on the television show \"MTV Unplugged\". It featured tracks from her previous two albums alongside four new songs, including \"King of Pain\" (a cover of The Police song) and \"No Pressure over Cappuccino\", which she wrote with her main guitar player, Nick Lashley. The recording of the \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" track \"That I Would Be Good\", released as a single, became a minor hit on hot adult contemporary radio in America. Also in 1999, Morissette released a live version of her song \"Are You Still Mad\" on the charity album \"Live in the X Lounge II\". For her live rendition of \"So Pure\" at Woodstock '99, she was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards. During the summer of 1999, Morissette toured with singer-songwriter Tori Amos on the \"5 and a Half Weeks Tour\" in support of Amos' album \"To Venus and Back\" (1999).\n2000\u20132007: \"Under Rug Swept\" and \"So-Called Chaos\".\nIn 2001, Morissette was featured with Stephanie McKay on the Tricky song \"Excess\", which is on his album \"Blowback\". She released her fifth studio album, \"Under Rug Swept\", in February 2002. For the first time in her career, she took on the role of sole writer and producer of an album. Her band, comprising Joel Shearer, Nick Lashley, Chris Chaney, and Gary Novak, played the majority of the instruments; additional contributions came from Eric Avery, Dean DeLeo, Flea, and Meshell Ndegeocello.\n\"Under Rug Swept\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, eventually going platinum in Canada and selling one million copies in the U.S. It produced the hit single \"Hands Clean\", which topped the Canadian Singles Chart and received substantial radio play; for her work on \"Hands Clean\" and \"So Unsexy\", Morissette won a Juno Award for Producer of the Year. A second single, \"Precious Illusions\", was released, but it did not garner significant success outside Canada or U.S. hot AC radio.\nLater in 2002, Morissette released the combination package \"Feast on Scraps\", which includes a DVD of live concert and backstage documentary footage directed by her and a CD containing eight previously unreleased songs from the \"Under Rug Swept\" recording sessions. Preceded by the single \"Simple Together\", it sold roughly 70,000 copies in the U.S. and was nominated for a Juno Award for Music DVD of the Year.\nMorissette hosted the Juno Awards of 2004 dressed in a bathrobe, which she took off to reveal a flesh-colored bodysuit, a response to the era of censorship in the U.S. caused by Janet Jackson's breast-flash incident during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. She released her sixth studio album, \"So-Called Chaos\", in May 2004. She wrote the songs on her own again, and co-produced the album with Tim Thorney and pop music producer John Shanks. The album debuted at number five on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart to generally mixed critical reviews, and it became Morissette's lowest seller in the U.S. and was her first album not to top the chart. The lead single, \"Everything\", achieved major success on Adult Top 40 radio in America and was moderately popular elsewhere, particularly in Canada, although it failed to reach the top 40 on the U.S. Hot 100. Because the first line of the song includes the word \"asshole\", American radio stations refused to play it, and the single version was changed to include the word \"nightmare\" instead. Unhappy that U.S. radio networks had required her to change a word in the song, Canadian radio played the unaltered version, with her stating at the 2004 Juno Awards in Canada: \"Well, I am overjoyed to be back in my homeland, the true North, strong and censor-free.\" Two other singles, \"Out Is Through\" and \"Eight Easy Steps\", fared considerably worse, although a dance mix of \"Eight Easy Steps\" was a U.S. club hit. Morissette embarked on a U.S. summer tour with long-time friends and fellow Canadians Barenaked Ladies, working with the non-profit environmental organization Reverb.\nTo commemorate the 10th anniversary of \"Jagged Little Pill\" (1995), Morissette released a studio acoustic version, \"Jagged Little Pill Acoustic\", in June 2005. The album was released exclusively through Starbucks' Hear Music retail concept through their coffee shops for a six-week run. The limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and HMV Canada, who retaliated by removing Morissette's other albums from sale for the duration of Starbucks's exclusive six-week sale. As of November\u00a02010[ [update]], \"Jagged Little Pill Acoustic\" had sold 372,000 copies in the U.S., and a video for \"Hand in My Pocket\" received rotation on VH1 in America. The accompanying tour ran for two months in mid-2005, with Morissette playing small theatre venues. During the same period, she was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. She opened for The Rolling Stones for a few dates of their A Bigger Bang Tour in fall 2005.\nMorissette released the greatest hits album ' in late 2005. The lead single and only new track, a cover of Seal's \"Crazy\", was an Adult Top 40 and dance hit in the U.S., but achieved only minimal chart success elsewhere. A limited edition of \"The Collection\" features a DVD including a documentary with videos of two unreleased songs from Morissette's 1996 Can't Not Tour: \"King of Intimidation\" and \"Can't Not\". (A reworked version of \"Can't Not\" had also appeared on \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\".) It also includes a ninety-second clip of the unreleased video for the single \"Joining You\". As of November\u00a02010[ [update]], \"The Collection\" had sold 373,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan. That same year, Morissette contributed the song \"Wunderkind\" to the soundtrack of the film ', and she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.\n2006 marked the first year in Morissette's musical career without a single concert appearance showcasing her own songs, with the exception of an appearance on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" in January when she performed \"Wunderkind\".\nOn April 1, 2007, Morissette released a tongue-in-cheek cover of The Black Eyed Peas's selection \"My Humps\", which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied only by a piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively with a group of men and hits the ones who act as if attempting to touch her breasts, had received 16,465,653 views as of February 15, 2009. She did not take any interviews for a time to explain the song, and it was theorized that she did it as an April Fools' Day joke. Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacy \"Fergie\" Ferguson responded by sending Morissette a buttocks-shaped cake with an approving note. On the verge of the release of her following album, she finally elaborated on how the video came to be, citing that she became very much emotionally loaded while recording her new songs one after the other and one day she wished she could do a simple song like \"My Humps\" and the joke just took a life of its own.\nMorissette performed at a gig for The Nightwatchman, a.k.a. Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, at the Hotel Caf\u00e9 in Los Angeles in April 2007. The following June, she performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and \"O Canada\", the American and Canadian national anthems, in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Ottawa Senators and Anaheim Ducks in Ottawa. (The NHL requires arenas to perform both the American and Canadian national anthems at games involving teams from both countries.)\n2008\u20132019: \"Flavors of Entanglement\" and \"Havoc and Bright Lights\".\nIn early 2008, Morissette participated in a tour with Matchbox Twenty and Mutemath as a special guest. Her seventh studio album, \"Flavors of Entanglement\", which was produced by Guy Sigsworth, was released in mid-2008. She has said that the album was created out of her grief after her breakup with Ryan Reynolds, saying \"it was cathartic.\" She stated that in late 2008, she would embark on a North American headlining tour, but in the meantime she would be promoting the album internationally by performing at shows and festivals and making television and radio appearances. The album's first single was \"Underneath\", a video for which was submitted to the 2007 Elevate Film Festival, the purpose of which festival was to create documentaries, music videos, narratives and shorts regarding subjects to raise the level of human consciousness on the earth. On October 3, 2008, she released the video for her latest single, \"Not as We\". She said the album was created out of her grief after splitting up with Reynolds, and the song \"Torch\" was written about him.\nShe has also recorded a cover of the 1984 Willie Nelson and Julio Iglesias hit, \"To All the Girls I've Loved Before\", re-written as \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\". Nelson played rhythm guitar on the recording. In April 2010, she released the song \"I Remain\", which she wrote for the \"\" soundtrack. On May 26, 2010, the season finale of \"American Idol\", she performed a duet of \"You Oughta Know\" with Runner Up Crystal Bowersox. She left Maverick Records after all promotion for \"Flavors\" was completed.\nOn November 20, 2011, she appeared at the American Music Awards. When asked about the new album during a short interview, she said she had recorded 31 songs, and that the album would \"likely be out next year, probably [in] summertime\". On December 21, 2011, she performed a duet of \"Uninvited\" with finalist Josh Krajcik during the performance finale of the X-Factor.\nMorissette embarked on a European tour for summer 2012, according to Alanis.com. In early May 2012, a new song called \"Magical Child\" appeared on a Starbucks compilation called Every Mother Counts.\nOn May 2, 2012, Morissette revealed through her Facebook account that her eighth studio album, entitled \"Havoc and Bright Lights\", would be released in August 2012, on new label Collective Sounds, distributed by Sony's RED Distribution. On the same day, \"Billboard\" specified the date as August 28 and revealed the album would contain twelve tracks. Its lead single, \"Guardian\", was released on iTunes on May 15, 2012, and hit the radio airwaves four days prior to this. The single had minor success in North America, charting the \"Billboard\" Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles in the US and almost reaching the top 40 in Canada. It was a hit in several European countries.\nOn August 21, 2012, Morissette was inducted into the Guitar Center RockWalk in Hollywood. She received the UCLA Spring Sing's George and Ira Gershwin Award on May 16, 2014, at Pauley Pavilion. On her website starting in summer 2014, in celebration of her fortieth birthday, the LP record for her song \"Big Sur\" was offered for sale, which was previously available on the Target edition of her 2012 album, \"Havoc and Bright Lights\". July 25, 2014, was the start of the ten-show Intimate and Acoustic tour. In 2015, she was named to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.\nIn celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the release of \"Jagged Little Pill\", a new four-disc collector's edition was released on October 30, 2015. The four-disc edition includes remastered audio of the original album as well as an entire disc of 10 unreleased demos from the era, handpicked by Morissette from her archives, offering a deeper and more personal look at the classic album. Also included is a previously unreleased concert from 1995 as well as 2005's \"Jagged Little Pill Acoustic\".\nWhile on tour in August 2017, Morissette teased a song which would become known as \"I Miss The Band\".

She appeared on stage with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society in 1985 and 1988. In 1999, she delved into acting again, for the first time since 1993, appearing as God in the Kevin Smith comedy \"Dogma\" and contributing the song \"Still\" to its soundtrack. She reprised her role as God for a post-credits scene in Smith's next film, \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\", to literally close the book on the View Askewniverse. She also appeared in the hit HBO comedies \"Sex and the City\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", appeared in the play \"The Vagina Monologues\", and had brief cameos playing herself in the Brazilian hit soap operas \"Celebridade\" and \"Malha\u00e7\u00e3o\".\nIn late 2003, Morissette appeared in the Off-Broadway play \"The Exonerated\" as Sunny Jacobs, a death row inmate freed after proof surfaced that she was innocent. In April 2006, MTV News reported that she would reprise her role in \"The Exonerated\" in London from May 23 until May 28. She expanded her acting credentials with the July 2004 release of the Cole Porter biographical film \"De-Lovely\", in which she performed the song \"Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)\" and had a brief role as an anonymous stage performer. In February 2005, she made a guest appearance on the Canadian television show \"\" with \"Dogma\" co-star Jason Mewes and director Kevin Smith. Also in 2005, she, then engaged to Ryan Reynolds, made a cameo appearance as \"herself\" as a former client of Reynolds' character in the film \"Just Friends\".

Dick's novel \"Radio Free Albemuth\". She plays Sylvia, an ordinary woman in unexpected remission from lymphoma. She stated that she is \"...a big fan of Philip K.

{"id": "60330", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60330", "title": "Self", "text": "Individual person as the object of its own reflective consciousness\nIn philosophy, the self is an individual's own being, knowledge, and values, and the relationship between these attributes. \nThe first-person perspective distinguishes selfhood from personal identity. Whereas \"identity\" is (literally) sameness and may involve categorization and labeling,\nselfhood implies a first-person perspective and suggests potential uniqueness. Conversely, \"person\" is used as a third-person reference. Personal identity can be impaired in late-stage Alzheimer's disease and in other neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the self is distinguishable from \"others\". Including the distinction between sameness and otherness, the self versus other is a research topic in contemporary philosophy and contemporary phenomenology (see also psychological phenomenology), psychology, psychiatry, neurology, and neuroscience.\nAlthough subjective experience is central to selfhood, the privacy of this experience is only one of many problems in the philosophy of self and the scientific study of consciousness.\nPsychology.\nThe psychology of self is the study of either the cognitive and affective representation of one's identity or the subject of experience. The earliest formulation of the self in modern psychology forms the distinction between two elements I and me. The self as \"I\", is the subjective knower. While, the self as \"Me\", is the subject that is known. Current views of the self in psychology positions the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and social identity. Self, following the ideas of John Locke, has been seen as a product of episodic memory but research on people with amnesia reveals that they have a coherent sense of self based on preserved conceptual autobiographical knowledge. Hence, it is possible to correlate cognitive and affective experiences of self with neural processes. A goal of this ongoing research is to provide grounding insight into the elements of which the complex multiple situated selves of human identity are composed.\nWhat the Freudian tradition has subjectively called, \"sense of self\" is for Jungian analytic psychology, where one's identity is lodged in the persona or ego and is subject to change in maturation. Carl Jung distinguished, \"The self is not only the center but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the center of this totality...\". The Self in Jungian psychology is \"the archetype of wholeness and the regulating center of the psyche ... a transpersonal power that transcends the ego.\" As a Jungian archetype, it cannot be seen directly, but by ongoing individuating maturation and analytic observation, can be experienced objectively by its cohesive wholeness-making factor.\nMeanwhile, self psychology is a set of psychotherapeutic principles and techniques established by the Austrian-born American psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut upon the foundation of the psychoanalytic method developed by Freud, and is specifically focused on the subjectivity of experience, which, according to self psychology, is mediated by a psychological structure called the self. Examples of psychiatric conditions where such \"sameness\" may become broken include depersonalization, which sometimes occurs in schizophrenia, where the self appears different from the subject.\nPsychiatry.\nThe 'Disorders of the Self' have also been extensively studied by psychiatrists.\nFor example, facial and pattern recognition take large amounts of brain processing capacity but pareidolia cannot explain many constructs of self for cases of disorder, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.\nOne's sense of self can also be changed upon becoming part of a stigmatized group. According to Cox, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon (2012), if an individual has prejudice against a certain group, like the elderly and then later becomes part of this group. This prejudice can be turned inward causing depression.\nThe philosophy of a disordered self, such as in schizophrenia, is described in terms of what the psychiatrist understands are actual events in terms of neuron excitation but are delusions nonetheless, and the schizo-affective or a schizophrenic person also believes are actual events in terms of essential being. PET scans have shown that auditory stimulation is processed in certain areas of the brain, and imagined similar events are processed in adjacent areas, but hallucinations are processed in the same areas as actual stimulation. In such cases, external influences may be the source of consciousness and the person may or may not be responsible for \"sharing\" in the mind's process, or the events which occur, such as visions and auditory stimuli, may persist and be repeated often over hours, days, months or years\u2014and the afflicted person may believe themselves to be in a state of rapture or possession.\nNeuroscience.\nTwo areas of the brain that are important in retrieving self-knowledge are the medial prefrontal cortex and the medial posterior parietal cortex.\nThe posterior cingulate cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex are thought to combine to provide humans with the ability to self-reflect. The insular cortex is also thought to be involved in the process of self-reference.\nSociology.\nCulture consists of explicit and implicit patterns of historically derived and selected ideas and their embodiment in institutions, cognitive and social practices, and artifacts. Cultural systems may, on the one hand, be considered as products of action, and on the other, as conditioning elements of further action. The way individuals construct themselves may be different due to their culture.\nHazel Rose Markus and Shinobu Kitayama's theory of the interdependent self hypothesizes that representations of the self in human cultures fall on a continuum from \"independent\" to \"interdependent\". The independent self is supposed to be egoistic, unique, separated from the various contexts, critical in judgment, and prone to self-expression. The interdependent self is supposed to be altruistic, similar with the others, flexible according to contexts, conformist, and unlikely to express opinions that would disturb the harmony of his or her group of belonging. However, this theory has been criticized by other sociologists, including David Matsumoto for being based on popular stereotypes and myths about different cultures rather than on rigorous scientific research. A 2016 study of 10,203 participants from 55 cultural groups also failed to find a correlation between the postulating series of causal links between culture and self-construals, finding instead that correlations between traits varied both across cultures did not correlate with Markus &amp; Kitayama's identifications of \"independent\" or \"interdependent\" self.\nPhilosophy.\nThe philosophy of self seeks to describe essential qualities that constitute a person's uniqueness or a person's essential being. There have been various approaches to defining these qualities. The self can be considered as the source of consciousness, the agent responsible for an individual's thoughts and actions, or the substantial nature of a person which endures and unifies consciousness over time.\nThe self has a particular prominence in the thought of Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650).\nIn addition to the writings of Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995) on \"otherness\", the distinction between \"you\" and \"me\" has been further elaborated in Martin Buber's 1923 philosophical work \"Ich und Du\".\nIn philosophy, the problem of personal identity is concerned with how one is able to identify a single person over a time interval, dealing with such questions as, \"What makes it true that a person at one time is the same thing as a person at another time?\" or \"What kinds of things are we persons?\"\nA question related to the problem of personal identity is Benj Hellie's vertiginous question. The vertiginous question asks why, of all the subjects of experience out there, \"this\" one\u2014the one corresponding to the human being referred to as Benj Hellie\u2014is the one whose experiences are \"live\"? (The reader is supposed to substitute their own case for Hellie's.) Hellie's argument is closely related to Caspar Hare's theories of egocentric presentism and perspectival realism, of which several other philosophers have written reviews.\nSimilar questions are also asked repeatedly by J. J. Valberg in justifying his horizonal view of the self, and by Thomas Nagel in \"The View from Nowhere\". Tim S. Roberts refers to the question of why a particular organism out of all the organisms that happen to exist happens to be you as the \"Even Harder Problem of Consciousness\".\nOpen individualism is a view in the philosophy of self, according to which there exists only one numerically identical subject, who is everyone at all times, in the past, present and future.617 It is a theoretical solution to the question of personal identity, being contrasted with \"Empty individualism\", the view that personal identities correspond to a fixed pattern that instantaneously disappears with the passage of time, and \"Closed individualism\", the common view that personal identities are particular to subjects and yet survive over time.xxii\nOpen individualism is related to the concept of anatt\u0101 in Buddhist philosophy. In Buddhism, the term anatt\u0101 () or an\u0101tman () is the doctrine of \"non-self\" \u2013 that no unchanging, permanent self or essence can be found in any phenomenon. While often interpreted as a doctrine denying the existence of a self, \"anatman\" is more accurately described as a strategy to attain non-attachment by recognizing everything as impermanent, while staying silent on the ultimate existence of an unchanging essence. In contrast, dominant schools of Hinduism assert the existence of \u0100tman as pure awareness or witness-consciousness, \"reify[ing] consciousness as an eternal self.\"\nOne thought experiment in the philosophy of personal identity is the teletransportation paradox. It deals with whether the concept of one's future self is a coherent concept. The thought experiment was formulated by Derek Parfit in his 1984 book \"Reasons and Persons.\" Derek Parfit and others consider a hypothetical \"teletransporter\", a machine that puts you to sleep, records your molecular composition, breaking you down into atoms, and relaying its recording to Mars at the speed of light. On Mars, another machine re-creates you (from local stores of carbon, hydrogen, and so on), each atom in exactly the same relative position. Parfit poses the question of whether or not the teletransporter is actually a method of travel, or if it simply kills and makes an exact replica of the user. Then the teleporter is upgraded. The teletransporter on Earth is modified to not destroy the person who enters it, but instead it can simply make infinite replicas, all of whom would claim to remember entering the teletransporter on Earth in the first place. Using thought experiments such as these, Parfit argues that any criteria we attempt to use to determine sameness of person will be lacking, because there is no further fact. What matters, to Parfit, is simply \"Relation R\", psychological connectedness, including memory, personality, and so on.\nReligion.\nReligious views on the Self vary widely. The Self is a complex and core subject in many forms of spirituality. Two types of Self are commonly considered\u2014the Self that is the ego, also called the learned, superficial Self of mind and body, egoic creation, and the Self which is sometimes called the \"True Self\", the \"Observing Self\", or the \"Witness\". In Hinduism, the \u0100tman (Self), despite being experienced as an individual, is actually a representation of the unified transcendent reality, Brahman. Our experience of reality doesn't match the nature of Brahman due to m\u0101y\u0101.\nOne description of spirituality is the Self's search for \"ultimate meaning\" through an independent comprehension of the sacred. Another definition of spiritual identity is: \"A persistent sense of Self that addresses ultimate questions about the nature, purpose, and meaning of life, resulting in behaviors that are consonant with the individual\u2019s core values. Spiritual identity appears when the symbolic religious and spiritual value of a culture is found by individuals in the setting of their own life. There can be different types of spiritual Self because it is determined by one's life and experiences.\"\nHuman beings have a Self\u2014that is, they are able to look back on themselves as both subjects and objects in the universe. Ultimately, this brings questions about who we are and the nature of our own importance. Traditions such as in Buddhism see the attachment to Self is an illusion that serves as the main cause of suffering and unhappiness.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Bloc was formed in the early 1990s by Members of Parliament (MPs) who defected from the federal Progressive Conservative Party and Liberal Party during the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord. Founder Lucien Bouchard had been a cabinet minister in the federal Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney.\nThe Bloc seeks to create the conditions necessary for the political secession of Quebec from Canada and campaigns exclusively within the province during federal elections. The party has been described as social democratic and separatist (or \"sovereigntist\"). The Bloc supports the Kyoto Protocol, abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, legalization of assisted suicide, abolition of the Canadian Senate, abolition of the monarchy, the Quebec secularism law, and supports exempting Quebec from the requirements of the \"Multiculturalism Act.\"\nFrom the 1993 federal election until 2011, the Bloc was the largest party in Quebec and either the second- or third-largest party in the House of Commons through seven straight federal elections. The 2011 election saw the party win just four seats and lose official party status after a wave of support for the New Democratic Party. By 2014, the party had been reduced to two seats because of resignations and expulsions. In the 2015 election, the Bloc won 10 seats, even though the party's leader Gilles Duceppe failed to win a seat. In the 2019 election, the party won 32 seats, regaining official party status as a result. In the 2021 election, their seat count remained the same as the 2019 election. In the 2025 election, the party saw a decline in seat and vote share after increased support for the Liberal Party under Mark Carney. Due to the 2019, 2021, and 2025 elections resulting in a series of Liberal minority governments, the Bloc shared the balance of power with the New Democratic Party.\nThe Bloc has strong informal ties to the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ, whose members are known as '), a provincial party that advocates for the secession of Quebec from Canada and its independence; however, the two parties are not linked organizationally. As with its provincial counterpart, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has been supported by a wide range of voters in Quebec, from sections of organized labour to more conservative rural voters. Members and supporters are known in French as ' ().\nPositions and ideologies.\nAn incomplete list of Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois political positions. Among other things the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has advocated:\nDuring the 2015 Canadian federal election, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois supported banning the face covering during the citizenship ceremony and voting, aimed at Muslim women who wear the niqab.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was formed in 1990 as an informal coalition of Progressive Conservative and Liberal Members of Parliament from Quebec, who left their original parties around the time of the defeat of the Meech Lake Accord. The party was intended to be temporary and was given the goal of the promotion of sovereignty at the federal level. The party aimed to disband following a successful referendum on secession from Canada. As with most parties, it has gained and lost prominent supporters over the years.\nThe initial coalition that led to the Bloc was headed by Lucien Bouchard, who had been federal Minister of the Environment in the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. Bouchard abandoned the government in May 1990 in response to the report of a commission headed by Jean Charest that suggested changes to the Meech Lake Accord. Bouchard felt the recommendations for change undermined the objectives and spirit of the accord. According to \"The Secret Mulroney Tapes\" he was fired by Prime Minister Mulroney. Bouchard was joined by five of his fellow Tories (Nic Leblanc, Louis Plamondon, Beno\u00eet Tremblay, Gilbert Chartrand, and Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rin), along with two Liberals (Gilles Rocheleau and Jean Lapierre). The first Bloquiste candidate to be elected was Gilles Duceppe, then a union organizer, in a by-election for the Montreal riding of Laurier\u2014Sainte-Marie on 13 August 1990. He ran as an independent, since the Bloc had not been registered as a federal party.\nFirst election and Official Opposition.\nIn the 1993 federal election, the Bloc won 54 seats (out of 75) in Quebec, sweeping nearly all of the francophone ridings. Because the opposition vote in the rest of Canada was split between the Reform Party, the Progressive Conservative Party, and the New Democratic Party, the Bloc narrowly won the second largest number of seats in the House of Commons, and therefore became the official opposition. While Reform finished second in the national popular vote, the Bloc's heavy concentration of support in Quebec was slightly larger than Reform's concentration in the West.\nSoon after the 35th Parliament convened, Bouchard announced that Bloquiste MPs would only speak French on the floor of the House of Commons, a policy that remains in force to this day. This was out of necessity; although Bouchard and most of the Bloc's founding members were fluently bilingual in French and English, Bouchard had discovered that most of his large caucus could not speak English well enough to use it in debate.\nThe election of such a relatively large number of Bloquistes was the first of The Three Periods, a plan intended to lay out the way to sovereignty created by PQ leader Jacques Parizeau. Parizeau became Premier of Quebec in the Quebec election of 1994 (the second of the \"Three Periods\").\nBecause the Bloc was the official opposition, it had considerable privileges over the other parties although all of its MPs had been elected in one province. For instance, Question Periods during the 35th Parliament were dominated by issues of national unity. However, the governing Liberals regarded Reform as their main opposition on non-Quebec matters. Also, in 1995, when Bouchard garnered an invitation to meet visiting US President Bill Clinton by virtue of being Opposition Leader, Reform leader Preston Manning was also given a meeting with Clinton in order to defuse Bouchard's separatist leverage.\n1995 Quebec referendum and aftermath.\nIn 1995, the PQ government called the second referendum on independence in Quebec history. The Bloc entered the campaign for the \"Oui\" (Yes) side (in favour of sovereignty). The \"Oui\" side's campaign had a difficult beginning, so the leadership of the campaign was shifted from PQ leader Jacques Parizeau to Bloc leader Lucien Bouchard. Bouchard was seen as more charismatic and more moderate, and therefore more likely to attract voters.\nA \"tripartite agreement\" mapping out the plan for accession to independence was written and signed by the leaders of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec on 12 June 1995. It revived Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque's notion that the referendum should be followed by the negotiating of an association agreement between an independent Quebec and the rest of Canada. This provision was inspired by Bouchard. Parizeau had previously wanted a vote simply on independence. The difference became moot when 50.6% of voters taking part in the referendum rejected the sovereignty plan. An overwhelming \"Non\" vote in Montreal tipped the balance.\nThe day after the referendum, Parizeau announced his pending resignation as PQ leader and Premier of Quebec. Bouchard left federal politics and succeeded Parizeau in both posts on 26 January 1996. \nFollowing Bouchard's departure from Ottawa, Michel Gauthier became leader of the Bloc. In the wake of the referendum defeat, Gauthier proved unable to hold the fractious caucus together and resigned as leader just one year later. Gilles Duceppe, who had served as interim leader between Bouchard and Gauthier, became leader of the Bloc in 1997.\nParty under Gilles Duceppe.\nIn the 1997 federal election, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois dropped to 44 seats, losing official opposition status to the Reform Party. The 1997\u20132000 term was marked by the Bloc's fight against the passage of the Clarity Act, the attempt by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien (himself a Quebecer who represented a strongly nationalist riding) and St\u00e9phane Dion, a Quebec minister in Chr\u00e9tien's cabinet, to codify the Supreme Court of Canada's 1998 decision that Quebec could not secede unilaterally.\nIn the 2000 election, the Bloc dropped further to 38 seats, despite polling a larger percentage of the vote than at the previous election. One factor was the forced merger of several major Quebec cities, such as Montreal, Quebec City and Hull/Gatineau. The merger was very unpopular in those areas, resulting in Liberal wins in several of the merged areas. This was still more than the number of seats the Liberals had won in Quebec. However, the Liberals won several subsequent by-elections during the life of the 37th Parliament, until the Liberals had held the majority of Quebec's seats in the Commons for the first time since the 1984 federal election. From then to the subsequent election, the Bloc continued to denounce the federal government's interventions in what the Bloc saw as exclusively provincial jurisdictions. The Bloc credits its actions for the uncovering of what has since become the sponsorship scandal.\nThe Bloc continued to slide in most of the 2003 opinion polls following the 2003 Quebec election which was won by the federalist Quebec Liberal Party led by Jean Charest. However, things changed during the winter of 2003. The federalist Charest government lost popularity. Then, in February 2004, the Auditor General of Canada uncovered the sponsorship scandal, suggesting illegality in the spending of federal monies in Quebec in support of Canadian unity. As well, the Liberal government of Jean Chr\u00e9tien passed party financing legislation that resulted in the Bloc receiving millions of dollars in subsidies that helped to stabilize its organization.\nFor the 2004 election, the Bloc adopted the slogan \"Un parti propre au Qu\u00e9bec\", a play on words that can be translated either as \"A party of Quebec's own\" (\"a party proper to Quebec\") or as \"A clean party in Quebec\". The Bloc won 54 seats in the House of Commons, tying its previous record from the 1993 campaign. For the 2006 election, the Bloc used the slogan \"Heureusement, ici, c'est le Bloc!\" (\"Fortunately, the Bloc is here!\"). The Bloc were expected to easily win more than 60 seats at the start of the campaign, and they did in fact take six seats from the Liberals. However, the unexpected surge of the new Conservative Party of Canada in parts of Quebec, particularly in and around Quebec City, led to the Bloc losing eight seats to the Tories. Coupled with an additional loss to Andr\u00e9 Arthur, an independent candidate, the Bloc recorded a net loss of three seats.\nThe Conservative Party won a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, thus forming a minority government. There was persistent speculation as to the possibility of the Bloc forming alliances with other opposition parties to wrest the government away from the Conservatives. Duceppe, whose leadership was confirmed after the election, maintained that the Bloc would continue to co-operate with other opposition parties or with the government when this advantaged Quebec, but would not participate in a federal government.\nGilles Duceppe announced on 11 May 2007 that he would run for the leadership of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois to replace Andr\u00e9 Boisclair, who resigned on 8 May 2007, after the poor performance in the March 2007 Quebec provincial election and internal dissent forced him to step down. Duceppe announced the next day that he was withdrawing from the race, and that he would support Pauline Marois who had also announced her intention to run.\nThe Bloc made slight gains following the 2008 federal elections as they won 49 seats, one more than the number they had before the previous parliament was dissolved. In that election, they used the slogan \"\" (\"Present for Quebec\"). Although they made small gains in relation to the number of seats at dissolution, they fell by 2 seats to 49 in comparison to the 51 they received in 2006. Also, the proportion of popular votes in the province was down 4 points to 38.1%, the Bloc's lowest score since 1997.\nIn a speech in front of his supporters following the election, BQ leader Gilles Duceppe claimed to have achieved his objectives, adding: \"without the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois tonight, Mr. Harper would have formed a majority government\".\nAt the end of November 2008, the Bloc indicated that it would support a possible motion of no confidence against the governing Conservatives by the two other opposition parties, and would support the resulting Liberal-NDP coalition government at least until June 2010, without actually being part of the government.\nCoalition attempt.\nOn 26 March 2011, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Duceppe stated that Conservative leader Stephen Harper had in 2004 tried to form a coalition government with the Bloc and NDP in response to Harper's allegations that the Liberals intended to form a coalition with the Bloc and the NDP. Two months after the 2004 federal election, Stephen Harper privately met with BQ leader Gilles Duceppe and New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton in a Montreal hotel. On 9 September 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to then-Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, stating,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn the same day the letter was written, the three party leaders held a joint press conference at which they expressed their intent to co-operate on changing parliamentary rules, and to request that the governor general consult with them before deciding to call an election. At the news conference, Harper said: \"It is the Parliament that's supposed to run the country, not just the largest party and the single leader of that party. That's a criticism I've had and that we've had and that most Canadians have had for a long, long time now so this is an opportunity to start to change that.\" However, at the time, Harper and the two other opposition leaders denied trying to form a coalition government, despite the letter written to the governor general. Harper said, \"This is not a coalition, but this is a co-operative effort.\"\nOne month later, on 4 October 2004, journalist Mike Duffy, (later appointed as a Conservative senator by Harper in December 2008), said \"It is possible that you could change prime minister without having an election\", and that some Conservatives wanted Harper as prime minister. The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace Paul Martin with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton's accusations.\nLoss of official party status.\nIn the 2011 federal election, in the wake of a surge of support for the New Democratic Party, the Bloc received less than a quarter of the popular vote in Quebec (and less than 6% of the national vote). It lost 44 of the 47 seats it held at parliament's dissolution, and only added one seat, which had been vacated by a Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois member six months prior to the election. The seats lost included that of Duceppe, who resigned as party president and leader. It also lost all but one of its seats in Montreal.\nBy winning only four seats, the Bloc failed to reach the minimum of 12 seats required for official party status in the House of Commons. MPs without official party status are treated as independents and must sit in the back row of the opposition benches. They are permitted just a few questions each week in question period and cannot sit as voting members on parliamentary committees.\nElected to Parliament in this election were incumbents Louis Plamondon, Andr\u00e9 Bellavance, Maria Mourani and rookie MP Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fortin. When the 41st Parliament convened on 2 June 2011, Plamondon became the Bloc's interim parliamentary leader. Vivian Barbot served as interim leader and party president following Duceppe's resignation until the party's 2011 leadership election.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leadership election campaign to choose a permanent successor to Duceppe began on 17 September 2011 and concluded on 11 December with the election of former MP for Hochelaga Daniel Paill\u00e9 as party leader. Plamondon, the longest-serving member of the Commons, served as parliamentary leader during Paill\u00e9's tenure as he did not have a seat.\nOn 28 February 2013, Claude Patry defected from the New Democratic Party and joined the Bloc, citing his disagreement with the New Democratic Party on the subject of Quebec sovereignty, bringing the party's total seats in Parliament up to five.\nThe caucus fell back to four MPs on 12 September 2013 when Mourani, the party's only remaining member from Montreal, was expelled for her comments criticizing the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government's proposed Charter of Quebec Values.\nPaill\u00e9 stepped down as leader on 16 December 2013 because of health reasons. A leadership election was held the following June.\nHardliner Mario Beaulieu, a former president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Jean-Baptiste who had never been a Member of Parliament nor a member of Quebec's National Assembly, was elected party leader after running on a platform of prioritizing Quebec independence above all else. He defeated BQ Member of Parliament Andr\u00e9 Bellavance, who had campaigned on a platform of broadening the Bloc beyond being a coalition of sovereigntists and had been endorsed by the rest of the party's caucus.\nOn 12 August 2014, the caucus was reduced to three MPs when the Bloc's interim parliamentary leader, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fortin, quit the party to sit as an independent saying that the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois he had joined no longer existed and that Beaulieu had destroyed its credibility. On 25 August 2014, former interim parliamentary leader and failed leadership contender Andr\u00e9 Bellavance also resigned, reducing the Bloc to two MPs \u2013 one of whom, Claude Patry, had announced that he would not run for re-election. On 31 December 2014, the party's vice president, Annie Lessard, resigned after a personality conflict with leader Mario Beaulieu.\nReturn and departure of Duceppe.\nWith two seats left in parliament, and with the party languishing in the polls a few months before an expected election campaign, it was announced 10 June 2015 that Gilles Duceppe would be returning to lead the party into the campaign; Beaulieu would relinquish the leadership but remain party president. The party executive agreed on 9 June 2015, to split the positions of president and party leader in order to facilitate Duceppe's return. The changes were approved by the party's general council on 1 July.\nDuring the 2015 federal election, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois had hoped to pick up seats from the collapsing NDP vote; however, most Quebecers instead switched their allegiance to the Liberals and Conservatives rather than back to the Bloc. While the Bloc managed to win 10 seats, more than twice that of the previous election, it was not enough to gain official party status. The party's share of the popular vote in Quebec fell to 19%, its lowest point up until that time. As in 2011, Duceppe failed to win his own seat, and resigned again as party leader.\nParty under Martine Ouellet (2017\u20132018).\nThe party was led on an interim basis by Rh\u00e9al Fortin until the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leadership election in March 2017 acclaimed Martine Ouellet, a member of the provincial National Assembly of Quebec, as party leader. Ouellet is not a Member of Parliament and intended to see out her term in the provincial legislature until the next provincial election in October 2018.\nOn 28 February 2018, seven of the Bloc's ten MPs quit the party's caucus to form the Groupe parlementaire qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (later called \"Qu\u00e9bec debout\") citing conflicts with Ouellet's leadership style and her insistence that the Bloc should emphasize promoting Quebec independence over \"defending Quebec's interests\". Three MPs remained in the Bloc's caucus: Mario Beaulieu (La Pointe-de-l'\u00cele), Xavier Barsalou-Duval (Pierre-Boucher\u2014Les Patriotes\u2014Verch\u00e8res), and Maril\u00e8ne Gill (Manicouagan).\nMore than 20 ex-Bloc MPs, including Gilles Duceppe, issued an open letter supporting the seven current MPs who had resigned from caucus and demanding Ouellet's resignation. Nevertheless, after a lengthy meeting, the party's executive issued a statement supporting Ouellet's leadership but also stating that the seven rebels could keep their Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois memberships and would not be expelled from the party for quitting the caucus, inviting them to return to the caucus in the future. A L\u00e9ger Marketing poll conducted shortly after put the Bloc Quebecois at 12% among Quebec voters, its lowest rating ever. Following an election this would likely translate into zero seats, putting the survival of the party into question for the 2019 federal election.\nA leadership review referendum was held on Ouellet's leadership on 1 and 2 June 2018 resulting in the party membership rejecting her leadership by 67%, while a proposal that the party prioritize Quebec independence on a daily basis above all other issues also passed with 65% support. Ouellet subsequently announced her resignation as party leader effective 11 June 2018.\nFollowing the announcement of Ouellet's resignation, MPs Michel Boudrias and Simon Marcil announced they would rejoin the party, while party president and MP Mario Beaulieu was named Ouelett's successor on an interim basis until her successor could be chosen. On 22 August 2018, as part of an agreement to reunite the party, Beaulieu ceded the party presidency to Yves Perron; on 17 September 2018, the remaining MPs who had defected from the Bloc rejoined the party and dissolved their breakaway group, \"Qu\u00e9bec debout\".\nParty under Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet (2019\u2013present).\nAs the only candidate to have entered the race by the 15 January 2019 deadline, former Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois cabinet minister Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet was named leader on 17 January 2019. After Blanchet became leader the BQ saw its support increasing in Quebec during the 2019 federal election, which some considered to have exceeded expectations. The BQ increased its number of seats from 10 in 2015, to 32 seats in 2019, both overtaking the NDP to become the third largest party in Canada and regaining official party status.\nIn the 2021 Canadian federal election, the BQ led by Blanchet won 32 seats, unchanged from the prior election.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois held a leadership confidence vote in May 2023. Blanchet won 97% of the vote.\nIn September 2024, the BQ won a competitive by-election in LaSalle\u2014\u00c9mard\u2014Verdun in Montreal. In the 2025 Canadian federal election, the BQ led by Blanchet won 22 seats, a significant decrease from the prior election.\nRelationship with the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\nThe Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has close ties to the Bloc and shares its principal objective of independence for Quebec. The two parties have backed each other during election campaigns, and prominent members of each party often attend and speak at the other's public events. In addition, the majority of each party's membership holds membership in both parties. However, on an organizational level the parties are separate entities \u2013 the Bloc is not the federal wing of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, nor the PQ the provincial wing of the Bloc.\nLucien Bouchard has been the leader of both parties. Michel Gauthier, once Bloc's leader, was a PQ member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1981 until 1988. Former party leader Daniel Paill\u00e9 was also a PQ member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1994 to 1996, and a BQ member of Parliament from 2009 to 2011.\nIn June 2014, Mario Beaulieu, a former PQ riding president and Bloc candidate, was elected leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Notwithstanding his previous ties to both parties, Beaulieu has been critical of what he sees as a too timid approach to sovereignty by both the Bloc and PQ. Beaulieu's election as Bloc leader was more warmly received by the PQ's rival party, Option nationale, than by the PQ.\nMartine Ouellet was a PQ MNA from 2010 until 2017 and ran twice for the PQ leadership. She continued to sit in the Quebec National Assembly, as an Independent MNA, after she was elected Bloc leader.\nIn the 2015 election, Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau officially endorsed the Bloc, despite earlier calling the party useless.\nSeveral incumbent PQ MNAs including Bernard Drainville, St\u00e9phane Bergeron, Maka Kotto, Dave Turcotte and Agn\u00e8s Maltais also endorsed the Bloc and campaigned for local candidates.\nParty leaders.\nParty presidents (2014\u2013present).\nUntil 2015, the party leader was also party president. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60340", "revid": "38047164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60340", "title": "Bay Area Rapid Transit", "text": "Rapid transit system serving the San Francisco Bay Area\nBay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a rapid transit system serving the San Francisco Bay Area in California. BART serves 50 stations along six routes and of track, including eBART, a spur line running to Antioch, and Oakland Airport Connector, a automated guideway transit line serving Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport. With an average of weekday passenger trips as of the third quarter of 2025 and annual passenger trips in 2024, BART is the seventh-busiest rapid transit system in the United States.\nBART is operated by the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District which formed in 1957. The initial system opened in stages from 1972 to 1974. The system has been extended several times, most recently in 2020, when Milpitas and Berryessa/North San Jos\u00e9 stations opened as part of the under construction Silicon Valley BART extension in partnership with the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA).\nServices.\nBART serves large portions of its three member counties \u2013 San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa \u2013 as well as smaller portions of San Mateo County and Santa Clara counties. The system has 50 stations: 22 in Alameda County, 12 in Contra Costa County, 8 in San Francisco, 6 in San Mateo County, and 2 in Santa Clara County. BART operates five named heavy rail services plus one separate automated guideway line. All of the heavy rail services run through Oakland, and all but the Orange Line cross the bay through the Transbay Tube to San Francisco. All five services run every day until 9 pm; only three services operate evenings after 9 pm. All stations are served during all service hours. The eastern segment of the (between Antioch and the transfer platform east of Pittsburg/Bay Point) uses different rolling stock and is separated from the rest of the line.\nHours and frequencies.\nBART's network topology, which mixes densely-packed urban stations served at high frequencies by multiple interlined services along a central trunk (West Oakland to Daly City, served by all lines but the Orange) with branching suburban lines with widely-spaced stations and lower frequencies, is similar to European S-Bahn systems. Trains on each primary service run every 20 minutes, except the busy Yellow Line, which operates every 10 minutes on weekdays. However, many stations are served by multiple lines; the trunk between West Oakland and Daly City receives 15 trains per hour (average four-minute headways) in peak hours. The Oakland Airport Connector runs \"on demand\", typically on headways of 10 minutes or less.\nTimed cross-platform transfers are available between the Orange Line, which runs north-south through the East Bay, and the Yellow Line, which operates through the Transbay Tube to serve the San Francisco Peninsula. This service complements the Red Line during daytime hours and replaces that line when it stops operating after 9:00 p.m.\nThe first inbound trains leave outer terminals around 5:00 am on weekdays, 6:00 am on Saturdays, and 8:00 am on Sundays and most holidays. The last trains of the service day leave their terminals around midnight; the final Yellow and Orange Line trains in both directions meet at MacArthur station, and the final Orange and Blue Line trains in the southbound direction meet at Bay Fair station, for guaranteed transfers.\nBus services.\nTwo different bus networks are operated by regional transit agencies as a rail replacement bus service when BART is not operating due to regularly scheduled maintenance during the overnight hours.\nThe \"All Nighter\" network provides basic bus service to San Francisco, the East Bay, and Peninsula, replicating rail transit services in those regions, including BART, Caltrain, and Muni Metro. All Nighter buses serve most BART stations (directly or within several blocks), replicating 3-Line late night BART service with abbreviated routes:\nThe All Nighter-branded bus service started in 2006, although late night bus service had been provided as an alternative to BART prior to then.\nThe \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Early Bird Express\" network is another bus alternative which provides service to major BART stations in the early morning between 3:50 am and 5:30 am. Early Bird Express buses are operated by local transit agencies, including AC Transit, Golden Gate Transit, Muni, and SamTrans, running between a limited number of major BART stations on San Francisco/Peninsula and Transbay routes which all meet at the Salesforce Transit Center. Early Bird Express routes are identified by three-digit route numbers starting with 7xx. As of \u00a02024[ [update]], there are six Early Bird Express routes, replicating 3-Line service:\nThe original Early Bird Express network was introduced in February 2019 when the start of rail service was shifted from 4\u00a0a.m. to 5\u00a0a.m. to accommodate seismic upgrades in the Transbay Tube; at its debut, it featured fifteen routes, but some were eliminated later that year due to low ridership. Additional routes were eliminated in 2024, including an inbound bus from Fremont replicating Orange Line service.\nHistorically, BART operated \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;BART Express\" bus service between 1974 and 1997, extending transit coverage to central and eastern Alameda and Contra Costa counties; these routes were discontinued following the completion of rail line extensions starting in the late 1990s. BART Express was operated for BART under contracts to AC Transit (1974\u20131989) and Laidlaw (1989\u20131997). Since then, some services similar to the legacy BART Express routes which were not replaced by rail service have been taken over by local bus operators, including WestCAT and Tri Delta Transit.\nTo accommodate those with conditions and disabilities that prevent from boarding a train, BART has entered a joint venture with AC Transit to establish East Bay Paratransit to provide paratransit bus services.\nConnecting services.\nIntermodal connections to local, regional, and intercity transit \u2013 including bus, light rail, commuter rail, and intercity rail \u2013 are available across the BART system. Three Amtrak intercity rail services \u2013 the \"California Zephyr\", \"Capitol Corridor\", and \"Gold Runner\" \u2013 stop at Richmond station; the \"Capitol Corridor\" also stops at Oakland Coliseum station. Transfer between BART and the Caltrain commuter rail service is available at Millbrae station.\nBART and most lines of San Francisco's Muni Metro light rail system share four stations (Embarcadero, Montgomery Street, Powell Street, and Civic Center/UN Plaza) in the Market Street subway; connections are also available to three lines at Balboa Park station and one line at Glen Park station. A tunnel at the Powell Street station connects to the Union Square/Market Street station on the Muni Metro T Third Street line. In the South Bay, Milpitas station provides a connection to the Orange Line of VTA light rail.\nBART is served by bus connections from regional and local transit agencies at all stations, most of which have dedicated off-street bus transfer areas. Many connecting routes (particularly in suburban areas) serve primarily as feeder routes to BART. Larger bus systems connecting to BART include Muni in San Francisco, AC Transit in the East Bay, SamTrans in San Mateo County, County Connection and Tri Delta Transit in eastern Contra Costa County, WestCAT in western Contra Costa County, WHEELS in the Tri-Valley, VTA in the Santa Clara Valley, and Golden Gate Transit. Smaller systems include Emery Go-Round in Emeryville, Commute.org on the Peninsula, San Leandro LINKS, Dumbarton Express, and Union City Transit. The Salesforce Transit Center regional bus hub is located one block from Embarcadero and Montgomery stations.\nSeveral transit agencies offer limited commuter-oriented bus service from more distant cities to outlying BART stations; these include VINE from Napa County, Solano Express from Solano County, Rio Vista Delta Breeze, Stanislaus Regional Transit Authority from Stanislaus County, and San Joaquin RTD from Stockton. Many BART stations are also served by privately run employer and hospital shuttles, and privately run intercity buses stop at several stations.\nAirport connections.\nBART also runs directly to two of the three major Bay Area airports (San Francisco International Airport and Oakland International Airport) with service to San Jose International Airport provided by a VTA bus route available at Milpitas station.\nHistory.\nOrigins, planning, and geographical coverage.\nSome of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system's current coverage area was once served by an electrified streetcar and suburban train system called the Key System. This early 20th-century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower deck of the Bay Bridge, but the system was dismantled in the 1950s, with its last transbay crossing in 1958, and was superseded by highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking the cities and suburbs. Marvin E. Lewis, a San Francisco trial attorney and member of the city's board of supervisors spearheaded a grassroots movement to advance the idea of an alternative bay crossing and the possibility of regional transit network.\nFormal planning for BART began with the setting up in 1957 of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a county-based special-purpose district body that governs the BART system. The district initially began with five members, all of which were projected to receive BART lines: Alameda County, Contra Costa County, the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, and Marin County. Although invited to participate, Santa Clara County supervisors elected not to join BART due to their dissatisfaction that the peninsula line only stopped at Palo Alto initially, and that it interfered with suburban development in San Jose, preferring instead to concentrate on constructing freeways and expressways. Though the system expanded into Santa Clara County in 2020, as of June 2024 it is still not a district member.\nIn 1962, San Mateo County supervisors voted to leave BART, saying their voters would be paying taxes to carry mainly Santa Clara County residents (presumably along I-280, SR 92, and SR 85). The district-wide tax base was weakened by San Mateo's departure, forcing Marin County to withdraw a month later. Despite the fact that Marin had originally voted in favor of BART participation at the 88% level, its marginal tax base could not adequately absorb its share of BART's projected cost. Another important factor in Marin's withdrawal was an engineering controversy over the feasibility of running trains on the lower deck of the Golden Gate Bridge, an extension forecast as late as three decades after the rest of the BART system. The withdrawals of Marin and San Mateo resulted in a downsizing of the original system plans, which would have had lines as far south as Palo Alto and northward past San Rafael. Voters in the three remaining participating counties approved the truncated system, with termini in Fremont, Richmond, Concord, and Daly City, in 1962.\nConstruction of the system began in 1964, and included a number of major engineering challenges, including excavating subway tunnels in San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley; constructing aerial structures throughout the Bay Area, particularly in Alameda and Contra Costa counties; tunneling through the Berkeley Hills on the Concord line; and lowering the system's centerpiece, the Transbay Tube connecting Oakland and San Francisco, into a trench dredged onto the floor of San Francisco Bay. Like other transit systems of the same era, BART endeavored to connect outlying suburbs with job centers in Oakland and San Francisco by building lines that paralleled established commuting routes of the region's freeway system. BART envisioned frequent local service, with headways as short as two minutes between trains through the Transbay Tube and six minutes on each individual line.\nEarly years and train control problems.\nPassenger service began on September 11, 1972, initially just between MacArthur and Fremont. The rest of the system opened in stages, with the entire system opening in 1974 when the transbay service through the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as a major step forward in subway technology, although questions were asked concerning the safety of the system and the huge expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased in until several years after the system opened.\nSome of the early safety concerns appeared to be well founded when the system experienced a number of train-control failures in its first few years of operation. As early as 1969, before revenue service began, several BART engineers identified safety problems with the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system. The BART Board of Directors was dismissive of their concerns and retaliated by firing them. Less than a month after the system's opening, on October 2, 1972, an ATC failure caused a train to run off the end of the elevated track at the terminal Fremont station and crash to the ground, injuring four people. The \"Fremont Flyer\" led to a comprehensive redesign of the train controls and also resulted in multiple investigations being opened by the California State Senate, California Public Utilities Commission, and National Transportation Safety Board. Hearings by the state legislature in 1974 into financial mismanagement at BART forced the General Manager to resign in May 1974, and the entire Board of Directors was replaced the same year when the legislature passed legislation leading to the election of a new Board and the end of appointed members.\nExtensions.\nEven before the BART system opened, planners projected several possible extensions. Although Marin County was left out of the original system, the 1970 Golden Gate Transportation Facilities Plan considered a tunnel under the Golden Gate or second deck on the bridge, but neither of these plans was pursued. Over twenty years would pass before the first extensions to the BART system were completed to North Concord/Martinez in 1995, Colma and Pittsburg/Bay Point in 1996. An extension to Dublin/Pleasanton in 1997 added a fifth line to the system for the first time in BART's history. The system was expanded to San Francisco International Airport in 2003 and to Oakland International Airport via an automated guideway transit spur line in 2014. eBART, an extension using diesel multiple units along conventional railroad infrastructure between Pittsburg/Bay Point and Antioch on the Yellow Line, opened on May 26, 2018. BART's most significant current extension project is the Silicon Valley BART extension on the Green and Orange Lines. The first phase extended the Fremont line to Warm Springs/South Fremont in early 2017, and the second phase to Berryessa/North San Jos\u00e9 began service on June 13, 2020. The third phase to Santa Clara is contingent upon the allocation of funding as of May 2020[ [update]], but is planned to be completed by 2036.\nPlans had long been floated for an extension from Dublin to Livermore, but the most recent proposal was rejected by the BART board in 2018. Other plans have included an extension to Hercules, a line along the Interstate Highway 680 corridor, and a fourth set of rail tracks through Oakland. At least four infill stations such as Irvington and Calaveras on existing lines have been proposed. With the Transbay Tube nearing capacity, long-range plans included a new four-bore Transbay Tube beneath San Francisco Bay that would run parallel and south of the existing tunnel and emerge at the Transbay Transit Terminal to connect to Caltrain and the future California High-Speed Rail system. The four-bore tunnel would provide two tunnels for BART and two tunnels for conventional/high-speed rail. The BART system and conventional U.S. rail use different and incompatible rail gauges and different loading gauges. In 2018, BART announced that a feasibility study for installing a second transbay crossing would commence the following year. By 2019, the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority (CCJPA) had joined with BART to study a multi-modal crossing, which could also allow \"Capitol Corridor\" and \"San Joaquins\" routes to serve San Francisco directly.\nSystem modernization.\nIn 2007, BART stated its intention to improve non-peak (night and weekend) headways for each line to 15 minutes. The 20-minute headways at these times is a barrier to ridership. In mid-2007, BART temporarily reversed its position, stating that the shortened wait times would likely not happen due to a $900,000 state revenue budget shortfall. Nevertheless, BART eventually confirmed the implementation of the plan by January 2008. Continued budgetary problems halted the expanded non-peak service and returned off-peak headways to 20 minutes in 2009.\nIn 2008, BART announced that it would install solar panels at two yards, maintenance facilities, and Orinda station (the only station that receives sufficient sunlight to justify installation cost).\nIn 2012, the California Transportation Commission announced that they would provide funding for expanding BART facilities, through the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, in anticipation of the opening of the Silicon Valley Berryessa Extension. $50\u00a0million would go in part to improvements to the Hayward Maintenance Complex.\nIn March 2019, BART announced that they would begin updating ticket add-fare machines inside the paid area to accept debit and credit cards for payment (for Clipper cards only). In December 2020, BART completed the changeover to Clipper and stopped issuing magstripe paper tickets. Existing paper tickets remained valid. In April 2021, BART began accepting Clipper cards on Apple Pay, Google Pay, and the Clipper app at all BART stations. By December 2023, the fare system was entirely Clipper-only. Beginning August 20, 2025, riders no longer need a Clipper card, and can pay using physical contactless credit or debit cards, or mobile payment methods, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay.\nDuring the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the BART equipment was mostly undamaged. A 2010 study concluded that along with some Bay Area freeways, some of BART's overhead structures could collapse in a major earthquake, which has a significant probability of occurring within three decades. Seismic retrofitting has been carried out since 2004 upon voter approval to address these deficiencies, especially in the Transbay Tube. BART projects that Transbay Tube retrofits are expected to be completed in 2023.\nRolling stock.\nCar types.\nThe mainline BART network operates with electric powered, self-propelled railcars. For most lines, six cars are coupled together in a train, except the Yellow Line, which uses nine-car trains. BART trains have gangway connections, and passengers can move freely between cars. The cars have three doors on each side, bike racks, 54 seats per car, and interior and exterior displays giving information. The new cars, branded by BART as its \"Fleet of the Future\", were unveiled in April 2016. The first cars were expected to be in service in December 2016, however, glitches and a failed CPUC inspection delayed introduction to January 19, 2018. A total of 775 cars were ordered from Bombardier (which merged with Alstom during production): 310 cab cars (D-cars) and 465 non-cab cars (E-cars). As of \u00a023, 2024[ [update]], BART has received all 775 D and E cars, of which 769 have been certified for service. To run its peak service, BART requires 400 cars. Of those, 384 are scheduled to be in active service; the others are used to build up spare trains (used to maintain on-time service).\nThe previous BART fleet, consisting of A, B, and C cars, was built between 1968 and 1996. It was retired from regular service on September 11, 2023, with the final revenue runs on April 20, 2024.\nThe Oakland Airport Connector uses a completely separate and independently operated fleet of cable car-based automated guideway transit vehicles. It uses four Cable Liner trains built by DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car, arranged as three-car sets, but the system can accommodate four-car trains in the future.\nThe eBART extension uses eight Stadler GTW diesel railcars. The Stadler GTW vehicles are diesel multiple units, which operate over standard gauge tracks (as opposed to BART's broad gauge).\nDepots.\nThe initial BART system included car storage and maintenance yards in Concord, Hayward, and Richmond, with an additional maintenance only (no car storage) yard in Oakland. The Daly City car storage and maintenance yard opened in December 1988. The Oakland Airport Connector uses the Doolittle Maintenance and Storage Facility. eBART vehicles use a facility in Antioch.\nFares.\nFare schedule.\nBART has distance-based fares, which requires riders to use fare gates to both enter and exit, with a flat fare of $2.15 for trips under . A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube ($1.40), to/from Oakland International Airport ($6.70) or San Francisco International Airport ($4.95), and to/from San Mateo County ($1.45, except $1.25 for Daly City). The maximum fare, including both airport surcharges and the Transbay surcharge, is $17.60; the maximum without surcharges (\u2013) is $10.30. As of \u00a02022[ [update]], the average fare paid is $3.93.\nBecause of the varied fares, it is possible to enter the system with enough stored value for a shorter trip, but not a longer trip. Passengers without sufficient fare to complete their journey must use an add-fare machine to add value in order to exit the station.\nBefore August 20, 2025, entering and exiting at the same station within 30 minutes incurred an \"excursion fare\" of $6.40 \u2013 significantly higher than many station-to-station fares. This was originally introduced to allow people to tour the then-futuristic system; it was kept to discourage undesired behaviors such as tech bus riders using BART parking lots. The excursion fare has been criticized for negatively impacting riders who leave stations during service disruptions (although station agents can allow riders to exit without fare payment). As of August 20, 2025, riders paying using the contactless Tap and Ride system have a 30-minute grace period to avoid the BART excursion fare; Clipper card users still need to see an agent to avoid it.\nAs of December 2022, BART is working to implement a 30-minute \"grace period\" before the fare is charged.\nUnlike many other rapid transit systems, BART does not have weekly or monthly passes with unlimited rides. The only discount provided to the general public is a 6.25% reduction when \"high value tickets\" (only available on Clipper cards with autoload) are purchased with fare values of $48 and $64. 50% discount is available to youth aged 5\u201318 (children age 4 and under ride free), and a 62.5% discount is provided to seniors and the disabled. The Clipper START program for low-income adults provides a 50% discount. The San Francisco Muni and BART offer a combined monthly \"A\" Fast Pass, which allows unlimited rides on Muni services plus BART service within San Francisco.\nIn August 2022, BART launched Clipper BayPass, a two-year pilot program to examine the viability of a transit pass that is compatible with all the public transit agencies in the Bay Area. The program was initially made available to around 50,000 college students and affordable housing residents.\nFare media.\nThe primary fare media for BART is the Clipper card, which is used by most Bay Area transit agencies. Clipper is a contactless smart card; passengers tap in and out at card readers on fare gates. Clipper cards in Apple Pay and Google Wallet electronic wallets can also be used. As of August 20, 2025, riders can also pay using physical contactless credit or debit cards, or mobile payment methods, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay.\nBART's original fare system used tickets made of a paper-plastic composite with a magnetic stripe. The tickets were sold by fare vending machines. When exiting, fare gates read the magnetically stored value on the card, encoded the new value with the fare subtracted, and printed the new value on the card. Tickets with no remaining value were retained by the machine rather than being returned. The entire fare system was designed and built by IBM under a $7 million contract (equivalent to $ million in 2024). It was the third system in the US to use encoded-value magnetic stripe tickets, following the Illinois Central Gulf commuter line (now the Metra Electric District) in 1964 and the PATCO Speedline in 1968.\nAlthough tickets could be refilled at fare machines, riders often discarded tickets with small values remaining. BART formerly relied on unused ticket values on such discarded cards for additional revenue \u2013 as much as $9.9\u00a0million annually in 1999 (equivalent to $ million in 2024). Tickets stopped being sold in December 2020 in favor of Clipper cards, and can no longer be used. A 50-cent surcharge per trip (25 cents for discounted fares) is applied to all journeys made on paper tickets. However, due to supply chain shortages resulting in a lack of plastic Clipper cards, BART started issuing tickets again at the SFO station in October 2022. Sales of paper tickets again ended on September 30, 2023, and they were no longer usable after November 30.\nBART first piloted a smart card for fare payment called EZ Rider in 2006; this program was abandoned in 2010 in favor of a regional farecard. In 2009, BART became one of the first five transit agencies to accept TransLink (later renamed Clipper) cards for fare payment and began phasing out tickets. By December 2020, all BART ticket machines, except for add-fare machines inside of paid areas, were converted to Clipper use only. Tickets were no longer accepted starting in December 2023.\nRidership levels.\nFor most of its history, BART's ridership has reflected the U.S. economy, growing modestly during periods of economic expansion and dropping slightly during recessions. A major exception occurred in 1989 in the aftermath of the Loma Prieta earthquake, which severely damaged the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge, causing its closure for a month. BART became the only direct route between the East Bay and San Francisco, resulting in a nearly 17% ridership jump for the 1990 fiscal year. Ridership would not drop back to previous levels after the repair of the bridge until the COVID-19 pandemic began to affect the Bay Area in March 2020.\nBetween 2010 and 2015, BART ridership grew rapidly, mirroring strong economic growth in the Bay Area. In 2015, the system was carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier. High gasoline prices also contributed to growth, pushing ridership to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record ridership days in September and October 2012.\nAfter six straight years of expansion, ridership growth began to slow in late 2016, dropping by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. Although the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, showed an average weekday ridership of 423,395, the second-highest in BART's history, this was a 2.3% drop from FY 2016. Ridership continued to decline by approximately 3% per year between 2016 and 2019, mirroring a nationwide decline in mass transit ridership in the second half of the decade. \"The Washington Post\" and LA Streetsblog attributed the national decline in ridership to changes in commute patterns, the fall in gasoline prices since 2014, and competition from the private sector in the form of ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. Ride-hailing has especially affected ridership on the lines to the San Francisco International Airport and the Oakland International Airport. At SFO, ride-hailing services grew by a factor of almost six or nearly 500% at the airport between 2014 and 2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and BART's share of airport transit.\nStations in the urban cores of San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley have the highest ridership, while suburban stations record lower rider numbers. During fiscal year 2017, the busiest station was Embarcadero with 48,526 average weekday exits, followed by Montgomery Street with 45,386. The busiest station outside of San Francisco was 12th Street Oakland City Center with 13,965 riders, followed by 19th Street Oakland with 13,456. The least busy station was Oakland International Airport with 1,517 riders, while the least busy standard BART station was North Concord / Martinez with 2,702 weekday exits.\nBART's one-day ridership record was set on Halloween of 2012 with 568,061 passengers attending the San Francisco Giants' victory parade for their World Series championship. This surpassed the record set two years earlier of 522,198 riders in 2010 for the Giants' 2010 World Series victory parade. Before that, the record was 442,100 riders in October 2009, following an emergency closure of the Bay Bridge. During a planned closure of the Bay Bridge, there were 475,015 daily riders on August 30, 2013, making that the third highest ridership. On June 19, 2015, BART recorded 548,078 riders for the Golden State Warriors championship parade, placing second on the all-time ridership list.\nBART set a Saturday record of 419,162 riders on February 6, 2016, coinciding with Super Bowl 50 events and a Golden State Warriors game. That easily surpassed the previous Saturday record of 319,484 riders, which occurred in October 2012, coinciding with several sporting events and Fleet Week. BART set a Sunday ridership record of 292,957 riders in June 2013, in connection with the San Francisco Gay Pride Parade, surpassing Sunday records set the previous two years when the Pride Parade was held.\nRidership dropped sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns beginning in March 2020, during which BART was forced to drastically cut service. Ridership in the weeks immediately following the start of the Bay Area's lockdown (on March 17, 2020) fell by as much as 93%. If ridership does not recover and additional revenue is not obtained, in the worst case the agency projected it would only be able to sustain trains on three lines running once an hour from 5am to 9pm weekdays, and would have to close nine stations. As of May\u00a02024[ [update]], weekday ridership is at 41% of pre-pandemic levels, Saturday ridership is at 63%, and Sunday ridership is at 75%.\nIn a 2022 survey, 31% of riders report household income below $50,000 (up from 26% in 2018), and 44% did not own a vehicle (up from 31% in 2018). Compared to the region, BART riders are more likely to be Black or Latino, and less likely to be White or Asian.\nInfrastructure.\nThe entirety of the system runs in exclusive, grade-separated right-of-way. BART's rapid transit revenue routes cover about with 50 stations. On the main lines, approximately of lines run through underground sections with on elevated tracks. 1,000 volts DC is delivered to the trains over a third rail. An automated guideway transit line and an additional station were opened in 2014, using off-the-shelf cable car technology developed by DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car: the Cable Liner. The section of the Antioch-SFO/Millbrae line east of the Pittsburg/Bay Point station, known as eBART, runs on conventional unelectrified rail.\nBART trains are so unpleasantly noisy that a recording while inside the Transbay Tube, described as \"the worst sound in the history of man\", was used in the 2008 horror video game \"Dead Space\". The main system uses an unusual broad gauge (mostly seen in India and Pakistan) and mostly ballastless track. Originally using flat-edge rail and wheelsets with cylindrical treads, in 2016 BART started switching to conical treads to reduce the noise caused by flange/rail contact and loss of adhesion of one of the wheels on curves.\nSchedules call for trains to operate at up to , but certain segments (in particular, the Transbay Tube) are designed for operation when making up delays.\nAs of \u00a02023[ [update]], rapid transit trains are typically six cars long, except on the Yellow Line, which uses eight-car trains. The minimum train length is four cars, and the maximum length is ten cars. A ten-car train is , the longest of any metro system in the United States, and extending slightly beyond the platforms. Cars are wide, the maximum gradient is four percent, and the minimum curve radius is . The combination of unique loading gauges and unusual rail technologies has complicated maintenance and increased cost of the system, as rolling stock requires custom wheelsets, brake systems, and power systems.\nMany of the original 1970s-era stations, especially the aerial stations, feature simple Brutalist architecture, but newer stations are a mix of Neomodern and Postmodern architecture. The additional double-tracked upper deck of the Market Street subway and its four underground stations were built by BART for Muni Metro.\nLines.\nThe routes run on track segments (\"lines\"), which are internally, but not commonly, known by letters.\nAutomation.\nBART was one of the first U.S. rail transit systems of any size to be substantially automated. Routing and dispatching of trains, and adjustments for schedule recovery are controlled by a combination of computer and human supervision at BART's Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the Kaiser Center in Downtown Oakland. Station-to-station train movement, including speed control and maintenance of separation between successive trains, is entirely automatic under normal operation, the operator's routine responsibilities being issuing announcements, closing the doors after station stops, and monitoring the track ahead for hazards. In unusual circumstances the operator controls the train manually at reduced speed.\nParking.\nMany BART stations offer parking; however, underpricing causes station parking lots to overflow in the morning. Pervasive congestion and underpricing forces some to drive to distant stations in search of parking. BART operates Parking Lots at 36 stations and offers parking passes for designated spots at many stations.\nBART offers long-term airport parking through a third-party vendor at most East Bay stations. Travelers must make an online reservation in advance and pay the daily fee of $5 before they can leave their cars at the BART parking lot.\nParking at stations in Santa Clara County (Milpitas and Berryessa/North San Jos\u00e9) is managed by Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority rather than BART.\nAccessibility.\nAll BART trains have dedicated spaces for wheelchair users and every station has accessible elevators. Estimated train arrival times and service announcements are both displayed on platform-level screens and announced audibly over the public address system. Station platforms are equipped with tactile paving to aid those with visual impairments, and Braille/tactile signs are present throughout stations.\nPlatform elevators.\nAt some stations, the elevator to the platform (which is inside the paid area) is accessed from an unpaid area of the station. To enter the BART system at one of these stations, passengers using the elevator must first pass through a faregate into the paid area and then exit back through the swing gate adjacent to the station agent booth before taking the elevator to the platform. To exit the system from one of these stations, passengers must do the reverse: take the elevator from the platform to the concourse level, enter the paid area through the swing gate, and then process their ticket at a faregate to exit the paid area once again. Station agents may be able to assist upon request. The configuration of these stations enables fare evasion and causes confusion for passengers.\nAs of 2020, eighteen stations had a platform elevator outside of the paid area. Of these, three stations had ticket processing machines near the elevators that allowed elevator users to avoid having to enter, then exit, then re-enter the paid area; however, these did nothing to deter fare evasion. BART has begun to correct this issue at stations either by expanding the paid area on the concourse level or by installing a single accessible faregate in front of the elevator doors. By December 2021, the number of stations with elevators outside the paid area had been reduced to eight. Five of these stations had elevator faregates installed by January 2023, while the paid area on the concourse level at was expanded to include a new elevator as part of a larger renovation. As of March 2023, only Orinda and Powell Street stations have a platform elevator outside the paid area. New elevator faregates are expected to be installed at these two remaining stations by April 2023.\nCell phone and Wi-Fi.\nIn 2004, BART became the first transit system in the United States to offer cellular telephone communication to passengers of all major wireless carriers on its trains underground. Service was made available for customers of Verizon Wireless, Sprint/Nextel, AT&amp;T Mobility, and T-Mobile in and between the four San Francisco Market Street stations from Civic Center to Embarcadero. In 2009, service was expanded to include the Transbay Tube, thus providing continuous cellular coverage between West Oakland and Balboa Park. In 2010, service was expanded to all underground stations in Oakland (19th Street, 12th Street/Oakland City Center, and Lake Merritt).\nIn 2007, BART ran a beta test of Wi-Fi Internet access for travelers. It initially included the four San Francisco downtown stations: Embarcadero, Montgomery, Powell, and Civic Center. It included above ground testing to trains at BART's Hayward Test Track. The testing and deployment were extended into the underground interconnecting tubes between the four downtown stations and further. The successful demonstration provided for a ten-year contract with WiFi Rail, Inc. for the services throughout the BART right of way. In 2008, the Wi-Fi service was expanded to include the Transbay Tube. BART terminated the relationship with Wi-Fi Rail in December 2014, citing that WiFi Rail had not submitted an adequate financial or technical plan for completing the network throughout the BART system.\nIn 2011, during the Charles Hill killing and aftermath BART disabled cell phone service to hamper demonstrators. The ensuing controversy drew widespread coverage that raised legal questions about free speech rights of protesters and the federal telecommunications laws that relate to passengers. In response, BART released an official policy on cutting off cell phone service.\nOrganization and management.\nGovernance.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District is a special district consisting of Alameda County, Contra Costa County, and the City and County of San Francisco. San Mateo County, which hosts six BART stations, and Santa Clara County, which hosts two, are not part of the BART District. A nine-member elected Board of Directors represents nine districts. BART has its own police force.\nWhile the district includes all of the cities and communities in its jurisdiction, some of these cities do not have stations on the BART system. This has caused tensions among property owners in cities like Livermore who pay BART taxes but must travel outside the city to receive BART service. In areas like Fremont, the majority of commuters do not commute in the direction that BART would take them (many Fremonters commute to San Jose). This would be remedied with the completion of the Silicon Valley BART extension. Phase I of the extension opened on June 13, 2020, giving San Jose its first BART station, Berryessa/North San Jos\u00e9 station.\nBudget.\nIn 2005, BART required nearly $300\u00a0million in funds after fares. About 37% of the costs went to maintenance, 29% to actual transportation operations, 24% to general administration, 8% to police services, and 4% to construction and engineering. In 2005, 53% of the budget was derived from fares, 32% from taxes, and 15% from other sources, including advertising, station retail space leasing, and parking fees. BART reported a farebox recovery ratio of 75.67% in February 2016, up from 2012's 68.2%. BART train operators and station agents have a maximum salary of $62,000 per year with an average of $17,000 in overtime pay. (BART management claimed that in 2013, union train operators and station agents averaged about $71,000 in base salary and $11,000 in overtime, and pay a $92 monthly fee from that for health insurance.)\nIncidents and controversies.\nBART Police shootings.\nOscar Grant III.\nOn January 1, 2009, a BART Police officer, Johannes Mehserle, fatally shot Oscar Grant III. Eyewitnesses gathered direct evidence of the shooting with video cameras, which were later submitted to and disseminated by media outlets and watched hundreds of thousands of times in the days following the shooting. Both peaceful and violent demonstrations occurred protesting the shooting.\nBART held multiple public meetings to ease tensions led by BART Director Carole Ward Allen who called on the BART Board to hire two independent auditors to investigate the shooting, and to provide recommendations to the board regarding BART Police misconduct. Director Ward Allen established BART's first Police Department Review Committee and worked with Assemblyman Sandre Swanson to pass AB 1586 in the California State Legislature, which enforced civilian oversight of the BART Police Department. BART Director Lynette Sweet said that \"BART has not handled this [situation] correctly,\" and called for the BART police chief and general manager to step down, but only one other BART Director, Tom Radulovich, supported such action.\nMehserle was arrested and charged with murder, to which he pleaded not guilty. Oakland civil rights attorney John Burris filed a US$25\u00a0million wrongful death claim against the district on behalf of Grant's daughter and girlfriend. Mehserle's trial was subsequently moved to Los Angeles following concerns that he would be unable to get a fair trial in Alameda County. On July 8, 2010, Mehserle was found guilty on a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. He was released on parole on June 13, 2011.\nCharles Hill.\nOn July 3, 2011, an officer of the BART Police shot and killed Charles Hill at Civic Center Station in San Francisco. Hill had thrown a bottle at the officers and was in the process of throwing a knife at them from a distance of about 15 feet when the first shot was fired.\nOn August 12, 2011, BART shut down cellphone services on the network for three hours in an effort to hamper possible protests against the shooting and to keep communications away from protesters at the Civic Center station in San Francisco. The shutdown caught the attention of state senator Leland Yee and international media, as well as drawing comparisons to the internet shutdowns during the Egyptian revolution earlier that year. Antonette Bryant, the union president for BART, stated that \"BART have lost our confidence and are putting rider and employee safety at risk.\"\nMembers of Anonymous broke into BART's website and posted names, phone numbers, addresses, and e-mail information on the Anonymous website.\nOn August 15, 2011, there was more disruption in service at BART stations in downtown San Francisco. \"The San Francisco Examiner\" reported that the protests were a result of the shootings, including that of Oscar Grant.\nOn August 29, 2011, a coalition of nine public interest groups led by Public Knowledge filed an Emergency Petition asking the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to declare \"that the actions taken by the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (\"BART\") on August 11, 2011, violated the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, when it deliberately interfered with access to Commercial Mobile Radio Service (\"CMRS\") by the public\" and \"that local law enforcement has no authority to suspend or deny CMRS, or to order CMRS providers to suspend or deny service, absent a properly obtained order from the Commission, a state commission of appropriate jurisdiction, or a court of law with appropriate jurisdiction\".\nIn December 2011 BART adopted a new \"Cell Service Interruption Policy\" that only allows shutdowns of cell phone services within BART facilities \"in the most extraordinary circumstances that threaten the safety of District passengers, employees and other members of public, the destruction of District property, or the substantial disruption of public transit service\". According to a spokesperson for BART, under the new policy the wireless phone system would not be turned off under circumstances similar to those in August 2011. Instead police officers would arrest individuals who break the law.\nIn February 2012, the San Francisco District Attorney concluded that the BART Police Officer that shot and killed Charles Hill at the Civic Center BART station the previous July \"acted lawfully in self defense\" and would not face charges for the incident.\nIn March 2012, the FCC requested public comment on the question of whether or when the police and other government officials can intentionally interrupt cellphone and Internet service to protect public safety.\nA federal lawsuit filed against BART by Charles Hill's brother was dismissed in 2013. The federal judge concluded that \"a reasonable officer in that situation could believe that he was in danger of being hit by a knife after having had a bottle thrown at him.\" The lawyers of Hill's family did not dispute that he had thrown a knife at the officer, but argued that both officers should have done more to deescalate the situation.\nWorker fatalities.\n1979 fatal electrical fire.\nIn January 1979, an electrical fire occurred on a train as it was passing through the Transbay Tube. One firefighter (Lt. William Elliott, 50, of the Oakland Fire Department) was killed in the effort to extinguish the blaze. Since then, safety regulations have been updated.\nJames Strickland.\nOn October 14, 2008, track inspector James Strickland was struck and killed by a train as he was walking along a section of track between the Concord and Pleasant Hill BART stations. Strickland's death started an investigation into BART's safety alert procedures. At the time of the accident, BART had assigned trains headed in opposite directions to a shared track for routine maintenance. BART came under further fire in February 2009 for allegedly delaying payment of death benefits to Strickland's family.\nOctober 2013 incident.\nOn the afternoon of October 19, 2013, a BART employee and a contractor, who were inspecting tracks, were struck and killed near Walnut Creek by a train being moved for routine maintenance. A labor strike by BART's two major unions was underway at the time, which caused BART to use an undertrained operator. Instead of the usual 14 weeks of the training, the operator only received four. The BART trainer was not in the cab with the operator at the time of impact but was instead in the passenger compartment. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the accident occurred because BART facilitated access to the railway line. BART was fined $600,000 for the incident.\nCrime.\nIn mid-2017, BART came under criticism for refusing to publicly release video evidence of crimes committed at Oakland stations. That year, in at least three incidents, groups of young people had boarded stopped trains and attacked and robbed train riders.\nIn response to the criticism, a BART manager argued that \"to release these videos would create a high level of racially insensitive commentary toward the district [...] and in addition it would create a racial bias in the riders against minorities on the trains.\" According to an internal memo, the agency decided to not issue a press release about one of the cases (where a woman had her phone stolen by one of a group of teenagers) in order to avoid having BART look \"crime ridden\" and because it would \"unfairly affect and characterize riders of color, leading to sweeping generalizations in media reports.\" A spokesman also stated that state laws about \"juvenile police records\" prohibited BART from releasing surveillance video.\nIn 2018, BART released surveillance video from one of the 2017 incidents, showing (as summarized by KRON4) \"the moments leading up to a mob-style attack on a BART train [... with] about 40 teens jumping the fare gates and pushing through the emergency gates at the station as an overwhelmed station agent calls for help.\" BART stated that two juveniles and an 18-year-old had been arrested for the incident, with the 18-year-old ending up serving one year in jail. In September 2017, six victims of the robberies/assaults filed suit against BART for gross negligence, claiming BART did not provide adequate security for its riders. In January 2020, two passengers affected by the same incident lost their lawsuits, one of them on the grounds that she had been attacked on the platform rather than on the train, outside of BART's common carrier duties.\nOn July 22, 2018, a man fatally stabbed 18-year-old Nia Wilson with a knife as she exited a train car at the MacArthur station. This was the third homicide at a BART station within five days. In June 2019, the Alameda County Civil Grand Jury released a report documenting a 128% increase in thefts on BART between 2014 and 2018, and an 83% increase in aggravated assault during the same time period.\nBART has historically suffered from fare evasion. Prior police crackdowns have occurred, but have not curbed the issue. An estimated 448 calls per month are made to BART police regarding fare evaders, and riders have observed that, at times, there are more fare evaders than paying customers. In April 2023, BART announced plans to install new gates resistant to fare evasion. The project, which was projected to cost $90 million, began with a pilot program at West Oakland station.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "60341", "revid": "39457116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60341", "title": "Richmond, California", "text": "Richmond is a city in western Contra Costa County, California, United States. The city was incorporated on August 3, 1905, and has a city council. Located in the San Francisco Bay Area's East Bay region, Richmond borders San Pablo, Albany, El Cerrito and Pinole in addition to the unincorporated communities of North Richmond, Hasford Heights, Kensington, El Sobrante, Bayview-Montalvin Manor, Tara Hills, and East Richmond Heights, and for a short distance San Francisco on Red Rock Island in the San Francisco Bay.\nRichmond is one of two cities, the other being San Rafael, that sits on the shores of both San Francisco Bay and San Pablo Bay. Its population was 116,448 as of the 2020 United States census making it the second largest city in the United States named Richmond after Richmond, Virginia.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Richmond\" predates incorporation of the city by more than fifty years. Edmund Randolph, originally from Richmond, Virginia, represented the city of San Francisco when California's first legislature met in San Jose in December 1849, and he became state assemblyman from San Francisco. Out of fondness for his hometown, Randolph persuaded a federal surveying party, surveying and mapping the San Francisco Bay, to place the names \"Point Richmond\" and \"Richmond\" on their 1854 geodetic coastal map. The map was used at the terminal selected by the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad. By 1899 maps made by the railroad carried the name \"Point Richmond Avenue\", a county road that later became Barrett Avenue, a central street in Richmond. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad purchased the railroad making their terminus at Richmond. The first post office opened in 1900, and the city of Richmond incorporated in 1905.\nHistory.\nThe Ohlone were the first inhabitants of the Richmond area, settling an estimated 5,000 years ago. They spoke the Chochenyo language, and subsisted as hunter-gatherers and harvesters.\nOrigins.\nThe site that would eventually become the city of Richmond was part of the Rancho San Pablo land granted to Don Francisco Mar\u00eda Castro, from which the nearby town of San Pablo inherited its name; the Point Richmond area was known originally as The Potrero and then renamed as Point Stevens in early charts of San Francisco Bay. Point Richmond was an island, but industrial development and deliberate fill connected it to the mainland by the early 1900s.\nOn July 4, 1900, the Santa Fe Railroad's western terminus was established at Point Richmond with ferry connections from Ferry Point in the Brickyard Cove area to San Francisco. The Santa Fe railroad also built a major rail yard next to Point Richmond. It constructed a tunnel through the Potrero San Pablo ridge to run track from the yard to a ferry landing from which freight cars could be transshipped to San Francisco. Where this track crosses the main street in Point Richmond, there remain two of the last operational wigwag grade crossing signals in the United States, and the only surviving examples of the \"upside-down\" type. The wigwag is a type of railroad crossing signal that was phased out in the 1970s and '80s across the country. There was controversy in 2005 when the State Transportation Authority ordered the BNSF railroad company to upgrade the railroad crossing signals. A compromise was achieved that included installing new modern crossing gates, red lights and bells while not removing, but simply shutting off, the historic ones and preserving their functionality for special events.\nStandard Oil set up operations on land sold by Emily Tewksbury in 1901, including what is now the Chevron Richmond Refinery and tank farm, which Chevron still operates. There is a pier into San Francisco Bay south of Point Molate for oil tankers.\nEarly days.\nThe city of Richmond was incorporated in 1905. Until the enactment of prohibition in 1919, the city had the largest winery in the world; the small abandoned village of Winehaven remains fenced off along Western Drive in the Point Molate Area. Richmond was a small town at that time, with some industrial development centered on the waterfront based around the railroad and oil refineries.\nThe Pullman Company also established a major facility in Richmond in the early 20th century. The facility connected with both the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific and serviced their passenger coach equipment. The Pullman Company was a large employer of African American men, who worked mainly as porters on the Pullman cars. Many of them settled in the East Bay, from Richmond to Oakland, before World War II.\nFrom 1917 and throughout the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan was active in the city.\nIn 1930 the Ford Motor Company opened the Richmond Assembly Plant, which later moved to Milpitas in 1956. The old Ford plant in Richmond has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1988. In 2004 it was purchased by developer Eddie Orton, who converted it into an events center named Ford Point Building\u2013The Craneway.\nWartime boomtown and shifting demographics.\nAt the onset of World War II, the four Richmond Shipyards were built along Richmond's waterfront, employing thousands of workers, many migrating to Richmond from other parts of the country after being recruited. These new workers generally lived in housing constructed specifically for the wartime boom, scattered throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, including Richmond, Berkeley and Albany. Many of these new migrants were Black Americans from the South and to a lesser extent the Midwest who took jobs in heavy industry and transport as those industries expanded to meet the needs of the war economy, while increased numbers of women also joined the industrial workforce for the first time as large numbers of working-age men were drafted for the war effort. During the war, Richmond's population increased dramatically, rising from 23,000 in 1940 to 114,899 in 1942 and peaking at around 120,000 by 1945.\nA specially built rail line, the Shipyard Railway, transported workers to the shipyards. Kaiser's Richmond shipyards built 747 Victory and Liberty ships for the war effort, more than any other site in the U.S. The shipyards broke many records, including the completion of a Liberty ship in just five days. On average the yards built a new ship in 30 days.\nThe medical system established for the shipyard workers at the Richmond Field Hospital eventually became today's Kaiser Permanente HMO. The hospital remained in operation until 1993, when it was replaced by the Richmond Medical Center hospital, which has since expanded to a multi-building campus.\nPoint Richmond was Richmond's original commercial hub, but a new downtown arose in the center of the city along Macdonald Avenue during the war. It was populated by department stores such as Kress, J.C. Penney, Sears, Macy's, and Woolworth's.\nPost-war decline and rebound.\nWhen the war ended the shipyard workers were no longer needed, and a decades-long population decline ensued. The census listed 99,545 residents in 1950. By 1960 much of the temporary housing built for the shipyard workers was torn down, and the population dropped to about 71,800.\nJust before his April 1968 assassination, Martin Luther King Jr. had been working on plans for the Poor People's Campaign, including a multi-city tour of the U.S. with a stop in Richmond. His son, Martin Luther King III, completed the Poverty in America Tour in 2007, stopping in Richmond. Unrest in late June 1968, sparked by the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy, damaged businesses in downtown along Macdonald Avenue. Most notably, the Travalini Furniture Store was destroyed by fire, which was assumed to be the result of the violent protests, but according to Fraser Felter, who was a reporter for the \"Richmond Independent\", police sources told him the fire was set to avoid a debt instead by destroying store records.\nIn the 1970s, the Hilltop area was developed in Richmond's northern suburbs, further depressing the downtown area as it drew retail clients and tenants away to the large indoor Hilltop Mall, which opened in 1976. The shopping mall, last named Hilltop Horizon, was opened under Taubman Centers, and has been sold since then to GM Pension Trust (1998), Simon Property Group (2007), Jones Lang LaSalle (2012), LBG Real Estate (2017), and Prologis (2021), who announced plans to close and demolish the building, reusing the land for a mixed-use development including residential, retail, and logistics facilities.\nIn the late 1990s the Richmond Parkway was built along Richmond's western industrial and northwestern parkland, connecting Interstates 80 and 580. Construction of the Parkway, which follows the alignment of SR\u00a093 as proposed in 1958, started in 1990 and completed in 1996 at a cost of $193\u00a0million. However, Caltrans issued a letter in 1998 saying it would not take over responsibility for the road unless it was brought up to expressway standards; as it was cost-prohibitive to convert it, the road remains the responsibility of the city and county.\nIn 2006, the city celebrated its centennial. This coincided with the repaving and streetscaping project of Macdonald Avenue. The city's old rundown commercial district along Macdonald has been designated the city's \"Main Street District\" by the state of California. This has led to funding of improvements in the form of state grants.\nGeography.\nRichmond is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (comprising 42.71%) is water. The city sits on of waterfront, more than any other city in the Bay Area. The city borders San Francisco Bay to the southwest and San Pablo Bay to the northwest, and includes Brooks Island and the Brother Islands entirely, and half of Red Rock Island.\nThere are several cities and unincorporated communities surrounding or bordering Richmond. To the south is the city of Albany which is in Alameda County and the city of El Cerrito. The unincorporated communities of East Richmond Heights, Rollingwood, Hasford Heights, and El Sobrante lie to the east. North Richmond to the west and San Pablo to the east are almost entirely surrounded by Richmond's city limits. To the north, Richmond borders the city of Pinole and the unincorporated areas of Bayview, Montalvin Manor, Hilltop Green, Tara Hills. Richmond borders Alameda, San Francisco, and Marin counties in the Bay and Red Rock Island.\nThe city is within the 94801, 94803, 94804, 94805, and 94806 ZIP Codes.\nClimate.\nRichmond, like much of the coastal East Bay, enjoys a very mild Mediterranean climate year round. The climate is slightly warmer than the coastal areas of San Francisco, the Peninsula, and Marin County; it is however more temperate than areas further inland. The average highs range from and the lows range from year round. Richmond usually enjoys an \"Indian summer\", and September is, on average, the warmest month. January is on average the coldest month.\nThe highest recorded temperature in Richmond was in September 1971 while the coldest was in December 1990.\nThe rainy season begins in late October and ends in April, with some showers in May. Most of the rain occurs during stronger storms which occur between November and March and drop of rain per month. January and February are the rainiest months.\nLike most of the Bay Area, Richmond is made up of several microclimates. Southern parts of the city and the ridges receive more fog than northern areas. Summer temperatures are higher in inland areas, where the moderating influence of San Francisco Bay is lessened. The average wind speed is with stronger winds from March through August; the strongest winds are in June. The city also enjoys more than 80% sunshine seven months out of the year and ten months with 60% or more. December and January are the darkest months with about 45% average brightness. The city experiences virtually no snowfall, and brief hail annually.\nEnvironment.\nRichmond is home to many species of animals. Canada geese visit the city on their annual migrations. Harbor seals live on the Castro Rocks, and pigeons and gulls populate the sidewalks and parking lots. Tadpoles and frogs can be found in the local creeks and vernal pools. Field mice and lizards are also found. Herons and egrets nest in protected areas on Brooks Island. Deer, falcons, raccoons, ducks, foxes, owls, and mountain lions live in Wildcat Canyon and Point Pinole Regional Shoreline.\nA license is needed for fishing on the waterfront or city waters but not on the piers, where in addition to crabs, sturgeon are plentiful. Striped bass, bat rays, leopard sharks, surf perch, jacksmelt, white croaker, and flounders are also found. Richmond is one of the few places where you can find the rare Olympia oyster on the West Coast, in the waters along the refinery's shoreline. Rainbow trout have recently returned to San Pablo and Wildcat creeks.\nRed-tailed hawks patrol the skies. Monarch butterflies migrate through the city on their journey between Mexico and Canada. Wildcat Marsh has two ponds where Canada geese often rest, and is also the home of the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse and California clapper rail. Another endangered species in the city is the Santa Cruz tarweed which survives alongside Interstate 80. Wildcat Canyon also hosts falcons and vultures. Threatened black rails also live in the city's marshes.\nAfter a baby gray whale was beached on the Point Richmond shore in May 2007, its rotting corpse became bothersome to neighbors. Removal was delayed as various agencies argued over which would have to pay for it, at an eventual cost of $18,000.\nRichmond is also home to one of the last pristine moist grassland habitats in the entire Bay Area at the former Campus Bay UC Berkeley Field Station near Meeker Slough. Richmond residents, however, have limited access to other environmental benefits. Because of the refineries located in Richmond, air quality is particularly low, and residents are especially at risk of air-pollution-related health issues.\nIn 2006, the city was sued by an environmental group for dumping raw sewage into the Bay. Councilmember Tom Butt was very vocal on the subject, accusing the city council of turning a blind eye to the problem.\nA 60-acre, 10.5-megawatt solar farm was opened within the city in 2018. The farm sits on a former landfill owned by Chevron.\nCrime.\nThe city has in the past suffered from a high crime rate; at one point, the city council requested a declaration of a state of emergency and asked for the intervention of the Contra Costa County Sheriff and the California Highway Patrol. Murder, vehicle theft, and larceny rates remain high, although they tend to be concentrated in the Iron Triangle and adjacent unincorporated North Richmond, which is outside the jurisdiction of the Richmond Police Department. By 1991, the city's all-time high of 62 homicides, among a population of 98,000, was seven times the national average. The portion of these homicides that were drug- or gang-related increased from 5 percent to 55 percent between 1989 and 1991.\nDespite the city making extreme headway in crime reduction and prevention, Richmond received widespread attention in 2009 when a girl was gang raped at a homecoming dance at Richmond High School.\nIn 2007, Richmond opened a program to prevent gun violence, the Office of Neighborhood Safety. The program collects information and analyzes public records to determine \"the 50 people in Richmond most likely to shoot someone and to be shot themselves.\" It then offers selected individuals \"a spot in a program that includes a stipend to turn their lives around\". \"Over an 18-month period, if the men demonstrate better behavior, ONS offers them up to $1,000 a month in cash, plus opportunities to travel beyond Richmond.\"\nIn 2004, Richmond was ranked the 12th most dangerous city in America. Those rankings have changed, and Richmond is no longer ranked as a \"most dangerous\" city, in either California or the United States. This is in large part due to the efforts of Police Chief Chris Magnus, who established \"community policing\", which involves police officers engaging with affected high crime communities.\nDisasters.\nRichmond lies in the volatile California region that has a potential for devastating earthquakes. Many buildings were damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The city has also had at least one minor tornado. The Chevron Richmond Refinery had highly noted chemical leaks in the 1990s. The company has been fined thousands, and sometimes hundreds of thousands, of dollars.\nRichmond has a siren system consisting of 17 emergency warning sirens located across the city; they are tested on the first Wednesday of every month, at 11 am PST (12 pm PDT), and are usually used to warn of toxic chemical releases from the Chevron Richmond Refinery.\nIn a July 26, 1993, industrial accident, a General Chemical company rail tanker car containing oleum overheated and exploded in the General Chemical railyard. This resulted in a area contaminated with the poisonous gas, and led to 25,000 people landing in the hospital. The incident led to lawsuits, and has been referred to as a mini-Bhopal.\n2007 San Francisco Bay Oil Spill.\nThe city's shoreline and wildlife were seriously affected by the 2007 San Francisco Bay oil spill. Beaches and shoreline were closed, but later reopened. Keller Beach was closed to public access for swimmers.\n2010 sinkhole.\nOn April 15, 2010, a sinkhole roughly deep appeared at the intersection of El Portal Drive and Via Verdi. Although no one was hurt, a car fell into the sinkhole.\n2012 Chevron Refinery fire.\nOn August 6, 2012, at around 6:15 PM, a large fire erupted at the Chevron refinery, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the surrounding area and resulting in nearly 15,000 people to seek medical treatment following the incident. Just minutes after the fire was reported, Contra Costa Health Services notified residents \u201cshelter in place\u201d; the local siren system was activated and several messages were issued through the Emergency Alert System. The fire was reported contained at around 10:40 PM.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020.\nThe 2020 United States census reported that Richmond had a population of 116,448.

It had a dynamite and gunpowder works (the Giant Powder Company, closed in 1960, now the site of Point Pinole Regional Shoreline), the last active whaling station in the country at Point Molate (closed in 1971), and one of the world's largest wineries (Winehaven), closed by Prohibition in 1919.\nDuring World War II, Richmond developed rapidly as a heavy industrial town, chiefly devoted to shipbuilding. Its major activity now is as a seaport, with 26 million tons of goods shipped through Port Richmond in 1993, mostly oil and petroleum products. The seaport is also home to a major oil refinery operated by Chevron Corporation. The Social Security Administration employs over 1,000 at its regional office and program service center in Downtown Richmond. Kaiser Permanente's Richmond Medical Center hospital in the Downtown Richmond is one of the largest employers in the city.\nRetail.\nThe Hilltop District includes Prologis Hilltop Center and a 16-screen Century Theatres alongside Hilltop Plaza Shopping Center. The 23rd Street business district has evolved into a predominantly Latino neighborhood over the last twenty years as have the storefronts.\nIn the Downtown Richmond District the Richmond Shopping Center was built as part of the city's \"main street\" revitalization efforts.\nThe Macdonald 80 Shopping Center is a commercial plot along the trunk route of Macdonald Avenue which has been designated the city's main street under the aforementioned program. It was once anchored by the now-defunct Montgomery Wards and a Toys\"R\"Us. Demolition of the former buildings and construction of a new shopping mall were completed in 2006.\nRedevelopment.\nThe former Richmond Shipyard No.\u00a02 and Inner Harbor were transformed starting in the late 1980s into a multiunit residential area, now known as Marina Bay. Starting in the early 2000s, the city began an aggressive redevelopment effort spurring exurban tract housing, condominiums, townhomes, a transit village, and terraced hillside subdivisions. The city also created a redevelopment agency that refurbished Macdonald Avenue, funded the Metro Walk transit village, resurrected the Macdonald 80 Shopping Center, and created the Richmond Greenway rails-to-trails trail and urban farming project. Since 1996, new homes have increased in price by 32%, and there has been a 65.6% increase in the total amount of new dwellings built annually.\nCountry Club Vista is a development surrounding the Richmond Country Club to the south and north. It includes suburban style tract houses with cul-de-sac courts and small yards. Seacliff, at Point Richmond, is a development of luxury waterfront homes built on a terraced hillside. San Marcos is a series of about ten condominium multistory buildings between The Shops at Hilltop and Country Club Vista. Richmond Transit Village has been constructed in the former west parking lot and an adjacent empty lot of the combined Richmond BART and Amtrak station. The development is part of the city's downtown revitalization efforts.\nRichmond CARES.\nOn September 11, 2013, the seven-member Richmond City Council, in a four-to-three vote, decided to pursue a scheme for using eminent domain to buy out mortgages. The vote was on \"[setting] up a Joint Powers Authority to bring more cities into the plan\". However, at least five votes would be needed before any mortgage could actually be bought out. North Las Vegas, Nevada and California governments including El Monte Fontana, the city of Ontario and San Bernardino County had considered such plans but decided not to pursue them. The vote made Richmond the first to accept the idea. The plan had been opposed by the vice-mayor and some members of the city council, who said it would \"compromise\" the city's finances.\nCritics of the plan noted that the company Mortgage Resolution Partners stood to potentially profit: it would receive $4,500 from the new lenders for each refinanced mortgage for arranging the financing to purchase the original loans and for handling all legal, administrative, and refinancing operations (an amount matching what lenders are compensated for under the Federal HARP loan modification program). Critics also questioned the inclusion of wealthy neighborhoods such as \"the area near the Richmond Country Club\". The Western Contra Costa Association of Realtors hired a public relations agency and sent mass mailings warning against the scheme; its advertising was \"funded, in part, by more than $70,000 from the California Association of Realtors and the National Associations of Realtors.\"&lt;ref name=\"http://richmondconfidential.org/2013/09/10/realtors-and-residents-debate-richmonds-eminent-domain-plan/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nDeutsche Bank and Wells Fargo had sued, claiming the program was unconstitutional. \"[T]he National Housing Law Project, Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, Bay Area Legal Aid, the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, and the California Reinvestment Coalition\" opposed the suit, calling the banks' request for an injunction against the city \"discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act\".\nSupporters of the plan include the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment and Robert Hockett, a professor of law at Cornell University.\nCasinos.\nMany casinos have been proposed for the West Contra Costa area. Point Molate would have a casino, resort, and a luxury shopping mall. Sugar Bowl Casino proposed a casino, a steakhouse, and a buffet promoted by the Pomo Tribe's Scotts Valley Band near the border between North Richmond and the city of Richmond's Parchester Village, whose residents have lauded it as a boon to fighting crime by adding more of a police presence and creating jobs for shiftless youth, but residents from neighboring newly developed sub-divisions along the Richmond Country Club were fervently opposed based on potential losses to property values. Casino San Pablo has already been built in neighboring San Pablo, with 2,500 slots. The projects have been the subject of much civic debate; supporters contend that the often cash-strapped government would get a major new source of revenue, while opponents air their concerns over the ramifications, including an increase in already high crime rates, lowered property values, and worsening neighborhood quality of life.\nPoint Molate is currently slated to either become a housing and conference center, a casino resort shopping area, or a large regional park.\nIn 2010, the city approved the environmental review of the plan in which the tribe agreed to contain development of the casino to the footprint of the buildings on the former naval depot site. The lobbying and reports required by Richmond have cost the tribe $15 million. This approval won over the region's strict environmentalists and many council members. Later that year residents were given the opportunity to weigh in on the issue and voted on the non-binding measure U to determine their approval of the project. 58% of voters opposed the $1 billion project. Citing the people's opposition and the inability to negotiate several key points with the developer, the city council voted down the project in 2011. Councilman Nat Bates remained a proponent of the plan with its projected 17,000 jobs, while the remainder of the council was chagrined at the fact that there was no guarantee that the jobs would go to Richmonders. The city of San Pablo, whose lifeline is their card club, Casino San Pablo, was elated. The Guideville Band of Pomo Indians was given the opportunity of 150 days to create a non-casino plan for the site such as alternatives in the environmental report for a convention center, conference center, hotel, spa, and housing.\nGovernment.\nThe Richmond city government operates under a council-manager system with seven members (including mayor and vice mayor) elected to alternating four-year terms. Politically, the city is a Democratic stronghold. By the early 1990s, not a single Republican remained on the council. The city council has four African Americans, four whites and two Latinos.\nThe position of Mayor rotated between members of the Richmond City Council until 1981, when the office became an elected position. George D. Carroll, who was voted by the City Council to become Mayor on July 6, 1964, was described at the time as \"the first Negro mayor in California and first in America with the exception of small, scattered all-Negro communities in the Deep South,\". George Livingston Sr. was the first elected African American mayor. He served from 1985 to 1993. Rosemary Corbin served as the mayor from 1993 to 2001. The current mayor Eduardo Martinez was elected Mayor of Richmond in 2022, winning 39% of the vote. Prior to winning the mayoral election, he had served on the Richmond City Council since 2014. Martinez, a former primary school teacher, is Richmond's first Latino mayor and a vocal critic of Chevron.\nYears of political domination by the local firefighters union subsided after an FBI corruption investigation. In the early 2000s Gayle McLaughlin was the first Green elected to the council, with the support of the Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA), a coalition of liberal Democrats, progressive independents, and Greens. In November 2006, McLaughlin was elected mayor, defeating incumbent first-term Mayor Irma Anderson. During McLaughlin's mayoralty (2007\u20132015), Richmond was the nation's largest city with a Green Party mayor.\nIn 2006, the city implemented a computer program that it had ordered from a German firm that provides the city with statistical interactive maps. These maps cover such areas as signage locations, streets, crime hot-spots, and zoning information. In 2007 the city won a contest in which its previously substandard website was upgraded and improved to make it more modern and functional. The prize includes two years of free webmastering.\nMayor McLaughlin and Councilperson Butt opposed Chevron's Renewal Project that would replace their 1950s era Hydrogen Manufacturing plant with a newer more efficient plant and would increase pollution by using dirtier, thicker, but cheaper crude oil.\nThe city of Richmond has eight community centers which are located within city parks. Many of the city's community centers were closed in the early 2000s following budget miscalculations and financial difficulties. In the 2006 city elections many candidates ran on platforms promising to reopen these community centers, most of which had been closed due to budget cuts. That election also featured a city sales tax increase, Measure Q, which failed.\nThere are 53 voting precincts in Richmond. Richmond has formerly been home to black culture and activist movements, most notably the Black Panther Party.\nRichmond became the first city in the United States to pass a resolution for a ceasefire in the Gaza war on October 25, 2023, eighteen days after the outbreak of hostilities.\nCannabis.\nThe city has eight cannabis dispensaries, and although the city has passed legislation approving them and has legalized their presence, city management does not accept their legality. In fact, the city had sued to close them. It is trying to enforce an injunction that would suspend their operating licenses. Although the city council has passed an ordinance permitting the dispensaries, city management refuses to cooperate with the spirit of the law because it has yet to take effect. The question remains whether the clubs will be closed before the law allowing them to open takes effect.\nIn 2019 the city approved \"Power Plant Park\" a marijuana farm consisting of 45 greenhouses on 18 acres north of North Richmond near Breuner Marsh and a solar farm. It is expected the create 500 new jobs and become a major economic contributor to the city.\nPolitical party affiliation.\nAccording to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Richmond has 52,364 registered voters. Of those, 33,166 (63.3%) are registered Democrats, 2,979 (5.7%) are registered Republicans, 14,108 (26.9%) have declined to state a political party, and 4.1% are registered members of a third party.\nEducation.\nThe public schools in all portions of Richmond are administered by the West Contra Costa Unified School District, formerly the Richmond Unified School District. There are also many private schools, mostly Catholic schools under the authority of the Diocese of Oakland.\nThe city has four high schools: De Anza High School, Salesian College Preparatory, Richmond High School, and Kennedy High School. In addition, there are four charter high schools, Making Waves Academy, Aspire Richmond California College Preparatory Academy, Leadership Public Schools: Richmond and West County Community High School, although West County Community High School was shut down in 2012. In 2012, Richmond Charter Academy, part of the Amethod Public Schools system, opened a charter middle school. There are also three middle schools, 16 elementary schools, and seven elementary-middle schools. Richmond also hosts three adult education schools.\nThe Contra Costa Community College District serves all of Contra Costa County, and Richmonders who decide to attend a community college typically go to Contra Costa College, located in the neighboring city of San Pablo.\n79.8% of Richmonders have a high school diploma or equivalent, compared with 84.2% nationally. But 27.1% have a bachelor's degree compared with a statistically similar 27.2% nationally.\nSince an exit exam requirement was implemented for California high schools, the CAHSEE, some Richmond high school students have been protesting against it. Some students sued the district in an attempt to eliminate the requirement. In July 2007, a compromise was reached in which the district would provide two additional years of educational assistance for the purposes of passing the exam. That year, only 28% of Richmond High School students had passed the CAHSEE, a prerequisite for graduating.\nObesity.\nAll Richmond schools have banned junk food, such as candy, soda, Twinkies, pizza, and other similar items in attempt to curb childhood obesity and change children's eating habits. It has been speculated that this was done preemptively, because some believe the state will soon mandate such restrictions. Despite these efforts, soda consumption in Richmond schools has not diminished. Furthermore, the current 32% of Richmond children who are obese will increase the current 24% adult obesity rate to 42% according to the Contra Costa County Health Services. This led the city council to approve a referendum on a 1 cent per ounce tax on beverages with a high sugar content for the 2012 elections, a first in the nation. The measure was opposed by councilmembers Corky Booz\u00e9 and Nat Bates, who stated that he knew \"many obese people that are perfectly healthy\" and that it was \"elitist\" and \"targeted black\" people respectively. Members Jovanka Beckles and Jeff Ritterman \u2013 the latter a cardiologist \u2013 expressed horror at the obesity rate. Beckles chastized the other black members (Bates and Booz\u00e9) for not supporting the measure, as she found that the epidemic most affected people of color like themselves. The revenues would have been used to counter obesity through health and fitness campaigns and expenditures. The referendum was defeated by voters in the November 2012 election.\nAttractions and landmarks.\nThe city of Richmond has dozens of parks, national historic parks, and 10 sites listed under the National Register of Historic Places.\nPoint Richmond.\nPoint Richmond, a neighborhood in Richmond, is known for its small-town appearance. \"The Point\", as it is known by locals, offers owner-operated stores, coffee shops, historic benches, and streetlights. The Masquers Playhouse is a performing arts center that offers shows and productions year round. Hotel Mac is one of the oldest buildings in the area and has classic early 20th century architecture, like many other buildings in the area. There is also The Plunge, a natatorium which had been closed due to seismic safety issues but was re-opened in August 2010 after the retrofitting was completed. The city expressed a desire to demolish the building at one point, but this was halted by the actions of a neighborhood preservation campaign which continues its mission to \"Save the Plunge!\".\nThe Richmond\u2013San Rafael Bridge extends across San Pablo Bay, entering Richmond just to the north of Point Richmond. The bridge is the origin of the term \"rollercoaster span\", due to its curves, bumps, and appearance, which have also earned the bridge the nickname of \"the rollercoaster bridge\". It was completed in 1957, and connects Contra Costa County with Marin County. Automobiles are charged a $6 toll in the westbound (towards Marin) direction only.\nThe Richmond Chevron Refinery occupies most of the land north of Point Richmond and the eastern end of the bridge. Some areas of this northern section are protected and publicly accessible, including Point Molate Beach Park, a park on the western coast of Richmond along Western Drive. It was originally a Chinese shrimp camp in the 1870s. On the northern end, near Point San Pablo, there is a yacht harbor that accommodates hundreds of private boats.\nBrickyard Cove.\nThe Ferry Point Tunnel is one of the oldest tunnels in California, connecting Point Richmond with Brickyard Cove to the south. Built in 1899, this structure still gives access to many attractions and neighborhoods in Brickyard Cove. The tunnel goes to the Golden State Railroad Museum, the USS \"Red Oak Victory\", and many beaches and parks, and to Ferry Point where an abandoned ferry-rail pier stands with a historic ferry slip still standing, though somewhat damaged by fire. It can be viewed from an adjacent fishing pier.\nThe Santa Fe Railroad established ferry service to San Francisco in 1900 and later built a station that operated as the western terminus for the railroad from 1903 to 1992. It has now been transformed into a museum to exemplify the feel of the terminal in that era. The Golden State Railroad Museum is a complex series of model railroad layouts in a museum in the Brickyard Cove area of Point Richmond. A visitor can operate trains of various eras, and there are miniature freight and passenger terminals, trestles, tunnels, and meticulously detailed town and city scenes, many of which are copied from real life scenes of the 1950s.\nKeller Beach is one of the city's beaches, located at Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline, a park in Brickyard Cove. It offers picnicking, sunbathing, wading, and swimming. The beach is overlooked by vehicles exiting the Brickyard Cove drive, Ferry Point tunnel and houses on the steep cliffs above. The beach, as with most of the cove, offers spectacular panoramic bay views of the Oakland hills, bridges, the San Francisco skyline and the Golden Gate.\nSouthern waterfront / Shipyards.\nFurther east, the is a restored World War II Victory ship, the 558th ship made in Richmond. It is moored in the former Richmond Shipyard No. 3. Liberty and Victory ships built in Richmond transported troops and supplies during World War II.\nEast across the Harbor/Santa Fe Channel, the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park is in Richmond, and commemorates women's shipbuilding and support for the war effort in the 1940s. The visitor's center is in a small utility building next to the former Ford Assembly Plant. Regular ferry service is provided to San Francisco from the Richmond Ferry Terminal via San Francisco Bay Ferry.\nThis area is connected by the San Francisco Bay Trail to several city parks along the waterfront, including Lucretia Edwards Shoreline Park, Marina Bay Park and the Rosie the Riveter Memorial, Barbara and Jay Vincent Park, and Shimada Friendship Park. The Bay Trail continues past these parks further southeast to Point Isabel Regional Shoreline and beyond to parks in El Cerrito, Albany, and Berkeley.\nCivic Center.\nDuring World War II the city sprawled and its population increased dramatically. This led city leaders to construct the Richmond Civic Center, with buildings completed between 1949 and 1957. This center houses the city hall, a small convention center, library, hall of justice, police headquarters, and arts center.\nArchitectural Forum magazine called the new Memorial Civic Center: \"a milestone in U.S. civic design: it is the first modern Civic Center built in any American city: and it is one of the most comprehensive centers constructed anywhere in the world.\"\nThe Richmond Public Library, the only public library independent of the Contra Costa County Public Libraries system, lies in the heart of the civic center. It houses over 204,686 books, 4,014 audio materials, 5,277 video materials, and 491 serial subscriptions.\nOffshore.\nEast Brother Light Station on East Brother Island (one of the Brother Islands) is host to an exclusive bed and breakfast.

The Center engages youth and young adults in imagining and creating new worlds for themselves and new visions for their communities through the inspiration and discipline of rigorous training in world performance traditions.\nThe Hyphy subculture and subgenre of rap music originated in Richmond and surrounding cities.\nFrom 1996 to 2002 a \"geekfest\" was held on the beach in Point Molate every few weeks or monthly by S.P.A.M. Records. The festival was a community service for under-21-year-olds.\nReligion.\nThere are dozens of houses of worship for various religions in the city, and some which are not represented in the city can be found nearby.

The Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park was established in 2000, encompassing the former Kaiser shipyards and other wartime industrial sites in Richmond. The park is a memorial to the six million women who labored on the home front, symbolized by the mythical figure \"Rosie the Riveter\". Richmond was selected for the park because it has many intact buildings that were constructed for 56 wartime industries. Its four shipyards produced an amazing 747 large ships and set production records. The home front changed Richmond from a predominantly rural community of 23,600 residents to a diverse population of over 100,000 people within a year. Industries operated around the clock and public housing, schools, day care centers, health care and merchants mobilized to support the new workforce that arrived on the city's doorstep. Fortunately, Richmond's turbulent and productive home front years were well chronicled and photographed. The National Park Service provides interpretive services and operates a Visitor Center in a former utility building next to the Ford Assembly Building.\nRichmond also has number of local parks and two large regional parks are under the authority of the East Bay Regional Parks District, a consortium of most of the Parks and Recreation lands and facilities of Alameda and Contra Costa County.\nWildcat Canyon Regional Park is the city's largest park at . The park once housed a dance hall and roller rink and has distinctive stonework throughout, which was the rationale for its placement on the National Register of Historic Places. It features San Pablo Creek, trails, forests, horseback riding, picnic areas, and a play structure for children, as well as horses for rent and mountain biking trails. High school students practice cross-country in the park. It is situated in the eastern Richmond hills and stretches into Berkeley's Tilden Regional Park in Alameda County. The park has diverse animal and plant life including great horned owls, opossums, king snakes, rubber boas, turkey vultures and many others.\nPoint Isabel Regional Shoreline is the largest off-leash dog park in the United States.\nThe Richmond Greenway is a project costing millions of dollars to transform an old rail line into a walking, jogging, and biking trail. It will span east to west from the end of the Ohlone Trail that follows the BART line from El Cerrito to Berkeley. It will also follow the BART line to Richmond station and continue to Point Richmond. Pedestrian bridges will be used to cross major avenues such as San Pablo Avenue and 23rd Street. An additional side project will add a bike lane/bike trail between the Richmond Greenway and the Ohlone trail at Potrero Avenue via 23rd Street, Carlson Boulevard, Cutting Boulevard, and Potrero. It is currently under construction.\nRichmond is home to four marinas: the Brickyard Cove Yacht Club, Point San Pablo Yacht Club, Marina Bay Marina, and Channel Marina in the Santa Fe channel.

Bear Transit provides commuter and student service from El Cerrito del Norte BART station and UC Berkeley to the UC Field Station in Campus Bay on route RFS. Several regional bus operators serve El Cerrito del Norte station (just south of Richmond) rather than Richmond station because of the former station's proximity to I-80.\nBefore AC Transit and BART, the Key System provided a network of several rail lines on the East Shore and Suburban Railway.\nCommercial and cargo rail.\nThe Union Pacific Railroad (UP) has a mainline passing through Richmond. This line was formerly operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP).\nThe BNSF Railway (BNSF) has a yard and that serves as the Northern California terminus of their line that goes to their main classification yard at Barstow via the San Joaquin Valley.

The voyage took approximately 45 minutes each way. The service began in 1999, but was discontinued in the late 2000s in the economic downturn following the dot-com bust. Ferry ridership plummeted and the service became economically unsustainable, which led Red and White Fleet to discontinue the service. The Richmond ferry terminal is at Ford Point located adjacent to the historic Ford Plant in Marina Bay which is now open as an industrial park and under renovation. The terminal had its own dedicated AC Transit feeder service from Point Richmond and downtown Richmond with route 374 also now discontinued. A new ferry service from Richmond is planned for 2018 by the San Francisco Bay Area Water Transit Authority. The new ferry will take only half an hour to San Francisco and will use the existing terminal and parking facilities at Ford Point in Marina Bay. The San Francisco Bay Ferry relaunched ferry service to the San Francisco Ferry Building in January 2019.\nPedestrian and bike lanes.\nThe city has aggressively developed its portions of the San Francisco Bay Trail and has more than any other city at present.

Traditionally, he and his half-brother Vasubandhu are regarded as the major classical Indian Sanskrit exponents of Mahayana Abhidharma, \"Vij\u00f1anavada\" (awareness only; also called \"Vij\u00f1aptiv\u0101da\", the doctrine of ideas or percepts, and \"Vij\u00f1aptim\u0101trat\u0101-v\u0101da\", the doctrine of 'mere representation) thought and Mahayana teachings on the bodhisattva path. He is also traditionally considered as one of the seventeen Nalanda masters who taught at the monastery which is located in modern-day Bihar.\nBiography.\nThere are differing views as to Asa\u1e45ga's birthplace. Some sources record that he was born in Puru\u1e63apura (present day Peshawar in Pakistan) in a Brahmin family, which at that time was part of the ancient kingdom of Gandh\u0101ra. However the writings of Buton Rinchen Drub state that Asanga and his brother, Vasubandhu, were born in Central India. Current scholarship places him in the fourth century CE. He was perhaps originally a member of the Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka school or the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school but later converted to Mah\u0101y\u0101na. According to some scholars, Asa\u1e45ga's frameworks for Abhidharma writings retained many underlying Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka traits, but other scholars argue that there is insufficient data to determine which school he originally belonged to.\nIn the record of his journeys through the kingdoms of India, Xuanzang wrote that Asa\u1e45ga was initially a Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka monk, but soon turned toward the Mah\u0101y\u0101na teachings. Asa\u1e45ga had a half-brother, Vasubandhu, who was a monk from the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school. Vasubandhu is said to have taken up Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism after meeting with Asa\u1e45ga and one of Asa\u1e45ga's disciples.\nAsa\u1e45ga spent many years in serious meditation and study under various teachers but the narrative of the 6th century monk Param\u0101rtha states that he was unsatisfied with his understanding. Param\u0101rtha then recounts how he used his meditative powers (siddhis) to travel to Tu\u1e63ita Heaven to receive teachings from Maitreya Bodhisattva on emptiness, and how he continued to travel to receive teachings from Maitreya on the Mahayana sutras.\nXuanzang (fl. c. 602 \u2013 664), a Chinese monk who traveled to India to study in the Yogacara tradition tells a similar account of these events:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the great mango grove five or six \"li\" to the southwest of the city (Ayodhya), there is an old monastery where Asa\u1e45ga Bodhisattva received instructions and guided the common people. At night he went up to the place of Maitreya Bodhisattva in Tu\u1e63ita Heaven to learn the ', the ', the \"\", etc.; in the daytime, he lectured on the marvelous principles to a great audience.Modern scholars disagree on whether the figure of Maitreya in this story is to be considered as Asa\u1e45ga's human teacher or as a visionary experience in meditation. Scholars such as Frauwallner held that this figure, sometimes termed Maitreya-n\u0101tha, was an actual historical person and teacher. Other scholars argue that this figure was the tutelary deity of Asa\u1e45ga (\"I\u1e63\u1e6da-devat\u0101\") as well as numerous other Yogacara masters, a point noted by the 6th century Indian monk Sthiramati. Whatever the case, Asa\u1e45ga's experiences led him to travel around India and propagate the Mahayana teachings. According to Taranatha's \"History of Buddhism in India\", he founded 25 Mahayana monasteries in India.\nAmong the most famed monasteries that he established was Veluvana in Magadha region of what is now Bihar. It was here that he hand-picked eight chosen disciples who would all become famed in their own right and spread the Mahayana.\nWorks.\nAsa\u1e45ga went on to write some key treatises (shastras) of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school. Over time, many different works were attributed to him (or to Maitreya, with Asa\u1e45ga as transmitter), although there are discrepancies between the Chinese and Tibetan traditions concerning which works are attributed to him. Modern scholars have also problematized and questioned these attributions after critical textual study of the sources. The many works attributed to this figure can be divided into the three following groups.\nThe first are three works which are widely agreed by ancient and modern scholars to be by Asa\u1e45ga:\nThe Maitreya Corpus.\nThe next group of texts are those that Tibetan hagiographies state were taught to Asa\u1e45ga by Maitreya and are thus known as the \"Five Dharmas of Maitreya\" in Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism. According to D.S. Ruegg, the \"five works of Maitreya\" are mentioned in Sanskrit sources from only the 11th century onwards. As noted by S.K. Hookham, their attribution to a single author has been questioned by modern scholars. \nAccording to the Tibetan tradition, the so called Asanga-Maitreya is:\nAccording to Karl Brunnh\u00f6lzl, the Chinese tradition also speaks of five Maitreya-Asanga texts (first mentioned in Dunlun's \"Yujia lunji\"), \"but considers them as consisting of the \"Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi, *Yogavibh\u0101ga\" [now lost], \"Mah\u0101y\u0101nas\u016btr\u0101lamk\u0101rak\u0101\", \"Madhy\u0101ntavibh\u0101ga\" and the \"Vajracchedik\u0101k\u0101vy\u0101khy\u0101.\"\"\nWhile the \"Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi \u015b\u0101stra\" (\"Treatise on the Levels of Spiritual Practitioners\"), a massive and encyclopaedic work on yogic praxis, has traditionally been attributed to Asa\u1e45ga or Maitreya \"in toto\", but most modern scholars now consider the text to be a compilation of various works by numerous authors, and different textual strata can be discerned within its contents. However, Asa\u1e45ga may still have participated in the compilation of this work.\nThe third group of texts associated with Asa\u1e45ga comprises two commentaries: the \"K\u0101rik\u0101saptati\", a work on the \"Vajracchedik\u0101\", and the \"\u0100ryasa\u1e43dhinirmocana-bh\u0101\u1e63ya\" (Commentary on the \"Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana\")\".\" The attribution of both of these to Asa\u1e45ga is not widely accepted by modern scholars."}
