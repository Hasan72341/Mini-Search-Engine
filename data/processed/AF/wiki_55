It is opposed to monarchism in Australia. Republicanism was first espoused in Australia before Federation in 1901. After a period of decline following Federation, the movement again became prominent at the end of the 20th century after successive legal and socio-cultural changes loosened Australia's ties with the United Kingdom.\nIn a referendum held in 1999, Australian voters rejected a proposal to establish a republic with a parliamentary appointed head of state. This was despite polls showing a majority of Australians supported a republic in principle for some years before the vote.\nRepublicanism is officially supported by the Labor Party and the Greens. It is supported by some members of the Liberal Party and other members of the Australian Parliament. Under the first Albanese ministry, there was an assistant minister for the republic from 1 June 2022 until 29 July 2024.\nHistory.\nBefore federation.\nIn his journal \"The Currency Lad\", first published in Sydney in 1832, pastoralist and politician Horatio Wills was the first person to openly espouse Australian republicanism. Born to a convict father, Wills was devoted to the emancipist cause and promoted the interests of \"currency lads and lasses\" (Australian-born Europeans).\nSome leaders and participants of the revolt at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 held republican views and the incident has been used to encourage republicanism in subsequent years, with the Eureka Flag appearing in connection with some republican groups. The Australian Republican Association (ARA) was founded in response to the Eureka Stockade, advocating the abolition of governors and their titles, the revision of the penal code, payment of members of parliament, the nationalisation of land and an independent federal Australian republic outside of the British Empire. David Flint, the national convener of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, notes that a movement emerged in favour of a White Australia policy; however British authorities in Whitehall were opposed to segregational laws. He suggests that to circumvent Westminster, those in favour of the discriminatory policies backed the proposed secession from the Empire as a republic.\nOne attendee of the ARA meetings was the Australian-born poet Henry Lawson, who wrote his first poem, entitled \"A Song of the Republic\", in \"The Republican\" journal.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Banish from under your bonny skiesThose old-world errors and wrongs and lies\u2014\u200a\nFederation and decline.\nAt the Australian Federation Convention, which produced the first draft that was to become the Australian Constitution in 1891, a former Premier of New South Wales, George Dibbs, stated the \"inevitable destiny of the people of this great country\" would be the establishment of \"the Republic of Australia\". The fervour of republicanism tailed off in the 1890s as the labour movement became concerned with the Federation of Australia. The republican movement dwindled further during and after World War I as emotional and patriotic support for the war effort went hand in hand with a renewed sense of loyalty to the monarchy. \"The Bulletin\" abandoned republicanism and became a conservative, Empire loyalist paper. The Returned and Services League formed in 1916 and became an important bastion of monarchist sentiment.\nThe conservative parties were fervently monarchist and although the Labor Party campaigned for greater Australian independence within the Empire and generally supported the appointment of Australians as Governor-General, it did not question the monarchy itself. Under the Labor government of John Curtin, a member of the Royal Family, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, was appointed Governor-General during World War II. The royal tour of Queen Elizabeth II in 1954 saw a reported 7 million Australians (out of a total population of 9\u00a0million) out to see her.\nThe 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, which culminated in the dismissal of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam by Governor-General John Kerr, raised questions about the value of maintaining a supposedly symbolic office that still possessed many key constitutional powers and what an Australian president with the same reserve powers would do in a similar situation.\nChanges to oaths and titles.\nReferences to the monarchy were removed from various institutions through the late 1980s and 1990s. For example, in 1993, the Oath of Citizenship, which included an assertion of allegiance to the Australian monarch, was replaced by a pledge to be loyal to \"Australia and its people\". Earlier, in 1990, the formula of enactment for the Parliament of Australia was changed from \"Be it enacted by the Queen, and the Senate, and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia as follows\" to \"The Parliament of Australia enacts\".\nBarristers in New South Wales (from 1993), Queensland (from 1994), ACT (from 1995), Victoria (from 2000), Western Australia (from 2001), Tasmania (from 2005), Northern Territory (from 2007), Commonwealth (from March 2007) and South Australia (from 2008) were no longer appointed Queen's Counsel (QC), but as Senior Counsel (SC). These changes were criticised by Justice Michael Kirby and other monarchists as moves to a \"republic by stealth\". However beginning with Queensland in 2013, Victoria and the Commonwealth in 2014 and followed by South Australia in 2020 the title of Queen's Counsel (QC) and now King's Counsel (KC) has again been conferred, in part due to the title's greater regard and recognition, internationally and domestically. There remains interest in New South Wales for a reintroduction of the title. In 2024, South Australia reverted back to only appointing SCs.\nKeating government proposals.\nThe Australian Labor Party (ALP) first made republicanism its official policy in 1991, with then Prime Minister Bob Hawke describing a republic as \"inevitable\". Following the ALP decision, the Australian Republican Movement (ARM) was born. Hawke's successor, Paul Keating, pursued the republican agenda much more actively than Hawke and established the Republic Advisory Committee to produce an options paper on issues relating to the possible transition to a republic to take effect on the centenary of Federation: 1 January 2001. The committee produced its report in April 1993 and in it argued that \"a republic is achievable without threatening Australia's cherished democratic institutions\".\nIn response to the report, Keating promised a referendum on the establishment of a republic, replacing the Governor-General with a president, and removing references to the Australian sovereign. The president was to be nominated by the prime minister and appointed by a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of the Senate and House of Representatives. The referendum was to be held either in 1998 or 1999. However, Keating's party lost the 1996 federal election in a landslide and he was replaced by John Howard, a monarchist, as prime minister.\n1998 Constitutional Convention.\nWith the change in government in 1996, Prime Minister John Howard proceeded with an alternative policy of holding a constitutional convention. This was held over two weeks in February 1998 at Old Parliament House. Half of the 152 delegates were elected and half were appointed by the federal and state governments. Convention delegates were asked whether or not Australia should become a republic and which model for a republic is preferred. At the opening of the convention, Howard stated that if the convention could not decide on a model to be put to a referendum, then plebiscites would be held on the model preferred by the Australian public.\nAt the convention, a republic gained majority support (89 votes to 52 with 11 abstentions), but the question of what model for a republic should be put to the people at a referendum produced deep divisions among republicans. Four republican models were debated: two involving direct election of the head of state; one involving appointment on the advice of the prime minister (the McGarvie Model); and one involving appointment by a two-thirds majority of parliament (the bi-partisan appointment model).\nThe latter was eventually successful at the convention, even though it only obtained a majority because of 22 abstentions in the final vote (57 against delegates voted against the model and 73 voted for, three votes short of an actual majority of delegates). A number of those who abstained were republicans who supported direct election (such as Ted Mack, Phil Cleary, Clem Jones, and Andrew Gunter), thereby allowing the bi-partisan model to succeed. They reasoned that the model would be defeated at a referendum and a second referendum called with direct election as the model.\nThe convention also made recommendations about a preamble to the constitution and a proposed preamble was also put to referendum.\nAccording to critics, the two-week timeline and quasi-democratic composition of the convention is evidence of an attempt by John Howard to frustrate the republican cause, a claim John Howard adamantly rejects.\n1999 Republican referendum.\nThe republic referendum was held on 6 November 1999, after a national advertising campaign and the distribution of 12.9\u00a0million 'Yes/No' case pamphlets. It comprised two questions: The first asked whether Australia should become a republic in which the Governor-General and monarch would be replaced by one office, the President of the Commonwealth of Australia, the occupant elected by a two-thirds vote of the Australian parliament for a fixed term. The second question, generally deemed to be far less important politically, asked whether Australia should alter the constitution to insert a preamble. Neither of the amendments passed, with 55% of all electors and all states voting 'no' to the proposed amendment; it was not carried in any state. The preamble referendum question was also defeated, with a Yes vote of only 39 per cent.\nMany opinions were put forward for the defeat, some relating to perceived difficulties with the parliamentary appointment model, others relating to the lack of public engagement or that most Australians were simply happy to keep the status quo. Some republicans voted no because they did not agree with provisions such as the president being instantly dismissible by the prime minister.\n2000s: Following the referendum.\nOn 26 June 2003, the Senate referred an inquiry into an Australian republic to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. During 2004, the committee reviewed 730 submissions and conducted hearings in all state capitals. The committee tabled its report, called \"Road to a Republic\", on 31 August 2004. The report examined the contest between minimalist and direct-election models and gave attention to hybrid models such as the electoral college model, the constitutional council model, and models having both an elected president and a Governor-General.\nThe bi-partisan recommendations of committee supported educational initiatives and holding a series of plebiscites to allow the public to choose which model they preferred, prior to a final draft and referendum, along the lines of plebiscites proposed by John Howard at the 1998 constitutional convention.\nIssues related to republicanism were raised by the March 2006 tour of Australia by Queen Elizabeth II. John Howard, still serving as prime minister, was then questioned by British journalists about the future of the Australian monarchy and there was debate about playing Australia's royal anthem, \"God Save the Queen\", during the opening of that year's Commonwealth Games, at which the monarch was present.\nIn July 2007, Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd pledged to hold a new referendum on a republic if called on to form a government. However, he stated there was no fixed time frame for such a move and that the result of the 1999 referendum must be respected. After his party won the 2007 federal election and Rudd was appointed prime minister, he stated in April 2008 that a move to a republic was \"not a top-order priority\".\nIn the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated: \"I believe that this nation should be a republic. I also believe that this nation has got a deep affection for Queen Elizabeth.\" She stated her belief that it would be appropriate for Australia to become a republic only once Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.\n2010s.\nIn November 2013, Governor-General Quentin Bryce proclaimed her support for an Australian republic, stating in a speech \"perhaps, my friends, one day, one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation's first head of state\". She had previously emphasised the importance of debate about the future of the Australian head of state and the evolution of the constitution.\nIn January 2015, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten called for a new push for a republic, stating: \"Let us declare that our head of state should be one of us. Let us rally behind an Australian republic - a model that truly speaks for who we are, our modern identity, our place in our region and our world.\"\nIn September 2015, former ARM chair Malcolm Turnbull became leader of the Liberal Party and was appointed prime minister. He stated he would not pursue \"his dream\" of Australia becoming a republic until after the end of the Queen's reign, instead focusing his efforts toward the economy. Upon meeting Elizabeth II in July 2017, Turnbull declared himself an \"Elizabethan\" and stated he did not believe a majority of Australians would support a republic before the end of her reign.\nIn December 2016, News.com.au found that a slim majority of members of both houses of parliament supported Australia becoming a republic (54% in the House and 53% in the Senate).\nIn July 2017, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten revealed that, should the Labor Party be elected in the 2019 federal election, they would legislate for a compulsory plebiscite on the issue. Should that plebiscite be supported by a majority of Australians, a second vote would be held, this time a referendum, asking the public for their support for a specific model of government. Labor lost the election.\n2020s.\nFollowing Labor's victory in the 2022 federal election, the new Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, appointed Matt Thistlethwaite as the Assistant Minister for the Republic, signalling a commitment to prepare Australia for a transition to republic following the next election. After the death of Elizabeth\u00a0II, former prime minister Julia Gillard opined that Australia would inevitably choose to be a republic, but agreed with Albanese's timing on debate about the matter. When asked if he supported another referendum following the Queen's death, Albanese stated it was \"not the time\" to discuss a republic. Instead the government had focused on the referendum to enshrine an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, which has been described by the assistant minister as a \"critical first step\" before a vote possibly some time in 2026. The Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had stated: \"I couldn't envisage a circumstance where we changed our head of state to an Australian head of state but still didn't recognise First Nations people in our constitution.\" \nAfter the Voice referendum failed, the government began to prioritise immediate economic policy over constitutional reforms, leading to concern from some republican leaders that a chance to hold another referendum would be delayed for a generation. In January 2024, the Labor government confirmed that a referendum was no longer a priority, however a break with the monarchy was still long-term party policy. \nOn 28 July 2024, the position of assistant minister for the republic, which was first established on 1 June 2022, was abolished in a ministerial reshuffle.\nOn 13 May 2025, following the Coalition's defeat at the 2025 federal election, Sussan Ley and Ted O'Brien were elected as leader and deputy leader of the Liberal Party, respectively. Ley has previously declared her support for a republic, while O'Brien served as Chair of the Australian Republic Movement between 2005 and 2007.\nIn September 2025, Albanese officially ruled out holding a referendum while he is prime minister.\nArguments for change.\nIndependence and head of state.\nA central argument made by Australian republicans is that, as Australia is an independent country, it is inappropriate and anomalous for Australia to share the person of its monarch with the United Kingdom. Republicans argue that the Australian monarch is not Australian and, as a national and resident of another country, cannot adequately represent Australia or Australian national aspirations, either to itself or to the rest of the world. Former Chief Justice Gerard Brennan stated that \"so long as we retain the existing system our head of state is determined for us essentially by the parliament at Westminster\". As ARM member Frank Cassidy put it in a speech on the issue: \"In short, we want a resident for President.\"\nMulticulturalism.\nSome republicans associate the monarchy with British identity and argue that Australia has changed demographically and culturally, from being \"British to our bootstraps\", as prime minister Sir Robert Menzies once put it, to being less British in nature (albeit maintaining an \"English Core\"). Many Australian republicans are of non-British ancestry, and feel no connection to the \"mother country\" to speak of. According to an Australian government inquiry, arguments put forth by these republicans include the claim that the idea of one person being both monarch of Australia and of the United Kingdom is an anomaly.\nHowever, monarchists argue that immigrants who left unstable republics and have arrived in Australia since 1945 welcomed the social and political stability that they found in Australia under a constitutional monarchy. Further, some Aboriginal Australians, such as former Senator Neville Bonner, said a republican president would not \"care one jot more for my people\".\nSocial values and contemporary Australia.\nFrom some perspectives, it has been argued that several characteristics of the monarchy are in conflict with modern Australian values. The hereditary nature of the monarchy is said to conflict with egalitarianism and dislike of inherited privilege. The laws of succession were, before amendment to them in 2015, held by some to be sexist and the links between the monarchy and the Church of England inconsistent with Australia's secular character.\nSectarianian divides.\nUnder the Act of Settlement, the monarch is prohibited from being a Catholic. Monarchism and republicanism in Australia have been claimed to delineate historical and persistent sectarian tensions with, broadly speaking, Catholics more likely to be republicans and Protestants more likely to be monarchists. This developed out of a historical cleavage in 19th- and 20th-century Australia, in which republicans were predominantly of Irish Catholic background and loyalists were predominantly of British Protestant background. Whilst mass immigration since the Second World War has diluted this conflict, the Catholic\u2013Protestant divide has been cited as a dynamic in the republic debate, particularly in relation to the referendum campaign in 1999. Nonetheless, others have stated that Catholic\u2013Protestant tensions\u2014at least in the sense of an Irish\u2013British conflict\u2014are at least forty years dead.\nIt has also been claimed, however, that the Catholic\u2013Protestant divide is intermingled with class issues. Republicanism in Australia has traditionally been supported most strongly by members of the urban working class with Irish Catholic backgrounds, whereas monarchism is a core value associated with urban and rural inhabitants of British Protestant heritage and the middle class, to the extent that there were calls in 1999 for 300,000 exceptionally enfranchised British subjects who were not Australian citizens to be barred from voting on the grounds that they would vote as a loyalist bloc in a tight referendum.\nProposals for change.\nA typical proposal for an Australian republic provides for the King and Governor-General to be replaced by a president or an executive federal council. There is much debate on the appointment or election process that would be used and what role such an office would have.\nAustralians for Constitutional Monarchy and the Australian Monarchist League argue that no model is better than the present system and argue that the risk and difficulty of changing the constitution is best demonstrated by inability of republicans to back a definitive design.\nThe range of models.\nAustralian republicans usually propose that the Governor-General is replaced by an Australian Head of State. They have proposed or shown support for a variety of methods for selecting and/or electing such a Head of State as follows: \nAlternatively, some proposals provide for replacing only the monarchy and entirely retaining the role of Governor-General. The McGarvie model replaces the monarch with a constitutional council of former governors and judges. Copernican models replace the monarch with a directly elected figurehead, without executive authority. These models maintain the executive authority and reserve powers of the current Governor-General, appointed by the council or elected figurehead respectively.\nOccasionally, it is proposed to abolish the roles of the Governor-General and the monarchy and have their functions exercised by other constitutional officers such as the speaker.\n2022 Australian Choice Model.\nSince 2022, the ARM has supported the Australian Choice Model, which they developed after consultation with more than 10,000 Australians. Originating in a 2004 Senate submission and 2018 book, the current model proposes that state, territory and Federal parliaments nominate eleven candidates which are then put to a national vote. The model aims to bridge a longstanding controversy of whether the parliament or people should elect a head of state.\nThe model includes specific constitutional amendments drafted and supported by ten constitutional law scholars. The proposed amendments codify the reserve powers of the Head of State with some variance from how they are exercised presently. The ARM claims that their research shows that their approach has significantly higher levels of support in the Australian community than direct election or parliamentary appointment models and would have the best prospects of success at a referendum.\nProcess models.\nFrom its foundation until the 1999 referendum, the ARM supported the bi-partisan appointment model, which would result in a President elected by the Parliament of Australia, with the powers currently held by the Governor-General. It is argued that the requirement of a two-thirds majority in a vote of both houses of parliament would result in a bi-partisan appointment, preventing a party politician from becoming president.\nFrom 2010 to 2022, the ARM proposed a non-binding plebiscite to decide the model, followed by a binding referendum to amend the Constitution, reflecting the model chosen. Opponents of holding non-binding plebiscites include monarchist David Flint, who described this process as \"inviting a vote of no confidence in one of the most successful constitutions in the world,\" and minimalist republican Greg Craven, who states \"a multi-option plebiscite inevitably will produce a direct election model, precisely for the reason that such a process favours models with shallow surface appeal and multiple flaws. Equally inevitably, such a model would be doomed at referendum.\"\nPublic opinion.\nPolls and surveys generate different responses depending on the wording of the questions, mostly in regards the type of republic, and often appear contradictory.\nIn 2009, the Australian Electoral Survey that is conducted following all elections by the Australian National University has found that support for a republic has remained reasonably static since 1987 at around 60%, if the type of republic is not part of the question. The survey also shows that support or opposition is relatively weak: 31% strongly support a republic while only 10% strongly oppose. Roy Morgan research has indicated that support for the monarchy has been supported by a majority of Australians since 2010, with support for a republic being in the majority between 1999 and 2004.\nAn opinion poll held in November 2008 that separated the questions found support for a republic at 50% with 28% opposed. Asked how the president should be chosen if there were to be a republic, 80 percent said elected by the people, against 12 percent who favoured appointment by parliament. In October 2009, another poll by UMR found 59% support for a republic and 33% opposition. 73% supported direct election, versus 18% support for parliamentary appointment.\nOn 29 August 2010, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" published a poll produced by Nielsen, asking multiple questions on the future of the monarchy:\nBut when asked which of the following statements best described their view:\nA survey of 1,000 readers of \"The Sun-Herald\" and \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", published in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" on 21 November 2010, found 68% of respondents were in favour of Australia becoming a republic, while 25% said it should not. More than half the respondents, 56%, said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible while 31% said it should happen after the Queen dies.\nHowever, an opinion poll conducted in 2011 saw a sharp decline in the support for an Australian republic. The polling conducted by the Morgan Poll in May 2011 showed the support for the monarchy was now 55% (up 17% since 1999), whereas the support for a republic was at 34% (down 20%). The turnaround in support for a republic has been called the \"strange death of Australian republicanism\".\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation's \"Vote Compass\" during the 2013 Australian federal election found that 40.4% of respondents disagreed with the statement \"Australia should end the monarchy and become a republic\", whilst 38.1% agreed (23.1% strongly agreed) and 21.5% were neutral. Support for a republic was highest among those with a left-leaning political ideology. Younger people had the highest rate for those neutral towards the statement (27.8%) with their support for strongly agreed the lowest of all age groups at 17.1%. Support for a republic was highest in the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria and lowest in Queensland and Western Australia. More men than women said they support a republic.\nIn early 2014, a ReachTEL poll of 2,146 Australian conducted just after Australia Day showed only 39.4% supported a republic with 41.6% opposed. Lowest support was in the 65+ year cohort followed by the 18\u201334-year cohort. ARM chair Geoff Gallop said higher support for a republic among Generation X and baby boomer voters could be explained by them having participated in the 1999 referendum and remembering the 1975 constitutional crisis.\nIn April 2014, a poll found that \"support for an Australian republic has slumped to its lowest level in more than three decades\"; namely, on the eve of the visit to Australia by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince George, 42% of those polled agreed with the statement that \"Australia should become a republic\", whereas 51% opposed.\nARM commissioned a poll to be conducted by Essential Research from 5 to 8 November in 2015, asking \"When Prince Charles becomes King of Australia, will you support or oppose replacing the British monarch with an Australian citizen as Australia's head of state?\" Of the 1008 participants, 51% said they would prefer an Australian head of state to \"King Charles\", 27% opposed and 22% were undecided.\n\"The Australian\" has polled the same question \"Are you personally in favour or against Australia becoming a republic?\" multiple times since 1999. After Australia Day 2016 they found 51% support. This level of support was similar to levels found between 1999 and 2003 by the same newspaper. Total against was 37% which was an increase over the rates polled in all previous polls other than 2011. Uncommitted at 12% was the lowest ever polled. However support for a republic was again lowest in the 18\u201334-year cohort.\nIn November 2018, Newspoll found support for a republic had collapsed to 40%. It was also the first time in their polling since the 1999 referendum that support for the monarchy was higher than a republic. A July 2020 YouGov poll found 62% of Australians believed Australia's head of state should be an Australian, not Queen Elizabeth II. An Ipsos poll in January 2021 found support for a republic was 34%, the lowest since 1979. However, one conducted by Ipsos in December 2022 (after the death of the Queen) showed support for a move to a republic had risen to 54%.\nIn October 2024, an opinion poll conducted by Roy Morgan, shortly after the King and Queen's royal tour, showed a dramatic increase in support for the monarchy, with 57 per cent of respondents believing Australia should remain a monarchy.\nIn November 2025, following Prince Andrew's (now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor) titles being removed by King Charles III, republican sentiment rose to 43% while Windsor's negative rating rose to 59%, while 61% of respondents wanted Windsor removed from the line of succession. 29% of respondents had a favourable view of King Charles. A total of 958 people were surveyed.\nParty political positions.\nPolitical party summary\nRepublicanism has a level support in all major political parties. Most parties take a stance on this issue and have developed or implemented policy accordingly. The various positions are as follows:\nLiberal\u2013National Coalition.\nThe Liberal Party espouses both conservative and classically liberal positions. It has no official position on the issue of monarchy, but both republicans and monarchists have held prominent positions within the party.\nProponents of republicanism in the Liberal Party include former prime minister and ARM leader Malcolm Turnbull, former prime minister Malcolm Fraser, former opposition leader John Hewson, former premiers Gladys Berejiklian (of NSW), Mike Baird (of NSW) and Jeff Kennett (of Victoria), former deputy leader Julie Bishop, and former federal treasurers Joe Hockey and Peter Costello.\nSupporters of the status quo include former prime ministers Robert Menzies, Scott Morrison, Tony Abbott (who led Australians for Constitutional Monarchy from 1992 to 1994), John Howard (whose government oversaw the 1999 referendum) and former opposition leaders Peter Dutton, Alexander Downer and Brendan Nelson.\nThe National Party officially supports the status quo, but there have been some republicans within the party, such as former leader Tim Fischer. The Country Liberal Party also supports the status quo, but some republicans have been members of the party, including former leader Gary Higgins.\nUnder then prime minister John Howard, a monarchist, the government initiated a process to settle the republican debate, involving a constitutional convention and a referendum. Howard says the matter was resolved by the failure of the referendum.\nAustralian Labor Party.\nThe Labor Party has supported constitutional change to become a republic since 1991 and has incorporated republicanism into its platform. Labor has proposed a series of plebiscites to restart the republican process. Along with this, Labor spokesperson (and former federal attorney general) Nicola Roxon has previously said that reform will \"always fail if we seek to inflict a certain option on the public without their involvement. This time round, the people must shape the debate\". In the 2019 federal election, Labor's platform included a two-stage referendum on a republic to be held during the next parliamentary term; however, Labor was defeated in the election. \nFollowing Labor's win at the 2022 election, Matt Thistlethwaite was appointed Assistant Minister for the Republic in the First Albanese ministry, reporting to the Attorney-General. It the first time any person had held such a title. The position was abolished following a ministerial reshuffle in 2024.\nAustralian Greens.\nThe Australian Greens are a strong proponent for an Australian republic, and this is reflected in the Greens \"Constitutional Reform &amp; Democracy\" policy. In 2009, the Greens proposed legislation to hold a plebiscite on a republic at the 2010 federal election. The bill was subject to a Senate inquiry, which made no recommendation on the subject, and the proposal was subsequently dropped.\nDemocrats.\nThe Australian Democrats, Australia's third party from the 1970s until the 2000s, strongly supported a move towards a republic through a system of an elected head of state through popular voting.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (\"Master Sun\"), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to a different set of skills or art related to warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years, it was the lead text in an anthology that was formalized as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. \"The Art of War\" remains one of the most influential works on strategy of all time and has shaped both East Asian and Western military theory and thinking. \nThe book contains a detailed explanation and analysis of the 5th-century BC Chinese military, from weapons, environmental conditions, and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Considered one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training throughout the world.\nThe text was first translated into a European language in 1772, when the French Jesuit priest Jean Joseph Marie Amiot produced a French version; a revised edition was published in 1782. A partial translation into English was attempted by British officer Everard Ferguson Calthrop in 1905 under the title \"The Book of War\". The first annotated English translation was completed and published by Lionel Giles in 1910. Military and political leaders such as the Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong, Japanese Takeda Shingen, Vietnamese general V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, and American generals Douglas MacArthur and Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. are all cited as having drawn inspiration from the book. \nHistory.\nText and commentaries.\n\"The Art of War\" is traditionally attributed to an ancient Chinese military general known as Sun Tzu (pinyin: ), meaning 'Master Sun'. Sun Tzu is said to have lived in the 6th century BC, but the earliest parts of \"The Art of War\" probably date to at least 100 years later.\nSima Qian's \"Shiji\", the first of China's \"Twenty-Four Histories\", records an early Chinese tradition that a text on military matters was written by one Sun Wu () from the state of Qi, and that this text had been read and studied by King Hel\u00fc of Wu (r.\u2009514\u00a0\u2013\u00a0495\u00a0BC). This text was traditionally identified with the received \"Master Sun's Art of War\". The conventional view was that Sun Wu was a military theorist from the end of the Spring and Autumn period (776\u2013471\u00a0BC) who fled Qi to the southeastern state of Wu, where he is said to have impressed the king with his ability to quickly train officials, including court women, in military discipline\u2014and to have made Wu's armies powerful enough to challenge the rival state of Chu to Wu's west. This view is still widely held in China.\nThe strategist and warlord Cao Cao in the early 3rd century AD authored the earliest known commentary to the \"Art of War\". Cao's preface makes clear that he edited the text and removed certain passages, but the extent of his changes were unclear historically. \"The Art of War\" appears throughout the bibliographical catalogs of the Chinese dynastic histories, but listings of its divisions and size varied widely.\nAuthorship.\nBeginning around the 12th century, Sun Tzu's historical existence began to be questioned by Chinese scholars, primarily on the grounds that he is not mentioned in the historical classic \"Zuo Zhuan\", which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period. The name \"Sun Wu\" () does not appear in any text prior to the \"Records of the Grand Historian\", and has been suspected to be a made-up descriptive cognomen meaning \"the fugitive warrior\", glossing the surname \"Sun\" as the related term \"fugitive\" ( ), while \"Wu\" ( ) is (1) the ancient Chinese virtue of \"martial, valiant\" and (2) a Jianghuai dialectal synonym of \"knight\", which corresponds to Sunzi's role as the hero's doppelg\u00e4nger in the story of Wu Zixu. In the early 20th century, the Chinese writer and reformer Liang Qichao theorized that the text was actually written in the 4th century BC by Sun Tzu's purported descendant Sun Bin, as a number of historical sources mention a military treatise he wrote.\nIn 1972, the Yinqueshan Han slips were discovered in two Han dynasty (206\u00a0BC\u00a0\u2013 220 AD) tombs near the city of Linyi in Shandong. Among the many bamboo slip writings contained in the tombs, which had been sealed between 134 and 118 BC, were two separate texts: one attributed to \"Sun Tzu\", corresponding to the received text, and another attributed to Sun Bin, which explains and expands upon the earlier \"The Art of War\" by Sunzi. The Sun Bin text's material overlaps with much of the \"Sun Tzu\" text. The two may be \"a single, continuously developing intellectual tradition united under the Sun name\". This discovery showed that much of the historical confusion was due to the fact that there were two texts that could have been referred to as \"Master Sun's Art of War\", not one. The content of the earlier text is about one-third of the chapters of the modern \"The Art of War\", and their text matches very closely. It is now generally accepted that the earlier \"The Art of War\" was completed sometime between 500 and 430\u00a0BC.\nChapters.\n\"The Art of War\" is divided into 13 chapters (or ); the collection is referred to as being one (\"whole\" or alternatively \"chronicle\").\nCultural influence.\nMilitary and intelligence applications.\nAcross East Asia, \"The Art of War\" was part of the syllabus for potential candidates of military service examinations.\nDuring the Sengoku period (c.\u20091467\u20131568), the Japanese Takeda Shingen (1521\u20131573) is said to have become almost invincible in all battles without relying on guns, because he studied \"The Art of War\". The book even gave him the inspiration for his famous battle standard (Wind, Forest, Fire and Mountain), meaning fast as the wind, silent as a forest, ferocious as fire and immovable as a mountain.\nThe translator Samuel B. Griffith offers a chapter on \"Sun Tzu and Mao Tse-Tung\" where \"The Art of War\" is cited as influencing Mao's \"On Guerrilla Warfare\", \"On the Protracted War\" and \"Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War\", and includes Mao's quote: \"We must not belittle the saying in the book of Sun Wu Tzu, the great military expert of ancient China, 'Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a thousand battles without disaster.'\"\nDuring the Vietnam War, some Viet Cong officers extensively studied \"The Art of War\" and reportedly could recite entire passages from memory. General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p successfully implemented tactics described in \"The Art of War\" during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu ending major French involvement in Indochina and leading to the accords which partitioned Vietnam into North and South. General Gi\u00e1p, later the main PVA military commander in the Vietnam War, was an avid student and practitioner of Sun Tzu's ideas.\nOutside East Asia.\nThe United States' defeat in the Vietnam War, more than any other event, brought Sun Tzu to the attention of leaders of U.S. military theory. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, lists \"The Art of War\" as one example of a book that may be kept at a military unit's library. \"The Art of War\" is listed on the US Marine Corps Professional Reading Program (formerly known as the Commandant's Reading List). It is recommended reading for all United States Military Intelligence personnel. \"The Art of War\" is also used as instructional material at the United States Military Academy (commonly known as West Point), in the course Military Strategy (470). It is also recommended reading for Officer cadets at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Some notable military leaders have stated the following about Sun Tzu and \"The Art of War\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I always kept a copy of The Art of War on my desk. \u2013 General Douglas MacArthur, 5 Star General and Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have read The Art of War by Sun Tzu. He continues to influence both soldiers &amp; politicians. \u2013 General Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisor, and Secretary of State.\nAccording to some authors, the strategy of deception from \"The Art of War\" was studied and widely used by the KGB: \"I will force the enemy to take our strength for weakness, and our weakness for strength, and thus will turn his strength into weakness\".\nApplication outside the military.\nSome of the book's admirers claim that it has a variety of applications in a myriad of competitive non-military endeavors across the modern world including espionage, culture, politics, business, and sports.\nSome business books have claimed to see metaphorical parallels from The Art of War to office politics and corporate business strategy. Some Japanese companies make the book required reading for their key executives. Entrepreneurs and corporate executives have turned to it for inspiration and advice on how to succeed in competitive business situations. The book has also been applied to the field of education.\n\"The Art of War\" has been the subject of legal books and legal articles on the trial process, including negotiation tactics and trial strategy.\nThe book \"The 48 Laws of Power\" by Robert Greene has many quotations from \"The Art of War\".\n\"The Art of War\" has also been applied in sports. National Football League coach Bill Belichick, record holder of the most Super Bowl wins in history, has stated on multiple occasions his admiration for \"The Art of War\". Brazilian association football coach Luiz Felipe Scolari actively used \"The Art of War\" for Brazil's successful 2002 World Cup campaign. During the tournament Scolari put passages of \"The Art of War\" underneath his players' doors at night.\n\"Playing To Win\" by David Sirlin analyses applications of the ideas from \"The Art of War\" in modern esports. \"The Art of War\" was released in 2014 as an e-book companion alongside the Art of War DLC for Europa Universalis IV, a PC strategy game by Paradox Development Studios, with a foreword by Thomas Johansson.\nFilm and television.\n\"The Art of War\" and Sun Tzu have been referenced and quoted in many movies and television shows, including in the 1987 movie \"Wall Street\", in which Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) frequently references it, and commends his protege, Bud Fox, for being able to quote a relevant passage from memory. The 20th \"James Bond\" film, \"Die Another Day\" (2002) also references \"The Art of War\" as the spiritual guide shared by Colonel Moon and his father. In \"The Sopranos\", season 3, episode 8 (\"He Is Risen\"), Dr. Melfi suggests to Tony Soprano that he read the book.\nIn the \"\" first-season episode \"The Last Outpost\", first officer William Riker quotes \"The Art of War\": \"Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy\". Captain Picard expressed pleasure that Sun Tzu was still taught at Starfleet Academy. Later in the episode, a survivor from a long-dead nonhuman empire noted common aspects between his own people's wisdom and \"The Art of War\" with regard to knowing when and when not to fight.\n\"The Art of War\" is a 2000 action spy film directed by Christian Duguay and starring Wesley Snipes, Michael Biehn, Anne Archer and Donald Sutherland.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65840", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65840", "title": "International Air Transport Association", "text": "International trade association for airlines\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA ) is an airline trade association founded in 1945. IATA has been described as a cartel since, in addition to setting technical standards for airlines, IATA also organized tariff conferences that served as a forum for price fixing.\nAccording to IATA, the trade association represents 317 airlines, including major carriers, from over 120 countries. IATA's member airlines account for carrying approximately 82% (2020) of total available seat miles air traffic. IATA supports airline activity and helps formulate industry policy and standards. It is headquartered in Montreal, Canada.\nHistory.\nIATA was formed in April 1945 in Havana, Cuba. It is the successor to the International Air Traffic Association, which was formed in 1919 at The Hague, Netherlands. At its founding, IATA consisted of 57 airlines from 31 countries. Much of IATA's early work was technical and IATA provided input to the newly created International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which was reflected in the annexes of the Chicago Convention in 1944, the international treaty that still governs international air transport.\nThe Chicago Convention did not result in a consensus on the economic regulation of the airline industry. According to Warren Koffler, IATA was formed to fill the resulting void and provide international air carriers with a mechanism to fix prices.\nIn the late 1940s, IATA started holding conferences to fix prices for international air travel. IATA secretary J.G Gazdik stated that the organization aimed to fix prices at reasonable levels, with due regard being paid to the cost of operations, in order to ensure reasonable profits for airlines.\nIn 1947, at a time when many airlines were government-owned and loss-making, IATA operated as a cartel, charged by the governments with setting a constrained fare structure that avoided price competition. The first Traffic Conference was held in 1947 in Rio de Janeiro and reached unanimous agreement on some 400 resolutions. IATA Director-General William Hildred recounted that about 200 of the resolutions at the Rio de Janeiro conference were related to establishing a uniform structure for tariffs charged for international air transportation.\nThe American Civil Aeronautics Board did not intervene to stop IATA's price fixing, and in 1954 law professor Louis B. Schwartz condemned the board's inaction as an \"abdication of judicial responsibility\". \"The Economist\" lambasted IATA's connivance with governments to fix prices and compared IATA with medieval guilds.\nIn the early 1950s IATA's price fixing regime forced airlines to attempt to differentiate themselves through the quality of their passenger experience. IATA responded by imposing strict limits on the quality of airline service. In 1958, IATA issued a formal ruling barring airlines from serving economy passengers sandwiches with \"luxurious\" ingredients. The economist Walter Adams observed that the limited service competition permitted by IATA tended to merely divert traffic from one air carrier to another without at the same time enlarging the overall air transport market.\nFrom 1956 to 1975, IATA resolutions capped travel agent commissions at 7% of the airline ticket price. Legal scholar Kenneth Elzinga argued that IATA's commission cap harmed consumers by decreasing the incentive for travel agents to offer improved service to consumers.\nBy the late 1970s, IATA's price fixing regime was seen as unattractive by many airlines. As a result, major airlines, like Singapore Airlines and Pan Am, chose to forgo IATA membership.\nMarket share.\nIn 1973, 94% of international scheduled passenger traffic flew on IATA carriers. \nIn 2024, IATA reported that international passenger traffic reached record highs, growing by 13.6% over 2023 figures. IATA member airlines, which represent more than 80% of global air traffic, carried the majority of this international scheduled passenger traffic. Although specific percentages for international traffic alone aren't detailed, IATA's robust membership and global reach suggest that a substantial portion of international scheduled passenger traffic was operated by IATA carriers in 2024.\nMarket control mechanism.\nDuring its time as a cartel, IATA set the fares that IATA carriers charged and enforced them with quasi-governmental powers; it was backed by most relevant governments by making IATA fares a requirement of air service agreements between countries. In the case of the US, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, the now-defunct federal agency that, at the time, regulated almost all US commercial air transport) also provided IATA with a waiver from US antitrust laws. Plus, most IATA airlines were majority government owned and even some privately owned IATA members were under government control. The biggest non-IATA carriers, like Aeroflot, tended to nonetheless charge IATA fares, but a few, such as such as Loftleidir Icelandic, offered below-IATA prices.\nCharter competition.\nThe real competition to the IATA cartel system were the charter carriers, which in 1972 accounted for up to 28% of international traffic, with prices set by supply and demand. IATA \"special fares\" (discounts from standard fares) were mostly a reaction to charter competition. IATA competition with charter carriers was complex and to some degree hypocritical: some IATA carriers had non-IATA subsidiaries offering charters that IATA carriers could not, for example, Lufthansa's Condor subsidiary or Air France's Air Charter International.\nIllegal rebates.\nIATA members engaging in illegal rebating on their IATA-set scheduled fares. In the early 1970s, there were a half billion dollars in annual illegal transatlantic scheduled fare rebates uncovered in a US Department of Justice investigation that resulted in fines and consent decrees from 19 airlines Pan Am, Trans World Airlines and most European flag carriers (e.g. Air France, Lufthansa, British Airways, KLM, etc). The investigation started when a travel agent was discovered entering the US with $80,000 hidden in his socks, which he admitted was a rebate.\nIn 1982, sociologist John Hannigan described IATA as \"the world aviation cartel\". IATA enjoyed immunity from antitrust law in several nations.\nTo prevent Laker Airways from disrupting IATA's price fixing regime, IATA members allegedly conspired to undercut prices on shared routes, seeking to bankrupt Freddie Laker's airline. Laker Airways bankruptcy estate later asserted claims against IATA members under the American Sherman and Clayton antitrust acts.\nIn 2006, the United States Department of Justice adopted an order withdrawing the antitrust immunity of IATA tariff conferences.\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted routine flights around the world. In the immediate aftermath most airlines, because of the physical distancing policies implemented by national governments, reduced their seat loading by eliminating the sale of the middle seat in a row of three. This reduction averaged out to a load factor of 62% normal, well below the IATA industry break-even level of 77%. Fares would need to rise as much as 54% if a carrier were to break even, according to calculations done by the IATA, who posit that because of \"forward-facing seats that prevent face-to-face contact, and ceiling-to-floor air flows that limit the circulation of respiratory droplets\" the risk of transmission is reduced. North American carriers such as WestJet, Air Canada and American Airlines all planned to resume normal pattern sales on 1 July 2020. This industry-driven policy garnered immediate push-back from some Canadians, including those who felt defrauded, while Minister of Transport Marc Garneau noted that the \"on-board spacing requirement is a recommendation only and therefore not mandatory\" while his Transport Canada department listed physical distancing as a prophylactic among the key positive points in a guide prepared for the Canadian aviation industry.\nRegional offices.\nBeyond IATA's Head Office located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, IATA maintains an Executive Office located in Geneva, Switzerland. Major regional offices are situated in: Beijing, Singapore, Amman, Madrid and Miami resulting in a network of as much as 57 global officers overall in 52 locales.\nFocus areas.\nSafety.\nThe main instrument for safety is the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). IOSA has also been mandated at the state level by several countries. In 2017, aviation posted its safest year ever, surpassing the previous record set in 2012. The new global Western-built jet accident rate became the equivalent of one accident every 7.36 million flights. Future improvements will be founded on data sharing with a database fed by a multitude of sources and housed by the Global Safety Information Center. In June 2014, the IATA set up a special panel to study measures to track aircraft in flight in real time. The move was in response to the disappearance without a trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on 8 March 2014.\nSimplifying the Business.\nSimplifying the Business was launched in 2004. This initiative has introduced a number of crucial concepts to passenger travel, including the electronic ticket and the bar coded boarding pass. Many other innovations are being established as part of the Fast Travel initiative, including a range of self-service baggage options.\nAn innovative program, launched in 2012 is New Distribution Capability (NDC). This will replace the pre-Internet EDIFACT messaging standard, which is still the basis of the Global Distribution System (GDS) and travel agent channel, with an XML standard. This will enable the same choices to be offered to high street travel shoppers as are offered to those who book directly through airline websites. A filing with the US Department of Transportation brought over 400 comments.\nEnvironment.\nIATA members and all industry stakeholders have agreed to three sequential environmental goals:\nAt the 2013 IATA annual general meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, members overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution on \"Implementation of the Aviation Carbon-Neutral Growth (CNG2020) Strategy.\" A representative for the European Federation for Transport and Environment criticized the resolution for relying on carbon offsets instead of direct reductions in aviation carbon emissions.\nServices.\nIATA provides consulting and training services in many areas.\nPublications - standards.\nA number of standards are defined under the umbrella of IATA. One of the most important is the IATA DGR for the transport of dangerous goods (HAZMAT) by air.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, extreme fatigue, muscle aches, constipation, slow heart rate, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goiter. Untreated cases of hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or congenital iodine deficiency syndrome.\nWorldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system reacts to the thyroid gland, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in countries with sufficient dietary iodine. Less common causes include previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) levels.\nSalt iodization has prevented hypothyroidism in many populations. Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine treats hypothyroidism. Medical professionals adjust the dose according to symptoms and normalization of the TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. Although an adequate amount of dietary iodine is important, too much may worsen specific forms of hypothyroidism.\nWorldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine-deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, overt hypothyroidism occurs in approximately 0.3\u20130.4% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.3\u20138.5% of people in the United States. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than in men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected. Dogs are also known to develop hypothyroidism, as are cats and horses, albeit more rarely. The word \"hypothyroidism\" is from Greek \"hypo-\" 'reduced', \"thyreos\" 'shield', and \"eidos\" 'form', where the two latter parts refer to the thyroid gland.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nPeople with hypothyroidism often have no or only mild symptoms. Numerous symptoms and signs are associated with hypothyroidism and can be related to the underlying cause, or a direct effect of not having enough thyroid hormones. Many symptoms of hypothyroidism are otherwise common and do not necessarily indicate thyroid problem. Hashimoto's thyroiditis may present with the mass effect of a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). In middle-aged women, the symptoms may be mistaken for those of menopause.\nDelayed relaxation after testing the ankle jerk reflex is a characteristic sign of hypothyroidism and is associated with the severity of the hormone deficit.\nMyxedema coma.\nMyxedema coma is a rare but life-threatening state of extreme hypothyroidism. It may occur in those with established hypothyroidism when they develop an acute illness. Myxedema coma can be the first presentation of hypothyroidism. People with myxedema coma typically have a low body temperature without shivering, confusion, a slow heart rate and reduced breathing effort. There may be physical signs suggestive of hypothyroidism, such as skin changes or enlargement of the tongue.\nPregnancy.\nHypothyroidism when untreated may lead to infertility and an increased risk of miscarriage or infant death around the time of birth, mostly in severe cases of hypothyroidism. Women are affected by hypothyroidism in 0.3\u20130.5% of pregnancies. Subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with birth of the baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.\nChildren.\nNewborn children with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may be larger than expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, poor weight gain, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature, and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6\u201315 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: difficulty with large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.\nIn older children and adolescents, the symptoms of hypothyroidism may include fatigue, cold intolerance, sleepiness, muscle weakness, constipation, a delay in growth, overweight for height, pallor, coarse and thick skin, increased body hair, irregular menstrual cycles in girls, and delayed puberty. Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heartbeat. A goiter may be present with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes only part of the thyroid is enlarged and it can be knobby.\nCauses.\nHypothyroidism is caused by inadequate function of the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the brain's hypothalamus (tertiary hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism is about a thousandfold more common than central hypothyroidism. Central hypothyroidism is the name used for secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism since the hypothalamus and pituitary gland are at the center of thyroid hormone control.\nIodine deficiency is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.\nAfter women give birth, about 5% develop postpartum thyroiditis which can occur up to nine months afterwards. This is characterized by a short period of hyperthyroidism followed by a period of hypothyroidism; 20\u201340% remain permanently hypothyroid.\nAutoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) is associated with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).\nIatrogenic hypothyroidism can be surgical (a result of thyroidectomy, usually for thyroid nodules or cancer) or following radioiodine ablation (usually for Graves' disease).\nPathophysiology.\nThyroid hormone is required for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In healthy individuals, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid hormone receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium\u2013hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) are bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.\nElectrocardiograms are abnormal in both primary overt hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. T3 and TSH are essential for the regulation of cardiac electrical activity. Prolonged ventricular repolarization and atrial fibrillation are often seen in hypothyroidism.\nThe thyroid gland is the only source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process requires iodine and the amino acid tyrosine. The gland takes up iodine in the bloodstream and incorporates it into thyroglobulin molecules. The process is controlled by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), which is secreted by the pituitary. Not enough iodine, or not enough TSH, can decrease thyroid hormone production.\nThe hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013thyroid axis plays a key role in maintaining thyroid hormone levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a negative feedback process. Not enough TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to insufficient TSH release and therefore insufficient thyroid hormone production.\nPregnancy leads to marked changes in thyroid hormone physiology. The gland increases in size by 10%, thyroxine production increases by 50%, and iodine requirements increase. Many women have normal thyroid function but have immunological evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (as evidenced by autoantibodies) or are iodine-deficient, and develop evidence of hypothyroidism before or after giving birth.\nDiagnosis.\nLaboratory testing of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in the blood is considered the best initial test for hypothyroidism; a second TSH level is often obtained several weeks later for confirmation. Levels may be abnormal in the context of other illnesses, and TSH testing in hospitalized people is discouraged unless thyroid dysfunction is strongly suspected as the cause of the acute illness. An elevated TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone, and free T4 levels are then often obtained. Measuring T3 in the assessment for hypothyroidism is discouraged by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). NICE recommends routine T4 testing in children where clinically indicated, and in adults only if central hypothyroidism is suspected or the TSH is abnormal. There are several symptom rating scales for hypothyroidism; they provide a degree of objectivity but have limited use for diagnosis.\nMany cases of hypothyroidism are associated with mild elevations in creatine kinase and liver enzymes in the blood. They typically return to normal when hypothyroidism has been fully treated. Levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein (a) can be elevated; the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less well-defined.\nVery severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma are characteristically associated with low sodium levels in the blood together with elevations in antidiuretic hormone, as well as acute worsening of kidney function due to several causes. For most causes, however, it is unclear if the relationship is causal.\nA diagnosis of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland does not require thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes it more likely that thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.\nCentral.\nIf the TSH level is normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central hypothyroidism (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, respectively). There may be other features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.\nOvert.\nIn overt primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are high and T4 levels are low. Overt hypothyroidism may also be diagnosed in those who have a TSH on multiple occasions of greater than 5mIU/L, appropriate symptoms, and only a borderline low T4. It may also be diagnosed in those with a TSH of greater than 10mIU/L.\nSubclinical.\nSubclinical hypothyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. The incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to be 3-15% and a higher incidence is seen in elderly people, females and those with lower iodine levels. Subclinical hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by autoimmune thyroid diseases, especially Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. In addition to detectable anti-TPO antibodies, other risk factors for conversion from subclinical hypothyroidism to overt hypothyroidism include female sex or in those with higher TSH levels or lower level of normal free T4 levels. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tested more frequently (e.g. every 6 months) compared with those who do not have antibodies.\nPregnancy.\nDuring pregnancy, the thyroid gland must produce 50% more thyroid hormone to provide enough thyroid hormone for the developing fetus and the expectant mother. In pregnancy, free thyroxine levels may be lower than anticipated due to increased binding to thyroxine-binding globulin and decreased binding to albumin. They should either be corrected for the stage of pregnancy, or total thyroxine levels should be used instead for diagnosis. TSH values may also be lower than normal (particularly in the first trimester) and the normal range should be adjusted for the stage of pregnancy.\nIn pregnancy, subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a TSH between 2.5 and 10\u00a0mIU/L with a normal thyroxine level, while those with TSH above 10\u00a0mIU/L are considered to be overtly hypothyroid even if the thyroxine level is normal. Antibodies against TPO may be important in making treatment decisions, and should, therefore, be determined in women with abnormal thyroid function tests. Determination of TPO antibodies may be considered as part of the assessment of recurrent miscarriage, as subtle thyroid dysfunction can be associated with pregnancy loss, but this recommendation is not universal, and the presence of thyroid antibodies may not predict future outcomes.\nPrevention.\nHypothyroidism may be prevented in a population by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization. Encouraged by the World Health Organization, 70% of the world's population across 130 countries are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries due to attempts to reduce salt intake.\nPregnant and breastfeeding women, who require 66% more daily iodine than non-pregnant women, may still not be getting enough iodine. The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 250\u00a0\u03bcg for pregnant and breastfeeding women. As many women will not achieve this from dietary sources alone, the American Thyroid Association recommends a 150\u00a0\u03bcg daily supplement by mouth.\nScreening.\nScreening for hypothyroidism is performed in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This has led to the early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn screening test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early identification of these cases may prevent complications.\nIn adults, widespread screening of the general population is debated. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in all sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease. Guidelines for England and Wales from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend testing for thyroid disease in people with type 1 diabetes and new-onset atrial fibrillation, and suggests testing in those with depression or unexplained anxiety (all ages), in children with abnormal growth, or unexplained change in behavior or school performance. NICE also recommends screening for celiac disease in people with a diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease.\nManagement.\nHormone replacement.\nHypothyroidism is managed by hormone substitution with a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent oversupplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher-than-average dose.\nBlood and TSH levels are monitored to help determine whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4\u20138 weeks after the start of treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. Normalization of TSH does not mean that other abnormalities associated with hypothyroidism improve entirely, such as elevated cholesterol levels.\nIn people with central hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30\u201360 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.\nLiothyronine.\nTreatment with liothyronine (synthetic T3) alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it would need to be taken more often than levothyroxine.\nAdding liothyronine to levothyroxine has been suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but this has not been confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy due to a lack of evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination therapy. Guidelines by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) discourage liothyronine.\nPeople with hypothyroidism who do not feel well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered concerning the chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. The addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use. A 2014 guideline from the American Thyroid Association recommends against the use of liothyronine.\nDesiccated animal thyroid.\nDesiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based thyroid gland extract, most commonly from pigs. It is a combination therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3. It also contains calcitonin (a hormone produced in the thyroid gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are not present in synthetic hormone medication. This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but has been disregarded since the 1970s and its use is unsupported by evidence; British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use, as does NICE.\nSubclinical hypothyroidism.\nThere is no evidence of a benefit from treating subclinical hypothyroidism in those who are not pregnant, and there are potential risks of unnecessary overtreatment. Untreated subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary artery disease when the TSH is over 10\u00a0mIU/L. There may be an increased risk for cardiovascular death. A 2007 review found no benefit of thyroid hormone replacement except for \"some parameters of lipid profiles and left ventricular function\". There is no association between subclinical hypothyroidism and an increased risk of bone fractures, nor is there a link with cognitive decline.\nAmerican guidelines recommend that treatment should be considered in people with symptoms of hypothyroidism, detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, a history of heart disease, or are at an increased risk for heart disease if the TSH is elevated but below 10\u00a0mIU/L. American guidelines further recommend universal treatment (independent of risk factors) in those with TSH levels that are markedly elevated; above 10 mIU/L because of an increased risk of heart failure or death due to cardiovascular disease. NICE recommends that those with a TSH above 10\u00a0mIU/L should be treated in the same way as overt hypothyroidism. Those with an elevated TSH but below 10\u00a0mIU/L who have symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism should have a trial of treatment but intend to stop this if the symptoms persist despite normalization of the TSH.\nMyxedema coma.\nMyxedema coma or severe decompensated hypothyroidism usually requires admission to the intensive care unit, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low to be able to safely swallow medication. While administration through a nasogastric tube is possible, this may be unsafe and is discouraged.\nPregnancy.\nIn women with known hypothyroidism who become pregnant, it is recommended that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first-trimester normal range is below 2.5\u00a0mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0\u00a0mIU/L. Measurement of free T4 in pregnancy is not recommended due to changes in levels of serum protein binding. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.\nWomen with anti-TPO antibodies who are trying to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5\u201310\u00a0mIU/L) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, in the sense that the TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases. Treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy is not conclusively shown to decrease the incidence of miscarriage.\nAlternative medicine.\nThe effectiveness and safety of using Chinese herbal medicines to treat hypothyroidism is not known.\nEpidemiology.\nHypothyroidism is the most frequent endocrine disorder. Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In large population-based studies in Western countries with sufficient dietary iodine, 0.3\u20130.4% of the population have overt hypothyroidism. A larger proportion, 4.3\u20138.5%, have subclinical hypothyroidism. Undiagnosed hypothyroidism is estimated to affect about 4\u20137% of community-derived populations in the US and Europe. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, 80% have a TSH level below the 10\u00a0mIU/L mark regarded as the threshold for treatment. Children with subclinical hypothyroidism often return to normal thyroid function, and a small proportion develops overt hypothyroidism (as predicted by evolving antibody and TSH levels, the presence of celiac disease, and the presence of a goiter).\nWomen are more likely to develop hypothyroidism than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times more likely than men to have TSH levels above 10 mU/L. 2\u20134% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in White people. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.\nVery severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma are rare, with it estimated to occur in 0.22 per million people a year. The majority of cases occur in women over 60 years of age, although it may happen in all age groups.\nMost hypothyroidism is primary in nature. Central/secondary hypothyroidism affects 1:20,000 to 1:80,000 of the population or about one out of every thousand people with hypothyroidism.\nHistory.\nIn 1811, Bernard Courtois discovered iodine was present in seaweed, and iodine intake was linked with goiter size in 1820 by Jean-Francois Coindet. Gaspard Adolphe Chatin proposed in 1852 that endemic goiter was the result of not enough iodine intake, and Eugen Baumann demonstrated iodine in thyroid tissue in 1896.\nThe first cases of myxedema were recognized in the mid-19th century (the 1870s), but its connection to the thyroid was not discovered until the 1880s when myxedema was observed in people following the removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy). The link was further confirmed in the late 19th century when people and animals who had had their thyroid removed showed improvement in symptoms with transplantation of animal thyroid tissue. The severity of myxedema, and its associated risk of mortality and complications, created interest in discovering effective treatments for hypothyroidism. Transplantation of thyroid tissue demonstrated some efficacy, but recurrences of hypothyroidism was relatively common, and sometimes required multiple repeat transplantations of thyroid tissue.\nIn 1891, the English physician George Redmayne Murray introduced subcutaneously injected sheep thyroid extract, followed shortly after by an oral formulation. Purified thyroxine was introduced in 1914 and in the 1930s synthetic thyroxine became available, although desiccated animal thyroid extract remained widely used. Liothyronine was identified in 1952.\nEarly attempts at titrating therapy for hypothyroidism proved difficult. After hypothyroidism was found to cause a lower basal metabolic rate, this was used as a marker to guide adjustments in therapy in the early 20th century (around 1915). However, a low basal metabolic rate was known to be non-specific, also present in malnutrition. The first laboratory test to help assess thyroid status was the serum protein-bound iodine, which came into use around the 1950s.\nIn 1971, the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) radioimmunoassay was developed, which was the most specific marker for assessing thyroid status in patients. Many people who were being treated based on basal metabolic rate, minimizing hypothyroid symptoms, or based on serum protein-bound iodine, were found to have excessive thyroid hormone. The following year, in 1972, a T3 radioimmunoassay was developed, and in 1974, a T4 radioimmunoassay was developed.\nOther animals.\nIn veterinary practice, dogs are the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The majority of cases occur as a result of primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, as well as many other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.\nOther species that are less commonly affected include cats and horses, as well as other large domestic animals. In cats, hypothyroidism is usually the result of other medical treatments such as surgery or radiation. In young horses, congenital hypothyroidism has been reported predominantly in Western Canada and has been linked with the mother's diet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65847", "revid": "5846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65847", "title": "Vitiligo", "text": "Skin condition where patches lose pigment\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nVitiligo ( ) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes patches of skin to lose pigment or color. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but it may be related to immune system changes, genetic factors, stress, or sun exposure, and susceptibility to it may be affected by regional environmental risk factors, especially early in life. Treatment options include topical medications, light therapy, surgery and cosmetics. The condition causes patches of a light peachy color of any size, which can appear on any place on the body; in particular, nonsegmental vitiligo, the common form, tends to progress, affecting more of the skin over time. Vitiligo spots on the skin can also vary in pigmentation over long periods, although they will stay in relatively the same areas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe only sign of vitiligo is the presence of pale, patchy areas of depigmented skin, which tend to occur on the extremities. Some people may experience itching before a new patch appears. The patches are initially small, but often grow and change shape. When skin lesions occur, they are most prominent on the face, hands, and wrists. The loss of skin pigmentation is particularly noticeable around body orifices, such as the mouth, eyes, nostrils, genitalia and umbilicus. Some lesions have increased skin pigment around the edges. Those affected by vitiligo who are stigmatized for their condition may experience depression and similar mood disorders.\nCauses.\nAlthough multiple hypotheses have been suggested as potential triggers that cause vitiligo, studies strongly imply that changes in the immune system are responsible for the condition. Vitiligo has been proposed to be a multifactorial disease with genetic susceptibility and environmental factors both thought to play a role. It is hypothesized that damaging environmental factors can disrupt redox reactions necessary for protein folding, so skin cells may initiate the unfolded protein response which releases cytokines, thus mounting an immune response.\nThe National Institutes of Health states that sometimes an event, like a sunburn, emotional distress, or exposure to a chemical, can trigger or exacerbate the condition. Skin depigmentation in particular areas in vitiligo can also be triggered by mechanical trauma: this is an example of the Koebner phenomenon. Unlike in other skin diseases, this can be caused by daily activities, especially chronic friction on particular areas of the body.\nImmune.\nVariations in genes that are expressed in the immune cells or in the melanocytes have both been associated with vitiligo. It is thought to be caused by the immune system attacking and destroying the melanocytes of the skin. A genome-wide association study found approximately 36 independent susceptibility loci for generalized vitiligo. One of them is the \"TYR\" gene that encodes the protein tyrosinase, which is an enzyme of the melanocytes that catalyzes melanin biosynthesis, and a major autoantigen in generalized vitiligo.\nAutoimmune associations.\nVitiligo is sometimes associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, alopecia areata, systemic lupus erythematosus, and celiac disease.\nAmong the inflammatory products of NLRP1 are caspase 1 and caspase 7, which activate the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2. Interleukin-1\u03b2 and interleukin-18 are expressed at high levels in people with vitiligo. In one of the mutations, the amino acid leucine in the NALP1 protein was replaced by histidine (Leu155\u00a0\u2192\u00a0His). The original protein and sequence are highly conserved in evolution, and are found in humans, chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, and bush babies. Addison's disease (typically an autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands) may also be seen in individuals with vitiligo.\nOxidative stress.\nNumerous whole-exome sequencing studies have demonstrated that vitiligo is associated with polymorphisms in genes involved in the response to oxidative stress, such as CAT, SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, NFE2L2, HMOX1, GST-M1, or GST-T1, supporting the association of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in melanocytes with the induction of an autoimmune response.\nThus, diseases presenting with altered mitochondrial function such as MELAS, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and Kabuki syndrome are associated with increased risk of vitiligo.\nIn line with these observations, genetic alterations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of melanocytes associated with altered mitochondrial function lead to a release of mtDNA that can be detected in the skin of vitiligo patients. This mtDNA can be sensed by the cGAS-STING pathway, resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production promoting the recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Mitochondrial antioxidants, NRF2 inhibitors, and TBK1 inhibitors are emerging as potential therapeutic options to block this cascade of events.\nDiagnosis.\nAn ultraviolet light can be used in the early phase of this disease for identification and to determine the effectiveness of treatment. Using a Wood's light, skin will change colour (fluoresce) when it is affected by certain bacteria, fungi, and changes to pigmentation of the skin.\nClassification.\nClassification attempts to quantify vitiligo have been analyzed as being somewhat inconsistent, while recent consensus has agreed to a system of segmental vitiligo (SV) and non-segmental vitiligo (NSV). NSV is the most common type of vitiligo.\nNon-segmental.\nIn non-segmental vitiligo (NSV), there is usually some form of symmetry in the location of the patches of depigmentation. New patches also appear over time and can be generalized over large portions of the body or localized to a particular area. Extreme cases of vitiligo, to the extent that little pigmented skin remains, are referred to as \"vitiligo universalis\". NSV can occur at any age (unlike segmental vitiligo, which is far more prevalent in teenage years).\nClasses of non-segmental vitiligo include the following:\nSegmental.\nSegmental vitiligo (SV) differs in appearance, cause, and frequency of associated illnesses. Its treatment is different from that of NSV. It tends to affect areas of skin that are associated with dorsal roots from the spinal cord and is most often unilateral. It is much more stable/static in its course, and its association with autoimmune diseases appears to be weaker than that of generalized vitiligo. SV does not improve with topical therapies or UV light; however, surgical treatments such as cellular grafting can be effective.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nChemical leukoderma is a similar condition due to multiple exposures to chemicals. Vitiligo, however, is a risk factor. Triggers may include inflammatory skin conditions, burns, intralesional steroid injections, and abrasions.\nOther conditions with similar symptoms include the following:\nTreatment.\nThere is no cure for vitiligo, but several treatment options are available. The best evidence is for applied steroids and ultraviolet light in combination with creams. Due to the higher risks of skin cancer, the United Kingdom's National Health Service suggests phototherapy be used only if primary treatments are ineffective. Lesions located on the hands, feet, and joints are the most difficult to repigment; those on the face are easiest to return to the natural skin color as the skin is thinner.\nImmune mediators.\nTopical preparations of immunosuppressing medications, including glucocorticoids (such as 0.05% clobetasol or 0.10% betamethasone) and calcineurin inhibitors (such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus) are considered to be first-line vitiligo treatments.\nIn July 2022, ruxolitinib cream (sold under the brand name Opzelura) was approved for medical use in the United States for the treatment of vitiligo.\nPhototherapy.\nPhototherapy is considered a second-line treatment for vitiligo. Exposing the skin to light from UVB lamps is the most common treatment for vitiligo. The treatments can be done at home with a UVB lamp or in a clinic. The exposure time is managed so that the skin does not suffer overexposure. Treatment can take a few weeks if the spots are on the neck and face, and if they have existed for not more than 3 years. If the spots are on the hands and legs and have been there for more than 3 years, it can take a few months. Phototherapy sessions are done 2\u20133 times a week. Spots on a large area of the body may require full-body treatment in a clinic or hospital. UVB broadband and narrowband lamps can be used, but narrowband ultraviolet peaked around 311\u00a0nm is the choice. It has been consistently reported that a combination of UVB phototherapy with other topical treatments improves re-pigmentation. However, some people with vitiligo may not see any changes to their skin or re-pigmentation occurring. A serious potential side effect involves the risk of developing skin cancer, the same risk as overexposure to natural sunlight.\nUltraviolet light (UVA) treatments are normally carried out in a hospital clinic. Psoralen and ultraviolet A light (PUVA) treatment involves taking a drug that increases the skin's sensitivity to ultraviolet light and then exposing the skin to high doses of UVA light. Treatment is required twice a week for 6\u201312 months or longer. Due to the high doses of UVA and psoralen, PUVA may cause side effects such as sunburn-type reactions or skin freckling.\nNarrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) phototherapy lacks the side effects caused by psoralens and is as effective as PUVA. As with PUVA, treatment is carried out twice weekly in a clinic or every day at home, and there is no need to use psoralen. Longer treatment is often recommended, and at least 6 months may be required for effects to phototherapy. NBUVB phototherapy appears better than PUVA therapy, with the most effective response on the face and neck.\nConcerning improved repigmentation: topical calcineurin inhibitors plus phototherapy are better than phototherapy alone, hydrocortisone plus laser light is better than laser light alone, ginkgo biloba is better than placebo, and oral mini-pulse of prednisolone (OMP) plus NB-UVB is better than OMP alone.\nSkin camouflage.\nIn mild cases, vitiligo patches can be hidden with makeup or other cosmetic camouflage solutions. If the affected person is pale-skinned, the patches can be made less visible by avoiding tanning of unaffected skin.\nDepigmenting.\nIn cases of extensive vitiligo, the option to depigment the unaffected skin with topical drugs like monobenzone, mequinol, or hydroquinone may be considered to render the skin an even color. The removal of all the skin pigment with monobenzone is permanent and vigorous. Sun safety must be adhered to for life to avoid severe sunburn and melanomas. Depigmentation takes about a year to complete.\nHistory.\nDescriptions of a disease believed to be vitiligo date back to a passage in the medical text Ebers Papyrus c.\u20091500 BC in ancient Egypt. Also, the Hebrew word \"Tzaraath\" from the Old Testament book of Leviticus dating to 1280\u00a0BC (or 1312\u00a0BC) described a group of skin diseases associated with white spots, and a subsequent translation to Greek led to continued conflation of those with vitiligo with leprosy and spiritual uncleanliness.\nMedical sources in the ancient world, such as Hippocrates, often did not differentiate between vitiligo and leprosy, often grouping these diseases together. The name \"vitiligo\" was first used by the Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus in his classic medical text \"De Medicina\".\nThe term \"vitiligo\" is believed to be derived from \"vitium\", meaning \"defect\" or \"blemish\".\nSociety and culture.\nThe change in appearance caused by vitiligo can impact a person's emotional and psychological well-being. It may create difficulty in becoming or remaining employed, particularly if vitiligo develops on visible areas of the body, such as the face, hands, or arms. Participating in a vitiligo support group may improve social coping skills and emotional resilience.\nNotable people with vitiligo.\nNotable cases include American pop singer Michael Jackson, American rapper Krizz Kaliko, Canadian fashion model Winnie Harlow, New Zealand singer-songwriter Kimbra, American actor David Dastmalchian and Argentine musician Charly Garc\u00eda. Professional wrestler Bryan Danielson and French actor Micha\u00ebl Youn are also affected, as is former French Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe, Miss Universe Egypt 2024 Logina Salah, former Roman Catholic priest, Governor of Pampanga and TV host Eddie Panlilio, and model and former Miss Colombia 2007 Taliana Vargas.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Adult Swim animated sitcom \"The Boondocks\" satirizes the idea of vitiligo in Uncle Ruckus, one of the show's characters. Ruckus, who is black, frequently claims to be white, often stating that he has \"Re-vitiligo, the opposite of what Michael Jackson had.\" He frequently uses this argument to maintain that he is actually white, leading him to commit delusional and racist antics in nearly every episode.\nResearch.\nAs of July\u00a02013[ [update]], afamelanotide is in phase II and III clinical trials for vitiligo and other skin diseases.\nA medication for rheumatoid arthritis, tofacitinib, has been tested for the treatment of vitiligo.\nIn October 1992, a scientific report was published of successfully transplanting melanocytes to vitiligo-affected areas, effectively repigmenting the region. The procedure involved taking a thin layer of pigmented skin from the person's gluteal region. Melanocytes were then separated out to a cellular suspension that was expanded in culture. The area to be treated was then denuded with a dermabrader and the melanocytes graft applied. Between 70 and 85 percent of people with vitiligo experienced nearly complete repigmentation of their skin. The longevity of the repigmentation differed from person to person.\nCurrent research suggests that the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of the transcription pathway (JAK/STAT pathway) plays a crucial role in the loss of epidermal melanocytes. This pathway is activated by CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells, creating a positive feedback loop with interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) chemokines from keratinocytes, potentially contributing to vitiligo. JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib show promise in targeting the IFN-\u03b3-chemokine signaling axis implicated in vitiligo pathogenesis, and improving nonsegmental vitiligo.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He asserts that friendliness (a desire not to harm humans) should be designed in from the start, but that the designers should recognize both that their own designs may be flawed, and that the robot will learn and evolve over time. Thus the challenge is one of mechanism design\u2014to design a mechanism for evolving AI under a system of checks and balances, and to give the systems utility functions that will remain friendly in the face of such changes.\nIn response to the instrumental convergence concern, which implies that autonomous decision-making systems with poorly designed goals would have default incentives to mistreat humans, Yudkowsky and other MIRI researchers have recommended that work be done to specify software agents that converge on safe default behaviors even when their goals are misspecified. Yudkowsky also proposed in 2004 a theoretical AI alignment framework called coherent extrapolated volition, which involves designing AIs to pursue what people would desire under ideal epistemic and moral conditions.\nCapabilities forecasting.\nIn the intelligence explosion scenario hypothesized by I.

He suggested that participating countries should be willing to take military action, such as \"destroy[ing] a rogue datacenter by airstrike\", to enforce such a moratorium.

A leading figure of modern Chinese literature, he wrote in both vernacular and literary Chinese as a novelist, literary critic, essayist, poet, translator and political commentator, known for his satirical, acerbic tone and critical reflections on Chinese history and culture.\nLu was born into a declining family of landlords and scholar-officials in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Although he initially aspired to take the imperial examinations, his family\u2019s limited financial means compelled him to attend government-funded schools that offered a \"Western-style education.\" After graduation, Lu pursued medical studies at Tohoku University in Japan but eventually dropped out, turning his attention to literature. Financial difficulties forced his return to China, where he taught at various secondary schools and colleges before taking a position at the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China.\nLu pioneered the New Culture Movement by publishing the first novel in vernacular Chinese, \"Diary of a Madman,\" in 1918. He gained prominence through his political writings in \"La Jeunesse\" following the May Fourth Movement in 1919. From the late 1920s onward, Lu became increasingly engaged with Marxist thought and leftist politics. In the 1930s, he served as the nominal leader of the League of Left-Wing Writers in Shanghai. After 1949, he was canonized by the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nLu Xun was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. As was common before the 20th century, Lu used several names. His birth name was \"Zhou Zhangshou\" (). His courtesy name was \"Yushan\" (), which he later changed to \"Yucai\" (). In 1898, before he went to the Jiangnan Naval Academy, he took the given name \"Shuren\" (), which figuratively means \"to be an educated man\". The name \"Lu Xun\", by which he is most well known internationally, was a pen name chosen upon the initial publishing of his story \"Diary of a Madman\" in 1918.\nBy the time Lu Xun was born, the Zhou family had been prosperous for centuries, and had become wealthy through landowning, pawnbroking, and by having several family members promoted to government positions. His paternal grandfather, Zhou Fuqing, was appointed to the Imperial Hanlin Academy in Beijing, the highest position possible for aspiring civil servants at that time.\nZhou's mother was a member of the same landed gentry class as Lu Xun's father, from a slightly smaller town in the countryside (Anqiaotou, Zhejiang; a part of Tongxiang). Because formal education was not considered socially appropriate for girls, she had not received any education, but she still taught herself how to read and write. The surname Lu () was the same as his mother's.\nLu Xun's early education was based on the Confucian classics, in which he studied poetry, history, and philosophy\u2014subjects which, he later reflected, were neither useful nor interesting to him. Instead, he enjoyed folk stories and opera, including the mythological narratives of the \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\" and the ghost stories told to him by a servant when he was a child.\nBy the time Lu Xun was born, his family's prosperity had already been declining. His father, Zhou Boyi, had been successful at passing the county-level imperial examinations, the route to wealth and social success in imperial China, but was unsuccessful in writing the more competitive provincial-level examinations (the \"juren\" exam). In 1893 Zhou was discovered attempting to bribe an examination official. Lu Xun's grandfather was implicated, and was arrested and sentenced to beheading for his son's crime. The sentence was later commuted, and he was imprisoned in Hangzhou instead.\nAfter the affair, Zhou was stripped of his position in the government and forbidden to ever again write the civil service examinations. The Zhou family only prevented Lu's grandfather from being executed through regular, expensive bribes to authorities, until he was finally released in 1901.\nAfter the family's attempt at bribery was discovered, Zhou engaged in heavy drinking and opium use and his health declined. Local doctors attempted to cure him through a series of expensive quack prescriptions, including monogamous crickets, sugar cane that had survived frost three times, ink, and the skin from a drum. Despite these expensive treatments, Zhou died of an asthma attack in 1896, at the age of 35. He might have suffered from dropsy.\nEducation.\nLu Xun half-heartedly participated in the first, district-level civil service examination in 1898, but then abandoned pursuing a traditional Confucian education or career. He intended to study at a prestigious school, the \"Seeking Affirmation Academy\", in Hangzhou, but was forced by his family's poverty to instead study at the \"Jiangnan Naval Academy\", a tuition-free military school in Nanjing.\nAs a consequence of Lu's decision to attend a military school specializing in Western education, his mother wept, he was instructed to change his name to avoid disgracing his family, and some of his relatives began to look down on him. Lu attended the Jiangnan Naval Academy for half a year, and left after it became clear that he would be assigned to work in an engine room, below deck, which he considered degrading. He later wrote that he was dissatisfied with the quality of teaching at the academy.\nAfter leaving the school, Lu Xun sat for the lowest level of the civil service exams, and finished 137th of 500. He intended to sit for the next-highest level, but became upset when one of his younger brothers died, and abandoned his plans.\nLu Xun transferred to another government-funded school, the \"School of Mines and Railways\", and graduated from that school in 1902. The school was Lu's first exposure to foreign literature, philosophy, history, and science, and he studied English and German intensively. Some of the influential authors that he read during that period include T. H. Huxley, John Stuart Mill, Yan Fu, and Liang Qichao. His later social philosophy may have been influenced by several novels about social conflict that he read during the period, including \"Ivanhoe\" and \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".\nLu Xun did well at the school with relatively little effort, and occasionally experienced racism directed at him from resident Manchu bannermen. The racism he experienced may have influenced his later sense of Han Chinese nationalism. After graduating Lu Xun planned to become a foreign doctor.\nIn 1902, Lu Xun left for Japan on a Qing government scholarship to pursue an education in foreign medicine. After arriving in Japan he attended the Kobun Institute, a preparatory language school for Chinese students attending Japanese universities. After encouragement from a classmate, he cut off his queue that Han Chinese were obliged to wear at the time, and practiced jujutsu in his free time. He had an ambiguous attitude towards Chinese revolutionary politics during the period, and it is not clear whether he joined any of the revolutionary parties that were popular among Chinese expatriates in Japan at that time, such as the Tongmenghui. He experienced anti-Chinese racism, but was simultaneously disgusted with the behaviour of some Chinese who were living in Japan. His earliest surviving essays, written in Literary Chinese, were published while he was attending this school, and he published his first Chinese translations of famous and influential foreign novels, including Jules Verne's \"From the Earth to the Moon\" and \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\".\nIn 1904, Lu began studying at the Sendai Medical Academy in northern Honshu, but remained there for less than two years. He generally found his studies at the school tedious and difficult, partially due to his imperfect Japanese. While studying in Sendai he befriended one of his professors, Fujino Genkur\u014d, who helped him prepare class notes. Because of their friendship Lu was accused by his classmates of receiving special assistance from Fujino. Lu later recalled his mentor affectionately in the essay \"Mr Fujino\", published in \"Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk\". The essay has since become one of his most widely renowned works, and is read in the Chinese middle school curriculum. Fujino later reciprocated Lu's respect in an obituary written for Lu after his death in 1937.\nWhile Lu Xun was attending medical school, the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905) broke out.37 Part of the war was fought on disputed Chinese land. Lantern slides used in the classroom also featured news items.37 One news slide showed a public execution of a Chinese prisoner being executed by the Japanese military for being an alleged Russian spy.37 The on-lookers shown in the slide were mainly Chinese, and Lu was shocked by what he viewed as their complete apathy.37 In his preface to \"Nahan\", the first collection of his short stories, Lu explained how viewing this scene influenced him to quit studying Western medicine, and to become a literary physician to what he perceived to be China's spiritual problems instead:\nAt the time, I hadn't seen any of my fellow Chinese in a long time, but one day some of them showed up in a slide. One, with his hands tied behind him, was in the middle of the picture; the others were gathered around him. Physically, they were as strong and healthy as anyone could ask, but their expressions revealed all too clearly that spiritually they were calloused and numb. According to the caption, the Chinese whose hands were bound had been spying on the Japanese military for the Russians. He was about to be decapitated as a 'public example.' The other Chinese gathered around him had come to enjoy the spectacle.\nIn March 1906, Lu Xun abruptly and secretly terminated his pursuit of the degree and left college. At the time he told no one. After arriving in Tokyo he made sure that the Chinese embassy would not cancel his scholarship and registered at the local German Institute, but was not required to take classes there. He began to read Nietzsche, and wrote a number of essays in the period that were influenced by his philosophy.\nIn June 1906, Lu's mother heard a rumor that he had married a Japanese girl and had a child with her, and feigned illness as a pretext to ask Lu to return home, where she would then force him to take part in an arranged marriage she had agreed to several years before. The girl, Zhu An, had little in common with Lu, was illiterate, and had been subject to foot binding. Lu Xun married her, but they never had a romantic relationship. Despite that fact, Lu took care of her material needs for the rest of his life. Several days after the ceremony Lu sailed back to Japan with his younger brother, Zhou Zuoren, and left behind his new wife.\nAfter returning to Japan he took informal classes in literature and history, published several essays in student-run journals, and in 1907 he briefly took Russian lessons. He attempted to found a literary journal with his brother, \"New Life\", but before its first publication its other writers and its financial backers all abandoned the project, and it failed. In 1909 Lu and his brother published their translations of Western fiction, including Edgar Allan Poe, as \"Tales from Abroad\", but the book sold only 41 copies of the 1,500 copies that were printed. The publication failed for a number of reasons: it was only sold in Tokyo, which did not have a large Chinese population, and in a single silk shop in Shanghai. Additionally, Lu wrote in Literary Chinese, which was difficult for ordinary people to read.\nEarly career.\nLu Xun intended to study in Germany in 1909, but did not have sufficient funds, and was forced to return home. Between 1909 and 1911 he held a number of brief teaching positions at local colleges and secondary schools that he felt were unsatisfying, partly to support his brother Zuoren's studies in Japan.\nLu spent these years in traditional Chinese literary pursuits: collecting old books, researching pre-modern Chinese fiction, reconstructing ancient tombstone inscriptions, and compiling the history of his native town, Shaoxing. He explained to an old friend that his activities were not \"scholarship\", but \"a substitute for 'wine and women'\". In his personal letters he expressed disappointment about his own failure, China's political situation, and his family's continuing impoverishment.\nIn 1911 he returned to Japan to retrieve his brother, Zuoren, so that Zuoren could help with the family finances. Zuoren wanted to remain in Japan to study French, but Lu wrote that \"French... does not fill stomachs\". He encouraged another one of his brothers, Jianren, to become a botanist. He began to drink heavily, a habit he continued for the rest of his life. In 1911 he wrote his first short story, \"Nostalgia\", but he was so disappointed with it that he threw it away. Zuoren saved it, and had it successfully published two years later under his own name.\nIn February 1912, shortly after the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty and was followed by the founding of the Republic of China, Lu gained a position at the national Ministry of Education. He was hired in Nanjing, but then moved with the ministry to Beijing, where he lived from 1912 to 1926. At first, his work consisted almost completely of copying books, but he was later appointed Section Head of the Social Education Division, and eventually to the position of Assistant Secretary. Two of his major accomplishments in office were the renovation and expansion of the National Library of China in Beijing, the establishment of the Natural History Museum, and the establishment of the Library of Popular Literature.\nTogether with Qian Daosun and Xu Shoushang, he designed the Twelve Symbols national emblem in 1912.\nBetween 1912 and 1917 he was a member of an ineffectual censorship committee, informally studied Buddhist sutras, lectured on fine arts, wrote and self-published a book on the history of Shaoxing, and edited and self-published a collection of folk stories from the Tang and Song dynasties. He collected and self-published an authoritative book on the work of an ancient poet, Ji Kang, and wrote \"A Brief History of Chinese Fiction\", a work which, because traditional scholars had not valued fiction, had little precedent in China. After Yuan Shikai declared himself the Emperor of China in 1915, Lu was briefly forced to participate in rituals honoring Confucius, which he ridiculed in his diaries.\nIn 1917, an old friend of Lu's, Qian Xuantong, invited Lu to write for \"New Youth\", a radical populist literary magazine that had recently been founded by Chen Duxiu, which also inspired a great number of younger writers such as Mao Dun. At first Lu was skeptical that his writing could serve any social purpose. He told Qian: \"Imagine an iron house without windows, absolutely indestructible, with many people fast asleep inside who will soon die of suffocation. But you know since they will die in their sleep, they will not feel the pain of death. Now if you cry aloud to wake a few of the lighter sleepers, making those unfortunate few suffer the agony of irrevocable death, do you think you are doing them a good turn?\"134 Qian replied, \"But if a few awake, you can't say that there is no hope of destroying the iron house.\" Shortly afterwards, in 1918 Lu wrote the first short story published in his name, \"Diary of a Madman\", for the April 2, 1918 magazine issue.\nLu recounted the conversation in his short story collection, \"Call to Arms\".134 It is widely known in China as a metaphor for the traditional Chinese cultural values and norms that Lu opposed.\nAfter the publication of \"Diary of a Madman\", the story was praised for its anti-traditionalism, its synthesis of Chinese and foreign conventions and ideas, and its skillful narration, and Lu became recognized as one of the leading writers of the New Culture Movement. Lu continued writing for the magazine, and produced his most famous stories for \"New Youth\" between 1917 and 1921. These stories were collected and re-published in \"Nahan\" (\"Outcry\") in 1923.\nIn 1919, Lu moved his family from Shaoxing to a large compound in Beijing, where he lived with his mother, his two brothers, and their Japanese wives. This living arrangement lasted until 1923, when Lu had a falling out with his brother, Zuoren, after which Lu moved with his wife and mother to a separate house. Neither Lu nor Zuoren ever publicly explained the reason for their disagreement, but Zuoren's wife later accused Lu of making sexual advances towards her. Some writers have speculated that their relationship may have worsened as a result of issues related to money, that Lu walked in on Zuoren's wife bathing, or that Lu had an inappropriate \"relationship\" with Zuoren's wife in Japan that Zuoren later discovered. After the falling out with Zuoren, Lu became depressed.\nIn 1920, Lu began to lecture part-time at several colleges, including Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Women's College, where he taught traditional fiction and literary theory. His lecture notes were later collected and published as \"A Brief History of Chinese Fiction\". He was able to work part-time because he only worked at the Education Ministry three days a week for three hours a day. In 1923 he lost his front teeth in a rickshaw accident, and in 1924 he developed the first symptoms of tuberculosis. In 1925 he founded a journal, \"Wilderness\", and established the \"Weiming Society\" in order to support young writers and encourage the translation of foreign literature into Chinese.\nIn the 20 years after the 1911 revolution there was a flowering of literary activity with dozens of journals. The goal was to reform the Chinese language to make universal education possible. Lu Xun was an active participant. His greatest works, such as \"Diary of a Madman\" and \"Ah Q\", exemplify this style of \"peasant dirt literature\" (). The language is fresh and direct. The subjects are country peasants.\nIn 1925, Lu Xun began what may have been his first meaningful romantic relationship, with one of his students at the Beijing Women's College, Xu Guangping. In March 1926 there was a mass student protest against the warlord Feng Yuxiang's collaboration with the Japanese. The protests degenerated into a massacre, in which two of Lu's students from Beijing Women's College were killed. Lu's public support for the protesters forced him to flee from the local authorities. Later in 1926, when the warlord troops of Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu took over Beijing, Lu left northern China and fled to Xiamen.\nAfter arriving in Xiamen, later in 1926, Lu Xun began teaching at Xiamen University, but was disappointed by the petty disagreements and unfriendliness of the university's faculty. During the short time he lived in Xiamen, Lu Xun wrote his last collection of fiction, \"Old Tales Retold\", which would not be published until several years later, and most of his autobiography, published as \"Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk\". He also published a collection of prose poetry, entitled \"Wild Grass\".\nIn January 1927, Lu Xun and Xu moved to Guangzhou, where he was hired as the head of the Chinese literature department at Sun Yat-sen University. His first act in his position was to hire Xu as his personal assistant, as well as Xu Shoushang, one of his old classmates from Japan, as a lecturer. While in Guangzhou, he edited multiple poems and books for publication, and served as a guest lecturer at Whampoa Academy. Through his students, he established connections within both the Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\nAfter the Shanghai massacre in April 1927, he attempted to secure the release of several students through the university, but failed. His failure to save his students led him to resign from his position at the university, and he left for the Shanghai International Settlement in September 1927. By the time he left Guangzhou, he was one of the most famous intellectuals in China.\nIn 1927 Lu was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, for the short story \"The True Story of Ah Q\", despite a poor English translation and annotations that were nearly double the size of the text. Lu rejected the possibility of accepting the nomination. Later, he renounced writing fiction or poetry in response to China's deteriorating political situation and his own poor emotional state, and restricted himself to writing argumentative essays.\nLater career.\nIn 1929, Lu Xun visited his mother, and reported that she was pleased at the news of Xu's pregnancy. Xu gave birth to a son named Haiying on 27 September. She was in labor with the baby for 27 hours. The child's name meant simply \"Shanghai infant\". His parents chose the name thinking that he could change it himself later, but he never did so. Haiying was Lu's only child.\nAfter moving to Shanghai, Lu rejected all regular teaching positions (though he sometimes gave guest lectures at different campuses), and for the first time was able to make a living solely as a professional writer, with a monthly income of roughly 500 yuan. He was also appointed by the government as a \"specially appointed writer\" by the national Ministry of Higher Education, which secured him an additional 300 yuan per month.\nLu Xun began to study and identify with Marxist politics, made contact with local CCP members, and became involved in literary disputes with other leftist writers in the city. In 1930 Lu became one of the co-founders of the League of Left-Wing Writers, but shortly after he moved to Shanghai other leftist writers accused him of being \"an evil feudal remnant\", the \"best spokesman of the bourgeoisie\", and \"a counterrevolutionary split personality\". The League continued in various forms until 1936, when the constant disputes among its members led the CCP to dissolve it.\nIn January 1931, the Kuomintang (KMT) passed new, stricter censorship laws, allowing for writers producing literature deemed \"endangering the public\" or \"disturbing public order\" to be imprisoned for life or executed. Later that month he went into hiding. In early February, less than a month later, the KMT executed twenty-four local writers (including five who belonged to the League) whom they had arrested under this law.\nAfter the execution of the \"24 Longhua Martyrs\" (in addition to other students, friends, and associates), Lu's political views became distinctly anti-KMT. In 1933 Lu met Edgar Snow. Snow asked Lu Xun whether there were any Ah Q's left in China. Lu Xun responded, \"It's worse now. Now it's Ah Q's who are running the country.\"\nLu Xun wrote a classical Chinese poem, \"A Lament for Ms. Ding\", to commemorate Ding Ling, who on 14 May 1933 had been kidnapped from her residence in the Shanghai international settlement by the KMT.15\nDespite the unfavorable political climate, Lu Xun contributed regularly to a variety of periodicals in the 1930s, including Lin Yutang's humor magazine \"The Analects Fortnightly\", and corresponded with writers in Japan as well as China.\nAlthough he had renounced writing fiction years before, in 1934 he published his last collection of short stories, \"Old Tales Retold\". In 1935, he sent a telegram to CCP forces in Shaanxi congratulating them on the recent completion of their Long March. The CCP requested that he write a novel about the communist revolution set in rural China, but he declined, citing his lack of background and understanding of the subject.\nLu was a heavy smoker, which may have contributed to the deterioration of his health throughout his last year. By 1936 he had developed chronic tuberculosis, and in March of that year he was stricken with bronchial asthma and a fever. The treatment for this involved draining 300\u00a0grams of fluid in the lungs through a puncture.\nFrom June to August, he was again sick, and his weight dropped to only . He recovered somewhat, and wrote two essays in the fall reflecting on mortality. These included \"Death\", and \"This Too Is Life\". A month before his death, he wrote: \"Hold the funeral quickly... do not stage any memorial services. Forget about me, and care about your own life \u2013 you're a fool if you don't.\" Regarding his son, he wrote: \"On no account let him become a good-for-nothing writer or artist.\"\nDeath.\nAt 3:30 am on the morning of 18 October 1936, the author woke having great difficulty breathing. Dr. Sudo, his physician, was summoned, and Lu was given injections to relieve the pain. His wife was with him throughout that night. Lu Xun died at 5:11 am the next morning, 19 October. Lu's remains were interred in a mausoleum within Lu Xun Park in Shanghai. Mao Zedong later made the calligraphic inscription above his tomb.\nHe was survived by his son, Zhou Haiying.\nLegacy.\nLu Xun has been described by Nobel laureate Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce as \"the greatest writer Asia produced in the 20th century.\" Shortly after Lu Xun's death, Mao Zedong called him \"the saint of modern China\", but used his legacy selectively to promote his own political goals. In 1942, he quoted Lu out of context to tell his audience to be \"a willing ox\" like Lu Xun was, but told writers and artists who believed in freedom of expression that, because CCP areas were already liberated, they did not need to be like Lu Xun. After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, CCP literary theorists portrayed his work as orthodox examples of communist literature, yet every one of Lu's close disciples from the 1930s was purged. Mao admitted that, had Lu survived until the 1950s, he would \"either have gone silent or gone to prison\".\nParty leaders depicted him as \"drawing the blueprint of the communist future\" and Mao Zedong defined him as the \"chief commander of China's Cultural Revolution,\" although Lu did not join the party. During the 1920s and 1930s Lu Xun and his contemporaries often met informally for free-wheeling intellectual discussions, but after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 the Party sought more control over intellectual life in China, and this type of intellectual independence was suppressed, often violently.\nFinally, Lu Xun's satirical and ironic writing style itself was discouraged, ridiculed, then as often as possible destroyed. In 1942, Mao wrote that \"the style of the essay should not simply be like Lu Xun's. [In a Communist society] we can shout at the top of our voices and have no need for veiled and round-about expressions, which are hard for the people to understand.\" In 2007, some of his bleaker works were removed from school textbooks. Julia Lovell, who has translated Lu Xun's writing, speculated that \"perhaps also it was an attempt to discourage the youth of today from Lu Xun's inconveniently fault-finding habits.\"\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the CCP both hailed Lu Xun as one of the fathers of communism in China, yet ironically suppressed the very intellectual culture and style of writing that he represented. Some of his essays and writings are now part of the primary school and middle school compulsory curriculum in China.\nLu completed volumes of translations, notably from Russian. He particularly admired Nikolai Gogol and made a translation of \"Dead Souls\". His own first story's title, \"Diary of a Madman\", was inspired by Gogol's story of the same name. As a left-wing writer, Lu played an important role in the development of modern Chinese literature. His books were and remain highly influential and popular today, both in China and internationally. Lu Xun's works appear in high school textbooks in both China and Japan. He is known to Japanese by the name Rojin (; ).\nBecause of his leftist political involvement and the role his works played in the subsequent history of the People's Republic of China, Lu Xun's works were banned in Taiwan until the late 1980s. He was among the early supporters of the Esperanto movement in China.\nLu Xun's importance to modern Chinese literature lies in the fact that he contributed significantly to nearly every modern literary medium during his lifetime. He wrote in a clear lucid style, which was to influence many generations, in stories, prose poems and essays. Lu Xun's two short story collections, \"Nahan\" (\"Call to Arms\") and \"Panghuang\" (\"Wandering\"), are often acclaimed as classics of modern Chinese literature. Lu Xun's translations were important at a time when foreign literature was seldom read, and his literary criticisms remain acute and persuasively argued.\nLu Xun was also a leader of the Woodcut Movement in China (1930\u20131950) and widely recognized as a pioneer of the rise of the woodcut print in China. After encountering new printmaking techniques in Japan, Lu embraced the art form, envisioning it as a medium to promote social change and \"an alternative socialist road to art.\" Through writings, lectures, and woodcut print publications, Lu Xun was instrumental in inspiring a generation in China towards the black-and-white woodcut.\nThe work of Lu Xun has also received attention outside China. In 1986, Fredric Jameson cited \"Diary of a Madman\" as the \"supreme example\" of the \"national allegory\" form that all Third World literature takes. Gloria Davies compares Lu Xun to Nietzsche, saying that both were \"trapped in the construction of a modernity which is fundamentally problematic\". According to Leonardo Vittorio Arena, Lu Xun cultivated an ambiguous standpoint towards Nietzsche, a mixture of attraction and repulsion, the latter because of Nietzsche's excesses in style and content.\nStyle and thought.\nLu Xun was a versatile writer. He wrote using both traditional Chinese conventions and 19th century European literary forms. His style has been described in equally broad terms, conveying both \"sympathetic engagement\" and \"ironic detachment\" at different moments. Particularly in his early novellas, Lu wrote about characters who were weak, indecisive, frustrated, and largely the victims of oppressive Chinese culture.125\nHis essays are often incisive in his societal commentary, and in his stories his mastery of the vernacular language and tone make some of his literary works (like \"The True Story of Ah Q\") hard to convey through translation. In them, he frequently treads a fine line between criticizing the follies of his characters and sympathizing with those very follies. Lu Xun was a master of irony and satire (as can be seen in \"The True Story of Ah Q\") and yet could also write impressively direct prose (\"My Old Home\", \"A Little Incident\").\nLu Xun is typically regarded by Mao Zedong as the most influential Chinese writer who was associated with the May Fourth Movement. He produced harsh criticism of social problems in China, particularly in his analysis of the \"Chinese national character\". He was sometimes called a \"champion of common humanity\".\nLu Xun felt that the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 had been a failure. In 1925 he opined, \"I feel the so-called Republic of China has ceased to exist. I feel that, before the revolution, I was a slave, but shortly after the revolution, I have been cheated by slaves and have become their slave.\" He even recommended that his readers heed the critique of Chinese culture in \"Chinese Characteristics\" by the missionary writer Arthur Smith. His disillusionment with politics led him to conclude in 1927 that \"revolutionary literature\" alone could not bring about radical change. Rather, \"revolutionary men\" needed to lead a revolution using force. In the end, he experienced profound disappointment with the new Nationalist government, which he viewed as ineffective and even harmful to China.\nLu contended that \"[i]f Chinese characters are not exterminated, there can be no doubt that China will perish.\"\nBibliography.\nLu Xun's works became known to English readers as early as 1926 with the publication in Shanghai of \"The True Story of Ah Q\", translated by George Kin Leung, and more widely beginning in 1936 with an anthology edited by Edgar Snow and Nym Wales \"Living China, Modern Chinese Short Stories,\" in which Part One included seven of Lu Xun's stories and a short biography based on Snow's talks with Lu Xun. However, there was not a complete translation of the fiction until the four-volume set of his writings, which included \"Selected Stories of Lu Hsun\" translated by Yang Hsien-yi and Gladys Yang. Another full selection was William A. Lyell's \"Diary of a Madman and Other Stories\" (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1990). In 2009, Penguin Classics published a complete translation by Julia Lovell of his fiction, \"The Real Story of Ah-Q and Other Tales of China: The Complete Fiction of Lu Xun\", which the scholar Jeffrey Wasserstrom said \"could be considered the most significant Penguin Classic ever published.\"\n\"The Lyrical Lu Xun: a Study of his Classical-style Verse\"\u2014a book by Jon Eugene von Kowallis (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1996) \u2013 includes a complete introduction to Lu Xun's poetry in the classical style, with Chinese characters, literal and verse translations, and a biographical introduction which summarizes his life in relation to his poetry.\nIn 2017, Harvard University Press published a book of his essays translated by Eileen J.

It is most commonly a symptom of coronary artery disease.\nAngina is typically the result of partial obstruction or spasm of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The main mechanism of coronary artery obstruction is atherosclerosis as part of coronary artery disease. Other causes of angina include abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure and, less commonly, anemia. The term derives from la \" angere\"\u00a0'to strangle' and \" pectus\"\u00a0'chest', and can therefore be translated as \"a strangling feeling in the chest\".\nAn urgent medical assessment is suggested to rule out serious medical conditions. There is a relationship between severity of angina and degree of oxygen deprivation in the heart muscle. However, the severity of angina does not always match the degree of oxygen deprivation to the heart or the risk of a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Some people may experience severe pain even though there is little risk of a heart attack whilst others may have a heart attack and experience little or no pain. In some cases, angina can be quite severe. Worsening angina attacks, sudden-onset angina at rest, and angina lasting more than 15 minutes are symptoms of unstable angina (usually grouped with similar conditions as the acute coronary syndrome). As these may precede a heart attack, they require urgent medical attention and are, in general, treated similarly to heart attacks.\nIn the early 20th century, severe angina was seen as a sign of impending death. However, modern medical therapies have improved the outlook substantially. Middle-age patients who experience moderate to severe angina (grading by classes II, III, and IV) have a five-year survival rate of approximately 92%.\nClassification.\nStable angina.\nAlso known as 'effort angina', this refers to the classic type of angina related to myocardial ischemia. A typical presentation of stable angina is that of chest discomfort and associated symptoms precipitated by some activity (running, walking, etc.) with minimal or non-existent symptoms at rest or after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. Symptoms typically diminish several minutes after activity and recur when activity resumes. In this way, stable angina may be thought of as being similar to intermittent claudication symptoms. Other recognized precipitants of stable angina include cold weather, heavy meals, and emotional stress.\nUnstable angina.\nUnstable angina (UA) (also \"crescendo angina\"; this is a form of acute coronary syndrome) is defined as angina pectoris that changes or worsens or begins suddenly at rest. Unstable angina is a medical emergency and requires urgent medical treatment from a doctor.\nIt has at least one of these three features:\nUA may occur often unpredictably and even at rest, which may be a serious indicator of an impending heart attack. The primary factor differentiating unstable angina from stable angina (other than symptoms) is the underlying pathophysiology of the atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of unstable angina is the reduction of coronary blood flow due to transient platelet aggregation on apparently normal endothelium, coronary artery spasms, or coronary thrombosis.\nThe process starts with atherosclerosis, progresses through inflammation to yield an active unstable plaque, which undergoes thrombosis and results in acute myocardial ischemia, which, if not reversed, results in cell necrosis (infarction). Studies show that 64% of all unstable anginas occur between 22:00 and 08:00 when patients are at rest.\nIn stable angina, the developing atheroma (a fatty plaque) is protected with a fibrous cap. This cap may rupture in unstable angina, allowing blood clots to precipitate and further decrease the area of the coronary vessel's lumen or the interior open space within an artery. This explains why, in many cases, unstable angina develops independently of activity.\nMicrovascular angina.\nMicrovascular angina, also known as \"cardiac syndrome X\", is characterized by angina-like chest pain, in the context of normal epicardial coronary arteries (the largest vessels on the surface of the heart, prior to significant branching) on angiography. The original definition of cardiac syndrome X also mandated that ischemic changes on exercise (despite normal coronary arteries) were displayed, as shown on cardiac stress tests. The primary cause of microvascular angina is unknown, but factors apparently involved are endothelial dysfunction and reduced flow (perhaps due to spasm) in the tiny \"resistance\" blood vessels of the heart. Since microvascular angina is not characterized by major arterial blockages, it is harder to recognize and diagnose.\nMicrovascular angina was previously considered a rather benign condition, but more recent data has changed this attitude. Studies, including the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE), suggest that microvascular angina is part of the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease, perhaps explaining the higher rates of angina in females than in males, as well as their predilection towards ischemia and acute coronary syndromes in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.\nSigns and symptoms.\nAngina pectoris can be quite painful, but many patients with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain and is because the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).\nMyocardial ischemia comes about when the myocardium (the heart muscle) receives insufficient blood and oxygen to function normally either because of increased oxygen demand by the myocardium or because of decreased supply to the myocardium. This inadequate perfusion of blood and the resulting reduced delivery of oxygen and nutrients are directly correlated to blocked or narrowed blood vessels.\nSome experience \"autonomic symptoms\" (related to increased activity of the autonomic nervous system) such as nausea, vomiting, and pallor.\nA variant form of angina\u2014Prinzmetal's angina\u2014occurs in patients with normal coronary arteries or insignificant atherosclerosis. It is believed caused by spasms of the artery. It occurs more in younger women.\nCoital angina, also known as \"angina d'amour\", is angina subsequent to sexual intercourse. It is generally rare, except in patients with severe coronary artery disease.\nCause.\nMajor risk factors.\nRoutine counseling of adults by physicians to advise them to improve their diet and increase their physical activity has, in general, been found to induce only small changes in actual behavior. Therefore, as of 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend routine lifestyle counseling of all patients without known cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes, and instead recommends selectively counseling only those patients who seem most ready to make lifestyle changes and using available time with other patients to explore other types of intervention that would be more likely to have a preventative impact.\nOne study found that smokers with coronary artery disease had a significantly increased level of sympathetic nerve activity when compared to those without. This is in addition to increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral vascular resistance associated with nicotine, which may lead to recurrent angina attacks. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the risk of CHD (Coronary heart disease), stroke, and PVD (Peripheral vascular disease) is reduced within 1\u20132 years of smoking cessation. In another study, it was found that, after one year, the prevalence of angina in smokingmales under 60 after an initial attack was 40% less in those having quit smoking compared to those that continued. Studies have found that there are short-term and long-term benefits to smoking cessation.\nOther cardiac problems.\nMyocardial ischemia can result from:\nAtherosclerosis is the most common cause of stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels) of the heart's arteries and, hence, angina pectoris. Some people with chest pain have normal or minimal narrowing of heart arteries; in these patients, vasospasm is a more likely cause for the pain, sometimes in the context of Prinzmetal's angina and syndrome X.\nMyocardial ischemia also can be the result of factors affecting blood composition, such as the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, as seen with severe anemia (low number of red blood cells), or long-term smoking.\nPathophysiology.\nAngina results when there is an imbalance between the heart's oxygen demand and supply. This imbalance can result from an increase in demand (e.g., during exercise) without a proportional increase in supply (e.g., due to obstruction or atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries).\nHowever, the pathophysiology of angina in females varies significantly as compared to males. Non-obstructive coronary disease is more common in females.\nDiagnosis.\nAngina should be suspected in people presenting tight, dull, or heavy chest discomfort that is:\nSome people present with atypical symptoms, including breathlessness, nausea, or epigastric discomfort, or burning. These atypical symptoms are particularly likely in older people, women, and those with diabetes.\nAnginal pain is not usually sharp or stabbing or influenced by respiration. Antacids and simple analgesics do not usually relieve the pain. If chest discomfort (of whatever site) is precipitated by exertion, relieved by rest, and relieved by glyceryl trinitrate, the likelihood of angina is increased.\nIn angina patients momentarily not feeling any chest pain, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically normal unless there have been other cardiac problems in the past. During periods of pain, depression, or elevation of the ST segment may be observed. To elicit these changes, an exercise ECG test (\"treadmill test\") may be performed, during which the patient exercises to his/her maximum ability before fatigue, breathlessness, or pain intervenes; if characteristic ECG changes are documented (typically more than 1\u00a0mm of flat or downsloping ST depression), the test is considered diagnostic for angina. Even constant monitoring of the blood pressure and the pulse rate can lead to some conclusions regarding angina. The exercise test is also useful in looking for other markers of myocardial ischemia: blood pressure response (or lack thereof, in particular, a drop in systolic blood pressure), dysrhythmia, and chronotropic response. Other alternatives to a standard exercise test include a thallium scintigram or sestamibi scintigram (in patients unable to exercise enough for the treadmill tests, e.g., due to asthma or arthritis or in whom the ECG is too abnormal at rest) or stress echocardiography.\nIn patients in whom such noninvasive testing is diagnostic, a coronary angiogram is typically performed to identify the nature of the coronary lesion, and whether this would be a candidate for angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), treatment only with medication, or other treatments. In hospitalized patients with unstable angina (or the newer term of \"high-risk acute coronary syndromes\"), those with resting ischaemic ECG changes or those with raised cardiac enzymes such as troponin may undergo coronary angiography directly.\nTreatment.\nAngina pectoris occurs as a result of coronary blood flow insufficiency in the face of increased oxygen demand. The principal goal in the prevention and relief of angina is to limit the oxygen requirement of the heart so it can meet the inadequate oxygen supply derived through the blood supplied from the stenosed or constricted arteries. The main goals of treatment in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing progression of the disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, metoprolol, propranolol) have a large body of evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability, and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. There are differing course of treatments for the patient depending on the type of angina the patient has. However, this second can provide a brief overview of the types of medications provided for angina and the purpose by which they are prescribed.\nBeta blockers, specifically B1 adrenergic blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, are preferred for angina treatment, out of B1 selective and non-selective as well as B1 ISA agents. B1 blockers are cardioselective blocking agents (such as nevibolol, atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, etc.) which result in blocking cAMP in the heart muscle cells. cAMP, which plays a vital role in phosphorylating the ryanodine receptor and LTCC, will usually increase Ca+2 levels in the heart muscle cells, blocking contraction. Therefore, B1 blockade decreases the HR and contraction of the heart muscle, making it demand less oxygen. An important thing to note is that the B1 cardioselective blockers are cardioselective and not cardio-specific. This means that if the beta-adrenergic antagonist is prescribed in higher doses, it can lose the selectivity aspect and begin causing hypertension from B2 adrenergic stimulation of smooth muscle cells. This is why in therapy for patients with angina, the vasodilatory organonitrates complement the use of B-blockers when prescribed the use of angina. The preference for Beta-1 cardioselective blockers is for B1 cardioselective blockers without intrinsic sympathetic activity. Beta blockers with intrinsic sympathetic activity will still do the beta blockade of the heart muscle cells and have a decreased ionotrophic and chronotropic effect, but this effect will be to a lesser extent than if the beta blocker did not have the intrinsic sympathetic activity. A common beta-blocker with ISA prescribed for the treatment of angina is Acebutolol.\nNon-selective beta-adrenergic antagonists will yield the same action on B1 receptors, however will also act on B2 receptors. These medications, such as Propranolol and Nadolol, act on B1 receptors on smooth muscle cells as well. B1 blockade occurs in the smooth muscle cells. Specifically cAMP is responsible for inhibiting Myosin Light Kinase, the enzyme responsible for acting on Actin-Myosin. The inhibition of B1 will result in decreased levels of cAMP which will lead to increased levels of Myosin Light Chain Kinase in the smooth muscle cells, the enzyme responsible for acting on Actin-Myosin and leading to contraction of the smooth muscle cell. This increased contraction of the smooth muscle cell from B1 blockade is not desirable since it explains the hypertension that may arise with patients taking that medication.\nCalcium channel blockers act to decrease the heart's workload, and thus its requirement for oxygen by blocking the calcium channels of the heart muscle cell. With decreased intracellular calcium, the calcium-troponin complex does not form in the heart muscle cell and it does not contract, therefore reducing the need for oxygen.\nThe other class of medication that can be used to treat angina are the organic nitrates. Organic nitrates are used extensively to treat angina. They improve coronary blood flow of the coronary arteries (arteries which supply blood to the heart muscle) by reversing and preventing vasospasm, which increases the blood flow to the heart, improving perfusion and oxygen delivery to the heart associated with the pain of angina. These drugs also reduce systemic vascular resistance, of both veins and arteries but the veins to a greater extent. The decrease in the resistance of the arteries and veins decreases the myocardial oxygen demand, which also reduces myocardial oxygen demand. Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator that decreases myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing the heart's workload. Nitroglycerin should not be given if certain inhibitors such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil have been taken within the previous 12 hours as the combination of the two could cause a serious drop in blood pressure.\nTreatments for angina are balloon angioplasty, in which the balloon is inserted at the end of a catheter and inflated to widen the arterial lumen. Stents to maintain the arterial widening are often used at the same time. Coronary bypass surgery involves bypassing constricted arteries with venous grafts. This is much more invasive than angioplasty.\nCalcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides heart rate reduction without affecting contractility leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque.&lt;ref name=\"doi:10.1001/jama.295.13.jpc60002\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.\nExercise is also a very good long-term treatment for the angina (but only particular regimens \u2013 gentle and sustained exercise rather than intense short bursts), probably working by complex mechanisms such as improving blood pressure and promoting coronary artery collateralisation.\nThough sometimes used by patients, evidence does not support the use of traditional Chinese herbal products (THCP) for angina.\nIdentifying and treating risk factors for further coronary heart disease is a priority in patients with angina. This means testing for elevated cholesterol and other fats in the blood, diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure), and encouraging smoking cessation and weight optimization.\nThe calcium channel blocker nifedipine prolongs cardiovascular event- and procedure-free survival in patients with coronary artery disease. New overt heart failures were reduced by 29% compared to placebo; however, the mortality rate difference between the two groups was statistically insignificant.\nMicrovascular angina in women.\nWomen with myocardial ischemia often have either no or atypical symptoms, such as palpitations, anxiety, weakness, and fatigue. Additionally, many females with angina are found to have cardiac ischemia, yet no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. Evidence is accumulating that nearly half of females with myocardial ischemia have coronary microvascular disease, a condition often called microvascular angina (MVA). Small intramyocardial arterioles constrict in MVA causing ischemic pain that is less predictable than with typical epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD).\nThe pathophysiology is complex and still being elucidated, but there is strong evidence that endothelial dysfunction, decreased endogenous vasodilators, inflammation, changes in adipokines, and platelet activation are contributing factors. The diagnosis of MVA may require catheterization during which there is an assessment of the microcirculatory response to adenosine or acetylcholine and measurement of coronary and fractional flow reserve. New techniques include positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transthoracic Doppler echocardiography.\nManaging MVA can be challenging, for example, females with this condition have less coronary microvascular dilation in response to nitrates than do those without MVA. Females with MVA often have traditional risk factors for CAD such as obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension. Aggressive interventions to reduce modifiable risk factors are an important component of management, especially smoking cessation, exercise, and diabetes management. The combination of non-nitrate vasodilators, such as calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors along with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), also is effective in many women, and new drugs, such as Ranolazine and Ivabradine, have shown promise in the treatment of MVA. Other approaches include spinal cord stimulators, adenosine receptor blockade, and psychiatric intervention.\nSuspected angina.\nHospital admission for people with the following symptoms is recommended, as they may have unstable angina: pain at rest (which may occur at night), pain on minimal exertion, angina that seems to progress rapidly despite increasing medical treatment. All people with suspected angina should be urgently referred to a chest pain evaluation service, for confirmation of the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of coronary heart disease.\nEpidemiology.\nAs of 2010, angina due to ischemic heart disease affects approximately 112\u00a0million people (1.6% of the global population) being slightly more common in males than females (1.7% to 1.5%).\nIn the United States, 10.2 million are estimated to experience angina with approximately 500,000 new cases occurring each year. Angina is more often the presenting symptom of coronary artery disease in females than in men. The prevalence of angina rises with increasing age, with a mean age of onset of 62.3 years. After five years post-onset, 4.8% of individuals with angina subsequently died from coronary heart disease. Males with angina were found to have an increased risk of subsequent acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease related death than women. Similar figures apply in the remainder of the Western world. All forms of coronary heart disease are much less-common in the Third World, as its risk factors are much more common in Western and Westernized countries; it could, therefore, be termed a disease of affluence.\nHistory.\nThe condition was named \"hritshoola\" in ancient India and was described by Sushruta (6th century BC).\nThe first clinical description of \"angina pectoris\" was by a British physician Dr. William Heberden in 1768.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bush to have United States citizens report suspicious activity. The program's website implied that US workers who had access to private citizens' homes, such as many cable installers and telephone repair workers, would be reporting on what was in people's homes if it were deemed \"suspicious.\"\nIt came under intense scrutiny in July 2002 when the \"Washington Post\" alleged in an editorial that the program was vaguely defined, and investigative political journalist Ritt Goldstein observed in Australia's \"Sydney Morning Herald\" that TIPS would provide America with a higher percentage of 'citizen spies' than the former East Germany had under the notorious Stasi secret police. Goldstein later observed that he broke news of Operation TIPS on March 10 in Spain's second largest daily, \"El Mundo\", but that he struggled until July before finding a major English language paper which would print the story.\nIn the days immediately following Goldstein's revelation, publications such as the libertarian magazine \"Reason\", and then the \"Boston Globe\", emphasized the Stasi analogy, widely highlighting Operation TIPS' shortcomings. TIPS was subsequently cancelled after concerns over civil liberties violations.\nOverview.\nThe program's website implied that US workers who had access to private citizens' homes, such as cable installers and telephone repair workers, would be reporting on what was in people's homes if it were deemed \"suspicious.\" The initial start of the program was to be August 2002 and would have included one million workers in ten US cities and then to be expanded.\nOperation TIPS was accused of doing an \"end run\" around the United States Constitution, and the original wording of the website was subsequently changed. President Bush's then-Attorney General, John Ashcroft denied that private residences would be surveilled by private citizens operating as government spies. Mr. Ashcroft nonetheless defended the program, equivocating on whether the reports by citizens on fellow citizens would be maintained in government databases. While saying that the information would not be in a central database as part of Operation TIPS, he maintained that the information would still be kept in databases by various law enforcement agencies.\nThe databases were an explicit concern of various civil liberties groups (on both the left and the right) who felt that such databases could include false information about citizens with no way for those citizens to know that such information was compiled about them, nor any way for them to correct the information, nor any way for them to confront their accusers.\nThe United States Postal Service, after at first seeming supportive of the program, later resisted its personnel being included in this program, reasoning that if mail carriers became perceived as law enforcement personnel that they would be placed in danger at a level for which they could not reasonably be expected to be prepared, and that the downside of the program hence vastly outweighed any good that it could accomplish. The National Association of Letter Carriers, a postal labor union, was especially outspoken in its opposition.\nAttempted passage.\nBoth Congressional Representative Dick Armey (Republican, Texas) and Senator Patrick Leahy (Democrat, Vermont) raised concerns. Senator Leahy said that it was similar to J. Edgar Hoover's misuse of the FBI during the 1960s when Hoover hired citizens to spy on neighbors who were political protesters. Rep. Armey included legislation in the House's Homeland Security Bill that explicitly prohibited the creation of Operation TIPS; but Joe Lieberman blocked the program's removal from the Senate version of the bill. The Senate, however, essentially passed the House version that eliminated the program.\nOperation TIPS was officially cancelled when the Homeland Security Act was passed by Congress in November 2002. Section 880 explicitly prohibited the program.\nTerrorism Liaison Officers.\nOn June 30, 2008, the \"Denver Post\" reported that 181 individuals, including police officers, paramedics, firefighters, utility workers, and railroad employees had been trained as Terrorism Liaison Officers to report suspicious information which could be signs of terrorist activity. The article also stated that TLOs were already active in six other states and the District of Columbia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She gained literary prominence in Japanese-occupied Shanghai between 1943 and 1945. However, after the Communists defeated the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War, she fled the country. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she was rediscovered by scholars such as C. T. Hsia and Shui Jing. Together with the re-examination of literary histories in the post-Mao era during the late 1970s and early 1980s, she rose again to literary prominence in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the Chinese diaspora communities.\nLife.\nChildhood and youth.\nChang was born Zhang Ying () in Shanghai, China on September 30, 1920. She was the first child of Zhang Zhiyi (; 1896\u20131953) and Huang Suqiong (; 1893\u20131957). Chang's maternal great-grandfather, Huang Yisheng (; 1818\u20131894), was a prominent naval commander. Chang's paternal grandfather, Zhang Peilun (1848\u20131903) married Li Ju'ou (; 1866\u20131916) and was son-in-law to Li Hongzhang, an influential Qing court official. She was also raised by her paternal aunt Zhang Maoyuan (; 1898\u20131991).\nIn 1922, when Chang was two years old, the family relocated to Tianjin. When she was three, her father introduced her to Tang poetry. Beginning in 1924, her father often brought back prostitutes or concubines and became heavily addicted to opium, which led to fights between her parents. During this time, Chang's mother decided to travel with her aunt to study in France. In 1927, after Chang's father promised to end his drug usage and extramarital affairs, Chang and her mother came back and settled in Shanghai. Chang's parents eventually divorced in 1930; she and her younger brother Zhang Zijing (; 1921\u20131997) were raised by their father.\nAt the age of 18, Chang contracted dysentery. Instead of seeking medical treatment, her father beat her and forced her to stay in her bedroom for six months. Chang eventually ran away to live with her mother and then stayed with her mother for nearly two years, until she went to university.\nEducation.\nChang started school at age 4. Chang had obtained excellent English skills besides her native Chinese. In 1937, she graduated from an all-female Christian boarding high school, St. Mary's Hall, Shanghai, even though her family was not religious.\nAt an early age, under her mother's influence, Chang began painting, playing piano, and learning English.\nIn 1939, Chang was accepted to the University of London on a full scholarship, but was unable to attend due to World War II. Instead, she studied English Literature at the University of Hong Kong, where she met her lifelong friend, Fatima Mohideen (; died 1995). When Chang was one semester short of earning her degree in December 1941, Hong Kong fell to the Empire of Japan. Chang's famous works were completed during the Japanese occupation.\nMarriages.\nIn 1943, Chang met her first husband Hu Lancheng when she was 23 and he was 37. They married the following year in a private ceremony. Fatima Mohideen was the sole attendee. In the few months that he courted Chang, Hu was still married to his third wife. Although Hu was labelled a traitor for collaborating with the Japanese during World War II, Chang continued to remain loyal to Hu. Shortly thereafter, Hu chose to move to Wuhan to work for a newspaper. While staying at a local hospital, he seduced a 17-year-old nurse, Zhou Xunde (), who soon moved in with him. When Japan was defeated in 1945, Hu used another identity and hid in the nearby city of Wenzhou, where he married Fan Xiumei (). Chang and Hu divorced in 1947.\nIn 1956, while living in MacDowell Colony, New Hampshire, Chang met and became involved with the American screenwriter Ferdinand Reyher, a Philadelphia native nearly 30 years her senior. During the time they were briefly apart in New York (Chang in New York City, Reyher in Saratoga), Chang wrote to Reyher that she was pregnant with his child. Reyher wrote back to propose. Although Chang did not receive the letter, she telephoned the following morning to inform Reyher she was arriving in Saratoga. Reyher had a chance to propose to her in person, but insisted that he did not want the child. Chang had an abortion shortly afterward. On August 14, 1956, the couple married in New York City. After the wedding, the couple moved back to New Hampshire. After suffering a series of strokes, Reyher eventually became paralyzed, before his death on October 8, 1967.\nDeath.\nOn September 8, 1995, Chang was found dead in her apartment on Rochester Avenue in Westwood, Los Angeles, by her landlord. According to her friends, Chang had died of natural causes several days before her building manager discovered her body, after becoming alarmed that she had not answered her telephone. Her death certificate states that she died from cardiovascular disease. In accordance with Chang's will, she was cremated without any memorial service, and her ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.\nAfter Chang's death, Stephen Soong (\u5b8b\u6dc7; 1919\u20131996) became the executor of her estate, succeeded by his son Roland Soong (\u5b8b\u4ee5\u6717). In 1997, the Soong family donated some of Chang's manuscripts to the East Asian Library at the University of Southern California, including the English translation of \"The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai\" and the unfinished manuscript of the novel \"The Young Marshall.\" In 2015, Roland Soong handed Eileen Chang's manuscripts to Hong Kong scholar Rosanna Fong (\u99ae\u774e\u4e7e) for organization and research.\nCareer.\nShanghai.\nAt the age of 10, Chang's mother renamed her as A\u00ecl\u00edng, a transliteration of Eileen, in preparation for her entrance into an English school. While in high school, Chang read \"Dream of the Red Chamber\", one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, which influenced her work throughout her career. Chang displayed great literary talent and her writings were published in the school magazine. The following year, she wrote her debut short novel at the age of 12.\nChang's writing was heavily influenced by the environment in which she lived. Shanghai and Hong Kong in the 1940s were the background of many of her earlier novels. She was known for her \"aesthetic ambivalence\" where the narrative style and language were reminiscent of the traditional \"linked-chapter\" novel while the setting was more in line with modern urban melodramas. Chang also sought to probe and examine the psychology of her characters.\nIn 1943, Chang was introduced to the prominent editor Zhou Shoujuan and gave him a few pieces of her writing. With Zhou's support, Chang soon became the most popular new writer in Shanghai. Within the next two years, she wrote some of her most acclaimed works, including \"Love in a Fallen City\" and \"The Golden Cangue\". In her English translation of \"The Golden Cangue\", Chang simplified English expressions and sentence structures to make it easier for readers to understand.\nSeveral short stories and novellas were collected in \"Romances\" (\"Chuan Qi\", ) (1944). It instantly became a bestseller in Shanghai, boosting Chang's reputation and fame among readers and also the Chinese literary circle.\nA collection of her essays appeared as \"Written on Water\" (\"L\u00edu Y\u00e1n\" ) in 1945. Her literary maturity was said to be far beyond her age. As described by Nicole Huang in the introduction to \"Written on Water\", \"The essay form became a means for Eileen Chang constantly to redefine the boundaries between life and work, the domestic and the historic, and meticulously to weave a rich private life together with the concerns of a public intellectual.\" In 20th century China, Chang experimented with new literary language. In her essay entitled \"writing of one's own,\" Chang retrospectively remarks on her use of a new fictional language in her novella \"Lianhuantao\" (\"Chained Links\").\nIn the early years of her career, Chang was famously associated with this comment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To be famous, I must hurry. If it comes too late, it will not bring me so much happiness ... Hurry, hurry, or it will be too late, too late!\nHong Kong.\nIn 1945, Chang's reputation waned due to postwar cultural and political turmoil. It worsened after the defeat of the Nationalist government by the Communists in the Chinese Civil War. Chang left mainland China for Hong Kong in 1952, realizing her writing career in Shanghai was over. In Hong Kong, she worked for the United States Information Service (USIS), which promoted United States interests overseas. During this time, she wrote two anti-communist works, \"The Rice Sprout Song\" (\"Yang Ge\", ) and \"Naked Earth\" (\"Chidi zhi lian,\" \u8d64\u5730\u4e4b\u6200, sometimes known in English as \"Love in Redland\"), both of which she later translated into Chinese and published in Taiwan. \"The Rice Sprout Song\" was Chang's first novel written entirely in English.\nChang wrote \"Naked Earth\" at the direct request of the USIS and used a plot outline supplied by USIS agents. According to academic Brian DeMare, the book is a consequence of the anti-Communist paranoia of the United States Cold War mentality and lacks the poetry and nuance of Chang's other works.\nShe also translated a variety of English works into Chinese, most notably \"The Old Man and the Sea\" by Ernest Hemingway and \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" by Washington Irving. Chang's translation of \"The Old Man and the Sea\" was seen as Cold War propaganda for the USIS and is argued to have directly influenced her writing and translating of \"The Rice Sprout Song\".\nUnited States.\nIn 1955, Chang moved to America, struggling to become an English writer. Her work was rejected by publishers many times. Chang's move from Hong Kong to the U.S. marked an important turning point in her literary career.\nIn the 1960s, Chang was constantly searching for new job opportunities, particularly ones that involved translating or writing screenplays. Chang once tried to adapt a screenplay for Hollywood with Chinese elements, but was unsuccessful because the agent thought the role had too much content and psychological changes. Chang became an American citizen in 1960 and headed to Taiwan for more opportunities, returning to the United States in 1962.\nBetrayal is an overarching theme in Chang's later works, notably in her English essay \"A Return to the Frontier\" (1963) and one of her last novels \"Little Reunions\" (2009, published posthumously). Compared to her previous works, there are many more tragedies and betrayals in her writings later in her life.\nIn 1962, when she resided in San Francisco, Chang started writing the English novel \"The Young Marshal\" based on the love story between the Chinese general Zhang Xueliang and his wife, Zhao Yidi, with an aim to break into the American literary world. However, due to the multitude of Chinese names and complex historical background in the book, her editor gave a poor evaluation of the initial chapters, which greatly undermined Chang's confidence in the writing. With her interest in Zhang Xueliang waning, she abandoned the story. In 2014, Eileen Chang's literary executor, Roland Soong, managed to have the unfinished novel published, with a Chinese translation by Zheng Yuantao.\nIn 1963, Chang also wrote two novels based on her own life: \"The Fall of the Pagoda\" and \"The Book of Change\". Both were believed to be her attempts to offer an alternative writing style to mainstream America; she did not succeed. The full-length novels were not published until 2010.\nIn 1966, Chang had a writing residency at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. In 1967, Chang held a short-term job at Radcliffe College. In 1969, upon the invitation of Shih-Hsiang Chen, a professor of Oriental Languages at the University of California, Berkeley, Chang became a senior researcher at the Center for Chinese Studies of Berkeley. Her research topics included Chinese Communist terminology and the novel \"Dream of the Red Chamber\". In 1971, the year Chen died, Chang left her post at Berkeley. In 1972, Chang relocated to Los Angeles. In 1975, she completed the English translation of \"The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai\", a late Qing novel written in Wu Chinese by Han Bangqing. The manuscript for the translation was found among her papers at the University of Southern California and published posthumously in 2005.\nIn 1978, \"Crown Magazine\" published Chang's novellas \"Lust, Caution\" and \"Fu Hua Lang Rui\", as well as her short story \"Xiang Jian Huan\".\nIn 1990, Chang began writing an essay \"Table of Love and Hate\" (\u611b\u618e\u8868), a reflection of her thoughts during her school days. The essay was published posthumously in the July 2016 issue (Issue 155) of Taiwan's Ink magazine and in the autumn-winter issue of China's Harvest magazine.\nInfluence.\nChang was a realist and modernist writer. Her most important contribution was her construction of a unique wartime narrative, one that deviated from the grand accounts of national salvation and revolution. She sought to recount the seemingly irrelevant details and experiences of daily life of ordinary men and women in periods of social change and violence. Chang was also known for her view of modern history, displaying colours, lines, and moods in her writing and juxtaposition of historical reality with the domain of domesticity.\nDuring the 1970s, Chang's legacy had such a significant impact on many creative writers in Taiwan that several generations of \"Chang School writers\" (\u5f35\u6d3e\u4f5c\u5bb6) emerged, notably Chu T\u2019ien-wen, Chu T\u2019ien-hsin, Lin Yao-de, and Yuan Chiung-chiung.\nWith collective efforts to unearth the literary histories of the pre-revolutionary days in the post-Mao era, a renewed Eileen Chang \"fever\" swept through the streets of mainland China. The name Eileen Chang became synonymous with the glories of a bygone era. As with Taiwan in the 1970s, a group of young women authors who were clearly inspired by Chang rose to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s. Other notable Mainland China authors influenced by Chang include Wang Anyi, Su Tong, and Ye Zhaoyan.\nChang has been listed as one of the four women literary geniuses in Shanghai during the Republic of China era, alongside Su Qing, Guan Lu, and Pan Liudai. Chang has also been listed as one of the four women literary geniuses during the Republic of China era, along with L\u00fc Bicheng, Xiao Hong and Shi Pingmei. Dominic Cheung, a poet and professor of East Asian languages at the University of Southern California, said that had it not been for the Chinese civil war, Chang would have been a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nIn popular culture.\nEileen Chang's works are often adapted for screens. The best known is probably Ang Lee's film \"Lust, Caution\" (2007), based on her novella of the same name, starring Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Tang Wei. The film won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival and Golden Horse Award for best film in 2007. Other film adaptations include \"Love in a Fallen City\" (1984) and \"Love After Love\" (2020), the latter based on Chang's \"Aloeswood Incense: The First Brazier\"; both films were directed by Ann Hui. Chang's \"Love in a Fallen City\" was also adapted into stage performances by the in 1987, 2002, and 2005. In 2006, the theatre took the Cantonese performance to New York, Shanghai, and Toronto.\nA 20-episode TV series, \"The Legend of Eileen Chang\", written by Wang Hui-ling and starring Rene Liu, aired in Taiwan in 2004.\nMalaysian singer Victor Wong wrote a song titled \"Eileen Chang\" (\"Zhang Ailing\") in 2005.\nTaiwanese writer Luo Yijun includes quotations and themes from Chang's writings and life in his novel \"Daughter\".\nIn 2020 on the occasion of the centennial celebration of Chang's birth, an online exhibition \"Eileen Chang at the University of Hong Kong\" was presented on the website for the University Museum and Art Gallery, Hong Kong. The exhibition pieced together a narrative that highlights the early stages of Chang's literary career.\nFilms.\nThe following scripts were penned by Chang:\nThe following are films adapted from Eileen Chang's novels:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65870", "revid": "2842084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65870", "title": "Qian Zhongshu", "text": "Chinese literary scholar and writer (1910\u20131998)\nQian Zhongshu (November 21, 1910 \u2013 December 19, 1998), also transliterated as Ch'ien Chung-shu or Dzien Tsoong-su, was a Chinese literary scholar and writer. He was known for his satirical novel \"Fortress Besieged\"; his erudite, rarefied nonfiction, distinguished by extensive, polyglot references to Chinese and Western history and literature; and his role in translating Mao Zedong\u2019s writings into English. \nLife.\nMost of what is known about Qian's early life relies on an essay written by his wife Yang Jiang. Born in Wuxi, Qian Zhongshu was the son of Qian Jibo (), a conservative Confucian scholar, landed gentry, and Chinese language professor at Tsinghua, St. John's University, and National Central University (Nanking), respectively. By family tradition, Qian Zhongshu grew up under the care of his eldest uncle, who did not have a son. Qian was initially named Yangxian (; lit. \"respect the ancients\"), with the courtesy name Zheliang (; \"sagacious and upright\"). However, when he was one year old, in accordance with a tradition of zhuazhou, practiced in many parts of China, he was given a few objects laid out in front of him for his \"grabbing\"; he grabbed a book. His uncle thusly renamed him Zhongshu, literally \"fond of books,\" while Yangxian became his intimate name. Qian was a rather talkative child. His father later changed his courtesy name to Mocun (, lit. \"to keep silent\"), in the hope that he would talk less.\nBoth Qian's name and courtesy name forecasted his future life. While he remained talkative when talking about literature with friends, he kept silent most of the time on politics and social activities. Qian was indeed very fond of books. When he was young, his uncle often brought him along to teahouses during the day. There, Qian was left alone to read storybooks on folklore and historical events, which he would repeat to his cousins upon returning home.\nAt the age of 6, Qian went to Qinshi primary school and stayed home for less than half a year due to illness. At the age of 7, Qian studied in a private school of a relative's family. Due to inconvenience, he quit school a year later and was taught by his uncle. When Qian was 11, he entered the first grade at Donglin Elementary School, and his uncle died this year. He continued living with his widowed aunt, even though their living conditions drastically worsened as her family's fortunes dwindled. Under the strict tutelage of his father, Qian mastered classical Chinese. At the age of 14, Qian left home to attend Taowu middle school, an English-language missionary school in Suzhou, after being scolded by his father, he studied hard and improved his writing level. In 1927, Qian was admitted to Furen Middle School, an English-language Missionary School in Wuxi, where he manifested his talent in language. At the age of 20, Qian's aunt died.\nDespite comparatively lower score in mathematics, Qian excelled in both Chinese and English languages. Thus, he was accepted into the Department of Foreign Languages of Tsinghua University in 1929, ranking 57 out of 174 male students. One of his few friends was the budding Sinologist and comparatist Achilles Fang. Qian also frequently cut classes, though he more than made up for this in Tsinghua's large library, which he boasted of having \"read through.\" It was probably in his college days that Qian began his lifelong habit of collecting quotations and taking reading notes. At Tsinghua, Qian studied with professors, such as Wu Mi, George T. Yeh, Wen Yuan-ning, and others. In 1932, he met Yang Jiang, who became a successful playwright and translator. In 1933, Qian became engaged to Yang, and they married in 1935. For the biographical facts of Qian's following years, the two memoirs by his wife can be consulted. Yang Jiang wrote, \"Zhongshu's 'foolishness' could not be contained in books, but just had to gush forth'\". Two years after Qian graduated from Tsinghua University in 1933, Qian taught at Kwanghua University in Shanghai and contributed to English-language publications such as \"The China Critic\".\nIn 1935, Qian received a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to further his studies abroad. Together with his wife, Qian headed for the University of Oxford in Britain. After spending two years at Exeter College, Oxford, he received a Bachelor of Letters. Shortly after his daughter Qian Yuan () was born in England in 1937, he studied for one more year in the University of Paris in France. In 1938, he returned to China and was appointed as a full professor at Tsinghua University, which, due to the war, had relocated to Kunming, in Yunnan province and become part of Southwestern United University. In 1939, after Qian returned to Shanghai to visit his relatives, he directly went to Hunan to take care of his sick father and temporarily left Southwestern United University. In 1941, During the Pearl Harbor incident, Qian was temporarily trapped in Shanghai.\nOwing to the unstable situation during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, Qian did not hold any long-term jobs. However, it was during the late 1930s and 1940s that he wrote most of his Chinese-language fiction, including \"Fortress Besieged\" and the story collection \"Human, Beast, Ghost,\" as well as the essay collection \"Written in the Margins of Life\". After Japan's defeat, in the late 1940s, he worked in the National Central Library in Nanjing, editing its English-language publication, \"Philobiblon.\"\nIn 1949, Qian was ranked on the list of National First-class Professors () and commenced his academic work in his alma mater. Four years later, an administrative adjustment saw Tsinghua changed into a science and technology-based institution, with its Arts departments merged into Peking University. Qian was relieved of teaching duties and worked entirely in the Institute of Literary Studies () under PKU. Qian is a senior researcher at the institute, and his wife Yang Jiang is also a researcher. He also worked as part of a small team in charge of the translation of Mao Zedong's \"Selected Works\" and poetry.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, like many other prominent intellectuals of the time, Qian suffered persecution. Appointed to be a janitor, he was robbed of his favorite pastime, reading. Having no access to books, he had to read his reading notes. He began to form the plan to write \"Limited Views\" during this period. Qian, his wife, along with their daughter survived the hardships of Cultural Revolution, but their son-in-law, a history teacher, was driven to suicide.\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, Qian returned to research. From 1978 to 1980, he visited several universities in Italy, the United States and Japan, impressing his audience with his wit and erudition. In 1982, he was appointed as the deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He then began working on \"Limited Views\", which occupied the next decade of his life. \nWhile \"Limited Views\" established his fame in the academic field, his novel \"Fortress Besieged\" introduced him to the public. \"Fortress Besieged\" was reprinted in 1980, and became a best-seller. Many illegal reproductions and \"continuations\" followed. Qian's fame rose to its height when the novel was adapted into a TV serial in 1990 which was acted by some famous Chinese actors, such as Daoming Chen and Da Ying.\nQian returned to research, but escaped from social activities. He consciously kept a distance from the mass media and political figures and played an important role in digitizing Chinese classics late in his life. Readers kept visiting the secluded scholar, and an anecdote goes that Qian when approached by a British admirer, remarked: \"Is it necessary for one to know the hen if one loves the eggs it lays?\" \nQian was hospitalized in 1994, and his daughter also became ill in 1995. On March 4, 1997, Qian's daughter died of cancer. On December 19, 1998, Qian died in Beijing.\nFormer residence.\nQian's former residence, covering 1,600 square meters, is located at Xinjiexiang #30 and #32 in Wuxi, Nanjing. It was built in 1923 by his grandfather Qian Fujiong. In 1926 his uncle Qian Sunqin built five buildings and several auxiliary rooms on the west side of the back of the house, covering an area of 667.6 square meters. The whole group of buildings are typical Jiangnan courtyard houses. Inside the residence, there are some unique separate buildings, such as \"Haixu Shulou\" and \"Meihua Shuwu\". In 2018, it applied for China's significant cultural relics protection units. The former residence has related exhibitions and is open to the public without fees.\nWorks.\nQian lived in Shanghai from 1941 to 1945, which was then under Japanese occupation. Many of his works were written or published during this chaotic period of time. A collection of short essays, \"Written in the Margins of Life\" () was published in 1941. \"Human, Beast, Ghost\" (), a collection of short stories, mostly satiric, was published in 1946. His most celebrated work \"Fortress Besieged\" appeared in 1947, but not until 1980s that it receives more attention. \"On the Art of Poetry\", written in classical Chinese, was published in 1948.\nBesides rendering Mao Zedong's selected works into English, Qian was appointed to produce an anthology of poetry of the Song dynasty when he was working in the Institute of Literary Studies. The \"Selected and Annotated Song Dynasty Poetry\" was published in 1958. Despite Qian's quoting the chairman, and his selecting a considerable number of poems that reflect class struggle, the work was criticized for not being Marxist enough. The work was praised highly by the overseas critics, though, especially for its introduction and footnotes. In a new preface for the anthology written in 1988, Qian said that the work was an embarrassing compromise between his personal taste and the prevailing academic atmosphere.\n\"Seven Pieces Patched Together\" (), a collection of seven pieces of literary criticism written (and revised) over years in vernacular Chinese, was published in 1984, and has been translated by Duncan Campbell as \"http://\". This collection includes the famous essay \"Lin Shu's Translation\" ().\nQian's \"magnum opus\" is the five-volume \"Limited Views\" (, lit. \"Pipe-Awl Collection\"). Begun in the 1980s and published in its current form in the mid-1990s, it is an extensive collection of notes and short essays on poetics, semiotics, literary history and related topics written in classical Chinese.\nQian's command of the cultural traditions of classical and modern Chinese, ancient Greek (in translations), Latin, English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish allowed him to construct a towering structure of polyglot and cross-cultural allusions. He took a range of Chinese classical texts as the basis of this work, including the \"I-Ching\", \"Classic of Poetry\", \"Verses of Chu\", \"The Commentary of Tso\", \"Records of the Grand Historian\", \"Tao Te Ching\", \"Lieh-tzu\", \"Jiaoshi Yilin\", \"Extensive Records of the T'ai-p'ing Era\" and the \"Complete Prose of the Pre-Tang Dynasties\" ().\nBroadly familiar with the Western history of ideas, Qian shed new lights on the Chinese classical texts by comparing them with Western works, showing their likeness, or more often their apparent likeness and essential differences.{\nQian Zhongshu is one of the best-known Chinese authors in the Western world. \"Fortress Besieged\" has been translated into English, French, German, Russian, Japanese and Spanish. It represents an alternative strand of modernism, which has\nlong remained hidden and unexamined in the history of modern Chinese literature. \"https://\" has been translated into English, French, and Italian.\nBesides being one of the great masters of written vernacular Chinese in the 20th century, Qian was also one of the last authors to produce substantial works in classical Chinese. Some regard his choice of writing \"Guan Zhui Bian\" (Limited Views) in classical Chinese as a challenge to the assertion that classical Chinese is incompatible with modern and Western ideas, an assertion often heard during the May Fourth Movement. Ronald Egan argues that the work contains an implicit negative commentary on the Cultural Revolution.\nPosthumous publications.\nA 13-volume edition of \"Works of Qian Zhongshu\" () was published in 2001 by the Joint Publishing, a hard-covered \"deluxe\" edition, in contrast to all of Qian's works published during his lifetime which are cheap paperbacks. The publisher claimed that the edition had been proofread by many experts. One of the most valuable parts of the edition which demonstrating Qian's writing ability while blending humor and irony, titled \"Marginalias on the Marginalias of Life\" (), is a collection of Qian's writings previously scattered in periodicals, magazines and other books. The writings collected there are, however, arranged without any visible order.\nOther posthumous publications of Qian's works have drawn harsh criticism. The official writing of \"Supplements to and Revisions of Songshi Jishi\" began in 1982. In the following ten years, Qian invested a lot of energy to make extensive and in-depth \"Supplements to and Revisions of Songshi Jishi\". The 10-volume \"Supplements to and Revisions of Songshi Jishi\" (), published in 2003, was criticized as a shoddy publication. Liaoning People's Publishing House published Qian Zhongshu's 'Supplements to and Revisions of Songshi Jishi\" in 2003. A facsimile of Qian's holograph has been published in 2005, by another publisher. The facsimiles of parts of Qian's notebooks appeared in 2004, and have similarly drawn criticism on account of blatant inadvertency. In 2005, a collection of Qian's English works was published. Again, it was lashed for its editorial incompetence.\nThe Commercial Press has, per an agreement with Yang Jiang, begun publishing photoreproductions of Qian Zhongshu's reading notes, totaling several score volumes in both Chinese and foreign languages.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nInnumerable biographies and memoirs in Chinese have been published since Qian's death.\nTwo critical studies of Qian's life and works in English:\nLiterary works by Qian in English translation:\nA selected translation of Qian's most celebrated work of literary criticism, \"Guan Zhui Bian\", with critical introduction:\nAn essay about Qian's critical vision and early writings:\nFive of Qian's essays on poetry in French translation:"}

{"id": "65873", "revid": "5718152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65873", "title": "Sweden Democrats", "text": "Political party in Sweden\nThe Sweden Democrats ( , SD ) is a nationalist and right-wing populist political party in Sweden founded in 1988. As of 2024, it is the largest member of Sweden's right-wing bloc and the second-largest party in the Riksdag. It provides confidence and supply to the right-wing ruling coalition. Within the European Union, the party is a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party.\nThe party describes itself as social conservative with a nationalist foundation. The party has also been variously characterised by universities, political commentators, and international media as economic nationalist, national-conservative, anti-immigration, anti-Islam, anti-gender, Eurosceptic, and right-wing or far-right. The Sweden Democrats reject the far-right label, saying that it no longer represents its political beliefs. Among the party's founders and early members were several people that had previously been active in white nationalist and neo-Nazi political parties and organizations. Under the leadership of Jimmie \u00c5kesson since 2005, the SD underwent a process of reform and has sought to position itself as a more mainstream party by expelling hardline members and moderating its beliefs, building on a work that had begun during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Today, the SD officially rejects fascism and Nazism on their platform and since 2012 has maintained a zero-tolerance policy against \"extremists\", \"lawbreakers\", and \"racists\". In 2025, the SD issued an official apology for its previous links to neo-Nazism during its early years.\nThe Sweden Democrats oppose current Swedish immigration and integration policies, instead supporting stronger restrictions on immigration and measures for immigrants to assimilate into Swedish culture. The Sweden Democrats are critical of multiculturalism and support having a common national and cultural identity, which they believe improves social cohesion. The party supports the Swedish welfare state but is against providing welfare to people who are not Swedish citizens and permanent residents of Sweden. The Sweden Democrats support a mixed market economy combining ideas from the centre-left and centre-right. The party supports same-sex marriage, civil unions for gay couples, and gender-affirming surgery but prefers that children be raised in a traditional nuclear family and argues that churches or private institutions should have the final say on performing a wedding over the state. The SD also calls for a ban on forced, polygamous or child marriages and stricter enforcement of laws against honour violence. The Sweden Democrats support keeping Sweden's nuclear power plants in order to mitigate climate change but argues that other countries should reduce their greenhouse gas emissions instead of Sweden, which the party believes is doing enough to reduce their emissions. The Sweden Democrats support generally increasing minimum sentences for crimes, as well as increasing police resources and personnel. The party also supports increasing the number of Swedish Army brigades and supports raising Sweden's defense spending.\nSupport for the Sweden Democrats has grown steadily since the 1990s and the party crossed the 4% threshold necessary for parliamentary representation for the first time during the 2010 Swedish general election, polling 5.7% and gaining 20 seats in the Riksdag. This increase in popularity has been compared by international media to other similar anti-immigration movements in Europe. The party received increased support in the 2018 Swedish general election, when it polled 17.5% and secured 62 seats in parliament, becoming the third largest party in Sweden. The Sweden Democrats were formerly isolated in the Riksdag until the late 2010s, with other parties maintaining a policy of refusing cooperation with them. In 2019, the leader of the Christian Democrats, Ebba Busch announced that her party was ready to start negotiations with the Sweden Democrats in the Riksdag, as did Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson. In the 2022 Swedish general election, the party ran as part of a broad right-wing alliance with those two parties and the Liberals, and came second overall with 20.5% of the vote. Following the election and the Tid\u00f6 Agreement, it was negotiated that SD agreed to support a Moderate Party-led government together with the Christian Democrats and the Liberals. It is the first time that SD holds direct influence over the government.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1988\u20131995).\nThe Sweden Democrats party was founded in 1988 as a direct successor to the Sweden Party, which in turn had been formed in 1986 by the merger of the activist group (BSS; in English: \"Keep Sweden Swedish\") and a faction of the Swedish Progress Party. The SD continued to use Keep Sweden Swedish as its slogan until the late 1990s. The SD claims 6 February 1988 as the date of its foundation and that the party was formally registered after a meeting in Stockholm designed to bring together various nationalist movements who issued a white paper for a new party, although observers tend to see the party's foundation as part of a complex decade-long series of events, with some even calling into question whether a meeting took place.\nInitially, the SD did not have a single centralized leader and was instead fronted by two alternating spokespeople before Anders Klarstr\u00f6m became the party's first official chairman and head of the Sweden Democrats' national board in 1989.\nAccording to the anti-racism publication \"Expo\" and the political historian Duncan McDonnell, it is generally agreed that the Sweden Democrats have never been a neo-Nazi or a fascist political party, although some of the SD's founders and early members had previously belonged to both Swedish and foreign neo-fascist and white nationalist groups. The party also had a reputation in the late 1980s and early 1990s for attracting skinhead gangs to its public events. Studies by \"Expo\" documented that around nine of the original 30 people who founded the SD had associations to known Nordic fascist parties such as the New Swedish Movement and the neo-Nazi Nordic Realm Party (, abbr. \"NRP\") while another eighteen had been part of the Keep Sweden Swedish organization. The study estimated that around sixty percent of party's national board members between 1989 and 1995 were connected to neo-Nazi movements in various ways both before and during their time in the party. However, the study also concluded that a majority of these members were no longer active within the party by the mid-to-late-1990s. The party's first auditor, Gustaf Ekstr\u00f6m, was a \"Waffen-SS\" veteran and had been a member of the national socialist party \"Svensk Socialistisk Samling\" in the1940s. The SD's first chairman Anders Klarstr\u00f6m and party co-founders and first board members Fritz H\u00e5kansson, G\u00f6sta Bergqvist and Sven Davidson had all been members of the Nordic Realm Party. Klarstr\u00f6m later elaborated he had briefly been part of the NRP as a teenager before distancing himself from it by the time he became SD leader. The first version of the SD's old youth-wing, the \"Sweden Democratic Youth\" was accused of having dual leadership with neo-Nazi youth movements until 1995 while the SD's logo from the 1990s until 2006 was a version of the torch used by the British National Front. The SD also encountered controversy for some of its early policy ideas before 1999, which included a proposal to repatriate most immigrants who came to Sweden from 1970, banning adoption of foreign born children and reinstating the death penalty.\nThe party promoted concerts by the Swedish offshoot of Rock Against Communism and sponsored music of the nationalist Viking rock band Ultima Thule. Various party officials today acknowledge that being fans of Ultima Thule's music factored prominently in their decision to become politically engaged. Early on, the party's newspaper \"SD-Kuriren\" promoted connections to its readers such as the National Democratic Party of Germany, the American National Association for the Advancement of White People (founded by David Duke), British politician John Tyndall and publications like the Nazi \"Nation Europa\" and \"Nouvelle \u00c9cole\", a newspaper that advocates racial biology and the British neo-Nazi Combat 18 movement.\nThe SD won municipal representation for the first time during the 1991 Swedish local elections in Dals-Ed Municipality and H\u00f6\u00f6r.\nModeration and growth (1995\u20132010).\nIn 1995, Klarstr\u00f6m was replaced as SD chairman by Mikael Jansson, a former member of the Centre Party. Jansson strove to make the party more respectable and took a direct stance against displays of extremism within its ranks. In 1995, the SD closed down its youth-wing and after skinheads started to impose on SD meetings, consuming alcohol at party events, displaying fascist imagery and the wearing of any kind of political uniform were formally banned in 1996. Also in 1996, it was revealed that an SD spokeswoman Tina Hallgren, had been to a party meeting of National Socialist Front posing in a Nazi uniform. Opposition to the party have mistakenly mixed these two events together and falsely claim that she was wearing the uniform at a rally of the Sweden Democrats and that it was because of this that the uniform ban came about. During the early 1990s, the SD sought to become a more conventional political party and became more influenced by the French National Rally, as well as the Freedom Party of Austria, the Danish People's Party, German The Republicans and Italian National Alliance. SDreceived economic support for the 1998 election from the then called French National Front, and became active in Jean-Marie Le Pen's Euronat from the same time. By the end of the decade, the party took further steps to moderate itself by distancing itself from all forms of fascist ideology, softening its policies on immigration and capital punishment and removing party figures deemed to be too radical. In 1999, the SD left Euronat although the youth wing remained affiliated until 2002. In 2001, the most extreme faction was expelled from the party, leading to the formation of the more radical National Democrats which in turn resulted in many of the SD's remaining hardline members leaving for the new party.\nDuring the early 2000s, the so-called \"Scania gang\", also known as the \"Gang of Four\" or \"Fantastic Four\", which consisted of the youth wing chairman Jimmie \u00c5kesson, as well as Bj\u00f6rn S\u00f6der, Mattias Karlsson and Richard Jomshof continued and expanded the moderation policy, which included ousting openly extremist members, banning neo-Nazi activists from attending party events or obtaining membership, and further revising the SD's policy platform. Before the 2002 election, former Member of Parliament (MP) for the Moderate Party, Sten Andersson defected to SD, citing that the party had gotten rid of its extreme-right elements. In 2003, the party declared the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be a cornerstone of its policies. In 2005, \u00c5kesson defeated Jansson in a leadership contest. Shortly after, the party changed its logo from the flaming torch to one featuring an \"Anemone hepatica\", reminiscent of the party's very first, but short-lived, logo (a stylised \"Myosotis scorpioides\").\nEntrance into parliament and ideological realignment (2010\u20132014).\nIn the 2010 Swedish general election, SDwon representation in the Swedish Riksdag for the first time, with5.7% of the vote and 20MPs.\nIn 2010, the SD leadership introduced a charter against racism on the party platform and later expanded this into a zero-tolerance policy regarding political extremism and law breaking. After some of the SD's elected members caused controversies during the party's first term in the Riksdag, the SD also stated it would introduce a vetting procedure for its future parliamentary candidates and issued updated guidelines on conduct and communication for party members. In 2011, the party also changed its self-description from \"nationalist\" to \"social conservative\".\nSweden Democrat MP William Petz\u00e4ll was persuaded to leave the party on 26 September 2011 while still retaining his parliamentary seat. This was done because of Petz\u00e4ll's substance abuse and the problems this might cause for SD'spublic image. Petz\u00e4ll later died of an overdose and his seat was turned over to Stellan Bojerud in September 2012.\nIn November 2012, videos from August 2010 were released, in segments, over the course of three days by Swedish newspaper \"Expressen\" (a year earlier, \"Expressen\" had released the same videos without making much noise). This came to be known as the Iron pipe scandal, although the same videos had already been released on YouTube by Erik Almqvist in 2010. The videos, recorded by MP Kent Ekeroth, featured him along with fellow Sweden Democrats MP Erik Almqvist and Christian Westling. The videos show Almqvist arguing with comedian Soran Ismail: Almqvist is referring to Sweden as \"my country, not your country\", as an insult to Ismail. They are also shown arguing with a drunken man. A woman can also be seen approaching Kent Ekeroth while filming; he calls her a whore and pushes her out of the way. A few minutes later they are seen picking up iron bars. Coming only a month after party leader \u00c5kesson had instated a zero-tolerance policy towards racism in the party, the release of the video caused Almqvist to leave his position as the party's economic policy spokesperson and his place in the executive committee on 14 November. He excused himself as having been under a lot of pressure and threats of violence at the time. As more segments of the video were released, revealing the other two men's involvement, the party announced on 15 November that Ekeroth would take a break from his position as the party's justice policy spokesman. Almqvist and Ekeroth both took time off from their parliament seats. Sweden Democratic Youth president Gustav Kasselstrand and vice president William Hahne criticised the decision to remove Almqvist and Ekeroth in an op-ed in \"Dagens Nyheter\", arguing that the party should not give in to media pressure.\nOnly two weeks after Almqvist and Ekeroth were forced to step down, fellow MP Lars Isovaara reported being robbed of his backpack and pushed out of his wheelchair by \"two unknown men of an immigrant background\". When trying to get into the Riksdag, Isovaara was himself reported by the police for racial abuse against safety guards. The Sweden Democrats initially defended Isovaara, but backed down when \"Expressen\" revealed that Isovaara had actually forgotten his backpack at a restaurant, and that the two men had helped him when he fell out of his wheelchair. He left his seat in the Riksdag on 29 November, and was replaced by Markus Wiechel.\nRise in national support (2014\u20132018).\nIn the European election of 2014, SD received 9.67% of votes, winning two seats in the European Parliament and becoming the fifth largest party in the country. The party later joined the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe and the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.\nIn the 2014 election, the Sweden Democrats received 12.9%of the votes, doubling their support and becoming the third-largest party. The party remained big in Scania and Blekinge; for example in Malm\u00f6 the party received 14% of the votes, in Landskrona it received 19% of the votes and in Sj\u00f6bo a total of 30% rendering the party the largest in that municipality. Other parties, however, remained firm in their decision to isolate them from exerting influence. Out of 29 constituencies electing parliamentarians, the party was the second largest in \"Scania North &amp; East\" while being the third largest party in 25. Although relying heavily on rural areas and the deep south, the party also made strong inroads and results above 15% in some medium-sized central Sweden cities such as Norrk\u00f6ping, Eskilstuna and G\u00e4vle, indicating a widening of its voter base in all areas.\nSome time after that, \u00c5kesson announced he would go on sick leave due to burnout. Mattias Karlsson was appointed to temporarily take over \u00c5kesson's duties as party leader.\nOn 23 March 2015, it was announced that \u00c5kesson would return from his leave of absence to resume his duties as party leader following an interview to be broadcast on the Friday, 27 March instalment of the \"Skavlan\" program on SVT, and a subsequent press conference with the Swedish media.\nAmid media coverage regarding the high immigration figures and the European migrant crisis, the Sweden Democrats soared in all opinion polls during the summer of 2015, even topping web-based polls from YouGov and Sentio in late summer, with a little over a quarter of the vote. The party also saw rising support in phone-based polls, although the swing was lower.\nEntering mainstream politics (2018\u20132022).\nIn early 2018, the far-right Alternative for Sweden was founded by members of the Sweden Democratic Youth, who were collectively expelled from the Sweden Democrats in 2015. Three Sweden Democrat members of the Riksdag\u00a0\u2013 Olle Felten, Jeff Ahl and former leader Mikael Jansson\u00a0\u2013 subsequently defected to the party.\nOn 2 July 2018, the two Sweden Democrats MEPs left the EFDD group and moved to the European Conservatives and Reformists Group.\nIn the 2018 Swedish general election, the SD increased its support to 17.5% of the vote, though it did not grow as much as most polls had predicted. According to Emily Schultheis of \"Foreign Policy\", the SD won an ideological victory, as it \"effectively set the terms for debate\" and forced its rivals to adopt immigration policies similar to its own, and other reporters made similar observations. The SD performed particularly well in Sk\u00e5ne County, having the highest number of voters in 21 out of the county's 33 municipalities. An SVT analysis of the results found that at least 22 seats in 17 city councils would be empty as the Sweden Democrats won more seats than the number of candidates it had. The party also received its first mayor, in H\u00f6rby Municipality.\nFollowing the election, Christian Democratic leader Ebba Busch announced that her party was willing to enter negotiations with the Sweden Democrats in the Riksdag. In December 2019, Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson held an official meeting with the Sweden Democrat leadership for the first time, despite having previously ruled out negotiating with the party. This led to speculation that the SD could be included in a new centre-right grouping to replace the Alliance which had collapsed after the Centre Party and the Liberal Party left to support the Social Democratic led government.\nIn October 2018, the Sweden Democrats went into a governing coalitions with the Moderate Party and the Christian Democrats for the first time in Staffanstorp Municipality, S\u00f6lvesborg Municipality, Herrljunga Municipality and Brom\u00f6lla Municipality. In Brom\u00f6lla, coalition felt apart in 2020, while new coalitions with the SD emerged in Sval\u00f6v Municipality (2019), Bjuv Municipality (2020) and Surahammar Municipality (2021).\nIn 2020, Mattias Karlsson, the former group leader of the Sweden Democrats in the Riksdag founded Oikos, a conservative think-tank which has been alleged to be an \"extension of the Sweden Democrats' political project\", supposedly also receiving funding from the party.\nIn 2021, the SD was invited to participate in alternative budget agreement talks with the Christian Democrats and the Moderates for the first time. That same year the SD also issued a vote of no confidence against the L\u00f6fven II cabinet citing the government's handling on immigration, the economy and housing which was carried by the other opposition parties and led to L\u00f6fven's impeachment. The SD had previously issued a vote of no confidence in the government in 2015, albeit without success.\n2022 general election (since 2022).\nAhead of the 2022 Swedish general election, the SD attempted to form a conservative grouping with the Moderates, Christian Democrats and the Liberals and requested ministerial posts in government should the right-wing bloc form a parliamentary majority. During the election, the SD campaigned to reduce asylum migration close to zero, stricter policies on work permits, lower energy bills and a tougher stance on gang violence with longer prison sentences. Preliminary results indicated that the Sweden Democrats had seen their strongest result to date and had overtaken the Moderates to become the second largest party with 20.6% of the vote. The result was confirmed after the election.\nIn October 2022, the SD was allocated chairmanship of four parliamentary committees for the first time in the Riksdag with party secretary Richard Jomshof appointed to head the Justice Committee, Aron Emilsson the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Tobias Andersson the Committee on Industry and Trade, and Magnus Persson the Committee on the Labour Market. SD parliamentarians were appointed as international delegation leaders for the first time, with Markus Wiechel becoming chairman of the Swedish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Bj\u00f6rn S\u00f6der for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Adam Marttinen the chairman of the joint-parliamentary group for Europol.\nThe party also formed a deal with Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson to provide for the first time in their history parliamentary support to a Moderate Party-led government as part of the Tid\u00f6 Agreement.\nIdeology and political positions.\nThe Sweden Democrats' current party programme is based on \"democratic nationalism\" and social conservatism. The SD platform expresses that the party's core philosophy is inspired by Swedish national conservatism and parts of the social democratic ('the people's home') idea. SD rejects any positioning of the party within the classic left-right scale, instead referring to itself as a \"value-oriented\" or \"value-conservative\" party. The party has stated that \"basic social justice with traditional conservative ideas\", nationalism and desires for democratic and good governance form its main principles. Nevertheless, the party is often described by international commentators as being right-wing to far-right.\nIn policy, SD articulates its main focus to be the areas of immigration, law and order and the elderly. The party also attaches particular importance to its economic and family policies. The SD criticizes multiculturalism in Sweden and emphasizes preserving national heritage. It is also opposed to what it sees as a constant shift of power from Stockholm to the European Union and campaigns to protect Swedish sovereignty and financial autonomy against the EU.\nPolitical analysis.\nThe SD's ideology and political identity has evolved significantly in the decades since its founding and entrance into the Riksdag. Labels for the party have consequently been a source of debate by outside observers. Nordic Studies scholar Benjamin R. Teitelbaum called the SD radical nationalist in 2013 and by 2018 said the party has since moved to the \"softer side\" of European populist parties. The party has been described by sociologist Jens Rydgren and political scientist Cas Mudde variously as xenophobic, far-right, racist or right-wing populist. French newspaper \"Le Monde\" profiled the SD as far-right and \"a nationalist party with fascist roots\". Critics of the SD have argued that it contains a more dangerous or problematic ideology behind a moderate facade, whereas others such as Teitelbaum have argued that research into the SD has been politically biased and that the SD has become more difficult to define due to its beliefs changing over the years. In 2013, a Sveriges Radio journalist called the SD \"xenophobic\", which resulted in a complaint lodged to the broadcasting regulator by the party. The Swedish Broadcasting Commission determined that this description was acceptable to use. According to Sveriges Radio in 2017, a European research agency classed the party as \"extreme\" using the Swedish GAL-TAN political scale, arguing that the SD is more traditionalist, socially authoritarian and nationalist and less progressive compared to other Swedish parliamentary parties and described the SD as similar to the French National Rally in some of its policies. In 2019, the polling company Novus said that their opinion polls show that SD is no-longer a \"one-issue\" party in regards to immigration, having won trust in other political questions too. In 2022, University of Gothenburg political scientist Johan Martinsson described the SD as \"anti-immigration, anti-multicultural, nationalist\" while stopping short of labelling the SD as a far-right party.\nHowever, the characterization of the SD as radical or extreme far-right has come under dispute in recent years by scholars and political observers. Commentator Kate\u0159ina Li\u0161an\u00edkov\u00e1 observed that the SD had hardline origins through its founders and initial support network, and notes that the SD's leadership openly acknowledges the party's history, but argues the present version of the SD does not match the description of a radical far-right party but is mistakenly labelled as such by media or opponents who focus on the party's early rather than current beliefs. She stated that the SD is now a national conservative party with populist elements but does not contradict democratic or Swedish constitutional principles. Similar observations were made in 2021 by Swedish political scientist S\u00f6ren Holmberg that \"extreme right\" was not a good description for the SD when placed within the traditional left-right scale, since the party contains centre-left and centrist policies on some issues compared to the other centre-right parties in Sweden. Holmberg furthermore argued that while SD can be considered a right-wing populist party, the label \"populist\" has become unstable due to some of the other parties in the Riksdag adopting populist ideas of their own. He concluded national-conservative was a better term for the SD. Swedish sociologist G\u00f6ran Adamson has also argued some political opposition conflate the SD's national conservative image as being right-wing extremist, and argued that the SD today is no longer comparable to European extreme-right or neo-fascist parties since the SD has a more liberal direction in several areas, and there is no evidence to suggest that the current incarnation of the party's policies are fascist or anti-democratic.\nDescribing the party's political trajectory, Johan Martinsson wrote that \"culturally nationalist\" was the most appropriate label for the Sweden Democrats since the party has continued to change its ideological programs and manifestos since its founding and no longer refer to ethnic nationalism in party literature. Martinsson acknowledged that the SD had links to Nazi movements during its first years before transforming itself in a conventional political party during the 1990s and since the 2010s the term \"radical right\" is no longer accurate for the SD. Martinsson summarized that while the SD adopts populist and anti-immigration rhetoric, other parties had also adopted more restrictive stances on migration and the SD's support for welfare state policies contrasts it from other right-leaning parties while the term \"right\" can be used as a pejorative label as opposed to an accurate description. Sweden-based British journalist Richard Orange noted in 2018 that the SD stands out due to its neo-Nazi roots but in the present now endorses more inclusive \"cultural nationalism\" over ethnic homogeny while calling for stricter immigration policies. In 2022, British political scientist Matthew Goodwin described the SD as having transformed itself from an extreme past to becoming part of a broader European family of national-populist parties which combine social and cultural conservative nationalism and populism but are opposed to fascist, anti-democratic and revolutionary ideas.\nWithin the party, the SD's leadership have rejected the extreme and \"far-right\" labels and argue they no longer represent the party. SD also states that its ideas are not racist and maintains that expressions of neo-fascism or Nazism among its membership are historical and no longer tolerated. Oscar Sj\u00f6stedt, the SD's financial spokesperson, places the party around the centre on the left\u2013right political spectrum, while leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson has stated that they are parallel with the Moderate Party. A 2016 survey of SD MPs in the Riksdag analyzed the party's voting record as closer to the centre-right Alliance on 44 percent of policy issues and closer to the Red-Greens on 25 percent of issues. SD group leader Mattias Karlsson stated in 2017 that the party is in the middle when it comes to economic redistribution policy and views on the welfare state, but centre-right on certain values such as defense and immigration policy. Swedish political scientist Henrik Ekengren Oscarsson published a similar conclusion about the party's voter base in 2016 which argued SD supporters are less likely to identify with traditional political labels but align to being centrist or to the left on economic matters and conservative on other issues. In addition, the SD has in recent years increasingly distanced itself from other European ultra-nationalist or far-right parties and stated it does not want anything to do with international and Swedish hard-right entities. In spite of this, a 2022 report by Swedish researchers Acta Publica claimed to have found 289 Swedish politicians who expressed racist or neo-Nazi views, with 214 of them being members of the SD. The SD itself has argued that some of these controversies with members have been as a result of the party's rapid growth since the late 2000s rather than the party itself being extremist.\nPolicies and beliefs.\nDomestic policy.\nThe party is a supporter of the Swedish monarchy playing a constitutional and cultural role in Swedish life, but also supports an amendment to the constitution that obligates the Riksdag to elect a new monarch in the event of there being no heir to the throne. In 2025 the party supported changing the citizenship requirements to the conditions of being able to speak Swedish, having education about Swedish culture and having an honest way of life, as well as declaring loyalty to Sweden.\nThe Sweden Democrats have been critical of the special rights given to the indigenous S\u00e1mi people of northern Sweden. In 2008, the party accepted a motion against the rights to reindeer husbandry. They have argued that those \"who do not involve themselves with reindeer husbandry are treated as second class citizens\" and that the privileges the herders have are \"undemocratic\". The party has previously wanted to abolish the S\u00e1mi Parliament, which it claimed special privileges for an \"ethnic minority while the society claims equal rights for others\". However, the SD has since disputed that it endorses abolishing the S\u00e1mi Parliament with SD spokesman Mattias Karlsson saying in a 2013 interview that \"the Sami are an indigenous people with an indisputable right to preserve their identity and culture.\"\nNational identity and culture.\nThe Sweden Democrats value a strong common national and cultural identity, believing these to be the most basic cornerstones of a functioning democracy and successful society. Minimizing linguistic, cultural and religious differences in society and emphasizing a defined sense of Swedish cultural values and social norms has a positive effect on societal cohesion, maintaining a welfare state and encouraging solidarity among the population, according to the party. On its platform, SD states the Swedish nation is defined \"in terms of loyalty, a common language and common culture\". A requirement for becoming a member of the Swedish nation is to either \"be born in it or by actively choosing to be a part of it\". For these reasons among others, SDfirmly rejects multiculturalism and argues that Sweden should preserve its cultural heritage by assimilating newcomers and maintaining Swedish as the nation's official language.\nUntil the 2000s, the SD attached ethnopluralist arguments to its defense of a Swedish homeland and culture. The 2005 party handbook called for a \"high degree of ethnic and cultural similarity among the population\" while the old party platform described the need to preserve the \"inherited essence\" of ethnic Swedes. However, the SD's official platform since 2018 no longer refers to a Swedish nation and people in an ethnically defined context, but adopts a more moderate cultural conservative policy promoting a shared national identity in which foreign-born people can become Swedish through stricter assimilation policies in exchange for citizenship and by the state asserting a more defined concept of Swedish culture and social values. The SD argues that not having a defined sense of what it means to be Swedish makes it harder for those of non-Western cultures to understand and become part of Swedish society. SD representatives have expressed that lacking a defined Swedish cultural identity and society will leave Sweden vulnerable to takeovers by more defined but aggressive cultures and social attitudes, with members of the party citing Islamic culture as an example. The SD has cited a strong work ethic, respect for nature, appreciation for Lutheran Christian traditions, speaking Swedish and equality between the sexes as important parts of Swedish cultural values that the country should strive to maintain. Nevertheless, the idea of a binding \"inherited essence\" is still a defining feature of SD supporters' worldview. A 2025 study reveals that supporters of the Sweden Democrats are more likely than those of other parties to believe that social differences (e.g., talents, intelligence, behaviours) between individuals, genders, and groups reflect genetic predispositions.\nIn a 2014 interview for \"Dagens Nyheter\", Second Deputy Speaker of the Riksdag and then-party secretary Bj\u00f6rn S\u00f6der elaborated on the SDparty programme with respect to its views on national identity and obtaining Swedish citizenship by saying that although an immigrant of any ethnic background in theory can become a Swedish citizen, they would have to adapt and be assimilated in order to be considered Swedish in the cultural sense, since the SD does not view a simple acquisition of Swedish citizenship with no assimilation requirements as the same as becoming part of Swedish society. In the interview, S\u00f6der stated that the officially recognised Swedish minority peoples such as S\u00e1mi, Tornedalians and Jews in many cases had dual cultural identities and that they probably would be proud of both heritages, and claimed that while these minorities are part of Sweden today, they had to give up part of their own culture in the past to integrate and become culturally Swedish. It was widely interpreted that S\u00f6der had stated in the interview that Jews cannot be Swedish unless they abandon their Jewish identity. S\u00f6der's comments were accused of being antisemitic and caused Swedish parliamentary groups and party leaders to call for his resignation. The Simon Wiesenthal Center listed the statement as number six on their list of the top ten most anti-semitic events of 2014. S\u00f6der responded in an article for \"The Jerusalem Post\", denying the charges of anti-semitism and claiming \"Dagens Nyheter\" had taken his statements out of context. In response, the SD also stated that it rejects antisemitism in Sweden and supports Israel in foreign policy, and that its proposed assimilation model is based on recognizing the difference between the concept of nationhood and acquired citizenship as opposed to implying minorities have split loyalties.\nThe Sweden Democrats advocates a cultural policy that would strip government funding for multicultural initiatives and strengthen support for traditional Swedish culture. This agenda has often manifested itself as opposition to state funding of immigrant cultural organisations and festivals, and more support for traditional Swedish craft, folk music, and folk dance groups. The party also tends to oppose state support for cultural initiatives deemed provocative or elitist. A 2014 letter signed by 52Swedish anthropologists, criticised the Sweden Democrats' use of the terms \"culture\" (\"kultur\" ) and \"anthropology\" (\"antropologi\" ), claiming their views on culture were \"essentialist and obsolete\", clarifying that culture is \"dynamic\" and \"in constant change\". The Sweden Democrats themselves maintain that traditional elements of Sweden's culture should not be rendered obsolete in favour of multiculturalism and argue Swedish cultural values contributed to the nation's economic and social successes through the \"people's home\" (\"Folkhemmet\") concept. According to scholar Bo Nilsson, the party links the adoption of multicultural policies with a subsequent decline in the \"Folkhemmet\" model and Sweden's success.\nThe party has expressed opposition to certain forms of modern architecture and in 2022 called for new housing to reflect traditional architectural styles, with the SD supporting more investment and streamlined planning permission rules into building new homes designed to match the specifications of what the party calls the \"Sverigehuset\" (the Sweden House), a classic wooden house design in Sweden. In 2025, the SD proposed to the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning to build more affordable housing in traditional designs.\nThe Sweden Democrats also criticise modern art, and have accused local councils of wasting public money on what it calls \"provocative\" art. The SD want citizens to be able to vote in local referendums on public art displayed near schools, public transport stations and town centres. \"The important thing is that what is expressed in the public environment is anchored to the citizens and especially the local residents who are most often in the environment so that they feel an identification\", says the party's cultural spokesperson Aron Emilsson. Sweden Democrats mayor in S\u00f6lvesborg Louise Erixon claimed \"There's a big division between what the general public thinks is beautiful and interesting and what a tiny cultural elite thinks is exciting\".\nThe Sweden Democrats also support a ban on the burqa and niq\u0101b in public places and are against proposals to publicly broadcast the Islamic call to prayer from minarets. The SD wants tougher enforcement of existing laws against female genital mutilation, honor violence and social segregation. The party also wants Swedish to remain Sweden's main official language in state funded schools, government agencies and public funded media, and for more teaching of Swedish cultural history in schools. It also supports prohibiting the hijab in primary schools, arguing that while it is not opposed to hijabs in general, the choice to wear it should be made on an individual basis when a child reaches adulthood. The SD is strongly opposed to sharia law being incorporated into the Swedish legal system.\nLeading party representatives have also spoken out in various contexts against mosques and Islamic centres in Sweden. In 2023, SD leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson argued that Swedish mosques which preach \"anti-democratic, anti-Swedish, homophobic, anti-Semitic propaganda\" should be closed and demolished and expressed opposition to the construction of new Islamic buildings. SD has also argued that other Swedish parties, particularly those on the left such as the Social Democrats are tolerant of Islamist activities in Sweden to secure votes at the expense of Swedish culture and security. In January 2024, Richard Jomshof, chairman of the Justice Committee in the Riksdag, ignited controversy in Sweden by proposing the prohibition of the Islamic star and crescent. He drew parallels to the ban on the Swastika, claiming that both symbols represent something dangerous.\nImmigration.\nThe Sweden Democrats believe that Sweden's recent immigration and integration policies have been a national failure. In a statement filed before the Riksdag Committee on Migration in August 2020, SD claims that Sweden's \"irresponsible\" immigration and asylum policies have subjected Sweden to an on-going \"long-term, albeit low-intensity crisis\". The SD official policy brief states that the party \"welcomes those who contribute to our [Sweden's] society, who follow our laws and respect our customs. On the other hand, anyone who comes here and exploits our systems, commits crimes or exposes our citizens to danger is not welcome\".\nHistorically, SD sought to repatriate most immigrants and ban immigration entirely; however, these policies were moderated in the 1990s before being abolished altogether. Presently, SD positions itself against mass immigration and wishes to strongly restrict immigration by instead giving generous support to those who do not want to assimilate into Swedish society to emigrate back to their country of origin. The SD also wants to change laws to allow for wider deportations of foreign residents who engage in illegal activity or are unemployed and abusing state welfare. The Sweden Democrats also call for an expansion of circumstances in which citizenship can be revoked from naturalized citizens, with Jimmie \u00c5kesson mentioning examples of those who commit crimes, engage in delinquency, support terrorism or remain socially unintegrated into society. The Sweden Democrats also support raising the remigration allowance given to migrants and asylum seekers who seek to voluntarily leave the country. The SD argues that its immigration policies are not based on xenophobia and that the party is not opposed to immigration per se, but believe immigration must stay at a level where it does not \"threaten national identity, the country's welfare or security\". SD has also campaigned to restrict immigration from what it calls \"culturally distant\" countries and argues that temporary work visas should be limited only to skills that are impossible to find in Sweden. SD are against free movement of labour within the European Union, calling on Sweden to revise its membership of the Schengen agreement, but support free movement between Nordic nations. The SD believes that Sweden will be better able to help refugees and economic migrants in their home areas once more state funds are freed from being directed towards funding immigration in Sweden. SD also favours cultural assimilation over integration of immigrants from non-Western backgrounds, arguing that integration is a meet in the middle approach and that Swedes should not have to bear the burden over what the party claims have been reckless immigration policies. Torbj\u00f6rn Kastell (former party secretary from 2003 to 2004) said in 2002 that the party wanted \"a multicultural world, not a multicultural society\".\nWhen handling asylum seekers and refugee cases, the SD supports protecting national sovereignty in regards to Sweden's decisions on migration and border control. The party calls for Sweden to adopt \"the principle of first safe country\" into its asylum laws, meaning that asylum seekers should only be able to seek refugee status in the first safe country that they arrive in and will be refused refugee status in Sweden if they have already crossed multiple safe countries or their case is already registered in a foreign state. Until such legislation is realized by the Riksdag, SD supports implementing stronger deterrents against asylum migration to Sweden through other countries and setting stricter limits on the right to welfare that asylum seekers are entitled to by the Swedish state and making cultural assimilation of those already in Sweden mandatory. The party opposes offering permanent residency to refugees, believing that temporary residency should be the standard for those who claim asylum in Sweden before a path to full residency or citizenship is considered. SD supports Sweden eventually accepting refugees exclusively through the UNHCR resettlement programme in accordance with a quota based on each municipality's capacity once Sweden's asylum laws are reformed and tightened. SD has also referred to the recommendations from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which state that the return of refugees should be the solution to refugee problems. On asylum cases from the Middle East and Africa, the party supports giving priority to persecuted Christian, former Muslim and other religious or sexual minorities fleeing war or death for apostasy, believing that such individuals are less likely to be offered refuge elsewhere. In 2017, members of the Sweden Democrats' leadership defended comments made by then US President Donald Trump in response to Trump's assertion that Sweden's immigration and asylum policies had led to a rise of terrorism and crime in Sweden. However, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the SD supported accepting and accommodating Ukrainian refugees in Sweden. Ahead of the 2022 Swedish general election, the party campaigned to tighten the rules in the Swedish Aliens Act (Utl\u00e4nningslagen) to the strictest possible level within European law and encourage voluntary remigration of asylum seekers and immigrants who are economically inactive or remain culturally unassimilated.\nThe SD also wants European governments to construct a security wall along the European border with Turkey in response to illegal immigration, terrorism and incursions by the Grey Wolves into Greece. It also calls on the European Union to commonly adopt a migration system based on the Australian model to prevent human trafficking across the Mediterranean, which the party states enables illegal immigrants and terrorists to reach Sweden. SD calls for compulsory measures for immigrants to be employed, live and work in Sweden for at least ten years, learn the Swedish language, go through a mandatory cultural assimilation program, and be subject to a language and social skills test before becoming eligible for Swedish citizenship. The party also supports increased spending on border patrol forces, zero tolerance laws on illegal immigration and foreign-born criminals, repatriations of Schengen Area migrants who move to Sweden to make a living from street begging, changes in the law to enable the government to strip foreign-born Swedish nationals of their citizenship if found guilty of a crime, penalties against employers who use foreign and undocumented labor to circumvent Swedish working conditions and stricter laws against family migration.\nIn recent years, the SDhas tried to approach the immigration policies of the Danish People's Party, which from 2001 to 2011 provided parliamentary support for the former Danish centre-right governments in return for a tightening of Danish immigration policies and stricter naturalisation laws. Following the 2022 Swedish general election, the Sweden Democrats achieved this objective under the Tid\u00f6 Agreement with the centre-right Moderate, Christian Democrat and Liberal Party coalition government. In exchange for SD parliamentary support, the Swedish government conceded to some of the SD's immigration policy demands on requirements for obtaining Swedish citizenship and expanding the deportation circumstances for foreign-born residents and asylum seekers.\nFollowing scenes of people in Swedish cities celebrating the October 7 attacks, the SD leadership stated that those who praised the attack should be expelled from the country and that the Tid\u00f6 Agreement clause on deporting non-citizens on grounds of poor character and not just criminal convictions should be used against those who support Hamas. SD also states that Swedes of foreign backgrounds who leave the country to join legally designated terrorist groups should be stripped of their citizenship or residency and denied re-entry into the country.\nSociety and crime.\nFamily policy.\nThe Sweden Democrats consider children raised in a nuclear family as the preferred option for the child's development. Those not raised by their biological parents should have the right to associate with or at least find out who they were. SD has been critical of adoption and artificial insemination for same-sex couples and polyamorous people.\nThe party also calls for a ban on child, polygamous and forced marriages, as well as harsher penalties for honor violence. It also supports a zero-tolerance stance against female genital mutilation within Sweden and abroad, and for perpetrators to be prosecuted or if necessary deported. SD also wants certain restrictions on male circumcision, calling for a ban on minors unless its for medical reasons. The party says that while it does support male circumcision for religious reasons, it should be performed at the age of consent and the state should not fund it through the healthcare system.\nSD supports abortion being legal in Sweden and free access to abortions up to the legal limit in Sweden which is 22 weeks since 2019.\nLGBT rights.\nThe party today fully supports legalization of same-sex marriage and civil unions for gay couples, but believes the ultimate decision to perform a wedding ceremony should be decided by the individual religious institution, rather than the state.\nThe SD previously opposed government sanctioned adoption to single people and same-sex couples, unless the adopting party are close relatives or already have a close relationship with the child, but has since shifted its stance to permitting same-sex adoption, and supports privately funded insemination for single or gay parents. Historically, members of SD have criticized a so-called \"Homosex Lobby\", but the party has since changed and moderated its position on LGBT in Swedish society. Party leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson has expressed concerns that what he describes as the gradual Islamisation of Sweden will eventually lead to the rights of sexual minorities being violated.\nThroughout the early 2000s, \"SD-Kuriren\" (the official SD party newspaper) regularly published articles criticizing LGBT events and describing homosexuality as \"perversion\", before moderating itself alongside a shift in party ideology. A blog post claiming Stockholm Pride sexualised young children and equating homosexuality with pedophilia titled (\"Soon enough we'll hit rock bottom\") was published by SD Party secretary Bj\u00f6rn S\u00f6der on 1 August 2007. The post was widely criticised in the Swedish media as an attack on LGBT people.\nAn unofficial pride parade called Pride J\u00e4rva was organised by SD member and former party magazine editor Jan Sjunnesson in the Stockholm suburbs of Tensta and Husby, two areas with large immigrant populations. The event was disavowed by the official Stockholm Pride organisation and the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights; in a joint statement, both organisations called Sjunnesson \"a person who's spreading hatred towards Muslims on social media [and] who's not supporting LGBT rights\". Approximately 30 people participated in Pride J\u00e4rva, with a larger amount of LGBT and heterosexual anti-racist counter-protestors arriving to oppose them. In 2014, the official Stockholm Pride voted to ban the SD from participating that year, which was met with criticism from both within the party and from some opposition politicians, who argued it was undemocratic.\nIn recent years, the SD has shifted its stance to being more supportive of LGBT rights and same-sex parenting by updating and expanding its policies regarding LGBT issues. In 2010, SD leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson and party vice-president Carina St\u00e5hl Herrstedt published an article apologizing for past homophobic statements made by party members, and arguing that mass immigration risked eroding the rights of Sweden's gay community. In its current platform, the SD states \"everyone must be treated equally, regardless of sexual orientation, and discrimination must be combated\". In a 2018 interview, SD member of the Riksdag and gender-equality spokesperson Paula Bieler stated that homophobes \"are not welcome in our party\". Since 2018, the SD party program has been updated to support same-sex adoption and parenting. In 2025, the SD proposed constructing a statue in \u00d6rebro, dedicated to Muhsin Hendricks, the world's first openly gay imam, who had been shot dead in his car in South Africa, to honour his work for the LGBTQI movement, as well as constructing a statue in Rinkeby to honour the rights of LGBTQI people in the area.\nThe SD supports gender-affirming surgery, as long as the motive behind it is mental wellbeing, and permission is given by a medical professional.\nGender studies scholars Karlberg, Korolczuk and S\u00e4ltenberg note that politicians representing the Sweden Democrats are among \"the primary actors advancing anti-gender discourses\" in Sweden, a discourse they argue contributes to an \"insidious de-democratization\" by targeting vulnerable groups.\nGender equality.\nSD opposes any \"negative or positive special treatment on the basis of gender, age, sexual orientation, nationality or ethnic origin\" in the labour market.\nThe party maintains that, collectively, there are biological differences between men and women, some of which that cannot be \"observed with the naked eye\". Perceived differences between men and women in regards to preference, behaviour and life choices exist due to each individual's choices and does not necessarily have to be \"problematic, the result of discrimination nor the result of an oppressive gender power structure\".\nChurch policies.\nThe party believes that the Church of Sweden should have a special position in Swedish society. In order to protect Swedish cultural heritage, members of the party want to protect the Lutheran tradition in the church elections and counteract secular party-political control of the Swedish Church. SD supports interfaith dialogue but opposes Qur'an recitals or imams delivering Islamic services in churches which the SD claims to be part of \"Islamizing Swedish society\". The SD previously called for the Church of Sweden to be reinstated as a state church but no longer supports this policy, however they continue to support holidays in connection with religious occasions to only include traditionally Swedish and Christian holidays with party leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson stating in a 2014 interview that he wants to protect Christianity as a \"system of norms\". In Swedish Church Assembly election campaigns, the SD has campaigned on the issue of Christians who are subjected to persecution and hate crimes in Sweden and abroad.\nLaw and order and security.\nThe Sweden Democrats support generally increased minimum sentences as well as increased resources and personnel for the police. SD wishes to instate the possibility of life imprisonment without parole for the worst crimes and to repatriate foreign citizens found guilty of serious crimes. SD also wants to establish a public register of individuals convicted of certain sexual crimes. The party also supports increased surveillance of those known to be involved in criminal gangs and terrorism. SD argues for a zero-tolerance law for people who physically attack police officers and emergency workers.\nSD previously supported the reinstatement of capital punishment before dropping it as an official policy after the party program was updated in 1998, although individuals within the party continue to support the death penalty for serious crimes such as murder and infanticide and have called for chemical castration of convicted child sexual abusers.\nThe SD opposes allowing Swedish citizens who joined ISIS to return to Sweden and argues that anyone who joins a foreign terrorist group should be denied state funded assistance. In 2023, SD also stated that Swedes who have travelled to the Gaza Strip to support Hamas should be banned from reentering the country. SD has also emphasised a desire to crack down on abuses and crimes of which the elderly are particular targets.\nIn 2025, the SD supported passing stricter ownership regulations on AR-15 rifles following the 2025 Risbergska school shooting although some senior party spokespeople expressed opposition to amending gun ownership laws citing the impact it could have on farmers and hunters.\nEconomy.\nThe Sweden Democrats have described themselves as supporters of the Swedish welfare state, labour rights and the public sector, but argue that welfare should be restricted to Swedish citizens and permanent residents. The party argues that foreign-born nationals must show proof of legal residence, paid taxes and financial self-support for a certain period to become eligible for welfare. In its platform, the SD claims that its economic policies are neither left or right-wing, but designed to improve conditions for small and medium-sized companies, self-employed citizens and entrepreneurs to boost employment and stimulate the economy, as opposed to what it describes as \"constructed jobs\" created by the state to reduce unemployment but hold no long term benefit for the Swedish economy or career paths for the people who work them. SD wants to abolish the Swedish Employment Service in its current form and replace it with a new authority for the supervision and close regulation of private employment services to ensure large corporations do not exploit or undercut Swedish workers. The party supports affordable and free access to public healthcare for Swedish nationals.\nSD supports certain free trade conditions but believe Sweden must exit or revise trade agreements that pose a threat to Sweden's sovereignty and Swedish workers. The party favours certain measures of economic protectionism and support state-ownership of companies that operate Swedish mines, agricultural land and produce energy or defense equipment. However, SD also support abolishing inheritance tax and reducing property tax. Since the 2010s, the SD has been critical of Chinese government involvement in infrastructure projects and trade deals with Sweden. SD wishes to lower the tax rate for the elderly, as well as increase subsidised housing for the elderly. SD also wishes to allocate additional resources to municipalities in order to provide seniors with greater food assistance and, in general, improve their quality of life.\nPolitical author Anders Backlund described the party as \"economically centrist\", leaning towards economic nationalism (in contrast to the other Swedish conservative parties who tend to favour open free markets and global cosmopolitan philosophies) and supporting a mixed market economy combining centre-left and centre-right ideas, as well as promoting \"welfare chauvinist\" policies which blend national-populism with socio-economics. According to political scientist Johan Martinsson: \"In economic terms, the party is more centrist and pragmatic, with a mixture of left and right-wing proposals\".\nEnvironment.\nThe party argues that, while Sweden should maintain its \"active role in global climate cooperation\", other countries should reduce their emissions, as it believes Sweden to already be doing enough on that front. The party opposed the Paris agreement, and advocates keeping nuclear power plants as a prominent energy source in Sweden, believing it to be an efficient way to mitigate climate change. They also advocate investing in climate research internationally and funding climate action on a global scale.\nAgriculture and forestry.\nSD supports creating a specialist law enforcement branch for animal welfare and call for stricter penalties against animal cruelty. In 2017, the SD members of the Riksdag Justice Committee filed a motion calling for extended prison sentences for those found guilty of animal abuse, which was ultimately supported by the other parties. The party opposes EU influence over domestic laws on hunting, farming and forestry within Sweden, calling for such policies to be decided upon by rural Swedes instead of Brussels. SD is also critical of non-stun animal slaughter and want to ban the import of goods that contradict Swedish animal welfare legislation.\nForeign policy.\nDefense.\nSD wants to increase the number of Swedish Army brigades to seven from 2021's two. The party has stated that it would seek to raise Sweden's defense spending to 2\u20132.5% of GDP.\nThe party supports closer military cooperation with neighboring Nordic countries and previously opposed Swedish membership of NATO, instead calling for an alignment without full membership. However, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine the SD leadership announced it would consider changing its policy to endorse NATO membership and support joining if Finland also applied for NATO membership. It subsequently voted in favor for NATO membership in the Riksdag.\nEuropean Union.\nThe Sweden Democrats support close political co-operation within the Nordic sphere, but are Eurosceptic and against further EU integration and cession of Swedish sovereignty to the European Union. The party states that it supports European political and economic co-operation to secure trade and combat cross-border organized crime, illegal immigration, Islamism, terrorism and environmental challenges but strongly opposes creating an EU army or policies that could lead to the creation of a Federal European Superstate. The party generally opposes all EU regulation over Swedish tax, pensions, environmental and domestic affairs and calls for the national sovereignty and cultural identity of European nations to be prioritized above the EU's political ambitions. SD rejects joining the Economic and Monetary Union by opposing the Euro currency and favors keeping the krona. They also seek to reduce Swedish financial contributions to Brussels, end Swedish participation in bailouts for other EU member states, renegotiate Swedish membership of the Schengen Agreement and opt-out of common asylum agreements, protect freedom of speech and the free access to the internet from EU copyright bills, and are against the accession of Turkey to the European Union.\nThe party has called for Sweden to renegotiate its membership of the EU and seeks an amendment to the Swedish constitution to make it mandatory that proposed EU treaties and financial transfers be first put to a public vote. The SD believes that if the EU cannot be reformed or attempts to transform itself into a Superstate, Sweden must immediately reconsider its membership via a referendum and prepare to leave the EU. The SD's youth-wing, the Young Swedes (), support a Swedish exit from the EU. In 2023, party leader \u00c5kesson and SD European Union spokesman Charlie Weimers unveiled a new EU strategy with the objective of achieving better negotiation results, increasing Swedish influence and stopping the EU from gaining more power by creating a referendum lock based on the UK European Union Act 2011 in the Riksdag to prevent transfer of powers to Brussels without a mandatory public vote. SD argues that a referendum lock should be used to prevent further EU expansion to include Turkey, Albania and Balkan states. The SD has also said it wants a Swedish exit from the EU be made possible by removing all references to membership in the constitution. In 2025, the Sweden Democrats stated that while they remain critical of the EU, they believe EU funds are necessary and pragmatic in the current climate for European military rearmament, with the party citing the war in Ukraine and deteriorating security situation between the United States and Europe.\nRussia.\nThe SD has taken a strongly pro-Ukraine position following the Russian invasion and has called on Sweden and Western governments to help the Ukrainian people defend their homeland. \u00c5kesson said in 2024 that SD stands fully behind Sweden's support for Ukraine, and that; \"We will continue to do so as long as the Ukrainian people fight their heroic fight.\" He also said that sees no limit on how much the EU should send to Ukraine, adding that he supports a future Ukrainian membership in the EU.\nIn 2022, an analysis of votes relating to Russia in the European Parliament found that the Sweden Democrats were the 10th-most critical party in the parliament having voted against Russian interests 93 percent of the time. The report found that among all Swedish parties the Sweden Democrats were the most critical of Russia. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the party got rid of members who had previously expressed support for Putin.\nMiddle East.\nThe Sweden Democrats are supportive of Israel. The party favors recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and proposes moving the Swedish embassy there. A study by the \"European Coalition for Israel\" documented that SD had the most pro-Israel voting record of the Swedish parties in the European Parliament. In 2021, the Israeli government stated that they did not maintain relations with the SD due to \"its roots in Nazism\" but by 2023 had dropped its non-cooperation stance after SD representatives signed a document of principle with Israeli ministers pledging to combat antisemitism. Between 2023 and 2024, a delegation of senior SD members visited Israel to hold meetings with Knesset politicians and discuss a cooperation pact with the Likud party. The party has also taken a strongly pro-Israel position following the outbreak of the Gaza war, supporting military action to remove Hamas and calling on the Swedish government to review all funding to Palestinian organizations which the SD accuse of spending aid money on terrorism.\nSD has advocated a \"neutral\" position on the Syrian civil war and sent a delegation to meet with Syrian officials in 2017.\nOther regions.\nIn 2011, SD was the only Swedish political party to vote against Swedish involvement in the 2011 military intervention in Libya. SD also supports the creation of an independent Kurdish state and for the Armenian genocide to be formally recognised by the international community. In 2019, SD-member Bj\u00f6rn S\u00f6der received the Mkhitar Gosh Medal by President Armen Sarksyan and Markus Wiechel received the Medal of Honour of the National Assembly of Armenia. These were the first Sweden Democrats to receive international awards for their political engagement. Since 2022, the SD has participated in bipartisan efforts to give more diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, and supported a motion in the Riksdag to change the name of Sweden's representative office in Taiwan to \"House of Sweden\". SD politician Markus Wiechel said the name change denotes that Sweden should treat Taiwan as a nation rather than a disputed territory or a province of China. Wiechel also proposed giving military support to Taiwan and said SD sees Taiwan as an independent state. Three SD-members of Parliament (Markus Wiechel, Bj\u00f6rn S\u00f6der and Nima Gholam Ali Pour) received \"Certificate of Appreciation\", an award from Taipei Mission in Sweden because of their commitment to strengthen Swedish-Taiwanese relations. SD politician and MEP Charlie Weimers also enhanced Taiwan-EU relations through his motion, which got approval in the European Parliament on closer cooperation between Taiwan and EU.\nOrganization.\nInternal structure.\nThe Sweden Democrats are made up of 16 districts of local party associations with executive boards. Each district consists of a number of municipal associations, which may include one or more municipalities. In municipalities that are not covered by a municipal association, the party organises its members as \"working groups\" instead. The SD also has a centralized national board permanently chaired by the party leader and party secretary and whose other members are elected by the SD's membership base.\nWithin the SD there is a women's branch SD-Women and an affiliated youth-wing Young Swedes SDU which was founded in 2015. The SD's first youth-wing was founded in 1993 as the \"Sweden Democratic Youth Association\" before it was renamed the Sweden Democratic Youth (SDU). The old SDU was disbanded in 1995 due to extremism problems before it was reconstituted in 1998. Many prominent SD politicians including party leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson were members of the SDU. In 2015, the SD announced it would expel the leadership of the SDU from the mother party and officially sever ties with it due to ongoing controversies with its members. The party subsequently created the Young Swedes SDU as a replacement.\nFollowing the 2010 Swedish general election, the SD created its own security unit which by 2014 consisted of an estimated 60 people. SD states that the unit is intended to handle internal issues within the party, including cybersecurity, to marshal public events and to encourage members to report external threats to the police. The SD has argued the security wing is necessary due to threats against SD politicians and highlighted a 2012 report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention which found one in two of every local SD politician had experienced some form of threat, harassment or physical violence, and that SD legislators were statistically twice as more likely to be threatened than members of other parties. SD reported 95 instances of threats or violence against elected officials to the police and Riksdag security in 2012.\nAssociated organisations and media.\nSince its founding, the SD has published its own newspaper which was previously known as and then until 2003. Party secretary Richard Jomshof currently serves as the paper's editor. In 2014, the party also launched an online magazine ('Contemporary'). It is currently edited by Swedish economist Dick Erixon.\nIn 2020, Mattias Karlsson, the former group leader of the Sweden Democrats in the Riksdag founded Oikos, a conservative think-tank. Expo has alleged the think-tank to be an \"extension of the Sweden Democrats' political project\" supposedly also receiving funding from the party although the group itself claims to be non-partisan.\nIn 2020, the party also helped to launch a web based TV channel called Riks, through their wholly owned online magazine , with the ambition that the media channel should not be an official party TV. However, in a 2024 investigatory expos\u00e9 conducted by TV4\u2019s investigatory branch, Kalla fakta, it was discovered that Riks and the SD are in a close-knit relationship with each other. For example, the expos\u00e9 showed that Riks rents its office spaces from the Sweden Democrats, and that members of the SD and Riks come into frequent contact with one another, moving freely between each other's offices. Moreover, the SD's communications department instructed Riks to hide any connection to SD before an \"Expressen\" interview with Dick Erixon in Riks' offices. In addition to that, the programme showed that the SD's communications department used anonymous social media accounts to artificially disseminate Riks' posts and YouTube videos.\nVoter demography.\nAccording to Statistics Sweden's (SCB) 2017 party preference survey, the Sweden Democrats (SD) have a stronger support among men than among women. There is no noticeable difference in support for the party among different age groups. The support for SD is greater among native born than among foreign born. Since 2014 the SD has substantially increased its support among both foreign-born and foreign-background voters, becoming the third largest party in Sweden also among this demographic by 2017. Sympathies are greater for the party among persons with primary and secondary education than among those with a higher education.\nA study by \"Aftonbladet\" in 2010 found that 14%of SD members were of immigrant origin, which matches the share of foreign-born inhabitants of Sweden, while their vote share in this population group has always been lower. For the 2010 election in the municipality of S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje (Stockholm County), SDwas the only party with a majority of immigrants on its electoral list, mostly Assyrians from the Middle East. Polling7.31%(3,447 votes), SD'smunicipal list in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje got 5of the65 municipal seats. Since 2014, the SD has seen growing support from foreign-born Swedish voters, and was estimated to have become the third most popular party for voters of immigrant backgrounds by 2017. In recent years, politicians of ethnic minority and immigrant backgrounds have become increasingly active in the party, with notable examples including Nima Gholam Ali Pour, Kent Ekeroth, Sara Gille and Rashid Farivar.\nInternational relations.\nIn its early days, the Sweden Democrats was known to associate itself with both native Swedish and wider European extreme-right activist groups and political parties. In 1997, the Sweden Democrats made connections with the French National Front (FN) and Jean-Marie Le Pen after SD spokesman Johan Rinderheim participated in the conference that established Le Pen's \"Euronat\" initiative and the SD received support from the FN in 1998. The SD also founded the \"NordNat\" alliance of Nordic nationalist parties in 1997 which also contained the Finnish Patriotic People's Movement, the Danish and the Fatherland Party of Norway, but otherwise the SD did not actively seek formal relationships outside of Sweden. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the SD began distancing itself from extreme-right parties. The SD broke ties with Euronat in 1998 and NordNat in 1999 and became more influenced by the neighboring Danish People's Party (DF). By the late 2000s the SD said it had ceased regarding the National Front as a role model and instead saw the DF as a sister party. In 2010, party secretary Bj\u00f6rn S\u00f6der published an article disowning the SD's older connections to extreme or neo-fascist groups or individuals like Le Pen and said SD was more focused on Sweden's issues over interacting with foreign parties. The party has also been active within counter-jihad networks, explicitly from 2007 to 2011.\nIn Europe, SD has had some contacts with the Austrian FP\u00d6, the Dutch Party for Freedom and Forum for Democracy, the Flemish Vlaams Belang and the now defunct Belgian People's Party over the early 2010s. The Danish People's Party was initially indifferent on collaborating with the SD until 2010 when Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard travelled to Sweden to help with the party's general election campaign. Shortly after, Danish People's Party foreign affairs spokesman S\u00f8ren Espersen hosted the SD's conference and said both parties would work together in the Nordic Council. Before the European election of 2014 there was some speculation that the SD would enter a grouping with other European nationalist parties led by Marine Le Pen. SD politicians confirmed they had had met with representatives from the proposed group but said the talks were informal. The Danish People's Party reportedly threatened to end ties with SD if they joined the group, stating that while they were willing to work with the SD and the Dutch Freedom Party, they opposed inclusion of parties like the National Front and the FP\u00d6. However, after the election the SD began to distance itself from other European far-right parties and elected to become a member of the more moderate Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group with the UK Independence Party. The SD was also active in the European Alliance for Freedom and the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe (ADDE) Euro parties with members of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). In 2016, Marine Le Pen stated that the Sweden Democrats were no longer in official cooperation with her party.\nIn 2015, SD began forging closer relations with the Danish People's Party, and in 2018 announced an official cooperation pact with the Finns Party, which had previously distanced itself from the SD. All three parties are members of the Nordic Freedom group in the Nordic Council. Politicians of the Norwegian Progress Party have called for official collaboration with the SD, although the Progress Party's leadership has traditionally not supported any partnership and turned down joining with the Sweden Democrats on the Nordic Council. In 2022, Progress Party leader Sylvi Listhaug officially endorsed the SD during the 2022 Swedish general election and said that while her party shares common ground with the Sweden Democrats on immigration and law &amp; order policies, differences in economic views prevented her from forming a direct alliance with the SD.\nThe SD maintained cooperation with the Alternative for Germany party under Frauke Petry's leadership when both parties sat with the EFDD group and were members of the ADDE alliance, with Jimmie \u00c5kesson describing the AfD as the SD's \"sister party\" in Germany during the 2017 German federal election. However, \u00c5kesson has since distanced the SD from statements made by some AfD politicians and by 2024 said the AfD was no longer ideologically compatible with his party.\nSince 2018, the SD has been a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR Group) and the European Conservatives and Reformists Party and presently sits alongside Brothers of Italy, the Czech Civic Democratic Party, Spanish Vox party, the Flemish N-VA, Polish Law and Justice, the Finns Party and JA21 from the Netherlands. In 2019, there was discussions on whether the SD would join a new group with the Danish People's Party headed by Matteo Salvini's Lega Nord. However, \u00c5kesson said SD was not invited to join a new European Parliament group and would stay with the ECR but suggested this may have been due to his party's reluctance to cooperate with Le Pen and pro-Putin parties in Europe. In 2024, the SD sought to distance itself from Hungary's Fidesz citing what they perceive as Viktor Orb\u00e1n's soft stance on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine and threatened to leave the ECR if Fidesz joined unless Orb\u00e1n demonstrated a more pro-NATO and Putin-critical position. However, the Sweden Democrats later softened its stance against Fidesz and said it was open to working with the party in the European Parliament, but maintained it would not cooperate with Alternative for Germany and cast doubt on an alliance with the French National Rally.\nIn July 2024, the Sweden Democrats formed the European Parliament 'Nordic Freedom' alliance within the ECR along with the Denmark Democrats and the Finns Party, citing common stances on opposing Russian influence, reducing the EU's intervention into the market, and a desire to participate in governments.\nOutside of the EU, SD has had informal contacts with the British Conservative Party and the US Republican Party. Individual politicians of the Norwegian Progress Party have also called for more collaboration with the SD. The SD has also sought to improve and build relations with Israel's Likud which had previously turned down meetings with the SD due to the party's past. In 2024, the SD and Likud began official cooperation with each other.\nPublic profile and controversies.\nEarly image.\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, several outspoken far-right and Nazi advocates were involved with the party. It was founded by, among others, the Swedish Waffen-SS veteran Gustaf Ekstr\u00f6m and members of both older Nazi and neo-Nazi organisations. In its early days, the SD also had a reputation for attracting biker and skinhead gangs to its rallies before disconnecting itself with neo-Nazi and skinhead movements in the mid-1990s. The party had flyers printed by the French National Front in the 1998 general election, and was financially backed for the 2004 European election by Belgian businessman and racial conspiracy theorist Bernard Mengal. In the 1990s, the party was a member of the \"Euronat\" initiative which was set up by Jean-Marie Le Pen before severing ties with it in 1999. In 1999, the party program was updated to state its opposition to Nazism: \"The Sweden Democrats reject with the same contempt Nazism, whose leitmotif is the Fuhrer principle, racial superiority and aggressive war, and which can be seen as a mirror image of and a reaction to Marxism.\" In 2005, the SD acknowledged that it had contained people with extreme political views at the time of its establishment but denied that it was founded as a neo-Nazi party or had ever endorsed fascist and national socialist ideas in its manifesto. As part of the moderation process, the Sweden Democrats began expelling extreme far-right members from the early 2000s onwards and in 2010 updated the party constitution to include clauses against racism, extremism and criminal behaviour. Since the 2010s, the SD has also sought to distance itself from far-right parties in Europe, including turning down an invitation to join an alliance in the European Parliament with the French National Front in 2014 and choosing to ally themselves with more moderate parties during the 2014 and 2019 European elections.\nIn June 2025, the SD leadership issued an official apology for the party's historical links to neo-fascist and neo-Nazi figures and groups, with SD spokesman Mattias Karlsson stating \"That there have been clear expressions of antisemitism and support for National Socialist ideas in my party's history, I think, is disgusting and reprehensible. I would like to reiterate the party's apology, above all to Swedish citizens of Jewish descent who may have felt a strong sense of insecurity and fear for good reasons.\"\nIsolation in parliament.\nBoth before and after the 2010 Swedish general election all the major parties, including the Swedish Social Democrats and the Moderate Party, declared they would not collaborate or work with the Sweden Democrats. The move was described by international pundits as an unofficial \"cordon sanitaire\". The policy of non-cooperation was kept in place for the 2014 Swedish general election. However, at a local level other parties from the Moderates to the Left Party have collaborated or voted in favour of SD initiatives. Following the 2018 general election, which saw the disintegration of the centre-right Alliance, Christian Democrats leader Ebba Busch and Moderates leader Ulf Kristersson signaled an end to the non-cooperation policy and began talks with the SD. The policy of non-cooperation was officially scrapped by the Moderates, Christian Democrats and The Liberals for the 2022 election when all four parties signed the Tid\u00f6 Agreement.\nMedia boycotts.\nThe Sweden Democrats have complained about difficulties buying advertising space before elections due to the media banning the party from advertising and have accused media outlets of political bias and trying to censor or limit the party's campaign messages during elections. This has been criticised by free speech organisations in Sweden and abroad. On 16 June 2006, \"Dagens Nyheter\" and \"Svenska Dagbladet\" decided to stop their boycott. \"Expressen\", however, still retains a ban on Sweden Democrat advertising. During the 2010 Swedish general election, broadcaster TV4 refused to air a Sweden Democrats campaign video which depicted a Swedish pensioner being outrun by burka-clad women with prams. TV4's decision was criticized by both free speech advocates and politicians from Denmark, including by Danish People's Party leader Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard, Venstre and the Conservative People's Party (the latter of whom reacted to TV4's decision to ban the video by calling for international election observers to be sent to Sweden), and by members of the Norwegian Progress Party who called the decision a \"violation of democratic rules\". The SD subsequently uploaded the video to YouTube where it was viewed over a million times. Swedish political journalist Hanne Kj\u00f6ller argued that attempts to censor the SD in 2010 by the media and left-wing protest groups ultimately backfired and ended up emboldening their support by giving them more publicity.\nMuhammad cartoon debate.\nAfter the Danish daily newspaper \"Jyllands-Posten\" published twelve cartoons depicting Muhammad and ignited a controversy during the2005 autumn and winter, the Sweden Democrats gave their unreserved support to the publication with reference to the freedom of speech. SDstated that it saw no reason why a Danish newspaper should be forced to abide by Muslim rules and prohibitions regarding expression. When the boycott of Danish products was launched in the Middle East, SDlaunched a \"Buy Danish\" campaign in support of Danish workers. In 2006 SD entered the Muhammad cartoon debate by publishing a cartoon depicting Muhammad on its youth league (SDU) and \"SD-Kuriren\" () websites. The cartoon showed Muhammad from behind holding a mirror in front of his face. However, instead of any facial features, the mirror showed only a blank head. The cartoon was captioned \"Muhammad's Face\" ( ).\nThe publication attracted the attention of the Swedish government, which informed internet service provider \"Levonline\" about the SD's publications. Subsequently, \"Levonline\" shut down SD's web page. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds, denied any direct interference. However, at the same time, Laila Freivalds condemned the publication as a provocation. Freivalds then resigned from the Persson Cabinet after being accused of interference with press freedom and lying about such actions.\nThis event spurred debate on government censorship in Sweden. The Sweden Democrats also had a hate speech charge filed against them due to the posted caricature. Similar hate speech charges were filed against other Swedish publishers who had depicted Muhammad. However, these charges were immediately deemed to be unfounded by the Swedish Chancellor of Justice.\nThe Sweden Democrats originally planned to publish a set of cartoons in their newspaper \"SD-Kuriren\". However, after the controversy erupted, Jimmie \u00c5kesson issued a statement on SD's website on 9 February 2006, stating that they would refrain from further publications online and in print, due to concerns that publishing might spur hostile actions against Swedes and Swedish interests.\nThe shutdown of the Sweden Democrats' websites was reported to the Committee on the Constitution by the Liberal People's Party leader Lars Leijonborg. SD filed complaints against the Security Service (\"S\u00e4po\") and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with the \"Justitiekansler\" and \"Justitieombudsmannen\", alleging that the government's interference was unconstitutional. The spokesperson of the Green Party, Peter Eriksson, also criticised the involvement of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the event.\nRacist incidents and expulsions.\nThe Sweden Democrats have, among all Swedish parliamentary parties, had the largest share of elected municipal representatives resign since the 2010 elections (27.8%). Many of these resignations were brought on by racist statements or actions by these representatives.\nIn November 2012, party spokesperson Erik Almqvist resigned after he had been caught on tape making racist and sexist statements. In November 2012, parliamentarian Lars Isovaara resigned after accusing two people of foreign origin of stealing his bag (which Isovaara had left at a restaurant) and then proceeding to verbally abuse a security guard of a foreign background. Isovaara's replacement in parliament, Markus Wiechel, was found in April 2013 to have referred to a group of black people as \"monkeys\" in a Facebook comment back in 2011. Wiechel later apologised and stated the comment had been in reference to a video of a tribal witch burning in Africa.\nIn March 2013, 12 individuals were thrown out of the party for their involvement in neo-Nazi or other extremist movements. In November 2013, parliamentarian and then vice party leader Jonas \u00c5kerlund gained attention for having called immigrants \"parasites\" during a broadcast on SD's own radio station in 2002, after the recording was publicly rediscovered. In his defence, \u00c5kerlund stated that he only said it to provoke people. In September 2014, the party chairman of the local Stockholm branch, Christoffer Dulny was asked to resign from his position after it was found he had previously posted mocking comments about immigrants, calling them \"shameless liars\" on alternative media sites. He also resigned from parliament on the same day.\nIn October 2016, a video of the parliamentarian and economic policy spokesperson Oscar Sj\u00f6stedt laughing at antisemitic jokes was released by a former school friend of his who also accused Sj\u00f6stedt of chanting fascist slogans. Whilst at a party believed to have been organized by the neo-Nazi group \"Info-14\" in 2011 when Sj\u00f6stedt was a member of the SD's youth wing, he laughingly told a story about former co-workers with Nazi sympathies mocking Jews and comparing them to sheep. Following an investigation by the SD, Sj\u00f6stedt stated that a friend had invited him to the party but he had walked out upon discovering who had organized it and denied expressing fascist statements. During the same month, the parliamentarian and second deputy party leader Carina Herrstedt was confronted with having sent an allegedly racist, antisemitic, homophobic and anti-romanyist email to her then spouse in 2011. The email, which had been leaked from the party's internal servers, for instance contained phrases that referred to black football players from the team Landskrona BoIS as \"negroes\" whilst also picturing Romani people as thieves. The email was meant to be playful and ironic, Herrstedt said to Aftonbladet.\nBetween 2015 and 2016, various members of the party were expelled from the SD for expressing extremist or racist views, or because of disagreement with the party's shift towards moderation and social conservatism. In April 2015, the Sweden Democratic Youth leaders were also expelled for these reasons, and the organisation was dissolved shortly after with the mother party issuing a warning for remaining SDU members to leave the youth wing or be expelled from the party. In December 2016, the parliamentarian Anna Hagwall was thrown out of the party after using arguments associated with antisemitism to argue for a bill that she introduced in parliament intended to reduce concentration of media ownership in Sweden.\nIn September 2017, a report from \"Dagens ETC\" found that 14 former municipal representatives of the party had infiltrated the SD in order to financially support the Nordic Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi organisation, through financial transactions, memberships, or purchases of antisemitic and racist literature or souvenirs. In August 2018, 2 members were kicked out due to purchases of Nazi memorabilia online; following the expulsions, Michael Erlandsson, one of the SD's spokespeople, publicly stated that people who \"have these types of views and share these types of materials\" have no place in the party and that the SD maintains a zero-tolerance stance on expressing fascist views. 14 candidates were expelled from the party as well after being exposed as former members of neo-Nazi organisations. Referring to the latest expulsions, SD leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson declared that the party \"works extremely hard to keep clean\".\nIn 2017, Martin Strid, party spokesman in Borl\u00e4nge, appeared to state at a televised SD rally that Muslims were not \"fully human\" and humane. Strid's comments were met with condemnation within the SD. \u00c5kesson and SD party secretary Richard Jomshof described them as racist, with Jomshof stating the SD advocates ideological criticism, but not violating human rights. SD board member Aron Emilsson said that Strid would face a disciplinary meeting for violating the party's code of conduct. In response, Strid said he had expressed himself \"clumsily\" but chose to quit the party after being given an ultimatum to resign or be expelled.\nIn March 2022, parliamentarian Roger Richthoff was sacked from his role as party defense spokesman and subsequently expelled from the SD and banned by the party from standing as a candidate for them in the 2022 Swedish general election after posting controversial comments on Twitter, including sharing a video supporting Russia in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in which several antisemitic conspiracy theories were presented.\nResearcher on Nordic nationalism Benjamin R. Teitelbaum described the present day version Sweden Democrats as paradoxical compared to other European nationalist parties on the issues of racism and radicalism among its members. Teitelbaum notes that in contrast to other Nordic and wider European populist parties, the SD differs by having a past rooted in white nationalism and extremism, but in the present day is comparably more proactive in rejecting ethno-nationalism and expelling members who make racist statements to the point where he considers the SD to be on the \"softer side\" of national-populism. Similar observations were made by British conservative author Douglas Murray who described the SD as undergoing one of the most significant transformations on the European political right from a party on the fringes that openly pushed extreme tendencies to a more mainstream movement that draws on diverse support. Kate\u0159ina Li\u0161an\u00edkov\u00e1 argued that out of all the parties in Sweden, the SD was more likely to attract individual members who made extreme statements regarding immigrants but this was a consequence of the SD being the only party in the Riksdag willing to challenge the political consensus on immigration for several years as opposed to the SD itself being an extremist or racist party.\nAshley Fox, leader of the British Conservative MEPs, praised the Sweden Democrats regarding the party's policy decisions on the expulsion of extremist and racist members: \"Over the past decade the Sweden Democrats have made progress in reforming themselves, expelling any members displaying unacceptable views or behaviour and diversifying their party base.\"\nIron pipe scandal.\nOn November 14, 2012, Erik Almqvist, in addition to party spokesperson Kent Ekeroth and party official Christian Westling were filmed arming themselves with iron pipes before they sought out a confrontation with Soran Ismail, a Swedish comedian of Kurdish descent.\nSplinter parties.\nSince the SD's inception, breakaway parties have been formed by former SD members, many of whom were either removed from the party due to controversial actions or resigned after the SD began to ideologically shift and moderate itself.\nIn 1995, former SD spokesman Leif Zeilon established the Homeland Party along with other founding members of the SD after Anders Klarstr\u00f6m was replaced as party chairman by a less hardline leadership.\nIn 2001, a major breakaway occurred when the more radical ethno-nationalist faction of the SD's national board and their supporters were collectively expelled and formed the National Democrats party.\nOn 18 March 2018, Alternative for Sweden (AfS) was formed by former members of the SD's old youth wing after they were kicked out of the party after alleged ties with extremist groups and for coming into conflict with the mother party. Three SD parliamentarians joined Alternative for Sweden but all lost their seats during the 2018 general election. AfS's policies have been criticised as too extreme by members of the SD such as Henrik Vinge.\nLobbying.\nThe Sweden Democrats came under fire in 2015 for changing their position on profits made by private welfare companies. Before the election in 2014 they favored having restrictions on the amount of profit that welfare companies could take and use for their own gain. Since the election, they have favored the approach of the Alliance parties, that is higher and more restrictive quality standards. This has been suspected to be because of extensive lobbying done by the organisation Svenskt N\u00e4ringsliv among others. The story was discovered by the Swedish newspaper \"Dagens Industri\" on 14 September 2015. SD has denied all accusations of corruption.\nAnonymous social media accounts.\nOn May 7, 2024, one month prior to the 2024 EU elections, the TV4 investigative journalism program ('Hard Facts') premiered a two-part documentary (, 'Undercover in the Troll Factory') revealing that the Sweden Democrats systematically used anonymous accounts on social media platforms such as TikTok, X and Facebook. The scoop was obtained through the use of the wallraff method where a reporter spent five months as an employee at the previously SD-owned YouTube channel Riks as well as the party's communications department, documenting internal discussions on the party's communication strategies. The documentary revealed that at least 23 anonymous social media accounts were actually run from SD's communications department, spreading xenophobic content and satirical attacks on opposing politicians from other parties, including deepfake videos. According to , posts from these accounts reached 27 million views across social media platforms. SD's head of communication, Joakim Wallerstein, repeated earlier claims that the party does not run any anonymous social media accounts. However, according to Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, internal communication reveals that Wallerstein already in 2012 wanted to include anonymous internet campaigns as part of the party's strategy.\nIn an official response from the Sweden Democrats' leader Jimmie \u00c5kesson, the documentary was dismissed as a \"gigantic, domestic influence operation by the left-liberal establishment\". In numerous interviews, SD representatives toned down the content posted on the anonymous accounts as simple satire and humor material. Following the documentary, and the party's response to it, SD received massive criticism from all other Swedish parliamentary parties. The government parties accused SD of not following the Tid\u00f6 Agreement, which contains a clause about showing respect towards other parties. After a meeting on May 16, SD agreed that some of the anonymous accounts' posts went against the agreement and agreed to delete 45 posts. They did not agree to stop running anonymous accounts but said they would use a softer tone towards parties in the Tid\u00f6 coalition.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "65880", "revid": "41957735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65880", "title": "Cassette tape", "text": "Magnetic audio tape recording format\nThe cassette tape, also called Compact Cassette, audio cassette, or simply \"tape\" or \"cassette\", is an analog magnetic tape recording format for audio recording and playback. Invented by Lou Ottens and his team at the Dutch company Philips, the Compact Cassette was introduced in August 1963.\nCassette tapes come in two forms, either containing content as a prerecorded cassette (\"Musicassette\"), or as a fully recordable \"blank\" cassette. Both forms have two sides and are reversible by the user. Although other tape cassette formats have also existed\u2014for example the Microcassette\u2014the generic term \"cassette tape\" is normally used to refer to the Compact Cassette because of its ubiquity.\nFrom 1983 to 1991, the cassette tape was the most popular audio format for new music sales in the United States.\nCassette tapes contain two miniature spools, between which the magnetically coated, polyester-type plastic film (magnetic tape) is passed and wound\u2014essentially miniaturizing reel-to-reel audio tape and enclosing it, with its reels, in a small case (cartridge)\u2014hence \"cassette\". These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell which is at its largest dimensions. The tape itself is commonly referred to as \"eighth-inch\" tape, supposedly wide, but actually slightly larger, at . Two stereo pairs of tracks (four total) or two monaural audio tracks are available on the tape; one stereo pair or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the tape is moving in one direction and the second (pair) when moving in the other direction. This reversal is achieved either by manually flipping the cassette when the tape comes to an end, or by the reversal of tape movement, known as \"auto-reverse\", when the mechanism detects that the tape has ended.\nHistory.\nPrecursors.\nAfter the Second World War, magnetic tape recording technology proliferated across the world. In the United States, Ampex, using equipment obtained in Germany as a starting point, began commercial production of reel-to-reel tape recorders. First used by broadcast studios to pre-record radio programs, tape recorders quickly found their way into schools and homes. By 1953, one million U.S. homes had tape machines, and several major record labels were releasing select titles on prerecorded reel-to-reel tapes.\nIn 1958, following four years of development, RCA introduced the RCA tape cartridge, which enclosed 60 minutes (30 minutes per side) of stereo quarter-inch reel-to-reel tape within a plastic cartridge that could be utilized on a compatible tape recorder/player without having to thread the tape through the machine. This format was not very successful, and RCA discontinued it in 1964.\nDevelopment and release.\nIn the early 1960s, Philips tasked two teams to design a high-quality tape cartridge for home use, using thinner and narrower tape than that used in reel-to-reel tape recorders. A team at its Vienna factory, which had experience with dictation machines, developed the \"Einloch-Kassette\", or single-hole cassette, with Grundig. At the same time, a team in Hasselt led by Lou Ottens developed a two-hole cassette under the name \"Pocket Recorder\".\nPhilips selected the two-spool cartridge as a winner and introduced the 2-track 2-direction mono version in Europe on 28 August 1963 at the Berlin Radio Show, and in the United States (under the \"Norelco\" brand) in November 1964. The same year, mass production of blank compact cassettes began in Hanover. Philips also offered a machine to play and record the cassettes, the Philips \"Typ EL 3300\". An updated model, \"Typ EL 3301\" was offered in the U.S. in November 1964 as Norelco \"Carry-Corder 150\". The trademark name \"Compact Cassette\" came a year later.\nFollowing rejection of the \"Einloch-Kassette\", Grundig developed the DC-International (DC standing for \"Double Cassette\") based on drawings of the Compact Cassette, introducing it in 1965 as companies were competing to establish their format as the worldwide standard. After yielding to pressure from Sony to license the Compact Cassette format to them free of charge, Philips' format achieved market dominance, with the DC-International cassette format being discontinued in 1967, just two years after its introduction.\nPhilips improved on the Compact Cassette's original design to release a stereo version. By 1966 over 250,000 compact cassette recorders had been sold in the U.S. alone. Japanese manufacturers soon became the leading source of recorders. By 1968, 85 manufacturers had sold over 2.4 million mono and stereo units. By the end of the 1960s, the cassette business was worth an estimated $150 million, and by the early 1970s compact cassette machines were outselling other types of tape machines by a large margin.\nPopularity of music cassettes.\nPrerecorded music cassettes (also known as \"Music-Cassettes\", and later just Musicassettes) were launched in Europe in late 1965. The Mercury Record Company, a US affiliate of Philips, introduced Musicassettes to the US in July 1966. The initial offering consisted of 49 titles.\nThe compact cassette format was initially designed for dictation and portable use, and the audio quality of early players was not well-suited for music. In 1971, the Advent Corporation introduced their Model 201 tape deck that combined Dolby type B noise reduction and chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) tape, with a commercial-grade tape transport mechanism supplied by the Wollensak camera division of 3M Corporation. This resulted in the format being taken more seriously for musical use, and started the era of high fidelity cassettes and players.\nBritish record labels began releasing Musicassettes in October 1967, and they exploded as a mass-market medium after the first Walkman, the TPS-L2, went on sale on 1 July 1979, as cassettes provided portability, which vinyl records could not. While portable radios and boom boxes had been around for some time, the Walkman was the first truly personal portable music player, one that not only allowed users to listen to music away from home, but to do so in private. According to the technology news website The Verge, \"the world changed\" on the day the TPS-L2 was released. Stereo tape decks and boom boxes became some of the most highly sought-after consumer products of both decades, as the ability of users to take their music with them anywhere with ease led to its popularity around the globe.\nLike the transistor radio in the 1950s and 1960s, the portable CD player in the 1990s, and the MP3 player in the 2000s, the Walkman defined the portable music market for the decade of the '80s, with cassette sales overtaking those of LPs. Total vinyl record sales remained higher well into the 1980s due to greater sales of singles, although cassette singles achieved popularity for a period in the 1990s. Another barrier to cassettes overtaking vinyl in sales was shoplifting; compact cassettes were small enough that a thief could easily place one inside a pocket and walk out of a shop without being noticed. To prevent this, retailers in the US would place cassettes inside oversized \"spaghetti box\" containers or locked display cases, either of which would significantly inhibit browsing, thus reducing cassette sales.\nDuring the early 1980s some record labels sought to solve this problem by introducing new, larger packages for cassettes which would allow them to be displayed alongside vinyl records and compact discs, or giving them a further market advantage over vinyl by adding bonus tracks. Willem Andriessen wrote that the development in technology allowed \"hardware designers to discover and satisfy one of the collective desires of human beings all over the world, independent of region, climate, religion, culture, race, sex, age and education: the desire to enjoy music at any time, at any place, in any desired sound quality and almost at any wanted price\". Critic Robert Palmer, writing in \"The New York Times\" in 1981, cited the proliferation of personal stereos as well as extra tracks not available on LP as reasons for the surge in popularity of cassettes.\nCassettes' ability to allow users to record content in public also led to a boom in bootleg cassettes made at live shows in the 1980s. The Walkman dominated the decade, selling up to 350 million units. So synonymous did the name \"Walkman\" become with all portable music players\u2014with a German dictionary at one point defining the term as such without reference to Sony\u2014that the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that Sony, which had not sought to have the publisher of that dictionary retract that definition, could not prevent other companies from using that name, as it had now become genericized. As a result of this, a number of Sony's competitors produced their own version of the Walkman. Others made their own branded tape players, like JVC, Panasonic, Sharp, and Aiwa, the second-largest producer of the devices.\nBetween 1985, when cassettes overtook vinyl, and 1992, when they were overtaken by CDs (introduced in 1983 as a format that offered greater storage capacity and more accurate sound), the cassette tape was the most popular format in the United States and the UK. Record labels experimented with innovative packaging designs. A designer during the era, Brian Cannon, explained: \"There was so much money in the industry at the time, we could try anything with design.\" The introduction of the cassette single, called a \"cassingle\", was also part of this era and featured a music single in Compact Cassette form. Until 2005, cassettes remained the dominant medium for purchasing and listening to music in some developing countries, but compact disc (CD) technology had superseded the Compact Cassette in the vast majority of music markets throughout the world by this time.\nCassette culture.\nCompact cassettes served as catalysts for social change. Their small size, durability and ease of copying helped bring underground rock and punk music behind the Iron Curtain, creating a foothold for Western culture among the younger generations. Likewise, in Egypt cassettes empowered an unprecedented number of people to create culture, circulate information, and challenge ruling regimes before the internet became publicly accessible.\nOne of the political uses of cassette tapes was the dissemination of sermons by the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini throughout Iran before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, in which Khomeini urged the overthrow of the regime of the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. During the military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u20131990) a \"cassette culture\" emerged where blacklisted music or music that was by other reasons not available as records was shared. Some pirate cassette producers created brands such as \"Cumbre y Cuatro\" that have in retrospect received praise for their contributions to popular music. Armed groups such as Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Patriotic Front (FPMR) and the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) made use of cassettes to spread their messages.\nCassette technology was a booming market for pop music in India, drawing criticism from conservatives while at the same time creating a huge market for legitimate recording companies, as well as pirated tapes. Some sales channels were associated with cassettes: in Spain filling stations often featured a display selling cassettes. While offering also mainstream music these cassettes became associated with genres such as Gipsy rhumba, light music and joke tapes that were common in the 1970s and 1980s.\nDecline.\nDespite sales of CDs overtaking those of prerecorded cassettes in the early 1990s in the U.S., the format remained popular for specific applications, such as car audio, personal stereos, boomboxes, telephone answering machines, dictation, field recording, home recording, and mixtapes well into the decade. Cassette players were typically more resistant to shocks than CD players, and their lower fidelity was not considered a serious drawback in mobile use. With the introduction of electronic skip protection it became possible to use portable CD players on the go, and automotive CD players became viable. CD-R drives and media also became affordable for consumers around the same time.\nBy 1993, annual shipments of CD players had reached 5 million, up 21% from the year before; while cassette player shipments had dropped 7% to approximately 3.4 million. Sales of pre-recorded music cassettes in the US dropped from 442 million in 1990 to 274,000 by 2007. For audiobooks, the final year that cassettes represented more than 50% of total market sales was 2002 when they were replaced by CDs as the dominant media.\nThe last new car with an available cassette player was a 2014 TagAZ AQUiLA. Four years prior, Sony had stopped the production of personal cassette players. In 2011, the Oxford English Dictionary removed the phrase \"cassette player\" from its 12th edition Concise version, which prompted some media sources to mistakenly report that the term \"cassette tape\" was being removed.\nIn India, music continued to be released on the cassette format due to its low cost until 2009.\n21st century.\nAlthough portable digital recorders are most common today, analog tape remains a desirable option for certain artists and consumers. Underground and DIY communities release regularly, and sometimes exclusively, on cassette format, particularly in experimental music circles and to a lesser extent in hardcore punk, death metal, and black metal circles, out of a fondness for the format. Even among major-label stars, the form has at least one devotee: Thurston Moore stated in 2009, \"I only listen to cassettes.\" By 2019, few companies still made cassettes. Among those are National Audio Company, from the US, and Mulann, also known as Recording The Masters, from France.\nSony announced the end of cassette Walkman production on 22 October 2010, a result of the emergence of MP3 players such as Apple's iPod. As of 2022, Sony uses the Walkman brand solely for its line of digital media players.\nThe 2010 Lexus SC430 was the last automobile sold new in North America with a compact cassette player as standard equipment.\nIn 2010, Botswana-based Diamond Studios announced plans for establishing a plant to mass-produce cassettes in a bid to combat piracy. It opened in 2011.\nIn South Korea, the early English education boom for toddlers encourages a continuous demand for English language cassettes, as of 2011,[ [update]] due to the affordable cost.\nNational Audio Company in Missouri, the largest of the few remaining manufacturers of audio cassettes in the US, oversaw the mass production of the \"Awesome Mix #1\" cassette from the film \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" in 2014. They reported that they had produced more than 10 million tapes in 2014 and that sales were up 20 percent the following year, their best year since they opened in 1969. In 2016, cassette sales in the United States rose by 74% to 129,000. In 2018, following several years of shortage, National Audio Company began producing their own magnetic tape, becoming the world's first known manufacturer of an all-new tape stock. Mulann, a company which acquired Pyral/RMGI in 2015 and originates from BASF, also started production of its new cassette tape stock in 2018, basing on reel tape formula.\nIn Japan and South Korea, the pop acts Seiko Matsuda, SHINee, and NCT 127 released their material on limited-run cassettes. In Reiwa era Japan, the revived popularity of cassette tapes is an example of Showa retro. As of 2021, Maxell was selling 8 million cassette tapes per year in Japan.\nIn the mid-to-late 2010s, cassette sales saw a modest resurgence concurrent with the vinyl revival. As early as 2015, the retail chain Urban Outfitters, which had long sold LPs, started selling new pre-recorded cassettes (both new and old albums), blank cassettes, and players. In 2016, cassette sales increased, a trend that continued in 2017 and 2018. In the UK, sales of cassette tapes in 2021 reached its highest number since 2003.\nCassettes are favored by some artists and listeners, including those of older genres of music such as dansband, as well as independent and underground artists, some of whom were releasing new music on tape by the 2020s, including Britney Spears and Busta Rhymes. Reasons cited for this include tradition, low cost, the DIY ease of use, and a nostalgic fondness for how the format's imperfections lend greater vibrancy to low-fi, experimental music, despite the lack of the \"full-bodied richness\" of vinyl.\nTape types.\nCassette tapes are made of a polyester-type plastic film with a magnetic coating. The original magnetic material was based on gamma ferric oxide (Fe2O3). c.\u20091970, 3M Company developed a cobalt \"volume-doping\" process combined with a double-coating technique to enhance overall tape output levels. This product was marketed as \"High Energy\" under its Scotch brand of recording tapes. Inexpensive cassettes commonly are labeled \"low-noise\", but typically are not optimized for high frequency response. For this reason, some low-grade IEC Type I tapes have been marketed specifically as better suited for data storage than for sound recording.\nIn 1968, DuPont, the inventor of a chromium dioxide (CrO2) manufacturing process, began commercialization of CrO2 media. The first CrO2 cassette was introduced in 1970 by Advent, and later strongly backed by BASF, the inventor and longtime manufacturer of magnetic recording tape. Next, coatings using magnetite (Fe3O4) such as TDK's Audua were produced in an attempt to approach or exceed the sound quality of vinyl records. Cobalt-\"adsorbed\" iron oxide (Avilyn) was introduced by TDK in 1974 and proved very successful. \"Type IV\" tapes using pure metal particles (as opposed to oxide formulations) were introduced in 1979 by 3M under the trade name Metafine. The tape coating on most cassettes sold as of 2024 are either \"normal\" or \"chrome\" consists of ferric oxide and cobalt mixed in varying ratios (and using various processes); there are very few cassettes on the market that use a pure (CrO2) coating.\nSimple voice recorders and earlier cassette decks are designed to work with standard ferric formulations. Newer tape decks usually are built with switches and later detectors for the different bias and equalization requirements for higher grade tapes. The most common are iron oxide tapes (as defined by the IEC 60094 standard).\nNotches on top of the cassette shell indicate the type of tape. Type I cassettes have only write-protect notches, Type II have an additional pair next to the write protection ones, and Type IV (metal) have a third set near the middle of the top of the cassette shell. These allow later cassette decks to detect the tape type automatically and select the proper bias and equalization.\nFeatures.\nThe cassette was the next step following reel-to-reel audio tape recording, although, because of the limitations of the cassette's size and speed, it initially compared poorly in quality. Unlike the 4-track stereo open-reel format, the two stereo tracks of each side lie adjacent to each other, rather than being interleaved with the tracks of the other side. This permitted monaural cassette players to play stereo recordings \"summed\" as mono tracks and permitted stereo players to play mono recordings through both speakers. The tape is wide, with each mono track wide, plus an unrecorded guard band between each track. In stereo, each track is further divided into a left and a right channel of each, with a gap of . The tape moves past the playback head at , the speed being a continuation of the increasingly slower speed series in open-reel machines operating at , , or . For comparison, the typical open-reel 4-track consumer format used tape that is wide, each track wide, and running at either twice or four times the speed of a cassette.\nVery simple cassette recorders for dictation purposes did not tightly control tape speed and relied on playback on a similar device to maintain intelligible recordings. For accurate reproduction of music, a tape transport incorporating a capstan and pinch roller system was used, to ensure tape passed over the record/playback heads at a constant speed.\nLocating write-protect notches.\nIf the cassette is held with one of the labels facing the user and the tape opening at the bottom, the write-protect notch for the corresponding side is at the top-left.\nTape length.\nTape length usually is measured in minutes of total playing time. Many of the varieties of blank tape were C60 (30 minutes per side), C90 (45 minutes per side) and C120 (60 minutes per side). Maxell makes 150-minute cassettes (UR-150) - 75 minutes per side. The C46 and C60 lengths typically are thick, but C90s are and (the less common) C120s are just thick, rendering them more susceptible to stretching or breakage. Even C180 tapes were available at one point.\nOther lengths are (or were) also available from some vendors, including C10, C12 and C15 (useful for saving data from early home computers and in telephone answering machines), C30, C40, C50, C54, C64, C70, C74, C80, C84, C94, C100, C105, C110, and C150. As late as 2010, Thomann still offered C10, C20, C30 and C40 IEC Type II tape cassettes for use with 4- and 8-track portastudios.\nTrack width.\nThe full tape width is 3.8\u00a0mm. For mono recording the track width is 1.5\u00a0mm. In stereo mode each channel has width of 0.6\u00a0mm with a 0.3\u00a0mm separation to avoid crosstalk.\nHead gap.\nThe head-gap width is 2\u00a0\u03bcm which gives a theoretical maximum frequency of about 12\u00a0kHz (at the standard speed of 1 7/8 ips or 4.76\u00a0cm/s). A narrower gap would give a higher frequency limit but also weaker magnetization.\nCassette tape adapter.\nCassette tape adapters allow external audio sources to be played back from any tape player, but were typically used for car audio systems. An attached audio cable with a phone connector converts the electrical signals to be read by the tape head, while mechanical gears simulate reel to reel movement without actual tapes when driven by the player mechanism.\nThere are also other type of cassette adapters, like Bluetooth Adapter Cassette or MP3 player cassette. They have a small battery inside and can be used by simply inserting them in a cassette player. Most of them also turn on when the cassette player is set on Play, by a small switch under the head in the cassette adapter. Most have a reel to reel gear for simulating the move of tape, otherwise, the player will either stop or reverse. Most adapters operate one side, although some may operate on both sides.\nOptional mechanical elements.\nIn order to wind up the tape more reliably, the former BASF (from 1998 EMTEC) patented the Special Mechanism or Security Mechanism advertised with the abbreviation SM in the early 1970s, which was temporarily used under license by Agfa. This feature each includes a rail to guide the tape to the spool and prevent an uneven roll from forming.\nFlaws.\nMagnetic tape is not an ideal medium for long-term archival storage, as it begins to degrade after 10 \u2013 20 years.\nA common mechanical problem occurs when a defective player or resistance in the tape path causes insufficient tension on the take-up spool. This would cause the magnetic tape to be fed out through the bottom of the cassette and become tangled in the mechanism of the player. In these cases, the player was said to have \"eaten\" or \"chewed\" the tape, often destroying the playability of the cassette.\nCassette recorders.\nThe first cassette machines (e.g. the Philips EL 3300, introduced in August 1963)\nOne innovation was the front-loading arrangement. Pioneer's angled cassette bay and the exposed bays of some Sansui models eventually were standardized as a front-loading door into which a cassette would be loaded. Later models would adopt electronic buttons, and replace conventional meters (which could be driven over full scale when overloaded, a condition called \"pegging the needle\" or simply \"pegging\") with electronic LED or vacuum fluorescent displays, with level controls typically being controlled by either rotary controls or side-by-side sliders.\nApplications for car stereos varied widely. Auto manufacturers in the US typically would fit a cassette slot into their standard large radio faceplates. Europe and Asia would standardize on DIN and double DIN sized faceplates. In the 1980s, a high-end installation would have a Dolby AM/FM cassette deck, and they rendered the 8-track player obsolete in car installations because of space, performance, and audio quality. In the 1990s and 2000s, as the cost of building CD players declined, many manufacturers offered a CD player. The CD player eventually supplanted the cassette deck as standard equipment, but some cars, especially those targeted at older drivers, were offered with the option of a cassette player, either by itself or sometimes in combination with a CD slot. Most new cars can still accommodate aftermarket cassette players, and the auxiliary jack advertised for MP3 players can be used also with portable cassette players, but 2011 was the first model year for which no American manufacturer offered factory-installed cassette players.\nApplications.\nAudio.\nThe Compact Cassette originally was intended for use in dictation machines. In this capacity, some later-model cassette-based dictation machines could also run the tape at half speed () as playback quality was not critical. The cassette soon became a medium for distributing prerecorded music\u2014initially through the Philips Record Company (and subsidiary labels Mercury and Philips in the US). As of 2009, one still found cassettes used for a variety of purposes, such as journalism, oral history, meeting and interview transcripts, audio books, and so on. Police are still big buyers of cassette tapes, as some lawyers \"don't trust digital technology for interviews\". However, they are starting to give way to Compact Discs and more \"compact\" digital storage media. Prerecorded cassettes were also employed as a way of providing chemotherapy information to recently diagnosed cancer patients as studies found anxiety and fear often gets in the way of the information processing.\nThe cassette quickly found use in the commercial music industry. One artifact found on some commercially produced music cassettes was a sequence of test tones, called SDR (Super Dynamic Range, also called XDR, or eXtended Dynamic Range) soundburst tones, at the beginning and end of the tape, heard in order of low frequency to high. These were used during SDR/XDR's duplication process to gauge the quality of the tape medium. Many consumers objected to these tones since they were not part of the recorded music.\nLeveraging high-speed duplication machines manufactured by companies such as Telex, Otari, and Sony, cassettes were widely used by the Christian faith community for sermon duplication during the 1970s-1990s. One ministry claims a quantity and distribution of \"almost 9 million cassettes in 42 languages\". Duplication was obsoleted during the 1980s-1990s when Compact Disc duplication and compressed digital audio files were popularized.\nMultitrack recording.\nMultitrack recorders utilizing the compact cassette were introduced beginning in 1979 with the TEAC 144 Portastudio. In the simplest configuration, rather than playing a pair of stereo channels of each side of the cassette, the typical portastudio used a four-track tape head assembly to access four tracks on the cassette at once (with the tape playing in one direction). Each track could be recorded to, erased, or played back individually, allowing musicians to overdub themselves and create simple multitrack recordings easily, which could then be mixed down to a finished stereo version on an external machine. To increase audio quality in these recorders, the tape speed sometimes was doubled to , in comparison to the standard ; additionally, dbx, Dolby B or Dolby C noise reduction provided compansion (compression of the signal during recording with equal and opposite expansion of the signal during playback), which yields increased dynamic range by lowering the noise level and increasing the maximum signal level before distortion occurs. Multi-track cassette recorders with built-in mixer and signal routing features ranged from easy-to-use beginner units up to professional-level recording systems. Cassette-based multitrack recorders are credited with launching the home recording revolution.\nHome dubbing.\nMost cassettes were sold blank, and used for recording (dubbing) the owner's records (as backup, to play in the car, or to make mixtape compilations), their friends' records, or music from the radio. This practice was condemned by the music industry with such alarmist slogans as \"Home Taping Is Killing Music\". However, many claimed that the medium was ideal for spreading new music and would increase sales, and strongly defended their right to copy at least their own records onto tape. For a limited time in the early 1980s Island Records sold chromium dioxide \"One Plus One\"\nVarious legal cases arose surrounding the dubbing of cassettes. In the UK, in the case of \"CBS Songs v. Amstrad\" (1988), the House of Lords found in favor of Amstrad that producing equipment that facilitated the dubbing of cassettes, in this case a high-speed twin cassette deck that allowed one cassette to be copied directly onto another, did not constitute copyright infringement by the manufacturer. In a similar case, a shop owner who rented cassettes and sold blank tapes was not liable for copyright infringement even though it was clear that his customers likely were dubbing them at home. In both cases, the courts held that manufacturers and retailers could not be held accountable for the actions of consumers.\nAs an alternative to home dubbing, in the late 1980s, the Personics company installed booths in record stores across America that allowed customers to make personalized mixtapes from a digitally encoded back-catalogue with customised printed covers.\nData recording.\nFloppy disk storage had become the standard data storage medium in the United States by the mid-1980s; for example, by 1983 the majority of software sold by Atari Program Exchange was on floppy. Cassette remained more popular for 8-bit computers such as the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, MSX, and Amstrad CPC 464 in many countries such as the United Kingdom (where 8-bit software was mostly sold on cassette until that market disappeared altogether in the early 1990s). Reliability of cassettes for data storage is inconsistent, with many users recalling repeated attempts to load video games; the Commodore Datasette used very reliable, but slow, digital encoding. In some countries, including the United Kingdom, Poland, Hungary, and the Netherlands, cassette data storage was so popular that some radio stations would broadcast computer programs that listeners could record onto cassette and then load into their computer. See BASICODE.\nThe cassette was adapted into what is called a streamer cassette (also known as a \"D/CAS\" cassette), a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the top edge of the cassette. Streamer cassettes also have a re-usable write-protect tab on only one side of the top edge of the cassette, with the other side of the top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence only one side of the cassette being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 250 kilobytes to 600 megabytes of data.\nRivals and successors.\nTechnical development of the cassette effectively ceased when digital recordable media, such as DAT and MiniDisc, were introduced in the late 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, with Dolby S recorders marking the peak of Compact Cassette technology. Anticipating the switch from analog to digital format, major companies, such as Sony, shifted their focus to new media. In 1992, Philips introduced the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), a DAT-like tape in almost the same shell as a Compact Cassette. It was aimed primarily at the consumer market. A DCC deck could play back both types of cassettes. Unlike DAT, which was accepted in professional usage because it could record without lossy compression effects, DCC failed in home, mobile and professional environments, and was discontinued in 1996.\nThe microcassette largely supplanted the full-sized cassette in situations where voice-level fidelity is all that is required, such as in dictation machines and answering machines. Microcassettes have in turn given way to digital recorders of various descriptions. Since the rise of cheap CD-R discs, and flash memory-based digital audio players, the phenomenon of \"home taping\" has effectively switched to recording to a Compact Disc or downloading from commercial or music-sharing websites.\nBecause of consumer demand, the cassette has remained influential on design, more than a decade after its decline as a media mainstay. As the Compact Disc grew in popularity, cassette-shaped audio adapters were developed to provide an economical and clear way to obtain CD functionality in vehicles equipped with cassette decks but no CD player. A portable CD player would have its analog line-out connected to the adapter, which in turn fed the signal to the head of the cassette deck. These adapters continue to function with MP3 players and smartphones, and generally are more reliable than the FM transmitters that must be used to adapt CD players and digital audio players to car stereo systems. Digital audio players shaped as cassettes have also become available, which can be inserted into any cassette player and communicate with the head as if they were normal cassettes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65886", "revid": "910180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65886", "title": "Microphone", "text": "Device that converts sound into an electrical signal\nA microphone, colloquially called a mic (), or mike, is a transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal. Microphones are used in telecommunication, sound recording, broadcasting, and consumer electronics, including telephones, hearing aids, and mobile devices.\nSeveral types of microphone are used today, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal. The most common are the dynamic microphone, which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the condenser microphone, which uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate; and the contact microphone, which uses a crystal of piezoelectric material. Microphones typically need to be connected to a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded or reproduced.\nHistory.\nIn order to speak to larger groups of people, a need arose to increase the volume of the human voice. The earliest devices used to achieve this were acoustic megaphones. Some of the first examples, from fifth-century-BC Greece, were theater masks with horn-shaped mouth openings that acoustically amplified the voice of actors in amphitheaters. Between 1664 and 1685, the English physicist Robert Hooke was the first to experiment with a medium other than air with the invention of an early telephone made of stretched wire with a cup attached at each end. Today, this is known as a tin-can telephone.\nIn 1856, Italian inventor Antonio Meucci developed a dynamic microphone based on the generation of electric current by moving a coil of wire to various depths in a magnetic field. This method of modulation was also the most enduring method for the technology of the telephone as well. Speaking of his device, Meucci wrote in 1857, \"It consists of a vibrating diaphragm and an electrified magnet with a spiral wire that wraps around it. The vibrating diaphragm alters the current of the magnet. These alterations of current, transmitted to the other end of the wire, create analogous vibrations of the receiving diaphragm and reproduce the word.\"\nIn 1861, German inventor Johann Philipp Reis built an early sound transmitter (the \"Reis telephone\") that used a metallic strip attached to a vibrating membrane that would produce intermittent current. Better results were achieved in 1876 with the \"liquid transmitter\" design in early telephones from Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray \u2013 the diaphragm was attached to a conductive rod in an acid solution. These systems, however, gave a very poor sound quality.\nThe first microphone that enabled proper voice telephony was the (loose-contact) carbon microphone. This was independently developed by David Edward Hughes in England and Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison in the US. Although Edison was awarded the first patent in mid-1877 (after a long legal dispute), Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention. The Berliner microphone found commercial success through the use by Alexander Graham Bell for his telephone and Berliner became employed by Bell. The carbon microphone was critical in the development of telephony, broadcasting and the recording industries. Thomas Edison refined the carbon microphone into his carbon-button transmitter of 1886. This microphone was employed at the first radio broadcast ever, a performance at the New York Metropolitan Opera House in 1910.\nIn 1916, E.C. Wente of Western Electric developed the next breakthrough with the first condenser microphone. In 1923, the first practical moving coil microphone was built. The Marconi-Sykes magnetophone, developed by Captain H. J. Round, became the standard for BBC studios in London. This was improved in 1930 by Alan Blumlein and Herbert Holman who released the HB1A and was the best standard of the day.\nAlso in 1923, the ribbon microphone was introduced, another electromagnetic type, believed to have been developed by Harry F. Olson, who applied the concept used in a ribbon speaker to making a microphone. Over the years these microphones were developed by several companies, most notably RCA that made large advancements in pattern control, to give the microphone directionality.\nThe introduction of the Neumann U 47 in 1949 was a turning point for microphone technology. It was the first studio condenser microphone to use a large dual-diaphragm capsule with switchable pickup patterns and a vacuum tube amplifier, setting a new standard for high-fidelity, warm, and detailed vocal and instrument recording. With television and film technology booming there was a demand for high-fidelity microphones and greater directionality. Electro-Voice responded with their Academy Award-winning shotgun microphone in 1963.\nThe Shure SM57 was introduced in 1965 and revolutionized the recording of instruments and amplified live music. The SM57 utilized the Unidyne III capsule to deliver clear and distortion-free sound. Its compact and rugged design allowed it to be positioned in close proximity to drums and amplifiers. It has become one of the top selling microphones in history.\nVarieties.\nMicrophones are categorized by their transducer principle (condenser, dynamic, etc.) and by their directional characteristics (omni, cardioid, etc.). Sometimes other characteristics such as diaphragm size, intended use or orientation of the principal sound input to the principal axis (end- or side-address) of the microphone are used to describe the microphone.\nCondenser.\nThe condenser microphone, invented at Western Electric in 1916 by E. C. Wente, is also called a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone\u2014capacitors were historically called condensers. The diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and audio vibrations produce changes in the distance between the plates. Because the capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to the distance between them, the vibrations produce changes in capacitance. These changes in capacitance are used to measure the audio signal. The assembly of fixed and movable plates is called an \"element\" or \"capsule\".\nCondenser microphones span the range from telephone mouthpieces through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal and are now the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology is due to the very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave compared to other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work.\nCondenser microphones require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage and is also needed to power the microphone electronics. Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns, such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example, the R\u00f8de NT2000 or CAD M179.\nThere are two main categories of condenser microphones, depending on the method of extracting the audio signal from the transducer: DC-biased microphones, and radio frequency (RF) or high frequency (HF) condenser microphones.\nDC-biased condenser.\nWith a DC-biased condenser microphone, the plates are biased with a fixed charge (\"Q\"). The voltage maintained across the capacitor plates changes with the vibrations in the air, according to the capacitance equation (C = &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;Q\u2044V), where Q = charge in coulombs, C = capacitance in farads and V = potential difference in volts. A nearly constant charge is maintained on the capacitor. As the capacitance changes, the charge across the capacitor does change very slightly, but at audible frequencies it is sensibly constant. The capacitance of the capsule (around 5 to 100\u00a0pF) and the value of the bias resistor (100\u00a0M\u03a9 to tens of G\u03a9) form a filter that is high-pass for the audio signal, and low-pass for the bias voltage. Note that the time constant of an RC circuit equals the product of the resistance and capacitance.\nWithin the time frame of the capacitance change (as much as 50\u00a0ms at 20\u00a0Hz audio signal), the charge is practically constant and the voltage across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. The voltage across the capacitor varies above and below the bias voltage. The voltage difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the series resistor. The voltage across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no voltage gain as the voltage differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels.\nRF condenser.\nRF condenser microphones use a comparatively low RF voltage, generated by a low-noise oscillator. The signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by the sound waves moving the capsule diaphragm, or the capsule may be part of a resonant circuit that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal. Demodulation yields a low-noise audio frequency signal with a very low source impedance. The absence of a high bias voltage permits the use of a diaphragm with looser tension, which may be used to achieve wider frequency response due to higher compliance. The RF biasing process results in a lower electrical impedance capsule, a useful by-product of which is that RF condenser microphones can be operated in damp weather conditions that could create problems in DC-biased microphones with contaminated insulating surfaces. The Sennheiser MKH series of microphones use the RF biasing technique. A covert, remotely energized application of the same physical principle called the Thing was devised by Soviet Russian inventor Leon Theremin and used to bug the US Ambassador's residence in Moscow between 1945 and 1952.\nElectret condenser.\nAn electret microphone is a type of condenser microphone invented by Gerhard Sessler and James West at Bell laboratories in 1962. The externally applied charge used for a conventional condenser microphone is replaced by a permanent charge in an electret material. An electret is a ferroelectric material that has been permanently electrically charged or \"polarized\". The name comes from \"electrostatic\" and \"magnet\"; a static charge is embedded in an electret by the alignment of the static charges in the material, much the way a permanent magnet is made by aligning the magnetic domains in a piece of iron.\nDue to their good performance and ease of manufacture, hence low cost, the vast majority of microphones made today are electret microphones; a semiconductor manufacturer estimates annual production at over one billion units. They are used in many applications, from high-quality recording and lavalier (lapel mic) use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones. Prior to the proliferation of MEMS microphones, nearly all cell-phone, computer, PDA and headset microphones were electret types.\nUnlike other capacitor microphones, they require no polarizing voltage, but often contain an integrated preamplifier that does require power. This preamplifier is frequently phantom powered in sound reinforcement and studio applications. Monophonic microphones designed for personal computers (PCs), sometimes called multimedia microphones, use a 3.5\u00a0mm plug as usually used for stereo connections; the ring, instead of carrying the signal for a second channel, carries power.\nValve microphone.\nA valve microphone is a condenser microphone that uses a vacuum tube (valve) amplifier. They remain popular with enthusiasts of tube sound.\nDynamic.\nThe dynamic microphone (also known as the moving-coil microphone) works via electromagnetic induction. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high gain before feedback, makes them popular for on-stage use.\nDynamic microphones use the same dynamic principle as in a loudspeaker, only reversed. A small movable induction coil, positioned in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet, is attached to the diaphragm. When sound enters through the windscreen of the microphone, the sound wave moves the diaphragm which moves the coil in the magnetic field, producing a varying voltage across the coil through electromagnetic induction.\nRibbon.\nRibbon microphones use a thin, usually corrugated metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is electrically connected to the microphone's output, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical signal. Ribbon microphones are similar to moving coil microphones in the sense that both produce sound by means of magnetic induction. Basic ribbon microphones detect sound in a bi-directional (also called figure-eight, as in the diagram below) pattern because the ribbon is open on both sides. Also, because the ribbon has much less mass, it responds to the air velocity rather than the sound pressure. Though the symmetrical front and rear pickup can be a nuisance in normal stereo recording, the high side rejection can be used to advantage by positioning a ribbon microphone horizontally, for example above cymbals, so that the rear lobe picks up sound only from the cymbals. The figure-eight response of a ribbon microphone is ideal for Blumlein pair stereo recording. Other directional patterns are produced by enclosing one side of the ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic RCA Type 77-DX microphone has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from figure-eight to unidirectional. \nA good low-frequency response in older ribbon microphones could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials, have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. \nIn common with other classes of dynamic microphones, ribbon microphones do not require phantom power; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones (i.e. those without the aforementioned preamplifier) are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power.\nCarbon.\nThe carbon microphone was the earliest type of microphone. The carbon button microphone (also known as the Berliner or Edison microphone) uses a capsule or button containing carbon granules pressed between two metal plates. A voltage is applied across the metal plates, causing a small current to flow through the carbon. One of the plates, the diaphragm, vibrates in sympathy with incident sound waves, applying a varying pressure to the carbon. The changing pressure deforms the granules, causing the contact area between each pair of adjacent granules to change, and this causes the electrical resistance of the mass of granules to change. The changes in resistance cause a corresponding change in the current flowing through the microphone, producing the electrical signal. Carbon microphones were once commonly used in telephones; they have extremely low-quality sound reproduction and a very limited frequency response range but are very robust devices. The Boudet microphone, which used relatively large carbon balls, was similar to the granule carbon button microphones.\nUnlike other microphone types, the carbon microphone can also be used as a type of amplifier, using a small amount of sound energy to control a larger amount of electrical energy. Carbon microphones found use as early telephone repeaters, making long-distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tubes. Called a Brown's relay, these repeaters worked by mechanically coupling a magnetic telephone receiver to a carbon microphone: the faint signal from the receiver was transferred to the microphone, where it modulated a stronger electric current, producing a stronger electrical signal to send down the line.\nPiezoelectric.\nA crystal microphone or piezo microphone uses the phenomenon of piezoelectricity\u2014the ability of some materials to produce a voltage when subjected to pressure\u2014to convert vibrations into an electrical signal. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with vacuum tube (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders. Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10\u00a0M\u03a9) of the vacuum tube input stage well. They were difficult to match to early transistor equipment and were supplanted by dynamic microphones, and later small electret condenser devices. The high impedance of the crystal microphone made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the connecting cable.\nPiezoelectric transducers are often used as contact microphones to amplify sound from acoustic musical instruments, to sense drum hits and trigger electronic samples, and to record sound in challenging environments, such as underwater under high pressure. Saddle-mounted pickups on acoustic guitars are typically piezoelectric devices that contact the strings passing over the saddle. This type of microphone is different from magnetic coil pickups commonly visible on typical electric guitars, which use magnetic induction, rather than mechanical coupling, to pick up vibration.\nFiber-optic.\nA fiber-optic microphone converts acoustic waves into electrical signals by sensing changes in light intensity, instead of sensing changes in capacitance or magnetic fields as with conventional microphones.\nDuring operation, light from a laser source travels through an optical fiber to illuminate the surface of a reflective diaphragm. Sound vibrations of the diaphragm modulate the intensity of light reflecting off the diaphragm in a specific direction. The modulated light is then transmitted over a second optical fiber to a photodetector, which transforms the intensity-modulated light into analog or digital audio for transmission or recording. Fiber-optic microphones possess high dynamic and frequency range, similar to the best high-fidelity conventional microphones.\nFiber-optic microphones do not react to or influence any electrical, magnetic, electrostatic or radioactive fields (this is called EMI/RFI immunity). The fiber-optic microphone design is therefore ideal for use in areas where conventional microphones are ineffective or dangerous, such as inside industrial turbines or in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment environments.\nFiber-optic microphones are robust, resistant to environmental changes in heat and moisture, and can be produced for any directionality or impedance matching. The distance between the microphone's light source and its photodetector may be up to several kilometers without need for any preamplifier or another electrical device, making fiber-optic microphones suitable for industrial and surveillance acoustic monitoring.\nFiber-optic microphones are used in very specific application areas such as for infrasound monitoring and noise cancellation. They have proven especially useful in medical applications, such as allowing radiologists, staff and patients within the powerful and noisy magnetic field to converse normally, inside the MRI suites as well as in remote control rooms. Other uses include industrial equipment monitoring and audio calibration and measurement, high-fidelity recording and law enforcement.\nLaser.\nA laser beam is aimed at the surface of a window or other plane surface that is affected by sound. The vibrations of this surface change the angle at which the beam is reflected, and the motion of the laser spot from the returning beam is detected and converted to an audio signal. In a more robust and expensive implementation, the returned light is split and fed to an interferometer, which detects movement of the surface by changes in the optical path length of the reflected beam. The former implementation is a tabletop experiment; the latter requires an extremely stable laser and precise optics. Laser microphones have been studied for their ability to detect sound vibrations on distant surfaces.\nAn experimental type of laser microphone is a device that uses a laser beam and smoke or vapor to detect sound vibrations in free air. On August 25, 2009, US patent 7,580,533 issued for a Particulate Flow Detection Microphone based on a laser-photocell pair with a moving stream of smoke or vapor in the laser beam's path. Sound pressure waves cause disturbances in the smoke that in turn cause variations in the amount of laser light reaching the photodetector. A prototype of the device was demonstrated at the 127th Audio Engineering Society convention in New York City from 9 through October 12, 2009.\nLiquid.\nEarly microphones did not reproduce intelligible speech until Alexander Graham Bell made improvements, including a variable-resistance water microphone and transmitter. Bell's water transmitter consisted of a metal cup filled with water with a small amount of sulfuric acid added. A sound wave caused the diaphragm to move, forcing a needle to move up and down in the water. The electrical resistance between the wire and the cup was then inversely proportional to the size of the water meniscus around the submerged needle. Elisha Gray filed a patent caveat for a version using a brass rod instead of the needle. Other minor variations and improvements were made to the water microphone by Majoranna, Chambers, Vanni, Sykes, and Elisha Gray, and one version was patented by Reginald Fessenden in 1903. These were the first working microphones, but they were impractical for commercial applications. The famous first phone conversation between Bell and Watson took place using a water microphone.\nMEMS.\nThe MEMS microphone is also called a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A pressure-sensitive diaphragm is etched directly into a silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques and is usually accompanied with an integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the condenser microphone design. Digital MEMS microphones have built-in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip, making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. Major manufacturers producing MEMS silicon microphones are Cirrus Logic, InvenSense (product line sold by Analog Devices), Akustica, Infineon, Knowles Electronics, Memstech, Sonion MEMS, Vesper, AAC Acoustic Technologies, and Omron.\nIn the 2010s, piezoelectric MEMS microphones were developed. These are a significant architectural and material change from existing condenser-style MEMS designs.\nPlasma.\nIn a plasma microphone, an experimental form of microphone, a plasma arc of ionized gas is used. The sound waves cause variations in the pressure around the plasma, in turn causing variations in temperature, which alter the conductance of the plasma. These variations in conductance can be picked up as variations superimposed on the electrical supply to the plasma.\nSpeakers as microphones.\nA loudspeaker, a transducer that turns an electrical signal into sound waves, is the functional opposite of a microphone. Since a conventional speaker is similar in construction to a dynamic microphone (with a diaphragm, coil and magnet), speakers can actually work \"in reverse\" as microphones. Reciprocity applies, so the resulting microphone has the same impairments as a single-driver loudspeaker: limited low- and high-end frequency response, poorly controlled directivity, and low sensitivity. In practical use, speakers are sometimes used as microphones in applications where high bandwidth and sensitivity are not needed such as intercoms, walkie-talkies or video game voice chat peripherals, or when conventional microphones are in short supply.\nHowever, there is at least one practical application that exploits those weaknesses: the use of a medium-size woofer placed closely in front of a \"kick drum\" (bass drum) in a drum set to act as a microphone. A commercial product example is the Yamaha Subkick, a woofer shock-mounted into a 10\" drum shell used in front of kick drums. Since a relatively massive membrane is unable to transduce high frequencies while being capable of tolerating strong low-frequency transients, the speaker is often ideal for picking up the kick drum while reducing bleed from the nearby cymbals and snare drums.\nCapsule design and directivity.\nThe inner elements of a microphone are the primary source of differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.\nPolar patterns.\nA microphone's directionality or polar pattern indicates how sensitive it is to sounds arriving at different angles about its central axis. The polar patterns illustrated above represent the locus of points in polar coordinates that produce the same signal level output in the microphone if a given sound pressure level (SPL) is generated from that point. How the physical body of the microphone is oriented relative to the diagrams depends on the microphone design. For large-membrane microphones such as in the Oktava (pictured above), the upward direction in the polar diagram is usually perpendicular to the microphone body, commonly known as \"side fire\" or \"side address\". For small diaphragm microphones such as the Shure (also pictured above), it usually extends from the axis of the microphone commonly known as \"end fire\" or \"top/end address\".\nSome microphone designs combine several principles in creating the desired polar pattern. This ranges from shielding (meaning diffraction/dissipation/absorption) by the housing itself to electronically combining dual membranes.\nOmnidirectional.\nAn omnidirectional (or nondirectional) microphone's response is generally considered to be a perfect sphere in three dimensions. In the real world, this is not the case. As with directional microphones, the polar pattern for an \"omnidirectional\" microphone is a function of frequency. The body of the microphone is not infinitely small and, as a consequence, it tends to get in its own way with respect to sounds arriving from the rear, causing a slight flattening of the polar response. This flattening increases as the diameter of the microphone (assuming it's cylindrical) reaches the wavelength of the frequency in question. Therefore, the smallest diameter microphone gives the best omnidirectional characteristics at high frequencies.\nThe wavelength of sound at 10\u00a0kHz is 1.4\" (3.5\u00a0cm). The smallest measuring microphones are often 1/4\" (6\u00a0mm) in diameter, which practically eliminates directionality even up to the highest frequencies. Omnidirectional microphones, unlike cardioids, do not employ resonant cavities as delays, and so can be considered the \"purest\" microphones in terms of low coloration; they add very little to the original sound. Being pressure-sensitive they can also have a very flat low-frequency response down to 20\u00a0Hz or below. Pressure-sensitive microphones also respond much less to wind noise and plosives than directional (velocity sensitive) microphones.\nAreas of application: studios, old churches, theaters, on-site TV interviews, etc.\nAn example of a nondirectional microphone is the round black \"eight ball\".\nUnidirectional.\nA unidirectional microphone is primarily sensitive to sounds from only one direction. The diagram above (lobar) illustrates a number of these patterns. The microphone faces upwards in each diagram. The sound intensity for a particular frequency is plotted for angles radially from 0 to 360\u00b0. (Professional diagrams show these scales and include multiple plots at different frequencies. The diagrams given here provide only an overview of typical pattern shapes, and their names.)\nCardioid, hypercardioid, supercardioid, subcardioid.\nThe most common unidirectional microphone is a cardioid microphone, so named because the sensitivity pattern is \"heart-shaped\" (i.e. a cardioid). The cardioid family of microphones are commonly used as vocal or speech microphones since they are good at rejecting sounds from other directions. In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centered around the microphone, which is the \"stem\" of the apple. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback from the monitors. Since these directional transducer microphones achieve their patterns by sensing pressure gradient, putting them very close to the sound source (at distances of a few centimeters) results in a bass boost due to the increased gradient. This is known as the proximity effect. The SM58 has been the most commonly used microphone for live vocals for more than 50 years demonstrating the importance and popularity of cardioid mics.\nThe cardioid is effectively a superposition of an omnidirectional (pressure) and a figure-8 (pressure gradient) microphone; for sound waves coming from the back, the negative signal from the figure-8 cancels the positive signal from the omnidirectional element, whereas, for sound waves coming from the front, the two add to each other. However, in low frequencies a cardioid microphone behaves as an omnidirectional microphone.\nBy combining the two components in different ratios, any pattern between omni and figure-8 can be achieved, which comprise the first-order cardioid family. Common shapes include:\nThree such cardioid microphones/hydrophones could be orthogonally oriented as a collocated triad to improve the gain and also create a steerable beam pattern.\nBi-directional.\n\"Figure-8\" or bi-directional microphones receive sound equally from both the front and back of the element. Most ribbon microphones are of this pattern. In principle they do not respond to sound pressure at all, only to the \"change\" in pressure between front and back; since sound arriving from the side reaches front and back equally there is no difference in pressure and therefore no sensitivity to sound from that direction. In more mathematical terms, while omnidirectional microphones are scalar transducers responding to pressure from any direction, bi-directional microphones are vector transducers responding to the gradient along an axis normal to the plane of the diaphragm. This also has the effect of inverting the output polarity for sounds arriving from the back side.\nShotgun.\nShotgun microphones are the most highly directional of simple first-order unidirectional types. They have the classic polar response of a hypercardioid or supercardioid. This is achieved by a process of cancellation of off-axis waves entering the longitudinal array of slots. A consequence of this technique is the presence of some rear lobes that vary in level and angle with frequency and can cause some coloration effects.\nBoundary.\nSeveral approaches have been developed for effectively using a microphone in less-than-ideal acoustic spaces, which often suffer from excessive reflections from one or more of the surfaces (boundaries) that make up the space. If the microphone is placed in, or very close to, one of these boundaries, the reflections from that surface have the same timing as the direct sound, thus giving the microphone a hemispherical polar pattern and improved intelligibility. Initially, this was done by placing an ordinary microphone adjacent to the surface, sometimes in a block of acoustically transparent foam. Sound engineers Ed Long and Ron Wickersham developed the concept of placing the diaphragm parallel to and facing the boundary.\nWhile a boundary microphone was initially implemented using an omnidirectional element, it is also possible to mount a directional microphone close enough to the surface to gain some of the benefits of this technique while retaining the directional properties of the element.\nApplication-specific designs.\nA lavalier microphone is made for hands-free operation. These small microphones are worn on the body. Originally, they were held in place with a lanyard worn around the neck, but more often they are fastened to clothing with a clip, pin, tape or magnet. The lavalier cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to an RF transmitter in a pocket or clipped to a belt (for mobile use), or run directly to the mixer (for stationary applications).\nA wireless microphone transmits the audio as a radio or optical signal rather than via a cable. Most professional wireless microphones send their signal using a small radio transmitter to a nearby receiver connected to the sound system.\nA contact microphone picks up vibrations directly from a solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or insects. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and contact pin. The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones have been used to pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed.\nA throat microphone is a variant of the contact microphone that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.\nA parabolic microphone uses a parabolic reflector to collect and focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, in much the same way that a parabolic antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, eavesdropping, law enforcement, and even espionage. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have a poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.\nA stereo microphone integrates two microphones in one unit to produce a stereophonic signal. A stereo microphone is often used for broadcast applications or field recording where it would be impractical to configure two separate condenser microphones in a classic X-Y configuration (see microphone practice) for stereophonic recording. Some such microphones have an adjustable angle of coverage between the two channels.\nA noise-canceling microphone is a highly directional design intended for noisy environments. One such use is in aircraft cockpits where they are normally installed as boom microphones on headsets. Another use is in live event support on loud concert stages for vocalists involved with live performances. Many noise-canceling microphones combine signals received from two diaphragms that are in opposite electrical polarity or are processed electronically. In dual diaphragm designs, the main diaphragm is mounted closest to the intended source and the second is positioned farther away from the source so that it can pick up environmental sounds to be subtracted from the main diaphragm's signal. After the two signals have been combined, sounds other than the intended source are greatly reduced, substantially increasing intelligibility. Other noise-canceling designs use one diaphragm that is affected by ports open to the sides and rear of the microphone, with the sum being a 16\u00a0dB rejection of sounds that are farther away. One noise-canceling headset design by Crown using a single diaphragm has been used prominently by vocal artists such as Garth Brooks, Britney Spears and Janet Jackson.\nStereo microphone techniques.\nVarious standard techniques are used with microphones used in sound reinforcement at live performances, or for recording in a studio or on a motion picture set. By suitable arrangement of one or more microphones, desirable features of the sound to be collected can be kept, while rejecting unwanted sounds.\nPowering.\nMicrophones containing active circuitry, such as most condenser microphones, require power to operate the active components. The first of these used vacuum-tube circuits with a separate power supply unit, using a multi-pin cable and connector. With the advent of solid-state amplification, the power requirements were greatly reduced and it became practical to use the same cable conductors and connector for audio and power. During the 1960s several powering methods were developed, mainly in Europe. The two dominant methods were initially defined in German DIN 45595 as Tonaderspeisung or T-power and DIN 45596 for phantom power. Since the 1980s, phantom power has become much more common, because the same input may be used for both powered and unpowered microphones. In consumer electronics such as DSLRs and camcorders, \"plug-in power\" is more common, for microphones using a 3.5\u00a0mm phone plug connector. Phantom, T-power and plug-in power are described in international standard IEC 61938.\nConnectors and connectivity.\nThe most common connectors used by microphones are:\nSome microphones use other connectors, such as a 5-pin XLR, or mini XLR for connection to portable equipment. Some lavalier (or \"lapel\", from the days of attaching the microphone to the news reporter's suit lapel) microphones use a proprietary connector for connection to a wireless transmitter, such as a radio pack. Since 2005, professional-quality microphones with USB connections have begun to appear, designed for direct recording into computer-based software.\nImpedance bridging.\nWhen choosing a pre-amplifier for a certain microphone, the microphone's impedance must be known. Impedance is a frequency-dependent electrical characteristic, measured in ohms\u00a0(\u03a9), that relates voltage to current. When not concerned with power transfer, signals are generally transferred as varying voltages and this is also the case for microphones. To obtain the highest signal amplitude one uses a method called impedance bridging. In this configuration the output impedance of the microphone should be negligible in comparison with the input impedance of the pre-amplifier (in practice a pre-amp impedance at least 10 times greater than the microphone impedance is recommended). By doing so, the signal is attenuated minimally and almost no power is used in the process.\nThe main alternative to impedance bridging is impedance matching which maximizes power transfer for a given source impedance. However, this has not been relevant since the early 20th century when amplifiers were very expensive and produced a lot of heat. To reduce the number of amplifiers in telephone lines, power loss needed to be minimal so source and load impedances were matched. A downside to impedance matching is the 6\u00a0dB loss in signal that occurs as only half the voltage level appears at the pre-amplifier's input. Certain ribbon and dynamic microphones however are exceptions, due to the designers' assumption of a certain load impedance being part of the internal electro-acoustical damping circuit of the microphone.\nDifferent microphones can have vastly different impedances and this depends on the design. In passive microphones, this value relates closely to the impedance of the coil (or similar mechanism). In active microphones, this value describes the output impedance of its internal amplifier circuitry.\nLow impedance is considered under 600\u00a0\u03a9. Medium impedance is considered between 600\u00a0\u03a9 and 10\u00a0k\u03a9. High impedance is above 10\u00a0k\u03a9. Owing to their built-in amplifier, condenser microphones typically have an output impedance between 50 and 200\u00a0\u03a9.\nDigital microphone interface.\nThe AES42 standard, published by the Audio Engineering Society, defines a digital interface for microphones. Microphones conforming to this standard directly output a digital audio stream through an XLR or XLD male connector, rather than producing an analog output. Digital microphones may be used either with new equipment with appropriate input connections that conform to the AES42 standard, or else via a suitable interface box. Studio-quality microphones that operate in accordance with the AES42 standard are now available from a number of microphone manufacturers.\nMeasurements and specifications.\nBecause of differences in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform phase and frequency responses. Additionally, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often not the case for music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications, but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from this or any other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC\u00a060268-4.\nA frequency response diagram plots the microphone sensitivity in decibels over a range of frequencies (typically 20\u00a0Hz to 20\u00a0kHz), generally for perfectly on-axis sound (sound arriving at 0\u00b0 to the capsule). Frequency response may be less informatively stated textually like so: \"30\u00a0Hz\u201316\u00a0kHz\u00a0\u00b13\u00a0dB\". This is interpreted as meaning a nearly flat, linear, plot between the stated frequencies, with variations in amplitude of no more than plus or minus 3\u00a0dB. However, one cannot determine from this information how \"smooth\" the variations are, nor in what parts of the spectrum they occur. Note that commonly made statements such as \"20\u00a0Hz\u201320\u00a0kHz\" are meaningless without a decibel measure of tolerance. Directional microphones' frequency response varies greatly with distance from the sound source, and with the geometry of the sound source. IEC\u00a060268-4 specifies that frequency response should be measured in \"plane progressive wave\" conditions (very far away from the source) but this is seldom practical. \"Close talking\" microphones may be measured with different sound sources and distances, but there is no standard and therefore no way to compare data from different models unless the measurement technique is described.\nThe self-noise or equivalent input noise level is the sound level that creates the same output voltage as the microphone does in the absence of sound. This represents the lowest point of the microphone's dynamic range, and is particularly important should you wish to record sounds that are quiet. The measure is often stated in dB(A), which is the equivalent loudness of the noise on a decibel scale frequency-weighted for how the ear hears, for example: \"15\u00a0dBA SPL\" (SPL means sound pressure level relative to 20\u00a0micropascals). The lower the number the better. Some microphone manufacturers state the noise level using ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which more accurately represents the way we hear noise, but gives a figure some 11\u201314\u00a0dB higher. A quiet microphone typically measures 20\u00a0dBA SPL or 32\u00a0dB SPL 468-weighted. Very quiet microphones have existed for years for special applications, such the Br\u00fcel &amp; Kjaer 4179, with a noise level around 0\u00a0dB SPL. Recently some microphones with low noise specifications have been introduced in the studio/entertainment market, such as models from Neumann and R\u00f8de that advertise noise levels between 5\u20137\u00a0dBA. Typically this is achieved by altering the frequency response of the capsule and electronics to result in lower noise within the A-weighting curve while broadband noise may be increased.\nThe clipping level is an important indicator of maximum usable level, as the 1% total harmonic distortion (THD) figure usually quoted under max SPL is really a very mild level of distortion, quite inaudible especially on brief high peaks. Clipping is much more audible. For some microphones, the clipping level may be much higher than the max SPL.\nThe dynamic range of a microphone is the difference in SPL between the noise floor and the maximum SPL. If stated on its own, for example, \"120\u00a0dB\", it conveys significantly less information than having the self-noise and maximum SPL figures individually.\nSensitivity indicates how well the microphone converts acoustic pressure to an output voltage. A high sensitivity microphone creates more voltage and so needs less amplification at the mixer or recording device. This is a practical concern but is not directly an indication of the microphone's quality, and in fact the term sensitivity is something of a misnomer, \"transduction gain\" being perhaps more meaningful, (or just \"output level\") because true sensitivity is generally set by the noise floor, and too much \"sensitivity\" in terms of output level compromises the clipping level. There are two common measures. The (preferred) international standard is made in millivolts per pascal at 1\u00a0kHz. A higher value indicates greater sensitivity. The older American method is referred to a 1\u00a0V/Pa standard and measured in plain decibels, resulting in a negative value. Again, a higher value indicates greater sensitivity, so \u221260\u00a0 dB is more sensitive than \u221270\u00a0dB.\nMeasurement microphones.\nSome microphones are intended for testing speakers, measuring noise levels and otherwise quantifying an acoustic experience. These are calibrated transducers and are usually supplied with a calibration certificate that states absolute sensitivity against frequency. The quality of measurement microphones is often referred to using the designations \"Class 1\", \"Type 2\", etc., which are references not to microphone specifications but to sound level meters. A more comprehensive standard for the description of measurement microphone performance was recently adopted.\nMeasurement microphones are generally scalar sensors of pressure; they exhibit an omnidirectional response, limited only by the scattering profile of their physical dimensions. Sound intensity or sound power measurements require pressure-gradient measurements, which are typically made using arrays of at least two microphones, or with hot-wire anemometers.\nCalibration.\nTo take a scientific measurement with a microphone, its precise sensitivity must be known (in volts per pascal). Since this may change over the lifetime of the device, it is necessary to regularly calibrate measurement microphones. This service is offered by some microphone manufacturers and by independent certified testing labs. All microphone calibration is ultimately traceable to primary standards at a national measurement institute such as NPL in the UK, PTB in Germany and NIST in the United States, which most commonly calibrate using the reciprocity primary standard. Measurement microphones calibrated using this method can then be used to calibrate other microphones using comparison calibration techniques.\nDepending on the application, measurement microphones must be tested periodically (every year or several months, typically) and after any potentially damaging event, such as being dropped (most such microphones come in foam-padded cases to reduce this risk) or exposed to sounds beyond the acceptable level.\nArrays.\nA microphone array is any number of microphones operating in tandem. There are many applications:\nTypically, an array is made up of omnidirectional microphones distributed about the perimeter of a space, linked to a computer that records and interprets the results into a coherent form.\nWindscreens.\nWindscreens (or interchangeably, windshields) provide a method of reducing the effect of wind on microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam \"hats\" shield wind into the grille from all directions, and \"blimps\", \"zeppelins\", and \"baskets\" entirely enclose the microphone and protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low-frequency content of wind noise, vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.\nThe shielding material used \u2013 wire gauze, fabric or foam \u2013 is designed to have a significant acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material increases wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high-frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft fabrics and gauzes require stretching on frames or laminating with coarser structural elements.\nSince all wind noise is generated at the first surface the air hits, the greater the spacing between the shield periphery and microphone capsule, the greater the noise attenuation. For an approximately spherical shield, attenuation increases by (approximately) the cube of that distance. With full basket windshields there is an additional pressure chamber effect, first explained by Joerg Wuttke, which, for two-port (pressure gradient) microphones, allows the shield and microphone combination to act as a high-pass acoustic filter.\nSince turbulence at a surface is the source of wind noise, reducing gross turbulence can add to noise reduction. Both aerodynamically smooth surfaces, and ones that prevent powerful vortices being generated, have been used successfully. Historically, artificial fur has proved very useful for this purpose since the fibers produce micro-turbulence and absorb energy silently. If not matted by wind and rain, the fur fibers are very transparent acoustically, but the woven or knitted backing can give significant attenuation. As a material, it suffers from being difficult to manufacture with consistency and is hard to keep in pristine condition on location. Thus there is an interest in moving away from its use.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lenz's law describes the direction of the induced field. Faraday's law was later generalized to become the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation, one of the four Maxwell equations in his theory of electromagnetism.\nElectromagnetic induction has found many applications, including electrical components such as inductors and transformers, and devices such as electric motors and generators.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nElectromagnetic induction was discovered by Michael Faraday, published in 1831. It was discovered independently by Joseph Henry in 1832.\nIn Faraday's first experimental demonstration, on August 29, 1831, he wrapped two wires around opposite sides of an iron ring or \"torus\" (an arrangement similar to a modern toroidal transformer). Based on his understanding of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a \"wave of electricity\", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it. This induction was due to the change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead (\"Faraday's disk\").\nFaraday explained electromagnetic induction using a concept he called lines of force. However, scientists at the time widely rejected his theoretical ideas, mainly because they were not formulated mathematically. An exception was James Clerk Maxwell, who used Faraday's ideas as the basis of his quantitative electromagnetic theory. In Maxwell's model, the time varying aspect of electromagnetic induction is expressed as a differential equation, which Oliver Heaviside referred to as Faraday's law even though it is slightly different from Faraday's original formulation and does not describe motional emf. Heaviside's version (see Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation below) is the form recognized today in the group of equations known as Maxwell's equations.\nIn 1834 Heinrich Lenz formulated the law named after him to describe the \"flux through the circuit\". Lenz's law gives the direction of the induced emf and current resulting from electromagnetic induction.\nTheory.\nFaraday's law of induction and Lenz's law.\nFaraday's law of induction makes use of the magnetic flux \u03a6B through a region of space enclosed by a wire loop. The magnetic flux is defined by a surface integral:\nformula_1\nwhere \"dA is an element of the surface \u03a3 enclosed by the wire loop, B is the magnetic field. The dot product B\u00b7\"dA corresponds to an infinitesimal amount of magnetic flux. In more visual terms, the magnetic flux through the wire loop is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass through the loop.\nWhen the flux through the surface changes, Faraday's law of induction says that the wire loop acquires an electromotive force (emf). The most widespread version of this law states that the induced electromotive force in any closed circuit is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit:\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 is the emf and \u03a6B is the magnetic flux. The direction of the electromotive force is given by Lenz's law which states that an induced current will flow in the direction that will oppose the change which produced it. This is due to the negative sign in the previous equation. To increase the generated emf, a common approach is to exploit flux linkage by creating a tightly wound coil of wire, composed of \"N\" identical turns, each with the same magnetic flux going through them. The resulting emf is then \"N\" times that of one single wire.\nformula_4\nGenerating an emf through a variation of the magnetic flux through the surface of a wire loop can be achieved in several ways:\nMaxwell\u2013Faraday equation.\nIn general, the relation between the emf formula_5 in a wire loop encircling a surface \u03a3, and the electric field E in the wire is given by\nformula_6\nwhere \"d\"\u2113 is an element of contour of the surface \u03a3. Combining this with the definition of flux\nformula_1\nthe integral form of the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation can be written as:\nformula_8\nIt is one of the four Maxwell's equations, and therefore plays a fundamental role in the theory of classical electromagnetism.\nFaraday's law and relativity.\nFaraday's law describes two different phenomena: the \"motional emf\" generated by a magnetic force on a moving wire (see Lorentz force), and the \"transformer emf\" that is generated by an electric force due to a changing magnetic field (due to the differential form of the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation). James Clerk Maxwell drew attention to the separate physical phenomena in 1861. This is believed to be a unique example in physics of where such a fundamental law is invoked to explain two such different phenomena.\nAlbert Einstein noticed that the two situations both corresponded to a relative movement between a conductor and a magnet, and the outcome was unaffected by which one was moving. This was one of the principal paths that led him to develop special relativity.\nApplications.\nThe principles of electromagnetic induction are applied in many devices and systems, including:\nElectrical generator.\nThe emf generated by Faraday's law of induction due to relative movement of a circuit and a magnetic field is the phenomenon underlying electrical generators. When a permanent magnet is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an electromotive force is created. If the wire is connected through an electrical load, current will flow, and thus electrical energy is generated, converting the mechanical energy of motion to electrical energy. For example, the \"drum generator\" is based upon the figure to the bottom-right. A different implementation of this idea is the Faraday's disc, shown in simplified form on the right.\nIn the Faraday's disc example, the disc is rotated in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. Mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through Amp\u00e8re's circuital law (labelled \"induced B\" in the figure). The rim thus becomes an electromagnet that resists rotation of the disc (an example of Lenz's law). On the far side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the far side of the rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to \"decrease\" the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the \"increase\" in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field \"increases\" the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the \"decrease\" in flux due to r the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to friction, Joule heating, and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting mechanical energy to electrical energy.\nElectrical transformer.\nWhen the electric current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic field will experience this change in magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, formula_9. Therefore, an electromotive force is set up in the second loop called the induced emf or transformer emf. If the two ends of this loop are connected through an electrical load, current will flow.\nCurrent clamp.\nA current clamp is a type of transformer with a split core which can be spread apart and clipped onto a wire or coil to either measure the current in it or, in reverse, to induce a voltage. Unlike conventional instruments the clamp does not make electrical contact with the conductor or require it to be disconnected during attachment of the clamp.\nMagnetic flow meter.\nFaraday's law is used for measuring the flow of electrically conductive liquids and slurries. Such instruments are called magnetic flow meters. The induced voltage \u03b5 generated in the magnetic field \"B\" due to a conductive liquid moving at velocity \"v\" is thus given by:\nformula_10\nwhere \u2113 is the distance between electrodes in the magnetic flow meter.\nEddy currents.\nElectrical conductors moving through a steady magnetic field, or stationary conductors within a changing magnetic field, will have circular currents induced within them by induction, called eddy currents. Eddy currents flow in closed loops in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. They have useful applications in eddy current brakes and induction heating systems. However eddy currents induced in the metal magnetic cores of transformers and AC motors and generators are undesirable since they dissipate energy (called core losses) as heat in the resistance of the metal. Cores for these devices use a number of methods to reduce eddy currents: \nElectromagnet laminations.\nEddy currents occur when a solid metallic mass is rotated in a magnetic field, because the outer portion of the metal cuts more magnetic lines of force than the inner portion; hence the induced electromotive force is not uniform; this tends to cause electric currents between the points of greatest and least potential. Eddy currents consume a considerable amount of energy and often cause a harmful rise in temperature.\nOnly five laminations or plates are shown in this example, so as to show the subdivision of the eddy currents. In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch (16 to 26 per centimetre), and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.\nThis is a rotor approximately 20\u00a0mm in diameter from a DC motor used in a CD player. Note the laminations of the electromagnet pole pieces, used to limit parasitic inductive losses.\nParasitic induction within conductors.\nIn this illustration, a solid copper bar conductor on a rotating armature is just passing under the tip of the pole piece N of the field magnet. Note the uneven distribution of the lines of force across the copper bar. The magnetic field is more concentrated and thus stronger on the left edge of the copper bar (a,b) while the field is weaker on the right edge (c,d). Since the two edges of the bar move with the same velocity, this difference in field strength across the bar creates whorls or current eddies within the copper bar.\nHigh current power-frequency devices, such as electric motors, generators and transformers, use multiple small conductors in parallel to break up the eddy flows that can form within large solid conductors. The same principle is applied to transformers used at higher than power frequency, for example, those used in switch-mode power supplies and the intermediate frequency coupling transformers of radio receivers.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is usually denoted \u03a6 or \u03a6B. The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb; in derived units, volt\u2013seconds or V\u22c5s), and the CGS unit is the maxwell. Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils, and it calculates the magnetic flux from the change of voltage on the coils.\nDescription.\nThe magnetic interaction is described in terms of a vector field, where each point in space is associated with a vector that determines what force a moving charge would experience at that point (see Lorentz force). Since a vector field is quite difficult to visualize, introductory physics instruction often uses field lines to visualize this field. The magnetic flux, through some surface, in this simplified picture, is proportional to the number of field lines passing through that surface (in some contexts, the flux may be defined to be precisely the number of field lines passing through that surface; although technically misleading, this distinction is not important). The magnetic flux is the \"net\" number of field lines passing through that surface; that is, the number passing through in one direction minus the number passing through in the other direction (see below for deciding in which direction the field lines carry a positive sign and in which they carry a negative sign).\nMore sophisticated physical models drop the field line analogy and define magnetic flux as the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field passing through a surface. If the magnetic field is constant, the magnetic flux passing through a surface of vector area S is\nformula_1\nwhere \"B\" is the magnitude of the magnetic field (the magnetic flux density) having the unit of Wb/m2 (tesla), \"S\" is the area of the surface, and \"\u03b8\" is the angle between the magnetic field lines and the normal (perpendicular) to S. For a varying magnetic field, we first consider the magnetic flux through an infinitesimal area element dS, where we may consider the field to be constant:\nformula_2\nA generic surface, S, can then be broken into infinitesimal elements and the total magnetic flux through the surface is then the surface integral\nformula_3\nFrom the definition of the magnetic vector potential A and the fundamental theorem of the curl the magnetic flux may also be defined as:\nformula_4\nwhere the line integral is taken over the boundary of the surface S, which is denoted \u2202\"S\".\nMagnetic flux through a closed surface.\nGauss's law for magnetism, which is one of the four Maxwell's equations, states that the total magnetic flux through a closed surface is equal to zero. (A \"closed surface\" is a surface that completely encloses a volume(s) with no holes.) This law is a consequence of the empirical observation that magnetic monopoles have never been found.\nIn other words, Gauss's law for magnetism is the statement:\nformula_5 formula_6 formula_7\nfor any closed surface \"S\".\nMagnetic flux through an open surface.\nWhile the magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero, the magnetic flux through an open surface need not be zero and is an important quantity in electromagnetism.\nWhen determining the total magnetic flux through a surface only the boundary of the surface needs to be defined, the actual shape of the surface is irrelevant and the integral over any surface sharing the same boundary will be equal. This is a direct consequence of the closed surface flux being zero.\nChanging magnetic flux.\nFor example, a change in the magnetic flux passing through a loop of conductive wire will cause an electromotive force (emf), and therefore an electric current, in the loop. The relationship is given by Faraday's law:\nformula_8\nwhere:\nThe two equations for the emf are, firstly, the work per unit charge done against the Lorentz force in moving a test charge around the (possibly moving) surface boundary \u2202\u03a3 and, secondly, as the change of magnetic flux through the open surface \u03a3. This equation is the principle behind an electrical generator.\nComparison with electric flux.\nBy way of contrast, Gauss's law for electric fields, another of Maxwell's equations, is\nformula_10 formula_6 formula_12\nwhere\nThe flux of E through a closed surface is \"not\" always zero; this indicates the presence of \"electric monopoles\", that is, free positive or negative charges.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Boyle's law has been stated as:\nThe absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies if the temperature and amount of gas remain unchanged within a closed system.\nMathematically, Boyle's law can be stated as:\nor\nwhere P is the pressure of the gas, V is the volume of the gas, and k is a constant for a particular temperature and amount of gas.\nBoyle's law states that when the temperature of a given mass of confined gas is constant, the product of its pressure and volume is also constant. When comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be expressed as:\nformula_1\nshowing that as volume increases, the pressure of a gas decreases proportionally, and vice versa. \nBoyle's law is named after Robert Boyle, who published the original law in 1662. An equivalent law is Mariotte\u2019s law, named after French physicist Edme Mariotte.\nHistory.\nThe relationship between pressure and volume was first noted by Richard Towneley and Henry Power in the 17th century. Robert Boyle confirmed their discovery through experiments and published the results. According to Robert Gunther and other authorities, it was Boyle's assistant, Robert Hooke, who built the experimental apparatus. Boyle's law is based on experiments with air, which he considered to be a fluid of particles at rest in between small invisible springs. Boyle may have begun experimenting with gases due to an interest in air as an essential element of life; for example, he published works on the growth of plants without air. Boyle used a closed J-shaped tube and after pouring mercury from one side he forced the air on the other side to contract under the pressure of mercury. After repeating the experiment several times and using different amounts of mercury he found that under controlled conditions, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to the volume occupied by it. \nThe French physicist Edme Mariotte (1620\u20131684) discovered the same law independently of Boyle in 1679, after Boyle had published it in 1662. Mariotte did, however, discover that air volume changes with temperature. Thus this law is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law or the Boyle\u2013Mariotte law. Later, in 1687 in the , Newton showed mathematically that in an elastic fluid consisting of particles at rest, between which are repulsive forces inversely proportional to their distance, the density would be directly proportional to the pressure, but this mathematical treatise does not involve any Mariott temperature dependance and is not the proper physical explanation for the observed relationship. Instead of a static theory, a kinetic theory is needed, which was developed over the next two centuries by Daniel Bernoulli (1738) and more fully by Rudolf Clausius (1857), Maxwell and Boltzmann.\nThis law was the first physical law to be expressed in the form of an equation describing the dependence of two variable quantities.\nDefinition.\nThe law itself can be stated as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBoyle's law is a gas law, stating that the pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship. If volume increases, then pressure decreases and vice versa, when the temperature is held constant.\nTherefore, when the volume is halved, the pressure is doubled; and if the volume is doubled, the pressure is halved.\nRelation with kinetic theory and ideal gases.\nAs the pressure on a gas increases, the volume of the gas decreases because the gas particles are forced closer together. \nMost gases behave like ideal gases at moderate pressures and temperatures. The technology of the 17th century could not produce very high pressures or very low temperatures. Hence, the law was not likely to have deviations at the time of publication. As improvements in technology permitted higher pressures and lower temperatures, deviations from the ideal gas behavior became noticeable, and the relationship between pressure and volume can only be accurately described employing real gas theory. The deviation is expressed as the compressibility factor.\nBoyle (and Mariotte) derived the law solely by experiment. The law can also be derived theoretically based on the presumed existence of atoms and molecules and assumptions about motion and perfectly elastic collisions (see kinetic theory of gases). These assumptions were met with enormous resistance in the positivist scientific community at the time, however, as they were seen as purely theoretical constructs for which there was not the slightest observational evidence.\nDaniel Bernoulli (in 1737\u20131738) derived Boyle's law by applying Newton's laws of motion at the molecular level. It remained ignored until around 1845, when John Waterston published a paper building the main precepts of kinetic theory; this was rejected by the Royal Society of England. Later works of James Prescott Joule, Rudolf Clausius and in particular Ludwig Boltzmann firmly established the kinetic theory of gases and brought attention to both the theories of Bernoulli and Waterston.\nThe debate between proponents of energetics and atomism led Boltzmann to write a book in 1898, which endured criticism until his suicide in 1906. Albert Einstein in 1905 showed how kinetic theory applies to the Brownian motion of a fluid-suspended particle, which was confirmed in 1908 by Jean Perrin.\nEquation.\nThe mathematical equation for Boyle's law is:\nformula_2\nwhere P denotes the pressure of the system, V denotes the volume of the gas, k is a constant value representative of the temperature of the system and amount of gas.\nSo long as temperature remains constant the same amount of energy given to the system persists throughout its operation and therefore, theoretically, the value of k will remain constant. However, due to the derivation of pressure as perpendicular applied force and the probabilistic likelihood of collisions with other particles through collision theory, the application of force to a surface may not be infinitely constant for such values of V, but will have a limit when differentiating such values over a given time. Forcing the volume V of the fixed quantity of gas to increase, keeping the gas at the initially measured temperature, the pressure P must decrease proportionally. Conversely, reducing the volume of the gas increases the pressure. Boyle's law is used to predict the result of introducing a change, in volume and pressure only, to the initial state of a fixed quantity of gas.\nThe initial and final volumes and pressures of the fixed amount of gas, where the initial and final temperatures are the same (heating or cooling will be required to meet this condition), are related by the equation:\nformula_3\nHere \"P\"1 and \"V\"1 represent the original pressure and volume, respectively, and \"P\"2 and \"V\"2 represent the second pressure and volume.\nBoyle's law, Charles's law, and Gay-Lussac's law form the combined gas law. The three gas laws in combination with Avogadro's law can be generalized by the ideal gas law.\nHuman breathing system.\nBoyle's law is often used as part of an explanation on how the breathing system works in the human body. This commonly involves explaining how the lung volume may be increased or decreased and thereby cause a relatively lower or higher air pressure within them (in keeping with Boyle's law). This forms a pressure difference between the air inside the lungs and the environmental air pressure, which in turn precipitates either inhalation or exhalation as air moves from high to low pressure.\nSee also.\nRelated phenomena:\nOther gas laws:\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Devices called electrical \"transducers\" provide an emf by converting other forms of energy into electrical energy. Other types of electrical equipment also produce an emf, such as batteries, which convert chemical energy, and generators, which convert mechanical energy. This energy conversion is achieved by physical forces applying physical work on electric charges. However, electromotive force itself is not a physical force, and ISO/IEC standards have deprecated the term in favor of source voltage or source tension instead (denoted formula_2).\nAn electronic\u2013hydraulic analogy may view emf as the mechanical work done to water by a pump, which results in a pressure difference (analogous to voltage).\nIn electromagnetic induction, emf can be defined around a closed loop of a conductor as the electromagnetic work that would be done on an elementary electric charge (such as an electron) if it travels once around the loop.\nFor two-terminal devices modeled as a Th\u00e9venin equivalent circuit, an equivalent emf can be measured as the open-circuit voltage between the two terminals. This emf can drive an electric current if an external circuit is attached to the terminals, in which case the device becomes the voltage source of that circuit.\nAlthough an emf gives rise to a voltage and can be measured as a voltage and may sometimes informally be called a \"voltage\", they are not the same phenomenon (see ).\nOverview.\nDevices that can provide emf include electrochemical cells, thermoelectric devices, solar cells, photodiodes, electrical generators, inductors, transformers and even Van de Graaff generators. In nature, emf is generated when magnetic field fluctuations occur through a surface. For example, the shifting of the Earth's magnetic field during a geomagnetic storm induces currents in an electrical grid as the lines of the magnetic field are shifted about and cut across the conductors.\nIn a battery, the charge separation that gives rise to a potential difference (voltage) between the terminals is accomplished by chemical reactions at the electrodes that convert chemical potential energy into electromagnetic potential energy. A voltaic cell can be thought of as having a \"charge pump\" of atomic dimensions at each electrode, that is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A (chemical) source of emf can be thought of as a kind of \"charge pump\" that acts to move positive charges from a point of low potential through its interior to a point of high potential. \u2026 By chemical, mechanical or other means, the source of emf performs work formula_3 on that charge to move it to the high-potential terminal. The emf formula_4 of the source is defined as the work formula_3 done per charge formula_6. formula_7.\nIn an electrical generator, a time-varying magnetic field inside the generator creates an electric field via electromagnetic induction, which creates a potential difference between the generator terminals. Charge separation takes place within the generator because electrons flow away from one terminal toward the other, until, in the open-circuit case, an electric field is developed that makes further charge separation impossible. The emf is countered by the electrical voltage due to charge separation. If a load is attached, this voltage can drive a current. The general principle governing the emf in such electrical machines is Faraday's law of induction.\nHistory.\nIn 1801, Alessandro Volta introduced the term \"force motrice \u00e9lectrique\" to describe the active agent of a battery (which he had invented around 1798).\nThis is called the \"electromotive force\" in English.\nAround 1830, Michael Faraday established that chemical reactions at each of two electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces provide the \"seat of emf\" for the voltaic cell. That is, these reactions drive the current and are not an endless source of energy as the earlier obsolete theory thought. In the open-circuit case, charge separation continues until the electrical field from the separated charges is sufficient to arrest the reactions. Years earlier, Alessandro Volta, who had measured a contact potential difference at the metal\u2013metal (electrode\u2013electrode) interface of his cells, held the incorrect opinion that contact alone (without taking into account a chemical reaction) was the origin of the emf. It is independent of size of the cell but depends on the nature of the electrolyte used.\nNotation and units of measurement.\nElectromotive force (emf) is typically denoted by the symbol \u2130 (script E). It represents the energy provided by a source per unit electric charge. The standard unit of emf in the International System of Units (SI) is the volt (V).\nIn a device without internal resistance, if an electric charge formula_8 passing through that device gains an energy formula_9 via work, the net emf for that device is the energy gained per unit charge: formula_10 Like other measures of energy per charge, emf uses the SI unit volt, which is equivalent to a joule (SI unit of energy) per coulomb (SI unit of charge).\nElectromotive force in electrostatic units is the statvolt (in the centimeter gram second system of units equal in amount to an erg per electrostatic unit of charge).\nFormal definitions.\n\"Inside\" a source of emf (such as a battery) that is open-circuited, a charge separation occurs between the negative terminal \"N\" and the positive terminal \"P\".\nThis leads to an electrostatic field formula_11 that points from \"P\" to \"N\", whereas the emf of the source must be able to drive current from \"N\" to \"P\" when connected to a circuit.\nThis led Max Abraham to introduce the concept of a nonelectrostatic field formula_12 that exists only inside the source of emf.\nIn the open-circuit case, formula_13, while when the source is connected to a circuit the electric field formula_14 inside the source changes but formula_12 remains essentially the same.\nIn the open-circuit case, the conservative electrostatic field created by separation of charge exactly cancels the forces producing the emf. \nMathematically:\nformula_16\nwhere formula_11 is the conservative electrostatic field created by the charge separation associated with the emf, formula_18 is an element of the path from terminal \"N\" to terminal \"P\", 'formula_19' denotes the vector dot product, and formula_20 is the electric scalar potential. \nThis emf is the work done on a unit charge by the source's nonelectrostatic field formula_12 when the charge moves from \"N\" to \"P\".\nWhen the source is connected to a load, its emf is just\nformula_22\nand no longer has a simple relation to the electric field formula_14 inside it.\nIn the case of a closed path in the presence of a varying magnetic field, the integral of the electric field around the (stationary) closed loop formula_24 may be nonzero.\nThen, the \"induced emf\" (often called the \"induced voltage\") in the loop is:\nformula_25\nwhere formula_14 is the entire electric field, conservative and non-conservative, and the integral is around an arbitrary, but stationary, closed curve formula_24 through which there is a time-varying magnetic flux formula_28, and formula_29 is the vector potential.\nThe electrostatic field does not contribute to the net emf around a circuit because the electrostatic portion of the electric field is conservative (i.e., the work done against the field around a closed path is zero, see Kirchhoff's voltage law, which is valid, as long as the circuit elements remain at rest and radiation is ignored).\nThat is, the \"induced emf\" (like the emf of a battery connected to a load) is not a \"voltage\" in the sense of a difference in the electric scalar potential.\nIf the loop formula_24 is a conductor that carries current formula_31 in the direction of integration around the loop, and the magnetic flux is due to that current, we have that formula_32, where formula_33 is the self inductance of the loop.\nIf in addition, the loop includes a coil that extends from point 1 to 2, such that the magnetic flux is largely localized to that region, it is customary to speak of that region as an inductor, and to consider that its emf is localized to that region.\nThen, we can consider a different loop formula_34 that consists of the coiled conductor from 1 to 2, and an imaginary line down the center of the coil from 2 back to 1. \nThe magnetic flux, and emf, in loop formula_34 is essentially the same as that in loop formula_24:formula_37\nFor a good conductor, formula_38 is negligible, so we have, to a good approximation,\nformula_39\nwhere formula_20 is the electric scalar potential along the centerline between points 1 and 2.\nThus, we can associate an effective \"voltage drop\" formula_41 with an inductor (even though our basic understanding of induced emf is based on the vector potential rather than the scalar potential), and consider it as a load element in Kirchhoff's voltage law,\nformula_42\nwhere now the induced emf is not considered to be a source emf.\nThis definition can be extended to arbitrary sources of emf and paths \"formula_24\" moving with velocity formula_44 through the electric field formula_14 and magnetic field formula_46:\nformula_47\nwhich is a conceptual equation mainly, because the determination of the \"effective forces\" is difficult.\nThe term formula_48\nis often called a \"motional emf\".\nIn (electrochemical) thermodynamics.\nWhen multiplied by an amount of charge formula_49 the emf formula_1 yields a thermodynamic work term formula_51 that is used in the formalism for the change in Gibbs energy when charge is passed in a battery:\nformula_52\nwhere formula_53 is the Gibbs free energy, formula_54 is the entropy, formula_20 is the system volume, formula_56 is its pressure and formula_57 is its absolute temperature.\nThe combination formula_58 is an example of a conjugate pair of variables. At constant pressure the above relationship produces a Maxwell relation that links the change in open cell voltage with temperature \"formula_57\" (a measurable quantity) to the change in entropy \"formula_54\" when charge is passed isothermally and isobarically. The latter is closely related to the reaction entropy of the electrochemical reaction that lends the battery its power. This Maxwell relation is:\nformula_61\nIf a mole of ions goes into solution (for example, in a Daniell cell, as discussed below) the charge through the external circuit is:\nformula_62\nwhere formula_63 is the number of electrons/ion, and formula_64 is the Faraday constant and the minus sign indicates discharge of the cell. Assuming constant pressure and volume, the thermodynamic properties of the cell are related strictly to the behavior of its emf by:\nformula_65\nwhere formula_66 is the enthalpy of reaction. The quantities on the right are all directly measurable. Assuming constant temperature and pressure:\nformula_67\nwhich is used in the derivation of the Nernst equation.\nDistinction with potential difference.\nAlthough an electrical potential difference (voltage) is sometimes called an emf, they are formally distinct concepts:\nIn the case of an open circuit, the electric charge that has been separated by the mechanism generating the emf creates an electric field opposing the separation mechanism. For example, the chemical reaction in a voltaic cell stops when the opposing electric field at each electrode is strong enough to arrest the reactions. A larger opposing field can reverse the reactions in what are called \"reversible\" cells.\nThe electric charge that has been separated creates an electric potential difference that can (in many cases) be measured with a voltmeter between the terminals of the device, when not connected to a load. The magnitude of the emf for the battery (or other source) is the value of this open-circuit voltage. \nWhen the battery is charging or discharging, the emf itself cannot be measured directly using the external voltage because some voltage is lost inside the source.\nIt can, however, be inferred from a measurement of the current formula_31 and potential difference formula_20, provided that the internal resistance formula_70 already has been measured: \"formula_71\"\n\"Potential difference\" is not the same as \"induced emf\" (often called \"induced voltage\"). \nThe potential difference (difference in the electric scalar potential) between two points A and B is independent of the path we take from \"A\" to \"B\". \nIf a voltmeter always measured the potential difference between \"A\" and \"B\", then the position of the voltmeter would make no difference. \nHowever, it is quite possible for the measurement by a voltmeter between points \"A\" and \"B\" to depend on the position of the voltmeter, if a time-dependent magnetic field is present. \nFor example, consider an infinitely long solenoid using an AC current to generate a varying flux in the interior of the solenoid. \nOutside the solenoid we have two resistors connected in a ring around the solenoid. \nThe resistor on the left is 100 \u03a9 and the one on the right is 200 \u03a9, they are connected at the top and bottom at points \"A\" and \"B\". \nThe induced voltage, by Faraday's law is formula_20, so the current formula_73 Therefore, the voltage across the 100 \u03a9 resistor is formula_74 and the voltage across the 200 \u03a9 resistor is formula_75, yet the two resistors are connected on both ends, but formula_76 measured with the voltmeter to the left of the solenoid is not the same as formula_76 measured with the voltmeter to the right of the solenoid.\nGeneration.\nChemical sources.\nThe question of how batteries (galvanic cells) generate an emf occupied scientists for most of the 19th century. The \"seat of the electromotive force\" was eventually determined in 1889 by Walther Nernst to be primarily at the interfaces between the electrodes and the electrolyte.\nAtoms in molecules or solids are held together by chemical bonding, which stabilizes the molecule or solid (i.e. reduces its energy). When molecules or solids of relatively high energy are brought together, a spontaneous chemical reaction can occur that rearranges the bonding and reduces the (free) energy of the system. In batteries, coupled half-reactions, often involving metals and their ions, occur in tandem, with a gain of electrons (termed \"reduction\") by one conductive electrode and loss of electrons (termed \"oxidation\") by another (reduction-oxidation or redox reactions). The spontaneous overall reaction can only occur if electrons move through an external wire between the electrodes. The electrical energy given off is the free energy lost by the chemical reaction system.\nAs an example, a Daniell cell consists of a zinc anode (an electron collector) that is oxidized as it dissolves into a zinc sulfate solution. The dissolving zinc leaving behind its electrons in the electrode according to the oxidation reaction (\"s\" = solid electrode; \"aq\" = aqueous solution):\nformula_78\nThe zinc sulfate is the electrolyte in that half cell. It is a solution which contains zinc cations formula_79, and sulfate anions formula_80 with charges that balance to zero.\nIn the other half cell, the copper cations in a copper sulfate electrolyte move to the copper cathode to which they attach themselves as they adopt electrons from the copper electrode by the reduction reaction:\nformula_81\nwhich leaves a deficit of electrons on the copper cathode. The difference of excess electrons on the anode and deficit of electrons on the cathode creates an electrical potential between the two electrodes. (A detailed discussion of the microscopic process of electron transfer between an electrode and the ions in an electrolyte may be found in Conway.) The electrical energy released by this reaction (213 kJ per 65.4 g of zinc) can be attributed mostly due to the 207 kJ weaker bonding (smaller magnitude of the cohesive energy) of zinc, which has filled 3d- and 4s-orbitals, compared to copper, which has an unfilled orbital available for bonding.\nIf the cathode and anode are connected by an external conductor, electrons pass through that external circuit (light bulb in figure), while ions pass through the salt bridge to maintain charge balance until the anode and cathode reach electrical equilibrium of zero volts as chemical equilibrium is reached in the cell. In the process the zinc anode is dissolved while the copper electrode is plated with copper. The salt bridge has to close the electrical circuit while preventing the copper ions from moving to the zinc electrode and being reduced there without generating an external current. It is not made of salt but of material able to wick cations and anions (a dissociated salt) into the solutions. The flow of positively charged cations along the bridge is equivalent to the same number of negative charges flowing in the opposite direction.\nIf the light bulb is removed (open circuit) the emf between the electrodes is opposed by the electric field due to the charge separation, and the reactions stop.\nFor this particular cell chemistry, at 298 K (room temperature), the emf formula_1 = 1.0934 V, with a temperature coefficient of formula_83\u00a0= \u22124.53\u00d710\u22124 V/K.\nVoltaic cells.\nVolta developed the voltaic cell about 1792, and presented his work March 20, 1800. Volta correctly identified the role of dissimilar electrodes in producing the voltage, but incorrectly dismissed any role for the electrolyte. Volta ordered the metals in a 'tension series', \"that is to say in an order such that any one in the list becomes positive when in contact with any one that succeeds, but negative by contact with any one that precedes it.\" A typical symbolic convention in a schematic of this circuit ( \u2013|\u2013 ) would have a long electrode 1 and a short electrode 2, to indicate that electrode 1 dominates. Volta's law about opposing electrode emfs implies that, given ten electrodes (for example, zinc and nine other materials), 45 unique combinations of voltaic cells (10 \u00d7 9/2) can be created.\nTypical values.\nThe electromotive force produced by primary (single-use) and secondary (rechargeable) cells is usually of the order of a few volts. The figures quoted below are nominal, because emf varies according to the size of the load and the state of exhaustion of the cell.\nOther chemical sources.\nOther chemical sources include fuel cells.\nElectromagnetic induction.\nElectromagnetic induction is the production of a circulating electric field by a time-dependent magnetic field. A time-dependent magnetic field can be produced either by motion of a magnet relative to a circuit, by motion of a circuit relative to another circuit (at least one of these must be carrying an electric current), or by changing the electric current in a fixed circuit. The effect on the circuit itself, of changing the electric current, is known as self-induction; the effect on another circuit is known as mutual induction.\nFor a given circuit, the electromagnetically induced emf is determined purely by the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit according to Faraday's law of induction.\nAn emf is induced in a coil or conductor whenever there is change in the flux linkages. Depending on the way in which the changes are brought about, there are two types: When the conductor is moved in a stationary magnetic field to procure a change in the flux linkage, the emf is \"statically induced\". The electromotive force generated by motion is often referred to as \"motional emf\". When the change in flux linkage arises from a change in the magnetic field around the stationary conductor, the emf is \"dynamically induced.\" The electromotive force generated by a time-varying magnetic field is often referred to as \"transformer emf\".\nContact potentials.\nWhen solids of two different materials are in contact, thermodynamic equilibrium requires that one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other. This is called the \"contact potential\". Dissimilar metals in contact produce what is known also as a contact electromotive force or Galvani potential. The magnitude of this potential difference is often expressed as a difference in Fermi levels in the two solids when they are at charge neutrality, where the Fermi level (a name for the chemical potential of an electron system) describes the energy necessary to remove an electron from the body to some common point (such as ground). If there is an energy advantage in taking an electron from one body to the other, such a transfer will occur. The transfer causes a charge separation, with one body gaining electrons and the other losing electrons. This charge transfer causes a potential difference between the bodies, which partly cancels the potential originating from the contact, and eventually equilibrium is reached. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Fermi levels are equal (the electron removal energy is identical) and there is now a built-in electrostatic potential between the bodies.\nThe original difference in Fermi levels, before contact, is referred to as the emf.\nThe contact potential cannot drive steady current through a load attached to its terminals because that current would involve a charge transfer. No mechanism exists to continue such transfer and, hence, maintain a current, once equilibrium is attained.\nOne might inquire why the contact potential does not appear in Kirchhoff's law of voltages as one contribution to the sum of potential drops. The customary answer is that any circuit involves not only a particular diode or junction, but also all the contact potentials due to wiring and so forth around the entire circuit. The sum of \"all\" the contact potentials is zero, and so they may be ignored in Kirchhoff's law.\nSolar cell.\nOperation of a solar cell can be understood from its equivalent circuit. Photons with energy greater than the bandgap of the semiconductor create mobile electron\u2013hole pairs. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the p-n junction. This electric field is created from a built-in potential, which arises from the contact potential between the two different materials in the junction. The charge separation between positive holes and negative electrons across the p\u2013n diode yields a \"forward voltage\", the \"photo voltage\", between the illuminated diode terminals, which drives current through any attached load. \"Photo voltage\" is sometimes referred to as the \"photo emf\", distinguishing between the effect and the cause.\nSolar cell current\u2013voltage relationship.\nTwo internal current losses formula_84 limit the total current formula_31 available to the external circuit. The light-induced charge separation eventually creates a forward current formula_86 through the cell's internal resistance formula_87 in the direction opposite the light-induced current formula_88. In addition, the induced voltage tends to forward bias the junction, which at high enough voltages will cause a recombination current formula_89 in the diode opposite the light-induced current.\nWhen the output is short-circuited, the output voltage is zeroed, and so the voltage across the diode is smallest. Thus, short-circuiting results in the smallest formula_84 losses and consequently the maximum output current, which for a high-quality solar cell is approximately equal to the light-induced current formula_91. Approximately this same current is obtained for forward voltages up to the point where the diode conduction becomes significant.\nThe current delivered by the illuminated diode to the external circuit can be simplified (based on certain assumptions) to:\nformula_92\nformula_93 is the reverse saturation current. Two parameters that depend on the solar cell construction and to some degree upon the voltage itself are the ideality factor \"m\" and the thermal voltage formula_94, which is about 26 millivolts at room temperature.\nSolar cell photo emf.\nSolving the illuminated diode's above simplified current\u2013voltage relationship for output voltage yields:\nformula_95\nwhich is plotted against formula_96 in the figure.\nThe solar cell's \"photo emf\" formula_97 has the same value as the open-circuit voltage formula_98, which is determined by zeroing the output current formula_31:\nformula_100\nIt has a logarithmic dependence on the light-induced current formula_88 and is where the junction's forward bias voltage is just enough that the forward current completely balances the light-induced current. For silicon junctions, it is typically not much more than 0.5 volts. While for high-quality silicon panels it can exceed 0.7 volts in direct sunlight.\nWhen driving a resistive load, the output voltage can be determined using Ohm's law and will lie between the short-circuit value of zero volts and the open-circuit voltage formula_98. When that resistance is small enough such that formula_103 (the near-vertical part of the two illustrated curves), the solar cell acts more like a \"current generator\" rather than a voltage generator, since the current drawn is nearly fixed over a range of output voltages. This contrasts with batteries, which act more like voltage generators.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Electronic components mounted on an insulating board are interconnected by lengths of insulated wire run between their terminals, with the connections made by wrapping several turns of uninsulated sections of the wire around a component lead or a socket pin.\nWires can be wrapped by hand or by machine, and can be hand-modified afterwards. It was popular for large-scale manufacturing in the 1960s and early 1970s, and continues today to be used for short runs and prototypes. The method eliminates the design and fabrication of a printed circuit board. Wire wrapping is unusual among other prototyping technologies since it allows for complex assemblies to be produced by automated equipment, but then easily repaired or modified by hand.\nWire wrap was used for assembly of high frequency prototypes and small production runs, including gigahertz microwave circuits and supercomputers. It is unique among automated prototyping techniques in that wire lengths can be exactly controlled, and twisted pairs or magnetically shielded twisted quads can be routed together.\nWire wrap construction became popular around 1960 in circuit board manufacturing, and use has now sharply declined. Surface-mount technology has made the technique comparatively much less useful than in previous decades. Solder-less breadboards and the decreasing cost of professionally made PCBs have nearly eliminated this technology.\nHistory.\nManually wrapped wires were common in early 20th century point-to-point electronic construction methods in which a strong connection was needed to hold the components in place. Wires were wrapped by hand around binding posts or spade lugs and then soldered.\nModern wire wrapping technology was developed after WWII at Bell Laboratories as a means of making electrical connections in a new relay being designed for use in the Bell Telephone system. A design team headed by Arthur C. Keller developed the \"Keller Wrap Gun\", and the entire wrap system was passed over to Western Electric for industrial application. After a \"make or buy\" committee at Western Electric decided to have the hand tool manufactured by an outside vendor, Western Electric sent the tool contract out for bids. Keller Tool of Grand Haven, Michigan, a supplier of rotary hand tools to Western Electric, won the contract and made several design changes to make the tool easier to manufacture and to use. Keller began manufacturing the tools in 1953, and subsequently obtained a license from Western Electric allowing sale of the technology on the open market. The tool was marketed under its original name \u2013 since the name of the manufacturer was coincidentally the same as the name of the inventor.\nIBM's first transistorized computers, introduced within the late 1950s, were built with the IBM Standard Modular System that used wire-wrapped backplanes.\nWire-wrap was used by Apple Computer to make early prototypes of the original Macintosh computer (The Macintosh 128K).\nMethod.\nA correctly made wire-wrap connection for 30 or 28 AWG wire is seven turns (fewer for larger wire) of bare wire with half to one and a half turns of insulated wire at the bottom for strain relief. The square hard-gold-plated post thus forms 28 redundant contacts. The silver-plated wire coating cold-welds to the gold. If corrosion occurs, it occurs on the outside of the wire, not on the gas-tight contact where oxygen cannot penetrate to form oxides. A correctly designed wire-wrap tool applies up to twenty tons of force per square inch on each joint.\nThe electronic parts sometimes plug into sockets. The sockets are attached with cyanoacrylate (or silicone adhesive) to thin plates of glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy (fiberglass).\nThe sockets have square posts. The usual posts are square, high, and spaced at intervals. Premium posts are hard-drawn beryllium copper alloy plated with a of gold to prevent corrosion. Less-expensive posts are bronze with tin plating.\n30 gauge (~0.0509mm2) silver-plated soft copper wire is insulated with a fluorocarbon that does not emit dangerous gases when heated. The most common insulation is Kynar. The 30 AWG Kynar wire is available in rolls, to be cut and stripped by the user, or precut into standard lengths, with one inch of insulation is removed on each end.\nThere are three ways of placing wires on a board. In professionally built wire-wrap boards, long wires are placed first so that shorter wires mechanically secure the long wires. Also, to make an assembly more repairable, wires are applied in layers. The ends of each wire are always at the same height on the post, so that at most three wires need to be replaced to replace a wire. Also, to make the layers easier to see, they are made with different colors of insulation. In space-rated or airworthy wire-wrap assemblies, the wires are boxed, and may be conformally coated with wax to reduce vibration. Epoxy is never used for the coating because it makes an assembly unrepairable.\nTooling.\nA \"wire wrap tool\" has two holes. The wire and of insulated wire are placed in a hole near the edge of the tool. The hole in the center of the tool is placed over the post.\nThe tool is rapidly twisted. The result is that 1.5 to 2 turns of insulated wire are wrapped around the post, and above that, 7 to 9 turns of bare wire are wrapped around the post. The post has room for three such connections, although usually only one or two are needed. This facilitates manual wire-wrapping to be employed for modifications or repairs.\nThe turn and a half of insulated wire helps prevent wire fatigue where it meets the post.\nAbove the turn of insulated wire, the bare wire wraps around the post. The corners of the post bite in with pressures of tons per square inch. This forces all the gases out of the area between the wire's silver plate and the post's gold or tin corners. Further, with 28 such connections (seven turns on a four-cornered post), a very reliable connection exists between the wire and the post. Furthermore, the corners of the posts are quite \"sharp\": they have a quite-small radius of curvature.\nAutomation.\nAutomated wire-wrap machines, as manufactured by the Gardner Denver Company in the 1960s and 1970s, were capable of automatically routing, cutting, stripping and wrapping wires onto an electronic \"backplane\" or \"circuit board\". The machines were driven by wiring instructions encoded onto punched cards, Mylar punched hole tape, and early micro computers.\nThe earliest machines (14FB and 14FG models, for example) were initially configured as \"horizontal\", which meant that the wire wrap board was placed upside down (pins up) onto a horizontal tooling plate, which was then rolled into the machine and locked onto a rotating (TRP table rotational position of four positions) and shifting (PLP = pallet longitudinal position of 11 positions) pallet assembly. These machines included very large hydraulic units for powering the servos that drove the ball screw mounted \"A\" and \"B\" drive carriages, a tall electronics cabinet loaded with hundreds of IBM control relays, many dozens of solenoids for controlling the various pneumatic mechanical subsystems, and an IBM 029 card reader for positioning instructions. The automatic wire wrap machines themselves were quite large, tall and square. Servicing the machines was extremely complex, and often meant climbing inside them just to work on them. This could be quite dangerous if safety interlocks were not maintained properly.\nLater, somewhat smaller machines were \"vertical\" (14FV) which meant the boards were placed onto a tooling plate with pins facing the machine operator. Gone were the hydraulic units, in favor of direct drive motors to rotate the ball screws, with rotary encoders to provide positioning feedback. This generally provided better visibility of the product for the operator, although maximum wrap area was significantly less than the horizontal machines. Top speeds on horizontal machines were generally around 500\u2013600 wires per hour, while the vertical machines could reach rates as high as 1200 per hour, depending on board quality and wiring configurations.\nConsiderations.\nWire-wrap works well with digital circuits with few discrete components, but is less convenient for analog systems with many discrete resistors, capacitors or other components (such elements can be soldered to a header and plugged into a wire wrap socket). The sockets are an additional cost compared to directly inserting integrated circuits into a printed circuit board, and add size and mass to a system. Multiple strands of wire may introduce cross-talk between circuits, of little consequence for digital circuits but a limitation for analog systems. The interconnected wires can radiate electromagnetic interference and have less predictable impedance than a printed circuit board. Wire-wrap construction cannot provide the ground planes and power distribution planes possible with multilayer printed circuit boards, increasing the possibility of noise.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In appearance it is similar to a Compact Cassette, using 3.81\u00a0mm / 0.15\" (commonly referred to as 4\u00a0mm) magnetic tape enclosed in a protective shell, but is roughly half the size at 73\u00a0mm \u00d7 54\u00a0mm \u00d7 10.5\u00a0mm. The recording is digital rather than analog. DAT can record at sampling rates equal to, as well as higher and lower than a CD (44.1, 48, or 32 kHz sampling rate respectively) at 16 bits quantization. If a comparable digital source is copied without returning to the analogue domain, then the DAT will produce an exact clone, unlike other digital media such as Digital Compact Cassette or non-Hi-MD MiniDisc, both of which use a lossy data-reduction system.\nSimilar to most formats of videocassette, a DAT cassette may only be recorded and played in one direction, unlike an analog compact audio cassette. Many DAT recorders had the capability to embed program numbers and IDs into the recording which can be used to select an individual track like on a CD player.\nAlthough intended as a replacement for analog audio compact cassettes, the format was never widely adopted by consumers because of its expense, as well as concerns from the music industry about unauthorized high-quality copies. The format saw moderate success in professional markets and as a computer storage medium, which was developed into the Digital Data Storage format. Sony ceased production of new recorders making it more difficult to play archived recordings in this format. Magnetic tape degradation has been noted by some engineers involved in re-mastering archival recordings on DAT, which presents a threat to audio held exclusively in this medium.\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nThe basic tape mechanism of DAT is closely based on video recorders, using a rotating head and helical scan to record data. This prevents DATs from being physically edited in the cut-and-splice manner of analog tapes, or open-reel digital tapes like ProDigi or DASH. In 1983, a DAT meeting was established to unify the standards for recording digital audio on magnetic tape developed by each company and in 1985, two standards were created: R-DAT (Rotating Digital Audio Tape) using a rotary head and S-DAT (Stationary Digital Audio Tape) using a fixed head. The S-DAT format had a simple mechanism similar to the Compact Cassette format but was difficult to develop a fixed recording head for high-density recording while the rotating head of the R-DAT had a proven track record in VCR formats like VHS &amp; Betamax. As the S-DAT version was never released, R-DAT had been renamed as simply \"DAT\" by the time of its launch. However, Philips and Matsushita (Panasonic) would later release their own stationary head digital format in the form of the Digital Compact Cassette. Sony would later introduce another rotating head format in the form of NT which was intended to replace the Microcassette and Mini-Cassette.\nThe DAT standard allows for four sampling modes: 32\u00a0kHz at 12 bits, and 32\u00a0kHz, 44.1\u00a0kHz or 48\u00a0kHz at 16 bits. Certain recorders operate outside the specification, allowing recording at 96\u00a0kHz and 24 bits (HHS). Some early machines aimed at the consumer market did not operate at 44.1\u00a0kHz when recording so they could not be used to 'clone' a compact disc. Since each recording standard uses the same tape, the quality of the sampling has a direct relation to the duration of the recording \u2013 32\u00a0kHz at 12 bits will allow six hours of recording onto a three-hour tape while HHS will only give 90 minutes from the same tape. Included in the signal data are subcodes to indicate the start and end of tracks or to skip a section entirely; this allows for indexing and fast seeking. Two-channel stereo recording is supported under all sampling rates and bit depths, but the R-DAT standard does support 4-channel recording at 32\u00a0kHz.\nDATs are between 15 and 180 minutes in length, a 120-minute tape being 60 metres in length. DATs longer than 60 metres tend to be problematic in DAT recorders due to the thinner media. DAT machines running at 48\u00a0kHz and 44.1\u00a0kHz sample rates transport the tape at 8.15\u00a0mm/s. DAT machines running at 32\u00a0kHz sample rate transport the tape at 4.075\u00a0mm/s.\nPredecessor formats.\nDAT was not the first digital audio tape; pulse-code modulation (PCM) was used in Japan by Denon in 1972 for the mastering and production of analogue phonograph records, using a 2-inch Quadruplex-format videotape recorder for its transport, but this was not developed into a consumer product. Denon's development dated from its work with Japan's NHK Broadcasting; NHK developed the first high-fidelity PCM audio recorder in the late 1960s. Denon continued development of their PCM recorders that used professional video machines as the storage medium, eventually building 8-track units used for, among other productions, a series of jazz records made in New York in the late 1970s.\nIn 1976, another digital audio tape format was developed by Soundstream, using wide reel-to-reel tape loaded on an instrumentation recorder manufactured by Honeywell acting as a transport, which in turn was connected to outboard digital audio encoding and decoding hardware of Soundstream's own design. Soundstream's format was improved through several prototypes and when it was developed to 50\u00a0kHz sampling rate at 16 bits, it was deemed good enough for professional classical recording by the company's first client, Telarc Records of Cleveland, Ohio. Telarc's April, 1978 recording of the Holst Suites for Band by Frederick Fennell and the Cleveland Wind Ensemble was a landmark release, and ushered in digital recording for America's classical music labels. Soundstream's system was also used by RCA.\nStarting in 1978, 3M introduced its own line and format of digital audio tape recorders for use in a recording studio. One of the first prototypes of 3M's system was installed in the studios of Sound 80 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This system was used in June 1978 to record Aaron Copland's \"Appalachian Spring\" by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. That record was the first Grammy-winning digital recording. The production version of the 3M Digital Mastering System was used in 1979 to record the first all-digital rock album, Ry Cooder's \"Bop Till You Drop,\" made at Warner Brothers Studio in California.\nThe first consumer-oriented PCM format used consumer video tape formats (Beta and VHS) as the storage medium. These systems used the EIAJ digital format, which sampled at 44.056\u00a0kHz at 14 bits. The Sony PCM-F1 system debuted in 1981, and Sony from the start offered the option of 16-bit wordlength. Other systems were marketed by Akai, JVC, Nakamichi and others. Panasonic, via its Technics division, briefly sold a digital recorder that combined an EIAJ digital adapter with a VHS video transport, the SV-P100. These machines were marketed by consumer electronics companies to consumers, but they were very pricey compared to cassette or even reel-to-reel decks of the time. They did catch on with the more budget conscious professional recordists, and some boutique-label professional releases were recorded using these machines.\nStarting in the early 1980s, professional systems using a PCM adaptor were also common as mastering formats. These systems digitized an analog audio signal and then encoded the resulting digital stream into an analog video signal so that a conventional VCR could be used as a storage medium.\nOne of the most significant examples of a PCM adaptor-based system was the Sony PCM-1600 digital audio mastering system, introduced in 1978. The PCM-1600 used a U-Matic-format VCR for its transport, connected to external digital audio processing hardware. It (and its later versions such as the PCM-1610 and 1630) was widely used for the production and mastering of some of the first Digital Audio CDs in the early 1980s. Once CDs were commercially introduced in 1982, tapes recorded on the PCM-1600 were sent to the CD pressing plants to be used to make the glass master disc for CD replication.\nOther examples include dbx, Inc.'s Model 700 system, which, similar to later Super Audio CDs, used a high sample-rate delta-sigma modulation rather than PCM; Decca's 1970s PCM system, which used a videotape recorder manufactured by IVC for a transport; and Mitsubishi's X-80 digital recorder, a 6.4\u00a0mm (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444\u00a0in) open reel digital mastering format that used a very unusual sampling rate of 50.4\u00a0kHz.\nFor high-quality studio recording, all of these formats were effectively made obsolete in the early 1980s by two competing reel-to-reel formats with stationary heads: Sony's DASH format and Mitsubishi's continuation of the X-80 recorder, which was improved upon to become the ProDigi format. (In fact, one of the first ProDigi-format recorders, the Mitsubishi X-86C, was playback-compatible with tapes recorded on an X-80.) Both of these formats remained popular as an analog alternative until the early 1990s, when hard disk recorders rendered them obsolete.\nDemise.\nSony released its last DAT product with the DAT Walkman TCD-D100 in 1995 and continued to produce it until November 2005 when Sony announced that its remaining DAT machine models would be discontinued the following month. Sony had sold around 660,000 DAT products since its introduction in 1987. Sony continued to produce blank DAT tapes until 2015 when it announced it would cease production by the end of the year. Even with this, the DAT format still finds regular use in film and television recording, primarily due to the support in some recorders for SMPTE time code synchronisation, and sometimes by audio enthusiasts as a way of backing up vinyl, compact cassette and CD collections to a digital format to then be transferred to PC. Although it has been superseded by modern hard disk recording or memory card equipment, which offers much more flexibility and storage, Digital Data Storage tapes, which are broadly similar to DATs, apart from tape length and thickness on some variants, and are still manufactured today unlike DAT cassettes, are often used as substitutes in many situations.\nDigital Compact Cassette.\nThe DAT recorder mechanism was considerably more complex and expensive than an analogue cassette deck mechanism due to the rotary helical scan head, therefore Philips and Panasonic Corporation developed a rival digital tape recorder system with a stationary head based on the analogue compact cassette known as S-DAT. The Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) was cheaper and simpler mechanically than DAT, but did not make perfect digital copies as it used a lossy compression technique called PASC. (Lossy compression was necessary to reduce the data rate to a level that the DCC head could record successfully at the linear tape speed of 4.75\u00a0cm/s that the compact cassette system uses.) DCC was never a competitor to DAT in recording studios, because DAT was already established, and studios favor lossless formats. As DCC was launched at the same time as Sony's Minidisc format (which has random access and editing features), it was not successful with consumers either. However, DCC proved that high quality digital recording could be achieved with a cheap simple mechanism using stationary heads.\nAnti-DAT lobbying.\nIn the late 1980s, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) unsuccessfully lobbied against the introduction of DAT devices into the U.S. Initially, the organization threatened legal action against any manufacturer attempting to sell DAT machines in the country. It later sought to impose restrictions on DAT recorders to prevent them from being used to copy LPs, CDs, and prerecorded cassettes. One of these efforts, the Digital Audio Recorder Copycode Act of 1987 (introduced by Sen. Al Gore and Rep. Waxman), initiated by CBS Records president Walter Yetnikoff, involved a technology called CopyCode and required DAT machines to include a chip to detect attempts to copy material recorded with a notch filter, meaning that copyrighted prerecorded music, whether analog or digital, whether on LP, cassette, or DAT, would have distorted sound resulting from the notch filter applied by the publisher at the time of mastering for mass reproduction. A National Bureau of Standards study showed that not only were the effects plainly audible, but that it was not even effective at preventing copying.\nThis opposition by CBS softened after Sony, a DAT manufacturer, bought CBS Records in January 1988. By June 1989, an agreement was reached, and the only concession the RIAA would receive was a more practical recommendation from manufacturers to Congress that legislation be enacted to require that recorders have a Serial Copy Management System to prevent digital copying for more than a single generation. This requirement was enacted as part of the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, which also imposed taxes on DAT recorders and blank media. However, the computer industry successfully lobbied to have personal computers exempted from that act, setting the stage for massive consumer copying of copyrighted material on materials like recordable CDs and by extension, filesharing systems such as Napster.\nUses.\nProfessional recording industry.\nDAT was used professionally in the 1990s by the audio recording industry as part of an emerging all-digital production chain also including digital multi-track recorders and digital mixing consoles that was used to create a fully digital recording. In this configuration, it is possible for the audio to remain digital from the first AD converter after the mic preamp until it is in a CD player.\nPre-recorded albums.\nIn December 1987, \"The Guitar And Other Machines\" by the British post-punk band The Durutti Column, became the first commercial release on DAT. Later in May 1988, Wire released their album \"The Ideal Copy\" on the format. Several other albums from multiple record labels were also released as pre-recorded DATs in the first few years of the format's existence, in small quantities as well. Factory Records released a small number of albums on the format, including New Order's best-selling compilation \"Substance 1987\", but many planned releases were cancelled.\nAmateur and home use.\nDAT was envisaged by proponents as the successor format to analogue audio cassettes in the way that the compact disc was the successor to vinyl-based recordings. It sold well in Japan, where high-end consumer audio stores stocked DAT recorders and tapes into the 2010s and second-hand stores generally continued to offer a wide selection of mint condition machines. However, there and in other nations, the technology was never as commercially popular as CD or cassette. DAT recorders proved to be comparatively expensive and few commercial recordings were available. Globally, DAT remained popular, for a time, for making and trading recordings of live music (see bootleg recording), since available DAT recorders predated affordable CD recorders. In the 1990s, fans of jam bands, such as the Grateful Dead and Phish, recorded and stored high-quality audience recordings of live concerts on the format.\nComputer data storage medium.\nThe format was designed for audio use, but through the ISO Digital Data Storage standard was adopted for general data storage, storing from 1.3 to 80\u00a0GB on a 60 to 180 meter tape depending on the standard and compression. It is a sequential-access medium and is commonly used for backups. Due to the higher requirements for capacity and integrity in data backups, a computer-grade DAT was introduced, called DDS (Digital Data Storage). Although functionally similar to audio DATs, only a few DDS and DAT drives (in particular, those manufactured by Archive for SGI workstations) are capable of reading the audio data from a DAT cassette. SGI DDS4 drives no longer have audio support; SGI removed the feature due to \"lack of demand\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its IUPAC name is 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP). The name \"picric\" comes from (\"pikros\"), meaning \"bitter\", due to its bitter taste. It is one of the most acidic phenols. Like other strongly nitrated organic compounds, picric acid is an explosive, which is its primary use. It has also been used as medicine (antiseptic, burn treatments) and as a dye.\nHistory.\nPicric acid was probably first mentioned in the 17th-century alchemical writings of Johann Rudolf Glauber. Initially, it was made by nitrating substances such as animal horn, silk, indigo, and natural resin, the synthesis from indigo first being performed by Peter Woulfe in 1771. The German chemist Justus von Liebig had named picric acid (rendered in French as ). Picric acid was given that name by the French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas in 1841. Its synthesis from phenol, and the correct determination of its formula, were accomplished during 1841. In 1799, French chemist Jean-Joseph Welter (1763\u20131852) produced picric acid by treating silk with nitric acid; he found that potassium picrate could explode. Not until 1830 did chemists think to use picric acid as an explosive. Before then, chemists assumed that only the salts of picric acid were explosive, not the acid itself. In 1871 Hermann Sprengel proved it could be detonated and afterwards most military powers used picric acid as their main high explosive material. A full synthesis was later found by Leonid Valerieovich Kozakov.\nPicric acid was the first strongly explosive nitrated organic compound widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional artillery. Nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose (guncotton) were available earlier, but shock sensitivity sometimes caused detonation in an artillery barrel at the time of firing. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist Eug\u00e8ne Turpin patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in blasting charges and artillery shells. In 1887 the French government adopted a mixture of picric acid and guncotton with the name Melinite. In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in Lydd, Kent, with the name Lyddite. Japan followed with an alternative stabilization approach known as Shimose powder which, instead of attempting to stabilize the material itself, removed its contact with metal by coating the inside of the shells with layer(s) of resin and wax. In 1889, a mixture of ammonium cresylate with trinitrocresol, or an ammonium salt of trinitrocresol, started to be manufactured with the name Ecrasite in Austria-Hungary. By 1894 Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with picric acid. Ammonium picrate (known as Dunnite or explosive D) was used by the United States beginning in 1906. However, shells filled with picric acid become unstable if the compound reacts with the metal shell or fuze casings to form metal picrates which are more sensitive than the parent phenol. The sensitivity of picric acid was demonstrated by the Halifax Explosion.\nPicric acid was used in the Battle of Omdurman, the Second Boer War, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War I. Germany began filling artillery shells with trinitrotoluene (TNT) in 1902. Toluene was less readily available than phenol, and TNT is less powerful than picric acid, but the improved safety of munitions manufacturing and storage caused the replacement of picric acid by TNT for most military purposes between the World Wars.\nEfforts to control the availability of phenol, the precursor to picric acid, emphasize its importance in World War I. Germans are reported to have bought US supplies of phenol and converted it to acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) to keep it from the Allies. At the time, phenol was obtained from coal as a co-product of coke ovens and the manufacture of gas for gas lighting. Laclede Gas reports being asked to expand production of phenol (and toluene) to assist the war effort. Both Monsanto and Dow Chemical began manufacturing synthetic phenol in 1915, with Dow being the main producer. Dow describes picric acid as \"the main battlefield explosive used by the French. Large amounts [of phenol] also went to Japan, where it was made into picric acid sold to the Russians.\"\nThomas Edison needed phenol to manufacture phonograph records. He responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake, New Jersey, facility using processes developed by his chemists. He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day. Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe. He built two plants to produce the raw material benzene at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Bessemer, Alabama, replacing supplies previously from Germany. Edison manufactured aniline dyes, which had previously been supplied by the German dye trust. Other wartime products included xylene, p-phenylenediamine, shellac, and pyrophyllite. Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable. In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.\nSynthesis.\nThe aromatic ring of phenol is activated towards electrophilic substitution reactions, and attempted nitration of phenol, even with dilute nitric acid, results in the formation of high molecular weight tars. In order to minimize these side reactions, anhydrous phenol is sulfonated with fuming sulfuric acid, and the resulting sulfonic acid is then nitrated with concentrated nitric acid. During this reaction, nitro groups are introduced, and the sulfonic acid group is displaced. The reaction is highly exothermic, and careful temperature control is required. Synthesis routes that nitrate aspirin or salicylic acid can also be used to mitigate tar formation. Carbon dioxide is lost from the former via decarboxylation, while both acetic acid and carbon dioxide are lost from the latter. Another method of picric acid synthesis is direct nitration of 2,4-dinitrophenol with nitric acid. It crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group \"Pca\"21 with a = 9.13 \u00c5, b = 18.69 \u00c5, c = 9.79 \u00c5 and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 90\u00b0.\nUses.\nBy far the greatest use of picric acid has been in ammunition and explosives. Explosive D, also known as Dunnite, is the ammonium salt of picric acid. Dunnite is more powerful but less stable than the more common explosive TNT (which is produced in a similar process to picric acid but with toluene as the feedstock). Picramide, formed by aminating picric acid (typically beginning with Dunnite), can be further aminated to produce the very stable explosive TATB. It has found some use in organic chemistry for the preparation of crystalline salts of organic bases (picrates) for the purpose of identification and characterization.\nOptical metallography.\nIn metallurgy, a 4% picric acid in ethanol etch, termed \"picral\", has been commonly used in optical metallography to reveal prior austenite grain boundaries in ferritic steels. The hazards associated with picric acid have meant it has largely been replaced with other chemical etchants. However, it is still used to etch magnesium alloys, such as AZ31.\nHistology.\nBouin solution is a common picric-acid\u2013containing fixative solution used for histology specimens. It improves the staining of acid dyes, but it can also result in hydrolysis of any DNA in the sample.\nPicric acid is used in the preparation of Picrosirius red, a histological stain for collagen.\nBlood tests.\nClinical chemistry laboratory testing utilizes picric acid for the Jaffe reaction to test for creatinine. It forms a colored complex that can be measured using spectroscopy.\nPicric acid forms red isopurpurate with hydrogen cyanide (HCN). By photometric measurement of the resulting dye, picric acid can be used to quantify hydrogen cyanide.\nDuring the early 20th century, picric acid was used to measure blood glucose levels. When glucose, picric acid and sodium carbonate are combined and heated, a characteristic red color forms. With a calibrating glucose solution, the red color can be used to measure the glucose levels added. This is known as the Lewis and Benedict method of measuring glucose.\nSkin dye.\nMuch less commonly, wet picric acid has been used as a skin dye, or temporary branding agent. It reacts with proteins in the skin to give a dark brown color that may last as long as a month.\nAntiseptic.\nDuring the early 20th century, picric acid was stocked in pharmacies as an antiseptic and as a treatment for burns, malaria, herpes, and smallpox. Picric-acid\u2013soaked gauze was commonly stocked in first aid kits from that period as a burn treatment. It was notably used for the treatment of burns suffered by victims of the Hindenburg disaster in 1937. Picric acid was used as a treatment for trench foot suffered by soldiers on the Western Front during World War I.\nPicric acid has been used for many years by fly tyers to dye mole skins and feathers a dark olive green for use as fishing lures. Its popularity has been tempered by its toxic nature.\nSafety.\nModern safety precautions recommend storing picric acid wet, to minimize the danger of explosion. Dry picric acid is relatively sensitive to shock and friction; laboratories that use it store it in bottles under a layer of water, rendering it safe. Glass or plastic bottles are required, as picric acid can easily form metal picrate salts that are even more sensitive and hazardous than the acid. Industrially, picric acid is especially hazardous because it is volatile and slowly sublimes even at room temperature. The buildup of picrates on exposed metal surfaces can constitute an explosion hazard.\nPicric acid gauze, if found in antique first aid kits, presents a safety hazard because picric acid of that vintage (60\u201390 years old) will have become crystallized and unstable, it may have formed metal picrates from long storage in a metal first aid case.\nBomb disposal units are often called to dispose of picric acid if it has dried out. In the United States there was an effort to remove dried picric acid containers from high school laboratories during the 1980s. \nMunitions containing picric acid may be found in sunken warships. The buildup of metal picrates over time renders them shock-sensitive and extremely hazardous. It is recommended that shipwrecks that contain such munitions not be disturbed. The hazard may subside when the shells become corroded enough to admit seawater as these materials are water-soluble. There are fluorescent probes to detect picric acid in very minute quantities.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The ideal gas concept is useful because it obeys the ideal gas law, a simplified equation of state, and is amenable to analysis under statistical mechanics. The requirement of zero interaction can often be relaxed if, for example, the interaction is perfectly elastic or regarded as point-like collisions.\nUnder various conditions of temperature and pressure, many real gases behave qualitatively like an ideal gas where the gas molecules (or atoms for monatomic gas) play the role of the ideal particles. Noble gases and mixtures such as air, have a considerable parameter range around standard temperature and pressure. Generally, a gas behaves more like an ideal gas at higher temperature and lower pressure, as the potential energy due to intermolecular forces becomes less significant compared with the particles' kinetic energy, and the size of the molecules becomes less significant compared to the empty space between them. One mole of an ideal gas has a volume of (exact value based on 2019 revision of the SI) at standard temperature and pressure (a temperature of 273.15\u00a0K and an absolute pressure of exactly 105\u00a0Pa).\nThe ideal gas model tends to fail at lower temperatures or higher pressures, where intermolecular forces and molecular size become important. It also fails for most heavy gases, such as many refrigerants, and for gases with strong intermolecular forces, notably water vapor. At high pressures, the volume of a real gas is often considerably larger than that of an ideal gas. At low temperatures, the pressure of a real gas is often considerably less than that of an ideal gas. At some point of low temperature and high pressure, real gases undergo a phase transition, such as to a liquid or a solid. The model of an ideal gas, however, does not describe or allow phase transitions. These must be modeled by more complex equations of state. The deviation from the ideal gas behavior can be described by a dimensionless quantity, the compressibility factor, Z.\nThe ideal gas model has been explored in both the Newtonian dynamics (as in \"kinetic theory\") and in quantum mechanics (as a \"gas in a box\"). The ideal gas model has also been used to model the behavior of electrons in a metal (in the Drude model and the free electron model), and it is one of the most important models in statistical mechanics.\nIf the pressure of an ideal gas is reduced in a throttling process the temperature of the gas does not change. (If the pressure of a real gas is reduced in a throttling process, its temperature either falls or rises, depending on whether its Joule\u2013Thomson coefficient is positive or negative.)\nTypes of ideal gas.\nThere are three basic classes of ideal gas:\nThe classical ideal gas can be separated into two types: The classical thermodynamic ideal gas and the ideal quantum Boltzmann gas. Both are essentially the same, except that the classical thermodynamic ideal gas is based on classical statistical mechanics, and certain thermodynamic parameters such as the entropy are only specified to within an undetermined additive constant. The ideal quantum Boltzmann gas overcomes this limitation by taking the limit of the quantum Bose gas and quantum Fermi gas in the limit of high temperature to specify these additive constants. The behavior of a quantum Boltzmann gas is the same as that of a classical ideal gas except for the specification of these constants. The results of the quantum Boltzmann gas are used in a number of cases including the Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation for the entropy of an ideal gas and the Saha ionization equation for a weakly ionized plasma.\nClassical thermodynamic ideal gas.\nThe classical thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas can be described by two equations of state:\nIdeal gas law.\nThe ideal gas law is the equation of state for an ideal gas, given by:\nformula_1\nwhere\nThe ideal gas law is an extension of experimentally discovered gas laws. It can also be derived from microscopic considerations.\nReal fluids at low density and high temperature approximate the behavior of a classical ideal gas. However, at lower temperatures or a higher density, a real fluid deviates strongly from the behavior of an ideal gas, particularly as it condenses from a gas into a liquid or as it deposits from a gas into a solid. This deviation is expressed as a compressibility factor.\nThis equation is derived from\nAfter combining three laws we get\n formula_5\nThat is:\n formula_6\n formula_7.\nInternal energy.\nThe other equation of state of an ideal gas must express Joule's second law, that the internal energy of a fixed mass of ideal gas is a function only of its temperature, with formula_8. For the present purposes it is convenient to postulate an exemplary version of this law by writing:\n formula_9\nwhere\nThat U for an ideal gas depends only on temperature is a consequence of the ideal gas law, although in the general case \u0109V depends on temperature and an integral is needed to compute U.\nMicroscopic model.\nIn order to switch from macroscopic quantities (left hand side of the following equation) to microscopic ones (right hand side), we use\n formula_10\nwhere\nThe probability distribution of particles by velocity or energy is given by the Maxwell speed distribution.\nThe ideal gas model depends on the following assumptions:\nThe assumption of spherical particles is necessary so that there are no rotational modes allowed, unlike in a diatomic gas. The following three assumptions are very related: molecules are hard, collisions are elastic, and there are no inter-molecular forces. The assumption that the space between particles is much larger than the particles themselves is of paramount importance, and explains why the ideal gas approximation fails at high pressures.\nHeat capacity.\nThe dimensionless heat capacity at constant volume is generally defined by\n formula_13\nwhere S is the entropy. This quantity is generally a function of temperature due to intermolecular and intramolecular forces, but for moderate temperatures it is approximately constant. Specifically, the Equipartition Theorem predicts that the constant for a monatomic gas is \"\u0109V\"\u00a0=\u00a0 while for a diatomic gas it is \"\u0109V\"\u00a0=\u00a0 if vibrations are neglected (which is often an excellent approximation). Since the heat capacity depends on the atomic or molecular nature of the gas, macroscopic measurements on heat capacity provide useful information on the microscopic structure of the molecules.\nThe dimensionless heat capacity at constant pressure of an ideal gas is:\n formula_14\nwhere \"H\" \n \"U\" + \"PV\" is the enthalpy of the gas.\nSometimes, a distinction is made between an ideal gas, where \"\u0109V\" and \"\u0109P\" could vary with temperature, and a perfect gas, for which this is not the case.\nThe ratio of the constant volume and constant pressure heat capacity is the adiabatic index\n formula_15\nFor air, which is a mixture of gases that are mainly diatomic (nitrogen and oxygen), this ratio is often assumed to be 7/5, the value predicted by the classical Equipartition Theorem for diatomic gases.\nEntropy.\nUsing the results of thermodynamics only, we can go a long way in determining the expression for the entropy of an ideal gas. This is an important step since, according to the theory of thermodynamic potentials, if we can express the entropy as a function of U (U is a thermodynamic potential), volume V and the number of particles N, then we will have a complete statement of the thermodynamic behavior of the ideal gas. We will be able to derive both the ideal gas law and the expression for internal energy from it.\nSince the entropy is an exact differential, using the chain rule, the change in entropy when going from a reference state 0 to some other state with entropy S may be written as\n formula_16\nwhere the reference variables may be functions of the number of particles N. Using the definition of the heat capacity at constant volume for the first differential and the appropriate Maxwell relation for the second, we have\n formula_17\nExpressing CV in terms of \"\u0109V\" as developed in the above section, differentiating the ideal gas equation of state, and integrating yields\n formula_18\nwhich implies that the entropy may be expressed as\n formula_19\nwhere all constants have been incorporated into the logarithm as \"f\"(\"N\") which is some function of the particle number N having the same dimensions as VT\u0109V in order that the argument of the logarithm be dimensionless. We now impose the constraint that the entropy is extensive, meaning that when the extensive parameters (V and N) are multiplied by a constant, the entropy is multiplied by the same constant. Mathematically:\n formula_20\nFrom this we find an equation for the function \"f\"(\"N\"):\n formula_21\nDifferentiating this with respect to a, setting a equal to 1, and then solving the differential equation yields\n formula_22\nwhere \u03a6 may vary for different gases but is independent of the thermodynamic state of the gas. It has the dimensions of \"VT\u0109V\"/\"N\". Substituting into the equation for the entropy,\n formula_23\nand using the expression for the internal energy of an ideal gas, the entropy may be written\n formula_24\nSince this is an expression for entropy in terms of U, V, and N, it is a fundamental equation from which all other properties of the ideal gas may be derived.\nThis is about as far as we can go using thermodynamics alone. Note that the above equation is flawed\u00a0\u2013 as the temperature approaches zero, the entropy approaches negative infinity, in contradiction to the third law of thermodynamics. In the above \"ideal\" development, there is a critical point, not at absolute zero, at which the argument of the logarithm becomes unity, and the entropy becomes zero. This is unphysical. The above equation is a good approximation only when the argument of the logarithm is much larger than unity\u00a0\u2013 the concept of an ideal gas breaks down at low values of . Nevertheless, there will be a \"best\" value of the constant in the sense that the predicted entropy is as close as possible to the actual entropy, given the flawed assumption of ideality. A quantum-mechanical derivation of this constant is developed in the derivation of the Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation, which expresses the entropy of a monatomic (\"\u0109V\" = 3/2) ideal gas. In the Sackur\u2013Tetrode theory the constant depends only upon the mass of the gas particle. The Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation also suffers from a divergent entropy at absolute zero but is a good approximation for the entropy of a monatomic ideal gas for high enough temperatures.\nAn alternative way of expressing the change in entropy is\nformula_25\nThermodynamic potentials.\nExpressing the entropy as a function of T, V, and N:\n formula_26\nThe chemical potential of the ideal gas is calculated from the corresponding equation of state (see thermodynamic potential):\n formula_27\nwhere G is the Gibbs free energy and is equal to \"U\" + \"PV\" \u2212 \"TS\" so that:\n formula_28\nThe chemical potential is usually referenced to the potential at some standard pressure \"Po\" so that, with formula_29:\n formula_30\nFor a mixture (\"j\"=1,2...) of ideal gases, each at partial pressure \"Pj\", it can be shown that the chemical potential \"\u03bcj\" will be given by the above expression with the pressure \"P\" replaced by \"Pj\".\nThe thermodynamic potentials for an ideal gas can now be written as functions of T, V, and N as:\nwhere, as before,\n formula_31.\nThe most informative way of writing the potentials is in terms of their natural variables, since each of these equations can be used to derive all of the other thermodynamic variables of the system. In terms of their natural variables, the thermodynamic potentials of a single-species ideal gas are:\n formula_32\n formula_33\n formula_34\n formula_35\nIn statistical mechanics, the relationship between the Helmholtz free energy and the partition function is fundamental, and is used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of matter; see https:// for more details.\nSpeed of sound.\nThe speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by the Newton-Laplace formula:\n formula_36\nwhere the isentropic Bulk modulus formula_37\nFor an isentropic process of an ideal gas, formula_38, therefore\n formula_39\nHere,\nIdeal quantum gases.\nIn the above-mentioned Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation, the best choice of the entropy constant was found to be proportional to the quantum thermal wavelength of a particle, and the point at which the argument of the logarithm becomes zero is roughly equal to the point at which the average distance between particles becomes equal to the thermal wavelength. In fact, quantum theory itself predicts the same thing. Any gas behaves as an ideal gas at high enough temperature and low enough density, but at the point where the Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation begins to break down, the gas will begin to behave as a quantum gas, composed of either bosons or fermions. (See the gas in a box article for a derivation of the ideal quantum gases, including the ideal Boltzmann gas.)\nGases tend to behave as an ideal gas over a wider range of pressures when the temperature reaches the Boyle temperature.\nIdeal Boltzmann gas.\nThe ideal Boltzmann gas yields the same results as the classical thermodynamic gas, but makes the following identification for the undetermined constant \u03a6:\n formula_40\nwhere \u039b is the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the gas and g is the degeneracy of states.\nIdeal Bose and Fermi gases.\nAn ideal gas of bosons (e.g. a photon gas) will be governed by Bose\u2013Einstein statistics and the distribution of energy will be in the form of a Bose\u2013Einstein distribution. An ideal gas of fermions will be governed by Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics and the distribution of energy will be in the form of a Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In an ideal, perfectly elastic collision, there is no net conversion of kinetic energy into other forms such as heat, sound, or potential energy.\nDuring the collision of small objects, kinetic energy is first converted to potential energy associated with a repulsive or attractive force between the particles (when the particles move against this force, i.e. the angle between the force and the relative velocity is obtuse), then this potential energy is converted back to kinetic energy (when the particles move with this force, i.e. the angle between the force and the relative velocity is acute).\nCollisions of atoms are elastic, for example Rutherford backscattering.\nA useful special case of elastic collision is when the two bodies have equal mass, in which case they will simply exchange their momenta.\nThe \"molecules\"\u2014as distinct from atoms\u2014of a gas or liquid rarely experience perfectly elastic collisions because kinetic energy is exchanged between the molecules\u2019 translational motion and their internal degrees of freedom with each collision. At any instant, half the collisions are, to a varying extent, \"inelastic collisions\" (the pair possesses less kinetic energy in their translational motions after the collision than before), and the other half could be described as \"super-elastic\" (possessing \"more\" kinetic energy after the collision than before). Averaged across the entire sample, molecular collisions can be regarded as essentially elastic as long as black-body radiation is negligible or doesn't escape.\nIn the case of macroscopic bodies, perfectly elastic collisions are an ideal never fully realized, but approximated by the interactions of objects such as billiard balls.\nWhen considering energies, possible rotational energy before or after a collision may also play a role.\nEquations.\nOne-dimensional Newtonian.\nIn any collision without an external force, momentum is conserved; but in an elastic collision, kinetic energy is also conserved. Consider particles A and B with masses \"m\"A, \"m\"B, and velocities \"v\"A1, \"v\"B1 before collision, \"v\"A2, \"v\"B2 after collision. The conservation of momentum before and after the collision is expressed by:\nformula_1\nLikewise, the conservation of the total kinetic energy is expressed by:\nformula_2\nThese equations may be solved directly to find formula_3 when formula_4 are known:\nformula_5\nAlternatively the final velocity of a particle, v2 (vA2 or vB2) is expressed by:\nformula_6\nWhere:\nformula_7\nIf both masses are the same, we have a trivial solution:\nformula_8\nThis simply corresponds to the bodies exchanging their initial velocities with each other.\nAs can be expected, the solution is invariant under adding a constant to all velocities (Galilean relativity), which is like using a frame of reference with constant translational velocity. Indeed, to derive the equations, one may first change the frame of reference so that one of the known velocities is zero, determine the unknown velocities in the new frame of reference, and convert back to the original frame of reference.\nBall A: mass = 3 kg, velocity = 4 m/s\nBall B: mass = 5 kg, velocity = 0 m/s\nBall A: velocity = \u22121 m/s\nBall B: velocity = 3 m/s\nExamples.\nAnother situation:\nThe following illustrate the case of equal mass, formula_9.\nIn the limiting case where formula_10 is much larger than formula_11, such as a ping-pong paddle hitting a ping-pong ball or an SUV hitting a trash can, the heavier mass hardly changes velocity, while the lighter mass bounces off, reversing its velocity plus approximately twice that of the heavy one.\nIn the case of a large formula_12, the value of formula_13 is small if the masses are approximately the same: hitting a much lighter particle does not change the velocity much, hitting a much heavier particle causes the fast particle to bounce back with high speed. This is why a neutron moderator (a medium which slows down fast neutrons, thereby turning them into thermal neutrons capable of sustaining a chain reaction) is a material full of atoms with light nuclei which do not easily absorb neutrons: the lightest nuclei have about the same mass as a neutron.\nDerivation of solution.\nTo derive the above equations for formula_14 rearrange the kinetic energy and momentum equations:\nformula_15\nDividing each side of the top equation by each side of the bottom equation, and using \nformula_16 gives:\nformula_17\nThat is, the relative velocity of one particle with respect to the other is reversed by the collision. \nNow the above formulas follow from solving a system of linear equations for \nformula_14; this is done by regarding \nformula_19 \nas constants:\nformula_20\nOnce formula_13 is determined, formula_22 can be found by symmetry.\nCenter of mass frame.\nWith respect to the center of mass, both velocities are reversed by the collision: a heavy particle moves slowly toward the center of mass, and bounces back with the same low speed, and a light particle moves fast toward the center of mass, and bounces back with the same high speed.\nThe velocity of the center of mass does not change by the collision. To see this, consider the center of mass at time formula_23 before collision and time formula_24 after collision:\nformula_25\nHence, the velocities of the center of mass before and after collision are:\nformula_26\nThe numerators of formula_27 and formula_28 are the total momenta before and after collision. Since momentum is conserved, we have formula_29\nOne-dimensional relativistic.\nAccording to special relativity,\nformula_30\nwhere \"p\" denotes momentum of any particle with mass \"m\", \"v\" denotes velocity, and \"c\" is the speed of light.\nIn the center of momentum frame where the total momentum equals zero, \nformula_31\nHere formula_32 represent the rest masses of the two colliding bodies, formula_33 represent their velocities before collision, formula_34 their velocities after collision, formula_35 their momenta, formula_36 is the speed of light in vacuum, and formula_37 denotes the total energy, the sum of rest masses and kinetic energies of the two bodies.\nSince the total energy and momentum of the system are conserved and their rest masses do not change, it is shown that the momentum of the colliding body is decided by the rest masses of the colliding bodies, total energy and the total momentum. Relative to the center of momentum frame, the momentum of each colliding body does not change magnitude after collision, but reverses its direction of movement.\nComparing with classical mechanics, which gives accurate results dealing with macroscopic objects moving much slower than the speed of light, total momentum of the two colliding bodies is frame-dependent. In the center of momentum frame, according to classical mechanics,\nformula_38\nThis agrees with the relativistic calculation formula_39 despite other differences. \nOne of the postulates in Special Relativity states that the laws of physics, such as conservation of momentum, should be invariant in all inertial frames of reference. In a general inertial frame where the total momentum could be arbitrary,\nformula_40\nWe can look at the two moving bodies as one system of which the total momentum is formula_41 the total energy is formula_37 and its velocity formula_43 is the velocity of its center of mass. Relative to the center of momentum frame the total momentum equals zero. It can be shown that formula_43 is given by:\nformula_45\nNow the velocities before the collision in the center of momentum frame formula_46 and formula_47 are:\nformula_48\nWhen formula_49 and formula_50\nformula_51\nTherefore, the classical calculation holds true when the speed of both colliding bodies is much lower than the speed of light (~300,000 kilometres per second).\nRelativistic derivation using hyperbolic functions.\nUsing the so-called \"parameter of velocity\" formula_52 (usually called the rapidity),\nformula_53\nwe get\nformula_54\nRelativistic energy and momentum are expressed as follows:\nformula_55\nEquations sum of energy and momentum colliding masses formula_56 and formula_57 (velocities formula_58 correspond to the velocity parameters formula_59), after dividing by adequate power formula_36 are as follows:\nformula_61\nand dependent equation, the sum of above equations:\nformula_62\nsubtract squares both sides equations \"momentum\" from \"energy\" and use the identity formula_63 after simplifying we get:\nformula_64\nfor non-zero mass, using the hyperbolic trigonometric identity formula_65 we get:\nformula_66\nas functions formula_67 is even we get two solutions:\nformula_68\nfrom the last equation, leading to a non-trivial solution, we solve formula_69 and substitute into the dependent equation, we obtain formula_70 and then formula_71 we have:\nformula_72\nIt is a solution to the problem, but expressed by the parameters of velocity. Return substitution to get the solution for velocities is:\nformula_73\nSubstitute the previous solutions and replace:\nformula_74 and formula_75 after long transformation, with substituting:\nformula_76\nwe get:\nformula_77\nTwo-dimensional.\nFor the case of two non-spinning colliding bodies in two dimensions, the motion of the bodies is determined by the three conservation laws of momentum, kinetic energy and angular momentum. The overall velocity of each body must be split into two perpendicular velocities: one tangent to the common normal surfaces of the colliding bodies at the point of contact, the other along the line of collision. Since the collision only imparts force along the line of collision, the velocities that are tangent to the point of collision do not change. The velocities along the line of collision can then be used in the same equations as a one-dimensional collision. The final velocities can then be calculated from the two new component velocities and will depend on the point of collision. Studies of two-dimensional collisions are conducted for many bodies in the framework of a two-dimensional gas.\nIn a center of momentum frame at any time the velocities of the two bodies are in opposite directions, with magnitudes inversely proportional to the masses. In an elastic collision these magnitudes do not change. The directions may change depending on the shapes of the bodies and the point of impact. For example, in the case of spheres the angle depends on the distance between the (parallel) paths of the centers of the two bodies. Any non-zero change of direction is possible: if this distance is zero the velocities are reversed in the collision; if it is close to the sum of the radii of the spheres the two bodies are only slightly deflected.\nAssuming that the second particle is at rest before the collision, the angles of deflection of the two particles, formula_78 and formula_79, are related to the angle of deflection formula_80 in the system of the center of mass by\nformula_81\nThe magnitudes of the velocities of the particles after the collision are:\nformula_82\nTwo-dimensional collision with two moving objects.\nThe final x and y velocities components of the first ball can be calculated as:\nformula_83\nwhere \"v\"1 and \"v\"2 are the scalar sizes of the two original speeds of the objects, \"m\"1 and \"m\"2 are their masses, \"\u03b8\"1 and \"\u03b8\"2 are their movement angles, that is, formula_84 (meaning moving directly down to the right is either a \u221245\u00b0 angle, or a 315\u00b0 angle), and lowercase phi (\u03c6) is the contact angle. (To get the x and y velocities of the second ball, one needs to swap all the '1' subscripts with '2' subscripts.)\nThis equation is derived from the fact that the interaction between the two bodies is easily calculated along the contact angle, meaning the velocities of the objects can be calculated in one dimension by rotating the x and y axis to be parallel with the contact angle of the objects, and then rotated back to the original orientation to get the true x and y components of the velocities.\nIn an angle-free representation, the changed velocities are computed using the centers x1 and x2 at the time of contact as\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere the angle brackets indicate the inner product (or dot product) of two vectors.\nOther conserved quantities.\nIn the particular case of particles having equal masses, it can be verified by direct computation from the result above that the scalar product of the velocities before and after the collision are the same, that is formula_85 Although this product is not an additive invariant in the same way that momentum and kinetic energy are for elastic collisions, it seems that preservation of this quantity can nonetheless be used to derive higher-order conservation laws.\nDerivation of two dimensional solution.\nThe impulse formula_86 during the collision for each particle is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nConservation of Momentum implies formula_87\nSince the force during collision is perpendicular to both particles' surfaces at the contact point, the impulse is along the line parallel to formula_88, the relative vector between the particles' center at collision time:\n formula_89 for some formula_90 to be determined and formula_91\nThen from (2):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFrom above equations, conservation of kinetic energy now requires:\nformula_92with formula_93\nThe both solutions of this equation are formula_94 and formula_95, where formula_94 corresponds to the trivial case of no collision. Substituting the non trivial value of formula_90 in (3) we get the desired result (1).\nSince all equations are in vectorial form, this derivation is valid also for three dimensions with spheres.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At any one instant, half the collisions are \u2013 to a varying extent \u2013 inelastic (the pair possesses less kinetic energy after the collision than before), and half could be described as \u201csuper-elastic\u201d (possessing \"more\" kinetic energy after the collision than before). Averaged across an entire sample, molecular collisions are elastic. \nAlthough inelastic collisions do not conserve kinetic energy, they do obey conservation of momentum. Simple ballistic pendulum problems obey the conservation of kinetic energy \"only\" when the block swings to its largest angle.\nIn nuclear physics, an inelastic collision is one in which the incoming particle causes the nucleus it strikes to become excited or to break up. Deep inelastic scattering is a method of probing the structure of subatomic particles in much the same way as Rutherford probed the inside of the atom (see Rutherford scattering). Such experiments were performed on protons in the late 1960s using high-energy electrons at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC). As in Rutherford scattering, deep inelastic scattering of electrons by proton targets revealed that most of the incident electrons interact very little and pass straight through, with only a small number bouncing back. This indicates that the charge in the proton is concentrated in small lumps, reminiscent of Rutherford's discovery that the positive charge in an atom is concentrated at the nucleus. However, in the case of the proton, the evidence suggested three distinct concentrations of charge (quarks) and not one.\nFormula.\nThe formula for the velocities after a one-dimensional collision is:\nformula_1\nwhere\nIn a center of momentum frame the formulas reduce to:\nformula_2\nFor two- and three-dimensional collisions the velocities in these formulas are the components perpendicular to the tangent line/plane at the point of contact.\nIf assuming the objects are not rotating before or after the collision, the normal impulse is:\nformula_3\nwhere formula_4 is the normal vector.\nAssuming no friction, this gives the velocity updates:\nformula_5\nPerfectly inelastic collision.\nA perfectly inelastic collision occurs when the maximum amount of kinetic energy\nof a system is lost. In a perfectly inelastic collision, i.e., a zero coefficient of restitution, the colliding particles stick together. In such a collision, kinetic energy is lost by bonding the two bodies together. This bonding energy usually results in a maximum kinetic energy loss of the system. It is necessary to consider conservation of momentum: (Note: In the sliding block example above, momentum of the two body system is only conserved if the surface has zero friction. With friction, momentum of the two bodies is transferred to the surface that the two bodies are sliding upon. Similarly, if there is air resistance, the momentum of the bodies can be transferred to the air.) The equation below holds true for the two-body (Body A, Body B) system collision in the example above. In this example, momentum of the system is conserved because there is no friction between the sliding bodies and the surface.\nformula_6\nwhere \"v\" is the final velocity, which is hence given by\nformula_7The reduction of total kinetic energy is equal to the total kinetic energy before the collision in a center of momentum frame with respect to the system of two particles, because in such a frame the kinetic energy after the collision is zero. In this frame most of the kinetic energy before the collision is that of the particle with the smaller mass. In another frame, in addition to the reduction of kinetic energy there may be a transfer of kinetic energy from one particle to the other; the fact that this depends on the frame shows how relative this is. The change in kinetic energy is hence:\nformula_8\nwhere \u03bc is the reduced mass and urel is the relative velocity of the bodies before collision. With time reversed we have the situation of two objects pushed away from each other, e.g. shooting a projectile, or a rocket applying thrust (compare the derivation of the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation).\nPartially inelastic collisions.\nPartially inelastic collisions are the most common form of collisions in the real world. In this type of collision, the objects involved in the collisions do not stick, but some kinetic energy is still lost. Friction, sound and heat are some ways the kinetic energy can be lost through partial inelastic collisions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It consists of making a pinprick puncture in one heel of the newborn to collect their blood. This technique is used frequently as the main way to collect blood from neonates. Other techniques include venous or arterial needle sticks, cord blood sampling, or umbilical line collection. This technique is often used for the Guthrie test, where it is used to soak the blood into pre-printed collection cards known as Guthrie cards.\nThe classical Guthrie test is named after Robert Guthrie, an American bacteriologist and physician who devised it in 1962. The test has been widely used in North America and Europe as one of the core newborn screening tests since the late 1960s. The test was initially a bacterial inhibition assay, but is gradually being replaced in many areas by newer techniques such as tandem mass spectrometry that can detect a wider variety of congenital diseases.\nDetected diseases.\nThe blood samples can be used for a variety of metabolic tests to detect genetic conditions, including:\nMechanism.\nThe test uses the growth of a strain of bacteria on a specially-prepared agar plate as a sign for the presence of high levels of phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate. The compound B-2-thienylalanine will inhibit the growth of the bacterium \"Bacillus subtilis\" (ATCC 6051) on minimal culture media. If phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate is added to the medium, then growth is restored. Such compounds will be present in excess in the blood or urine of patients with PKU. If a suitably-prepared sample of blood or urine is applied to the seeded agar plate, the growth of the bacteria in the test will be a positive indicator for PKU in the patient.\nTo prepare the sample for application, a small amount of blood (from a heel puncture, for example) or urine (from a diaper, for example) is applied to a piece of filter paper. Then a small disc is punched from the center of the spot of blood or urine, and the disc applied to the surface of a seeded, minimal-medium agar plate that contains added beta-2-thienylalanine. If the sample contains phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate then these compounds will diffuse into the agar medium. If their concentrations are high enough (as with the excess levels seen with PKU), bacteria will grow under the disc, but not elsewhere. Generally an overnight incubation is enough to determine whether phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, and/or phenyllactate are present in unusual concentrations in blood or urine.\nTiming.\nThe blood spot sample should be taken between 48 and 72 hours of age for all babies regardless of medical condition, milk feeding and prematurity. For the purpose of screening, date of birth is day 0 (some IT systems record date of birth as day 1). False positives and false negatives can sometimes occur when the screening tests are performed before 48 hours.\nWhen the immunoassay method is used as a screening method for quantifying 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) in dried blood spots, it exhibits a significant rate of false positive results. As per the clinical practice guideline issued by the Endocrine Society in 2018, employing LC-MS/MS to measure 17OHP and other adrenal steroid hormones (such as 21-deoxycortisol and androstenedione) is recommended as a supplementary screening approach to enhance the accuracy of positive predictions.\nWith genetic tests becoming more common, a wide variety of tests may use the blood drawn by this method. Many neonatal units (SCBUs) now use this method to carry out the daily blood tests (blood count, electrolytes) required to check the progress of ill neonates.\nData retention controversy.\nIn Ireland, a controversy emerged in 2012 whereby a number of hospitals retained heel prick test cards and thereby a DNA database with over a million samples from 1984, without parental consent or notification. This resulted in the introduction of a ten-year rolling destruction cycle. Similar practices exist in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and several states of the United States.\nHeel stick wound.\nHeel stick wounds are a cutaneous condition characterized by a break in the skin caused by neonatal heel prick. The heel stick is an important medical screening for the child and causes low levels of pain. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

PCBs are used to connect or \"wire\" components to one another in an electronic circuit. Electrical components may be fixed to conductive pads on the outer layers, generally by soldering, which both electrically connects and mechanically fastens the components to the board. Another manufacturing process adds vias, metal-lined drilled holes that enable electrical interconnections between conductive layers, to boards with more than a single side.\nPrinted circuit boards are used in nearly all electronic products today. Alternatives to PCBs include wire wrap and point-to-point construction, both once popular but now rarely used. PCBs require additional design effort to lay out the circuit, but manufacturing and assembly can be automated. Electronic design automation software is available to do much of the work of layout. Mass-producing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other wiring methods, as components are mounted and wired in one operation. Large numbers of PCBs can be fabricated at the same time, and the layout has to be done only once. PCBs can also be made manually in small quantities, with reduced benefits.\nPCBs can be single-sided (one copper layer), double-sided (two copper layers on both sides of one substrate layer), or multi-layer (stacked layers of substrate with copper plating sandwiched between each and on the outside layers). Multi-layer PCBs provide much higher component density, because circuit traces on the inner layers would otherwise take up surface space between components. The rise in popularity of multilayer PCBs with more than two, and especially with more than four, copper planes was concurrent with the adoption of surface-mount technology. However, multilayer PCBs make repair, analysis, and field modification of circuits much more difficult and usually impractical.\nThe world market for bare PCBs exceeded US$60.2 billion in 2014, and was estimated at $80.33 billion in 2024, forecast to be $96.57 billion for 2029, growing at 4.87% per annum.\nHistory.\nPredecessors.\nBefore the development of printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic circuits were wired point-to-point on a chassis. Typically, the chassis was a sheet metal frame or pan, sometimes with a wooden bottom. Components were attached to the chassis, usually by insulators when the connecting point on the chassis was metal, and then their leads were connected directly or with jumper wires by soldering, or sometimes using crimp connectors, wire connector lugs on screw terminals, or other methods. Circuits were large, bulky, heavy, and relatively fragile (even discounting the breakable glass envelopes of the vacuum tubes that were often included in the circuits), and production was labor-intensive, so the products were expensive.\nDevelopment of the methods used in modern printed circuit boards started early in the 20th century. In 1903, a German inventor, Albert Hanson, described flat foil conductors laminated to an insulating board, in multiple layers. Thomas Edison experimented with chemical methods of plating conductors onto linen paper in 1904. Arthur Berry in 1913 patented a print-and-etch method in the UK, and in the United States Max Schoop obtained a patent to flame-spray metal onto a board through a patterned mask. Charles Ducas in 1925 patented a method of electroplating circuit patterns.\nPredating the printed circuit invention, and similar in spirit, was John Sargrove's 1936\u20131947 Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME) that sprayed metal onto a Bakelite plastic board. The ECME could produce three radio boards per minute.\nEarly PCBs.\nThe Austrian engineer Paul Eisler invented the printed circuit as part of a radio set while working in the UK around 1936. In 1941 a multi-layer printed circuit was used in German magnetic influence naval mines.\nAround 1943 the United States began to use the technology on a large scale to make proximity fuzes for use in World War II. Such fuzes required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Harry W. Rubinstein its Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to the development of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors. This invention also represents a step in the development of integrated circuit technology, as not only wiring but also passive components were fabricated on the ceramic substrate.\nPost-war developments.\nIn 1948, the US released the invention for commercial use. Printed circuits did not become commonplace in consumer electronics until the mid-1950s, after the \"Auto-Sembly\" process was developed by the United States Army. At around the same time in the UK work along similar lines was carried out by Geoffrey Dummer, then at the RRDE.\nMotorola was an early leader in bringing the process into consumer electronics, announcing in August 1952 the adoption of \"plated circuits\" in home radios after six years of research and a $1M investment. Motorola soon began using its trademarked term for the process, PLAcir, in its consumer radio advertisements. Hallicrafters released its first \"foto-etch\" printed circuit product, a clock-radio, on November 1, 1952.\nEven as circuit boards became available, the point-to-point chassis construction method remained in common use in industry (such as TV and hi-fi sets) into at least the late 1960s. Printed circuit boards were introduced to reduce the size, weight, and cost of parts of the circuitry. In 1960, a small consumer radio receiver might be built with all its circuitry on one circuit board, but a TV set would probably contain one or more circuit boards.\nOriginally, every electronic component had wire leads, and a PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The component leads were then inserted through the holes and soldered to the copper PCB traces. This method of assembly is called \"through-hole\" construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the \"Auto-Sembly\" process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are inefficient since drilling holes is expensive and consumes drill bits and the protruding wires are cut off and discarded.\nSince the 1980s, surface mount parts have increasingly replaced through-hole components, enabling smaller boards and lower production costs, but making repairs more challenging.\nIn the 1990s the use of multilayer surface boards became more frequent. As a result, size was further minimized and both flexible and rigid PCBs were incorporated in different devices. In 1995 PCB manufacturers began using microvia technology to produce High-Density Interconnect (HDI) PCBs.\nRecent advances.\nRecent advances in 3D printing have meant that there are several new techniques in PCB creation. 3D printed electronics (PEs) can be utilized to print items layer by layer and subsequently the item can be printed with a liquid ink that contains electronic functionalities.\nHDI (High Density Interconnect) technology allows for a denser design on the PCB and thus potentially smaller PCBs with more traces and components in a given area. As a result, the paths between components can be shorter. HDIs use blind/buried vias, or a combination that includes microvias. With multi-layer HDI PCBs the interconnection of several vias stacked on top of each other (stacked v\u00edas, instead of one deep buried via) can be made stronger, thus enhancing reliability in all conditions. The most common applications for HDI technology are computer and mobile phone components as well as medical equipment and military communication equipment. A 4-layer HDI microvia PCB is equivalent in quality to an 8-layer through-hole PCB, so HDI technology can reduce costs. HDI PCBs are often made using build-up film such as ajinomoto build-up film, which is also used in the production of flip chip packages. Some PCBs have optical waveguides, similar to optical fibers built on the PCB.\nComposition.\nA basic PCB consists of a flat sheet of insulating material and a layer of copper foil, laminated to the substrate. Chemical etching divides the copper into separate conducting lines called tracks or \"circuit traces\", pads for connections, vias to pass connections between layers of copper, and features such as solid conductive areas for electromagnetic shielding or other purposes. The tracks function as wires fixed in place, and are insulated from each other by air and the board substrate material. The surface of a PCB may have a coating that protects the copper from corrosion and reduces the chances of solder shorts between traces or undesired electrical contact with stray bare wires. For its function in helping to prevent solder shorts, the coating is called solder resist or solder mask.\nThe pattern to be etched into each copper layer of a PCB is called the \"artwork\". The etching is usually done using photoresist which is coated onto the PCB, then exposed to light projected in the pattern of the artwork. The resist material protects the copper from dissolution into the etching solution. The etched board is then cleaned. A PCB design can be mass-reproduced in a way similar to the way photographs can be mass-duplicated from film negatives using a photographic printer.\nFR-4 glass epoxy is the most common insulating substrate. Another substrate material is cotton paper impregnated with phenolic resin, often tan or brown.\nA PCB may be printed with a legend identifying the components, test points, or identifying text. Originally, silkscreen printing was used for this purpose, but today other, finer quality printing methods are usually used. Normally the legend does not affect the function of a PCBA.\nLayers.\nA printed circuit board can have multiple layers of copper which almost always are arranged in pairs. The number of layers and the interconnection designed between them (vias, PTHs) provide a general estimate of the board complexity. Using more layers allow for more routing options and better control of signal integrity, but are also time-consuming and costly to manufacture. Likewise, selection of the vias for the board also allow fine tuning of the board size, escaping of signals off complex ICs, routing, and long term reliability, but are tightly coupled with production complexity and cost.\nOne of the simplest boards to produce is the two-layer board. It has copper on both sides that are referred to as external layers; multi layer boards sandwich additional internal layers of copper and insulation. After two-layer PCBs, the next step up is the four-layer. The four layer board adds significantly more routing options in the internal layers as compared to the two layer board, and often some portion of the internal layers is used as ground plane or power plane, to achieve better signal integrity, higher signaling frequencies, lower EMI, and better power supply decoupling.\nIn multi-layer boards, the layers of material are laminated together in an alternating sandwich: copper, substrate, copper, substrate, copper, etc.; each plane of copper is etched, and any internal vias (that will not extend to both outer surfaces of the finished multilayer board) are plated-through, before the layers are laminated together. Only the outer layers need be coated; the inner copper layers are protected by the adjacent substrate layers.\nComponent mounting.\n\"Through hole\" components are mounted by their wire leads passing through the board and soldered to traces on the other side. \"Surface mount\" components are attached by their leads to copper traces on the same side of the board. A board may use both methods for mounting components. PCBs with only through-hole mounted components are now uncommon. Surface mounting is used for transistors, diodes, IC chips, resistors, and capacitors. Through-hole mounting may be used for some large components such as electrolytic capacitors and connectors.\nThe first PCBs used through-hole technology, mounting electronic components by inserting leads through holes on one side of the board and soldering onto copper traces on the other side. Boards may be single-sided, with an unplated component side, or more compact double-sided boards, with components soldered on both sides. Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part's mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and trimming off the ends. Leads may be soldered either manually or by a wave soldering machine.\nSurface-mount technology emerged in the 1960s, gained momentum in the early 1980s, and became widely used by the mid-1990s. Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes. Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates compared with through-hole circuit boards. Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper. However, prices of semiconductor surface mount devices (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages, and some wire-ended components, such as 1N4148 small-signal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.\nElectrical properties.\nEach trace consists of a flat, narrow part of the copper foil that remains after etching. Its resistance, determined by its width, thickness, and length, must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry. Power and ground traces may need to be wider than signal traces. In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a ground plane for shielding and power return. For microwave circuits, transmission lines can be laid out in a planar form such as stripline or microstrip with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent impedance. In radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the inductance and capacitance of the printed circuit board conductors become significant circuit elements, usually undesired; conversely, they can be used as a deliberate part of the circuit design, as in distributed-element filters, antennae, and fuses, obviating the need for additional discrete components. High density interconnects (HDI) PCBs have tracks or vias with a width or diameter of under 152 micrometers.\nMaterials.\nLaminates.\nLaminates are manufactured by curing layers of cloth or paper with thermoset resin under pressure and heat to form an integral final piece of uniform thickness. They can be up to in width and length. Varying cloth weaves (threads per inch or cm), cloth thickness, and resin percentage are used to achieve the desired final thickness and dielectric characteristics. Available standard laminate thickness are listed in\nANSI/IPC-D-275.\nThe cloth or fiber material used, resin material, and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate's type designation (FR-4, CEM-1, G-10, etc.) and therefore the characteristics of the laminate produced. Important characteristics are the level to which the laminate is fire retardant, the dielectric constant (er), the loss tangent (tan \u03b4), the tensile strength, the shear strength, the glass transition temperature (Tg), and the Z-axis expansion coefficient (how much the thickness changes with temperature).\nThere are quite a few different dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.\nFR-4 is by far the most common material used today. The board stock with unetched copper on it is called \"copper-clad laminate\".\nWith decreasing size of board features and increasing frequencies, small non-homogeneities like uneven distribution of fiberglass or other filler, thickness variations, and bubbles in the resin matrix, and the associated local variations in the dielectric constant, are gaining importance.\nKey substrate parameters.\nThe circuit-board substrates are usually dielectric composite materials. The composites contain a matrix (usually an epoxy resin) and a reinforcement (usually a woven, sometimes non-woven, glass fibers, sometimes even paper), and in some cases a filler is added to the resin (e.g. ceramics; titanate ceramics can be used to increase the dielectric constant).\nThe reinforcement type defines two major classes of materials: woven and non-woven. Woven reinforcements are cheaper, but the high dielectric constant of glass may not be favorable for many higher-frequency applications. The spatially non-homogeneous structure also introduces local variations in electrical parameters, due to different resin/glass ratio at different areas of the weave pattern. Non-woven reinforcements, or materials with low or no reinforcement, are more expensive but more suitable for some RF/analog applications.\nThe substrates are characterized by several key parameters, chiefly thermomechanical (glass transition temperature, tensile strength, shear strength, thermal expansion), electrical (dielectric constant, loss tangent, dielectric breakdown voltage, leakage current, tracking resistance...), and others (e.g. moisture absorption).\nAt the glass transition temperature the resin in the composite softens and significantly increases thermal expansion; exceeding Tg then exerts mechanical overload on the board components - e.g. the joints and the vias. Below Tg the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all volume expansion projects to the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes. Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require a matrix with a high Tg.\nThe materials used determine the substrate's dielectric constant. This constant is also dependent on frequency, usually decreasing with frequency. As this constant determines the signal propagation speed, frequency dependence introduces phase distortion in wideband applications; as flat a dielectric constant vs frequency characteristics as is achievable is important here. The impedance of transmission lines decreases with frequency, therefore faster edges of signals reflect more than slower ones.\nDielectric breakdown voltage determines the maximum voltage gradient the material can be subjected to before suffering a breakdown (conduction, or arcing, through the dielectric).\nTracking resistance determines how the material resists high voltage electrical discharges creeping over the board surface.\nLoss tangent determines how much of the electromagnetic energy from the signals in the conductors is absorbed in the board material. This factor is important for high frequencies. Low-loss materials are more expensive. Choosing unnecessarily low-loss material is a common engineering error in high-frequency digital design; it increases the cost of the boards without a corresponding benefit. Signal degradation by loss tangent and dielectric constant can be easily assessed by an eye pattern.\nMoisture absorption occurs when the material is exposed to high humidity or water. Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water also may be soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials are not too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and cyanate esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about 4 for common circuit board materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating, as during soldering, and cause cracking and delamination, the same effect responsible for \"popcorning\" damage on wet packaging of electronic parts. Careful baking of the substrates may be required to dry them prior to soldering.\nCommon substrates.\nOften encountered materials:\nLess-often encountered materials:\nCopper thickness.\nCopper thickness of PCBs can be specified directly or as the weight of copper per area (in ounce per square foot) which is easier to measure. One ounce per square foot is 1.344 mils or 34 micrometers thickness (0.001344 inches). \"Heavy copper\" is a layer exceeding three ounces of copper per ft2, or approximately 4.2\u00a0mils (105\u00a0\u03bcm) (0.0042\u00a0inches) thick. Heavy copper layers are used for high current or to help dissipate heat.\nOn the common FR-4 substrates, 1 oz copper per ft2 (35\u00a0\u03bcm) is the most common thickness; 2 oz (70\u00a0\u03bcm) and 0.5 oz (17.5\u00a0\u03bcm) thickness is often an option. Less common are 12 and 105\u00a0\u03bcm, 9\u00a0\u03bcm is sometimes available on some substrates. Flexible substrates typically have thinner metalization. Metal-core boards for high power devices commonly use thicker copper; 35\u00a0\u03bcm is usual but also 140 and 400\u00a0\u03bcm can be encountered.\nIn the US, copper foil thickness is specified in units of ounces per square foot (oz/ft2), commonly referred to simply as \"ounce\". Common thicknesses are 1/2\u00a0oz/ft2 (150\u00a0g/m2), 1\u00a0oz/ft2 (300\u00a0g/m2), 2\u00a0oz/ft2 (600\u00a0g/m2), and 3\u00a0oz/ft2 (900\u00a0g/m2). These work out to thicknesses of 17.05\u00a0\u03bcm (0.67 thou), 34.1\u00a0\u03bcm (1.34 thou), 68.2\u00a0\u03bcm (2.68 thou), and 102.3\u00a0\u03bcm (4.02 thou), respectively.\n1/2\u00a0oz/ft2 foil is not widely used as a finished copper weight, but is used for outer layers when plating for through holes will increase the finished copper weight Some PCB manufacturers refer to 1\u00a0oz/ft2 copper foil as having a thickness of 35\u00a0\u03bcm (may also be referred to as 35\u00a0\u03bc, 35 micron, or 35 mic).\nManufacturing.\nPrinted circuit board manufacturing involves manufacturing bare printed circuit boards and then populating them with electronic components. In large-scale board manufacturing, multiple PCBs are grouped on a single panel for efficient processing. After assembly, they are separated (depaneled).\nTypes.\nBreakout boards.\nA minimal PCB for a single component, used for prototyping, is called a breakout board. The purpose of a breakout board is to \"break out\" the leads of a component on separate terminals so that manual connections to them can be made easily. Breakout boards are especially used for surface-mount components or any components with fine lead pitch.\nAdvanced PCBs may contain components embedded in the substrate, such as capacitors and integrated circuits, to reduce the amount of space taken up by components on the surface of the PCB while improving electrical characteristics.\nMultiwire boards.\nMultiwire is a patented technique of interconnection which uses machine-routed insulated wires embedded in a non-conducting matrix (often plastic resin). It was used during the 1980s and 1990s. As of 2010,[ [update]] Multiwire is still available through Hitachi.\nSince it was quite easy to stack interconnections (wires) inside the embedding matrix, the approach allowed designers to forget completely about the routing of wires (usually a time-consuming operation of PCB design): Anywhere the designer needs a connection, the machine will draw a wire in a straight line from one location/pin to another. This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced crosstalk (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other\u2014which almost never happens in Multiwire), though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.\nCorrections can be made to a Multiwire board layout more easily than to a PCB layout.\nCordwood construction.\nBefore the advent of integrated circuits, \"cordwood construction\" allowed the highest possible component packing density. The construction method was used with wire-ended components in applications where space was at a premium (such as fuzes, missile guidance, and telemetry systems) and in the high-speed computers of the day, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The name comes from the way axial-lead components (capacitors, resistors, coils, and diodes) are stacked in parallel rows and columns, like a stack of firewood. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads.\nSome versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components at the cost of being difficult to remove the boards or replace any component that is not at the edge.\nCordwood construction was replaced with multi-layer board, SMD and ICs.\nUses.\nPrinted circuit boards have been used as an alternative to their typical use for electronic and biomedical engineering thanks to the versatility of their layers, especially the copper layer. PCB layers have been used to fabricate sensors, such as capacitive pressure sensors and accelerometers, actuators such as microvalves and microheaters, as well as platforms of sensors and actuators for Lab-on-a-chip (LoC), for example to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fuel cells, to name a few.\nRepair.\nManufacturers may not support component-level repair of printed circuit boards because of the relatively low cost to replace compared with the time and cost of troubleshooting to a component level. In board-level repair, the technician identifies the board (PCA) on which the fault resides and replaces it. This shift is economically efficient from a manufacturer's point of view but is also materially wasteful, as a circuit board with hundreds of functional components may be discarded and replaced due to the failure of one minor and inexpensive part, such as a resistor or capacitor, and this practice is a significant contributor to the problem of e-waste.\nLegislation.\nIn many countries (including all European Single Market participants, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and China), legislation restricts the use of lead, cadmium, and mercury in electrical equipment. PCBs sold in such countries must therefore use lead-free manufacturing processes and lead-free solder, and attached components must themselves be compliant.\nSafety Standard UL 796 covers component safety requirements for printed wiring boards for use as components in devices or appliances. Testing analyzes characteristics such as flammability, maximum operating temperature, electrical tracking, heat deflection, and direct support of live electrical parts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

More specifically, the equations of motion describe the behavior of a physical system as a set of mathematical functions in terms of dynamic variables. These variables are usually spatial coordinates and time, but may include momentum components. The most general choice are generalized coordinates which can be any convenient variables characteristic of the physical system. The functions are defined in a Euclidean space in classical mechanics, but are replaced by curved spaces in relativity. If the dynamics of a system is known, the equations are the solutions for the differential equations describing the motion of the dynamics.\nTypes.\nThere are two main descriptions of motion: dynamics and kinematics. Dynamics is general, since the momenta, forces and energy of the particles are taken into account. In this instance, sometimes the term \"dynamics\" refers to the differential equations that the system satisfies (e.g., Newton's second law or Euler\u2013Lagrange equations), and sometimes to the solutions to those equations.\nHowever, kinematics is simpler. It concerns only variables derived from the positions of objects and time. In circumstances of constant acceleration, these simpler equations of motion are usually referred to as the SUVAT equations, arising from the definitions of kinematic quantities: displacement (\"s\"), initial velocity (\"u\"), final velocity (\"v\"), acceleration (\"a\"), and time (\"t\").\nA differential equation of motion, usually identified as some physical law (for example, F = ma), and applying definitions of physical quantities, is used to set up an equation to solve a kinematics problem. Solving the differential equation will lead to a general solution with arbitrary constants, the arbitrariness corresponding to a set of solutions. A particular solution can be obtained by setting the initial values, which fixes the values of the constants.\nStated formally, in general, an equation of motion \"M\" is a function of the position r of the object, its velocity (the first time derivative of r, v \n ), and its acceleration (the second derivative of r, a \n ), and time \"t\". Euclidean vectors in 3D are denoted throughout in bold. This is equivalent to saying an equation of motion in r is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in r,\nformula_1\nwhere \"t\" is time, and each overdot denotes one time derivative. The initial conditions are given by the \"constant\" values at \"t\" \n 0,\nformula_2\nThe solution r(\"t\") to the equation of motion, with specified initial values, describes the system for all times \"t\" after \"t\" \n 0. Other dynamical variables like the momentum p of the object, or quantities derived from r and p like angular momentum, can be used in place of r as the quantity to solve for from some equation of motion, although the position of the object at time \"t\" is by far the most sought-after quantity.\nSometimes, the equation will be linear and is more likely to be exactly solvable. In general, the equation will be non-linear, and cannot be solved exactly so a variety of approximations must be used. The solutions to nonlinear equations may show chaotic behavior depending on how \"sensitive\" the system is to the initial conditions.\nHistory.\nKinematics, dynamics and the mathematical models of the universe developed incrementally over three millennia, thanks to many thinkers, only some of whose names we know. In antiquity, priests, astrologers and astronomers predicted solar and lunar eclipses, the solstices and the equinoxes of the Sun and the period of the Moon. But they had nothing other than a set of algorithms to guide them. Equations of motion were not written down for another thousand years.\nMedieval scholars in the thirteenth century \u2014 for example at the relatively new universities in Oxford and Paris \u2014 drew on ancient mathematicians (Euclid and Archimedes) and philosophers (Aristotle) to develop a new body of knowledge, now called physics.\nAt Oxford, Merton College sheltered a group of scholars devoted to natural science, mainly physics, astronomy and mathematics, who were of similar stature to the intellectuals at the University of Paris. Thomas Bradwardine extended Aristotelian quantities such as distance and velocity, and assigned intensity and extension to them. Bradwardine suggested an exponential law involving force, resistance, distance, velocity and time. Nicholas Oresme further extended Bradwardine's arguments. The Merton school proved that the quantity of motion of a body undergoing a uniformly accelerated motion is equal to the quantity of a uniform motion at the speed achieved halfway through the accelerated motion.\nFor writers on kinematics before Galileo, since small time intervals could not be measured, the affinity between time and motion was obscure. They used time as a function of distance, and in free fall, greater velocity as a result of greater elevation. Only Domingo de Soto, a Spanish theologian, in his commentary on Aristotle's \"Physics\" published in 1545, after defining \"uniform difform\" motion (which is uniformly accelerated motion) \u2013 the word velocity was not used \u2013 as proportional to time, declared correctly that this kind of motion was identifiable with freely falling bodies and projectiles, without his proving these propositions or suggesting a formula relating time, velocity and distance. De Soto's comments are remarkably correct regarding the definitions of acceleration (acceleration was a rate of change of motion (velocity) in time) and the observation that acceleration would be negative during ascent.\nDiscourses such as these spread throughout Europe, shaping the work of Galileo Galilei and others, and helped in laying the foundation of kinematics. Galileo deduced the equation \"s\" \n \"gt\"2 in his work geometrically, using the Merton rule, now known as a special case of one of the equations of kinematics.\nGalileo was the first to show that the path of a projectile is a parabola. Galileo had an understanding of centrifugal force and gave a correct definition of momentum. This emphasis of momentum as a fundamental quantity in dynamics is of prime importance. He measured momentum by the product of velocity and weight; mass is a later concept, developed by Huygens and Newton. In the swinging of a simple pendulum, Galileo says in \"Discourses\" that \"every momentum acquired in the descent along an arc is equal to that which causes the same moving body to ascend through the same arc.\" His analysis on projectiles indicates that Galileo had grasped the first law and the second law of motion. He did not generalize and make them applicable to bodies not subject to the earth's gravitation. That step was Newton's contribution.\nThe term \"inertia\" was used by Kepler who applied it to bodies at rest. (The first law of motion is now often called the law of inertia.)\nGalileo did not fully grasp the third law of motion, the law of the equality of action and reaction, though he corrected some errors of Aristotle. With Stevin and others Galileo also wrote on statics. He formulated the principle of the parallelogram of forces, but he did not fully recognize its scope.\nGalileo also was interested by the laws of the pendulum, his first observations of which were as a young man. In 1583, while he was praying in the cathedral at Pisa, his attention was arrested by the motion of the great lamp lighted and left swinging, referencing his own pulse for time keeping. To him the period appeared the same, even after the motion had greatly diminished, discovering the isochronism of the pendulum.\nMore careful experiments carried out by him later, and described in his Discourses, revealed the period of oscillation varies with the square root of length but is independent of the mass the pendulum.\nThus we arrive at Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, et al.; and the evolved forms of the equations of motion that begin to be recognized as the modern ones.\nLater the equations of motion also appeared in electrodynamics, when describing the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force is the general equation which serves as the definition of what is meant by an electric field and magnetic field. With the advent of special relativity and general relativity, the theoretical modifications to spacetime meant the classical equations of motion were also modified to account for the finite speed of light, and curvature of spacetime. In all these cases the differential equations were in terms of a function describing the particle's trajectory in terms of space and time coordinates, as influenced by forces or energy transformations.\nHowever, the equations of quantum mechanics can also be considered \"equations of motion\", since they are differential equations of the wavefunction, which describes how a quantum state behaves analogously using the space and time coordinates of the particles. There are analogs of equations of motion in other areas of physics, for collections of physical phenomena that can be considered waves, fluids, or fields.\nKinematic equations for one particle.\nKinematic quantities.\nFrom the instantaneous position r \n r(\"t\"), instantaneous meaning at an instant value of time \"t\", the instantaneous velocity v \n v(\"t\") and acceleration a \n a(\"t\") have the general, coordinate-independent definitions;\nformula_3\nNotice that velocity always points in the direction of motion, in other words for a curved path it is the tangent vector. Loosely speaking, first order derivatives are related to tangents of curves. Still for curved paths, the acceleration is directed towards the center of curvature of the path. Again, loosely speaking, second order derivatives are related to curvature.\nThe rotational analogues are the \"angular vector\" (angle the particle rotates about some axis) \u03b8 \n \u03b8(\"t\"), angular velocity \u03c9 \n \u03c9(\"t\"), and angular acceleration \u03b1 \n \u03b1(\"t\"):\nformula_4\nwhere n\u0302 is a unit vector in the direction of the axis of rotation, and \"\u03b8\" is the angle the object turns through about the axis.\nThe following relation holds for a point-like particle, orbiting about some axis with angular velocity \u03c9:\nformula_5\nwhere r is the position vector of the particle (radial from the rotation axis) and v the tangential velocity of the particle. For a rotating continuum rigid body, these relations hold for each point in the rigid body.\nUniform acceleration.\nThe differential equation of motion for a particle of constant or uniform acceleration in a straight line is simple: the acceleration is constant, so the second derivative of the position of the object is constant. The results of this case are summarized below.\nConstant translational acceleration in a straight line.\nThese equations apply to a particle moving linearly, in three dimensions in a straight line with constant acceleration. Since the position, velocity, and acceleration are collinear (parallel, and lie on the same line) \u2013 only the magnitudes of these vectors are necessary, and because the motion is along a straight line, the problem effectively reduces from three dimensions to one.\nformula_6\nwhere:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Derivation\nEquations [1] and [2] are from integrating the definitions of velocity and acceleration, subject to the initial conditions r(\"t\"0) \n r0 and v(\"t\"0) \n v0;\nformula_7\nin magnitudes,\nformula_8\nwhich breaks into the radial acceleration , centripetal acceleration \u2013\"r\u03c9\"2, Coriolis acceleration 2\"\u03c9\", and angular acceleration \"r\u03b1\".\nSpecial cases of motion described by these equations are summarized qualitatively in the table below. Two have already been discussed above, in the cases that either the radial components or the angular components are zero, and the non-zero component of motion describes uniform acceleration.\nGeneral 3D motions.\nIn 3D space, the equations in spherical coordinates (\"r\", \"\u03b8\", \"\u03c6\") with corresponding unit vectors \u00ea\"r\", \u00ea\"\u03b8\" and \u00ea\"\u03c6\", the position, velocity, and acceleration generalize respectively to\nformula_9\nIn the case of a constant \"\u03c6\" this reduces to the planar equations above.\nDynamic equations of motion.\nNewtonian mechanics.\nThe first general equation of motion developed was Newton's second law of motion. In its most general form it states the rate of change of momentum p = p(\"t\") = \"m\"v(\"t\") of an object equals the force F = F(x(\"t\"), v(\"t\"), \"t\") acting on it,1112\nformula_10\nThe force in the equation is \"not\" the force the object exerts. Replacing momentum by mass times velocity, the law is also written more famously as\nformula_11\nsince \"m\" is a constant in Newtonian mechanics.\nNewton's second law applies to point-like particles, and to all points in a rigid body. They also apply to each point in a mass continuum, like deformable solids or fluids, but the motion of the system must be accounted for; see material derivative. In the case the mass is not constant, it is not sufficient to use the product rule for the time derivative on the mass and velocity, and Newton's second law requires some modification consistent with conservation of momentum; see variable-mass system.\nIt may be simple to write down the equations of motion in vector form using Newton's laws of motion, but the components may vary in complicated ways with spatial coordinates and time, and solving them is not easy. Often there is an excess of variables to solve for the problem completely, so Newton's laws are not always the most efficient way to determine the motion of a system. In simple cases of rectangular geometry, Newton's laws work fine in Cartesian coordinates, but in other coordinate systems can become dramatically complex.\nThe momentum form is preferable since this is readily generalized to more complex systems, such as special and general relativity (see four-momentum).112 It can also be used with the momentum conservation. However, Newton's laws are not more fundamental than momentum conservation, because Newton's laws are merely consistent with the fact that zero resultant force acting on an object implies constant momentum, while a resultant force implies the momentum is not constant. Momentum conservation is always true for an isolated system not subject to resultant forces.\nFor a number of particles (see many body problem), the equation of motion for one particle \"i\" influenced by other particles is\nformula_12\nwhere p\"i\" is the momentum of particle \"i\", F\"ij\" is the force on particle \"i\" by particle \"j\", and F\"E\" is the resultant external force due to any agent not part of system. Particle \"i\" does not exert a force on itself.\nEuler's laws of motion are similar to Newton's laws, but they are applied specifically to the motion of rigid bodies. The Newton\u2013Euler equations combine the forces and torques acting on a rigid body into a single equation.\nNewton's second law for rotation takes a similar form to the translational case,\nformula_13\nby equating the torque acting on the body to the rate of change of its angular momentum L. Analogous to mass times acceleration, the moment of inertia tensor I depends on the distribution of mass about the axis of rotation, and the angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity,\nformula_14\nAgain, these equations apply to point like particles, or at each point of a rigid body.\nLikewise, for a number of particles, the equation of motion for one particle \"i\" is\nformula_15\nwhere L\"i\" is the angular momentum of particle \"i\", \u03c4\"ij\" the torque on particle \"i\" by particle \"j\", and \u03c4\"E\" is resultant external torque (due to any agent not part of system). Particle \"i\" does not exert a torque on itself.\nApplications.\nSome examples of Newton's law include describing the motion of a simple pendulum,\nformula_16\nand a damped, sinusoidally driven harmonic oscillator,\nformula_17\nFor describing the motion of masses due to gravity, Newton's law of gravity can be combined with Newton's second law. For two examples, a ball of mass m thrown in the air, in air currents (such as wind) described by a vector field of resistive forces R \n R(r, \"t\"),\nformula_18\nwhere \"G\" is the gravitational constant, \"M\" the mass of the Earth, and A \n is the acceleration of the projectile due to the air currents at position r and time t.\nThe classical N-body problem for N particles each interacting with each other due to gravity is a set of N nonlinear coupled second order ODEs,\nformula_19\nwhere \"i\" \n 1, 2, ..., \"N\" labels the quantities (mass, position, etc.) associated with each particle.\nAnalytical mechanics.\nUsing all three coordinates of 3D space is unnecessary if there are constraints on the system. If the system has \"N\" degrees of freedom, then one can use a set of \"N\" generalized coordinates q(\"t\") \n [\"q\"1(\"t\"), \"q\"2(\"t\") ... \"qN\"(\"t\")], to define the configuration of the system. They can be in the form of arc lengths or angles. They are a considerable simplification to describe motion, since they take advantage of the intrinsic constraints that limit the system's motion, and the number of coordinates is reduced to a minimum. The time derivatives of the generalized coordinates are the \"generalized velocities\"\nformula_20\nThe Euler\u2013Lagrange equations are\nformula_21\nwhere the \"Lagrangian\" is a function of the configuration q and its time rate of change (and possibly time \"t\")\nformula_22\nSetting up the Lagrangian of the system, then substituting into the equations and evaluating the partial derivatives and simplifying, a set of coupled \"N\" second order ODEs in the coordinates are obtained.\nHamilton's equations are\nformula_23\nwhere the Hamiltonian\nformula_24\nis a function of the configuration q and conjugate \"\"generalized\" momenta\"\nformula_25\nin which \n (, , \u2026, ) is a shorthand notation for a vector of partial derivatives with respect to the indicated variables (see for example matrix calculus for this denominator notation), and possibly time \"t\",\nSetting up the Hamiltonian of the system, then substituting into the equations and evaluating the partial derivatives and simplifying, a set of coupled 2\"N\" first order ODEs in the coordinates \"qi\" and momenta \"pi\" are obtained.\nThe Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation is\nformula_26\nwhere\nformula_27\nis \"Hamilton's principal function\", also called the \"classical action\" is a functional of \"L\". In this case, the momenta are given by\nformula_28\nAlthough the equation has a simple general form, for a given Hamiltonian it is actually a single first order \"non-linear\" PDE, in \"N\" + 1 variables. The action \"S\" allows identification of conserved quantities for mechanical systems, even when the mechanical problem itself cannot be solved fully, because any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law, a theorem due to Emmy Noether.\nAll classical equations of motion can be derived from the variational principle known as Hamilton's principle of least action\nformula_29\nstating the path the system takes through the configuration space is the one with the least action \"S\".\nElectrodynamics.\nIn electrodynamics, the force on a charged particle of charge \"q\" is the Lorentz force:\nformula_30\nCombining with Newton's second law gives a first order differential equation of motion, in terms of position of the particle:\nformula_31\nor its momentum:\nformula_32\nThe same equation can be obtained using the Lagrangian (and applying Lagrange's equations above) for a charged particle of mass \"m\" and charge \"q\":\nformula_33\nwhere A and \"\u03d5\" are the electromagnetic scalar and vector potential fields. The Lagrangian indicates an additional detail: the canonical momentum in Lagrangian mechanics is given by:\nformula_34\ninstead of just \"m\"v, implying the motion of a charged particle is fundamentally determined by the mass and charge of the particle. The Lagrangian expression was first used to derive the force equation.\nAlternatively the Hamiltonian (and substituting into the equations):\nformula_35\ncan derive the Lorentz force equation.\nGeneral relativity.\nGeodesic equation of motion.\nThe above equations are valid in flat spacetime. In curved spacetime, things become mathematically more complicated since there is no straight line; this is generalized and replaced by a \"geodesic\" of the curved spacetime (the shortest length of curve between two points). For curved manifolds with a metric tensor \"g\", the metric provides the notion of arc length (see line element for details). The differential arc length is given by:https://\nformula_36\nand the geodesic equation is a second-order differential equation in the coordinates. The general solution is a family of geodesics:https://\nformula_37\nwhere \"\u0393\u2009\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\" is a Christoffel symbol of the second kind, which contains the metric (with respect to the coordinate system).\nGiven the mass-energy distribution provided by the stress\u2013energy tensor \"T\u2009\u03b1\u03b2\", the Einstein field equations are a set of non-linear second-order partial differential equations in the metric, and imply the curvature of spacetime is equivalent to a gravitational field (see equivalence principle). Mass falling in curved spacetime is equivalent to a mass falling in a gravitational field - because gravity is a fictitious force. The \"relative acceleration\" of one geodesic to another in curved spacetime is given by the \"geodesic deviation equation\":\nformula_38\nwhere \u03be\"\u03b1\" \n \"x\"2\"\u03b1\" \u2212 \"x\"1\"\u03b1\" is the separation vector between two geodesics, (\"not\" just ) is the covariant derivative, and \"R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\" is the Riemann curvature tensor, containing the Christoffel symbols. In other words, the geodesic deviation equation is the equation of motion for masses in curved spacetime, analogous to the Lorentz force equation for charges in an electromagnetic field.\nFor flat spacetime, the metric is a constant tensor so the Christoffel symbols vanish, and the geodesic equation has the solutions of straight lines. This is also the limiting case when masses move according to Newton's law of gravity.\nSpinning objects.\nIn general relativity, rotational motion is described by the relativistic angular momentum tensor, including the spin tensor, which enter the equations of motion under covariant derivatives with respect to proper time. The Mathisson\u2013Papapetrou\u2013Dixon equations describe the motion of spinning objects moving in a gravitational field.\nAnalogues for waves and fields.\nUnlike the equations of motion for describing particle mechanics, which are systems of coupled ordinary differential equations, the analogous equations governing the dynamics of waves and fields are always partial differential equations, since the waves or fields are functions of space and time. For a particular solution, boundary conditions along with initial conditions need to be specified.\nSometimes in the following contexts, the wave or field equations are also called \"equations of motion\".\nField equations.\nEquations that describe the spatial dependence and time evolution of fields are called \"field equations\". These include\nThis terminology is not universal: for example although the Navier\u2013Stokes equations govern the velocity field of a fluid, they are not usually called \"field equations\", since in this context they represent the momentum of the fluid and are called the \"momentum equations\" instead.\nWave equations.\nEquations of wave motion are called \"wave equations\". The solutions to a wave equation give the time-evolution and spatial dependence of the amplitude. Boundary conditions determine if the solutions describe traveling waves or standing waves.\nFrom classical equations of motion and field equations; mechanical, gravitational wave, and electromagnetic wave equations can be derived. The general linear wave equation in 3D is:\nformula_39\nwhere \"X\" \n \"X\"(r, \"t\") is any mechanical or electromagnetic field amplitude, say:\nand \"v\" is the phase velocity. Nonlinear equations model the dependence of phase velocity on amplitude, replacing \"v\" by \"v\"(\"X\"). There are other linear and nonlinear wave equations for very specific applications, see for example the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation.\nQuantum theory.\nIn quantum theory, the wave and field concepts both appear.\nIn quantum mechanics the analogue of the classical equations of motion (Newton's law, Euler\u2013Lagrange equation, Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation, etc.) is the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in its most general form:\nformula_40\nwhere \"\u03a8\" is the wavefunction of the system, \"\u0124\" is the quantum Hamiltonian operator, rather than a function as in classical mechanics, and \"\u0127\" is the Planck constant divided by 2\u03c0. Setting up the Hamiltonian and inserting it into the equation results in a wave equation, the solution is the wavefunction as a function of space and time. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation itself reduces to the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation when one considers the correspondence principle, in the limit that \"\u0127\" becomes zero. To compare to measurements, operators for observables must be applied the quantum wavefunction according to the experiment performed, leading to either wave-like or particle-like results.\nThroughout all aspects of quantum theory, relativistic or non-relativistic, there are various formulations alternative to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation that govern the time evolution and behavior of a quantum system, for instance: \nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Constrained motion such as linked machine parts are also described as kinematics.\nKinematics is concerned with systems of specification of objects' positions and velocities and mathematical transformations between such systems. These systems may be rectangular like Cartesian, Curvilinear coordinates like polar coordinates or other systems. The object trajectories may be specified with respect to other objects which may themselves be in motion relative to a standard reference. Rotating systems may also be used.\nNumerous practical problems in kinematics involve constraints, such as mechanical linkages, ropes, or rolling disks.\nOverview.\nKinematics is a subfield of physics and mathematics, developed in classical mechanics, that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move. \nKinematics differs from \"dynamics\" (also known as \"kinetics\") which studies the effect of forces on bodies.\nKinematics, as a field of study, is often referred to as the \"geometry of motion\" and is occasionally seen as a branch of both applied and pure mathematics since it can be studied without considering the mass of a body or the forces acting upon it. A kinematics problem begins by describing the geometry of the system and declaring the initial conditions of any known values of position, velocity and/or acceleration of points within the system. Then, using arguments from geometry, the position, velocity and acceleration of any unknown parts of the system can be determined. In his work \"Space and its Nature\", the scholar Ibn al-Haytham is credited with being the first to treat geometry and kinematics as a unified concept. To quantify the properties of space, he compared the dimensions of a body when it was in motion versus when it was at rest.\nAnother way to describe kinematics is as the specification of the possible states of a physical system. Dynamics then describes the evolution of a system through such states. Robert Spekkens argues that this division cannot be empirically tested and thus has no physical basis.\nKinematics is used in astrophysics to describe the motion of celestial bodies and collections of such bodies. In mechanical engineering, robotics, and biomechanics, kinematics is used to describe the motion of systems composed of joined parts (multi-link systems) such as an engine, a robotic arm or the human skeleton.\nGeometric transformations, including so-called rigid transformations, are used to describe the movement of components in a mechanical system, simplifying the derivation of the equations of motion. They are also central to dynamic analysis.\nKinematic analysis is the process of measuring the kinematic quantities used to describe motion. In engineering, for instance, kinematic analysis may be used to find the range of movement for a given mechanism and, working in reverse, using kinematic synthesis to design a mechanism for a desired range of motion. In addition, kinematics applies algebraic geometry to the study of the mechanical advantage of a mechanical system or mechanism.\nRelativistic kinematics applies the special theory of relativity to the geometry of object motion. It encompasses time dilation, length contraction and the Lorentz transformation.12.8 The kinematics of relativity operates in a spacetime geometry where spatial points are augmented with a time coordinate to form 4-vectors.\nWerner Heisenberg reinterpreted classical kinetics for quantum systems in his 1925 paper \"On the quantum-theoretical reinterpretation of kinematical and mechanical relationships\". Dirac noted the similarity in structure between Heisenberg's formulations and classical Poisson brackets. In a follow up paper in 1927 Heisenberg showed that classical kinematic notions like velocity and energy are valid in quantum mechanics, but pairs of conjugate kinematic and dynamic quantities cannot be simultaneously measure, a result he called indeterminacy, but which became known as the uncertainty principle.\nEtymology.\nThe term kinematic is the English version of A.M. Amp\u00e8re's \"cin\u00e9matique\", which he constructed from the Greek \"kinema\" (\"movement, motion\"), itself derived from \"kinein\" (\"to move\").\nKinematic and cin\u00e9matique are related to the French word cin\u00e9ma, but neither are directly derived from it. However, they do share a root word in common, as cin\u00e9ma came from the shortened form of cin\u00e9matographe, \"motion picture projector and camera\", once again from the Greek word for movement and from the Greek \"grapho\" (\"to write\").\nKinematics of a particle trajectory in a non-rotating frame of reference.\nParticle kinematics is the study of the trajectory of particles. The position of a particle is defined as the coordinate vector from the origin of a coordinate frame to the particle. For example, consider a tower 50\u00a0m south from your home, where the coordinate frame is centered at your home, such that east is in the direction of the \"x\"-axis and north is in the direction of the \"y\"-axis, then the coordinate vector to the base of the tower is r = (0\u00a0m, \u221250\u00a0m, 0\u00a0m). If the tower is 50\u00a0m high, and this height is measured along the \"z\"-axis, then the coordinate vector to the top of the tower is r = (0\u00a0m, \u201350\u00a0m, 50\u00a0m).\nIn the most general case, a three-dimensional coordinate system is used to define the position of a particle. However, if the particle is constrained to move within a plane, a two-dimensional coordinate system is sufficient. All observations in physics are incomplete without being described with respect to a reference frame.\nThe position vector of a particle is a vector drawn from the origin of the reference frame to the particle. It expresses both the distance of the point from the origin and its direction from the origin. In three dimensions, the position vector formula_1 can be expressed as\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5 are the Cartesian coordinates and formula_6, formula_7 and formula_8 are the unit vectors along the formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5 coordinate axes, respectively. The magnitude of the position vector formula_12 gives the distance between the point formula_13 and the origin.\nformula_14\nThe direction cosines of the position vector provide a quantitative measure of direction. In general, an object's position vector will depend on the frame of reference; different frames will lead to different values for the position vector.\nThe \"trajectory\" of a particle is a vector function of time, formula_15, which defines the curve traced by the moving particle, given by\nformula_16\nwhere formula_17, formula_18, and formula_19 describe each coordinate of the particle's position as a function of time.\nVelocity and speed.\nThe velocity of a particle is a vector quantity that describes the \"direction\" as well as the magnitude of motion of the particle. More mathematically, the rate of change of the position vector of a point with respect to time is the velocity of the point. Consider the ratio formed by dividing the difference of two positions of a particle (displacement) by the time interval. This ratio is called the average velocity over that time interval and is defined asformula_20where formula_21 is the displacement vector during the time interval formula_22. In the limit that the time interval formula_22 approaches zero, the average velocity approaches the instantaneous velocity, defined as the time derivative of the position vector,\nformula_24\nThus, a particle's velocity is the time rate of change of its position. Furthermore, this velocity is tangent to the particle's trajectory at every position along its path. In a non-rotating frame of reference, the derivatives of the coordinate directions are not considered as their directions and magnitudes are constants.\nThe speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity. It is a scalar quantity:\nformula_25\nwhere formula_26 is the arc-length measured along the trajectory of the particle. This arc-length must always increase as the particle moves. Hence, formula_27 is non-negative, which implies that speed is also non-negative.\nAcceleration.\nThe velocity vector can change in magnitude and in direction or both at once. Hence, the acceleration accounts for both the rate of change of the magnitude of the velocity vector and the rate of change of direction of that vector. The same reasoning used with respect to the position of a particle to define velocity, can be applied to the velocity to define acceleration. The acceleration of a particle is the vector defined by the rate of change of the velocity vector. The average acceleration of a particle over a time interval is defined as the ratio.\nformula_28\nwhere \u0394v is the average velocity and \u0394\"t\" is the time interval.\nThe acceleration of the particle is the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval approaches zero, which is the time derivative,\nformula_29\nAlternatively,\nformula_30\nThus, acceleration is the first derivative of the velocity vector and the second derivative of the position vector of that particle. In a non-rotating frame of reference, the derivatives of the coordinate directions are not considered as their directions and magnitudes are constants.\nThe magnitude of the acceleration of an object is the magnitude |a| of its acceleration vector. It is a scalar quantity:\nformula_31\nRelative position vector.\nA relative position vector is a vector that defines the position of one point relative to another. It is the difference in position of the two points.\nThe position of one point \"A\" relative to another point \"B\" is simply the difference between their positions\nformula_32\nwhich is the difference between the components of their position vectors.\nIf point \"A\" has position components formula_33\nand point \"B\" has position components formula_34\nthen the position of point \"A\" relative to point \"B\" is the difference between their components: formula_35\nRelative velocity.\nThe velocity of one point relative to another is simply the difference between their velocities\nformula_36\nwhich is the difference between the components of their velocities.\nIf point \"A\" has velocity components formula_37 and point \"B\" has velocity components formula_38 then the velocity of point \"A\" relative to point \"B\" is the difference between their components:\nformula_39\nAlternatively, this same result could be obtained by computing the time derivative of the relative position vector rB/A.\nRelative acceleration.\nThe acceleration of one point \"C\" relative to another point \"B\" is simply the difference between their accelerations.\nformula_40\nwhich is the difference between the components of their accelerations.\nIf point \"C\" has acceleration components formula_41\nand point \"B\" has acceleration components formula_42\nthen the acceleration of point \"C\" relative to point \"B\" is the difference between their components: formula_43\nAssuming that the initial conditions of the position, formula_44, and velocity formula_45 at time formula_46 are known, the first integration yields the velocity of the particle as a function of time.\nformula_47\nAdditional relations between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time can be derived. If the acceleration is constant,\nformula_48 can be substituted into the above equation to give:\nformula_49\nA relationship between velocity, position and acceleration without explicit time dependence can be obtained by solving the average acceleration for time and substituting and simplifying\nformula_50\nformula_51\nwhere formula_52 denotes the dot product, which is appropriate as the products are scalars rather than vectors.\nformula_53\nThe dot product can be replaced by the cosine of the angle \u03b1 between the vectors (see Geometric interpretation of the dot product for more details) and the vectors by their magnitudes, in which case:\nformula_54\nIn the case of acceleration always in the direction of the motion and the direction of motion should be in positive or negative, the angle between the vectors (\u03b1) is 0, so formula_55, and\nformula_56\nThis can be simplified using the notation for the magnitudes of the vectors formula_57 where formula_58 can be any curvaceous path taken as the constant tangential acceleration is applied along that path, so\nformula_59\nThis reduces the parametric equations of motion of the particle to a Cartesian relationship of speed versus position. This relation is useful when time is unknown. We also know that formula_60 or formula_58 is the area under a velocity\u2013time graph. We can take formula_58 by adding the top area and the bottom area. The bottom area is a rectangle, and the area of a rectangle is the formula_63 where formula_64 is the width and formula_65 is the height. In this case formula_66 and formula_67 (the formula_64 here is different from the acceleration formula_69). This means that the bottom area is formula_70. Now let's find the top area (a triangle). The area of a triangle is formula_71 where formula_65 is the base and formula_73 is the height. In this case, formula_74 and formula_75 or formula_76. Adding formula_77 and formula_78 results in the equation formula_58 results in the equation formula_80. This equation is applicable when the final velocity v is unknown.\nParticle trajectories in cylindrical-polar coordinates.\nIt is often convenient to formulate the trajectory of a particle r(\"t\") = (\"x\"(\"t\"), \"y\"(\"t\"), \"z\"(\"t\")) using polar coordinates in the \"X\"\u2013\"Y\" plane. In this case, its velocity and acceleration take a convenient form.\nRecall that the trajectory of a particle \"P\" is defined by its coordinate vector r measured in a fixed reference frame \"F\". As the particle moves, its coordinate vector r(\"t\") traces its trajectory, which is a curve in space, given by:\nformula_16\nwhere x\u0302, \u0177, and \u1e91 are the unit vectors along the \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\" axes of the reference frame \"F\", respectively.\nConsider a particle \"P\" that moves only on the surface of a circular cylinder \"r\"(\"t\") = constant, it is possible to align the \"z\" axis of the fixed frame \"F\" with the axis of the cylinder. Then, the angle \"\u03b8\" around this axis in the \"x\"\u2013\"y\" plane can be used to define the trajectory as,\nformula_82\nwhere the constant distance from the center is denoted as \"r\", and \"\u03b8\"(\"t\") is a function of time.\nThe cylindrical coordinates for r(\"t\") can be simplified by introducing the radial and tangential unit vectors,\nformula_83\nand their time derivatives from elementary calculus:\nformula_84\nformula_85\nformula_86\nformula_87\nUsing this notation, r(\"t\") takes the form,\nformula_88\nIn general, the trajectory r(\"t\") is not constrained to lie on a circular cylinder, so the radius \"R\" varies with time and the trajectory of the particle in cylindrical-polar coordinates becomes:\nformula_89\nWhere \"r\", \"\u03b8\", and \"z\" might be continuously differentiable functions of time and the function notation is dropped for simplicity. The velocity vector v\"P\" is the time derivative of the trajectory r(\"t\"), which yields:\nformula_90\nSimilarly, the acceleration a\"P\", which is the time derivative of the velocity v\"P\", is given by:\nformula_91\nThe term formula_92 acts toward the center of curvature of the path at that point on the path, is commonly called the centripetal acceleration. The term formula_93 is called the Coriolis acceleration.\nConstant radius.\nIf the trajectory of the particle is constrained to lie on a cylinder, then the radius \"r\" is constant and the velocity and acceleration vectors simplify. The velocity of vP is the time derivative of the trajectory r(\"t\"),\nformula_94\nPlanar circular trajectories.\nA special case of a particle trajectory on a circular cylinder occurs when there is no movement along the \"z\" axis:\nformula_95\nwhere \"r\" and \"z\"0 are constants. In this case, the velocity v\"P\" is given by:\nformula_96\nwhere formula_97 is the angular velocity of the unit vector \u03b8^ around the \"z\" axis of the cylinder.\nThe acceleration a\"P\" of the particle \"P\" is now given by:\nformula_98\nThe components\nformula_99\nare called, respectively, the \"radial\" and \"tangential components\" of acceleration.\nThe notation for angular velocity and angular acceleration is often defined as\nformula_100\nso the radial and tangential acceleration components for circular trajectories are also written as\nformula_101\nPoint trajectories in a body moving in the plane.\nThe movement of components of a mechanical system are analyzed by attaching a reference frame to each part and determining how the various reference frames move relative to each other. If the structural stiffness of the parts are sufficient, then their deformation can be neglected and rigid transformations can be used to define this relative movement. This reduces the description of the motion of the various parts of a complicated mechanical system to a problem of describing the geometry of each part and geometric association of each part relative to other parts.\nGeometry is the study of the properties of figures that remain the same while the space is transformed in various ways\u2014more technically, it is the study of invariants under a set of transformations. These transformations can cause the displacement of the triangle in the plane, while leaving the vertex angle and the distances between vertices unchanged. Kinematics is often described as applied geometry, where the movement of a mechanical system is described using the rigid transformations of Euclidean geometry.\nThe coordinates of points in a plane are two-dimensional vectors in R2 (two dimensional space). Rigid transformations are those that preserve the distance between any two points. The set of rigid transformations in an \"n\"-dimensional space is called the special Euclidean group on R\"n\", and denoted SE(\"n\").\nDisplacements and motion.\nThe position of one component of a mechanical system relative to another is defined by introducing a reference frame, say \"M\", on one that moves relative to a fixed frame, \"F,\" on the other. The rigid transformation, or displacement, of \"M\" relative to \"F\" defines the relative position of the two components. A displacement consists of the combination of a rotation and a translation.\nThe set of all displacements of \"M\" relative to \"F\" is called the configuration space of \"M.\" A smooth curve from one position to another in this configuration space is a continuous set of displacements, called the motion of \"M\" relative to \"F.\" The motion of a body consists of a continuous set of rotations and translations.\nMatrix representation.\nThe combination of a rotation and translation in the plane R2 can be represented by a certain type of 3\u00d73 matrix known as a homogeneous transform. The 3\u00d73 homogeneous transform is constructed from a 2\u00d72 rotation matrix \"A\"(\"\u03c6\") and the 2\u00d71 translation vector d = (\"dx\", \"dy\"), as:\nformula_102\nThese homogeneous transforms perform rigid transformations on the points in the plane \"z\" = 1, that is, on points with coordinates r = (\"x\", \"y\", 1).\nIn particular, let r define the coordinates of points in a reference frame \"M\" coincident with a fixed frame \"F\". Then, when the origin of \"M\" is displaced by the translation vector d relative to the origin of \"F\" and rotated by the angle \u03c6 relative to the x-axis of \"F\", the new coordinates in \"F\" of points in \"M\" are given by:\nformula_103\nHomogeneous transforms represent affine transformations. This formulation is necessary because a translation is not a linear transformation of R2. However, using projective geometry, so that R2 is considered a subset of R3, translations become affine linear transformations.\nPure translation.\nIf a rigid body moves so that its reference frame \"M\" does not rotate (\"\u03b8\" = 0) relative to the fixed frame \"F\", the motion is called pure translation. In this case, the trajectory of every point in the body is an offset of the trajectory d(\"t\") of the origin of \"M,\" that is:\nformula_104\nThus, for bodies in pure translation, the velocity and acceleration of every point \"P\" in the body are given by:\nformula_105\nwhere the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time and v\"O\" and a\"O\" are the velocity and acceleration, respectively, of the origin of the moving frame \"M\". Recall the coordinate vector p in \"M\" is constant, so its derivative is zero.\nRotation of a body around a fixed axis.\nObjects like a playground merry-go-round, ventilation fans, or hinged doors can be modeled as rigid bodies rotating about a single fixed axis. The \"z\"-axis has been chosen by convention.\nPosition.\nThis allows the description of a rotation as the angular position of a planar reference frame \"M\" relative to a fixed \"F\" about this shared \"z\"-axis. Coordinates p = (\"x\", \"y\") in \"M\" are related to coordinates P = (X, Y) in \"F\" by the matrix equation:\nformula_106\nwhere\nformula_107\nis the rotation matrix that defines the angular position of \"M\" relative to \"F\" as a function of time.\nVelocity.\nIf the point p does not move in \"M\", its velocity in \"F\" is given by\nformula_108\nIt is convenient to eliminate the coordinates p and write this as an operation on the trajectory P(\"t\"),\nformula_109\nwhere the matrix\nformula_110\nis known as the angular velocity matrix of \"M\" relative to \"F\". The parameter \"\u03c9\" is the time derivative of the angle \"\u03b8\", that is:\nformula_111\nAcceleration.\nThe acceleration of P(\"t\") in \"F\" is obtained as the time derivative of the velocity,\nformula_112\nwhich becomes\nformula_113\nwhere\nformula_114\nis the angular acceleration matrix of \"M\" on \"F\", and\nformula_115\nThe description of rotation then involves these three quantities:\nThe equations of translational kinematics can easily be extended to planar rotational kinematics for constant angular acceleration with simple variable exchanges:\nformula_118\nformula_119\nformula_120\nformula_121\nHere \"\u03b8\"i and \"\u03b8\"f are, respectively, the initial and final angular positions, \"\u03c9\"i and \"\u03c9\"f are, respectively, the initial and final angular velocities, and \"\u03b1\" is the constant angular acceleration. Although position in space and velocity in space are both true vectors (in terms of their properties under rotation), as is angular velocity, angle itself is not a true vector.\nPoint trajectories in body moving in three dimensions.\nImportant formulas in kinematics define the velocity and acceleration of points in a moving body as they trace trajectories in three-dimensional space. This is particularly important for the center of mass of a body, which is used to derive equations of motion using either Newton's second law or Lagrange's equations.\nPosition.\nIn order to define these formulas, the movement of a component \"B\" of a mechanical system is defined by the set of rotations [A(\"t\")] and translations d(\"t\") assembled into the homogeneous transformation [T(\"t\")]=[A(\"t\"), d(\"t\")]. If p is the coordinates of a point \"P\" in \"B\" measured in the moving reference frame \"M\", then the trajectory of this point traced in \"F\" is given by:\nformula_122\nThis notation does not distinguish between P = (X, Y, Z, 1), and P = (X, Y, Z), which is hopefully clear in context.\nThis equation for the trajectory of \"P\" can be inverted to compute the coordinate vector p in \"M\" as:\nformula_123\nThis expression uses the fact that the transpose of a rotation matrix is also its inverse, that is:\nformula_124\nVelocity.\nThe velocity of the point \"P\" along its trajectory P(\"t\") is obtained as the time derivative of this position vector,\nformula_125\nThe dot denotes the derivative with respect to time; because p is constant, its derivative is zero.\nThis formula can be modified to obtain the velocity of \"P\" by operating on its trajectory P(\"t\") measured in the fixed frame \"F\". Substituting the inverse transform for p into the velocity equation yields:\nformula_126\nThe matrix [\"S\"] is given by:\nformula_127\nwhere\nformula_128\nis the angular velocity matrix.\nMultiplying by the operator [\"S\"], the formula for the velocity vP takes the form:\nformula_129\nwhere the vector \"\u03c9\" is the angular velocity vector obtained from the components of the matrix [\u03a9]; the vector\nformula_130\nis the position of \"P\" relative to the origin \"O\" of the moving frame \"M\"; and\nformula_131\nis the velocity of the origin \"O\".\nAcceleration.\nThe acceleration of a point \"P\" in a moving body \"B\" is obtained as the time derivative of its velocity vector:\nformula_132\nThis equation can be expanded firstly by computing\nformula_133\nand\nformula_134\nThe formula for the acceleration A\"P\" can now be obtained as:\nformula_135\nor\nformula_136\nwhere \"\u03b1\" is the angular acceleration vector obtained from the derivative of the angular velocity vector;\nformula_137\nis the relative position vector (the position of \"P\" relative to the origin \"O\" of the moving frame \"M\"); and\nformula_138\nis the acceleration of the origin of the moving frame \"M\".\nKinematic constraints.\nKinematic constraints are constraints on the movement of components of a mechanical system. Kinematic constraints can be considered to have two basic forms, (i) constraints that arise from hinges, sliders and cam joints that define the construction of the system, called holonomic constraints, and (ii) constraints imposed on the velocity of the system such as the knife-edge constraint of ice-skates on a flat plane, or rolling without slipping of a disc or sphere in contact with a plane, which are called non-holonomic constraints. The following are some common examples.\nKinematic coupling.\nA kinematic coupling exactly constrains all 6 degrees of freedom.\nRolling without slipping.\nAn object that rolls against a surface without slipping obeys the condition that the velocity of its center of mass is equal to the cross product of its angular velocity with a vector from the point of contact to the center of mass:\nformula_139\nFor the case of an object that does not tip or turn, this reduces to formula_140.\nInextensible cord.\nThis is the case where bodies are connected by an idealized cord that remains in tension and cannot change length. The constraint is that the sum of lengths of all segments of the cord is the total length, and accordingly the time derivative of this sum is zero. A dynamic problem of this type is the pendulum. Another example is a drum turned by the pull of gravity upon a falling weight attached to the rim by the inextensible cord. An \"equilibrium\" problem (i.e. not kinematic) of this type is the catenary.\nKinematic pairs.\nReuleaux called the ideal connections between components that form a machine kinematic pairs. He distinguished between higher pairs which were said to have line contact between the two links and lower pairs that have area contact between the links. J. Phillips shows that there are many ways to construct pairs that do not fit this simple classification.\nLower pair.\nA lower pair is an ideal joint, or holonomic constraint, that maintains contact between a point, line or plane in a moving solid (three-dimensional) body to a corresponding point line or plane in the fixed solid body. There are the following cases:\nHigher pairs.\nGenerally speaking, a higher pair is a constraint that requires a curve or surface in the moving body to maintain contact with a curve or surface in the fixed body. For example, the contact between a cam and its follower is a higher pair called a \"cam joint\". Similarly, the contact between the involute curves that form the meshing teeth of two gears are cam joints.\nKinematic chains.\nRigid bodies (\"links\") connected by kinematic pairs (\"joints\") are known as \"kinematic chains\". Mechanisms and robots are examples of kinematic chains. The degree of freedom of a kinematic chain is computed from the number of links and the number and type of joints using the mobility formula. This formula can also be used to enumerate the topologies of kinematic chains that have a given degree of freedom, which is known as \"type synthesis\" in machine design.\nExamples.\nThe planar one degree-of-freedom linkages assembled from \"N\" links and \"j\" hinges or sliding joints are:\nFor larger chains and their linkage topologies, see R. P. Sunkari and L. C. Schmidt, \"Structural synthesis of planar kinematic chains by adapting a Mckay-type algorithm\", \"Mechanism and Machine Theory\" #41, pp.\u00a01021\u20131030 (2006).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65919", "revid": "48803326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65919", "title": "Point-to-point construction", "text": "Making an electronic circuit by directly connecting the leads of the components\nIn electronics, point-to-point construction is a non-automated technique for constructing circuits which was widely used before the use of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and automated assembly gradually became widespread following their introduction in the 1950s. Circuits using thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) were relatively large, relatively simple (the number of large, hot, expensive devices which needed replacing was minimised), and used large sockets, all of which made the PCB less obviously advantageous than with later complex semiconductor circuits. Point-to-point construction is still widespread in power electronics, where components are bulky and serviceability is a consideration, and to construct prototype equipment with few or heavy electronic components. A common practice, especially in older point-to-point construction, is to use the leads of components such as resistors and capacitors to bridge as much of the distance between connections as possible, reducing the need to add additional wire between the components.\nBefore point-to-point connection, electrical assemblies used screws or wire nuts to hold wires to an insulating wooden or ceramic board. The resulting devices were prone to fail from corroded contacts, or mechanical loosening of the connections. Early premium marine radios, especially from Marconi, sometimes used welded copper in the bus-bar circuits, but this was expensive. The crucial invention was to apply soldering to electrical assembly. In soldering, an alloy of tin and lead (and/or other metals), known as solder, is melted and adheres to other, nonmolten metals, such as copper or tinned steel. Solder makes a strong electrical and mechanical connection.\nPoint-to-point wiring is not suitable for automated assembly (though see wire wrap, a similar method that is) and is carried out manually, making it both more expensive and more susceptible to wiring errors than PCBs, as connections are determined by the person doing assembly rather than by an etched circuit board. For production, rather than prototyping, errors can be minimised by carefully designed operating procedures.\nAn intermediate form of construction uses terminal strips (sometimes called \"tag boards\"), eyelet boards or turret boards. Note that if components are arranged on boards with tags, eyelets or turrets at both ends and wires going to the next components, then the construction is correctly called tag, eyelet or turret construction respectively, as the components are not going from point to point. Although cordwood construction can be wired in a similar way the density means that component placement is usually fixed by a substrate that components are inserted into.\nTerminal strip construction.\nTerminal strip construction, which is often referred to as point-to-point construction within the tube guitar amplifier community, uses terminal strips (also called \"tag boards\"). A terminal strip has stamped tin-plated copper terminals, each with a hole through which wire ends could be pushed, fitted on an insulating strip, usually made of a cheap, heat-resistant material such as synthetic-resin bonded paper (FR-2), or bakelite reinforced with cotton. The insulator has an integral mounting bracket, sometimes electrically connected to one or more of the stamped loops to ground them to the chassis.\nThe chassis was constructed first, from sheet metal or wood. Insulated terminal strips were then riveted, nailed or screwed to the underside or interior of the chassis. Transformers, large capacitors, tube sockets and other large components were mounted to the top of the chassis. Their wires were led through holes to the underside or interior. The ends of lengths of wire or wire-ended components such as capacitors and resistors were pushed through the terminals, and usually looped and twisted. When all wires to be connected had been fitted to the terminal, they were soldered together (and to the terminal).\nProfessional electronics assemblers used to operate from books of photographs and follow an exact assembly sequence to ensure that they did not miss any components. This process is labor-intensive, subject to error and not suitable for automated production. Even after the introduction of printed circuit boards, it did not require laying out and manufacturing circuit boards.\nPoint-to-point and terminal strip construction continued to be used for some vacuum tube equipment even after the introduction of printed circuit boards. The heat of the tubes can degrade the circuit boards and cause them to become brittle and break. Circuit board degradation is often seen on inexpensive tube radios produced in the 1960s, especially around the hot output and rectifier tubes. American manufacturer Zenith continued to use point-to-point wiring in its tube-based television sets until the early 1970s.\nSome audiophile equipment, such as amplifiers, continues to be point-to-point wired using terminal pins, often in very small quantities. In this application modern point-to-point wiring is often used as a marketing design feature rather than a result of the economics of very-small-scale production.\nSometimes true point-to-point wiring\u2014without terminal strips\u2014with very short connections, is still used at very high radio frequencies (in the gigahertz range) to minimise stray capacitance and inductance; the capacitance between a circuit-board trace and some other conductor, and the inductance of a short track, become significant or dominant at high frequencies. In some cases careful PCB layout on a substrate with good high-frequency properties (e.g., ceramic) is sufficient. An example of this design is illustrated in an application note describing an avalanche transistor-based generator of pulses with risetime of a fraction of a nanosecond; the (few) critical components are connected directly to each other and to the output connector with the shortest possible leads.\nParticularly in complex equipment, wired circuits are often laid out as a \"ladder\" of side-by-side components, which need connecting to ladders or components by wire links. A good layout minimizes such links and wiring complexity, often approaching that of direct point-to-point. Amongst complex devices, the pre-PCB Tektronix vacuum-tube oscilloscopes stand out for their very well-designed point-to-point wiring.\nIf parasitic effects are significant, point-to-point and terminal strip wiring have variable parasitic components, while the inductance and capacitance due to a PCB are the same for all samples and can be compensated for reliably which may be essential for some RF circuits. In some heavily optimised point-to-point RF constructions the circuit can be tuned by bending wires around.\nPlacing the completed unit in an enclosure protects the circuit from its environment, and users from electrical hazards.\nA few large brand names still use terminal strip-type point-to-point boards, but usually for special product lines. Electric guitar amplifier manufacturer Marshall have reissued some of their older models, using this type of construction as a design feature, although their standard products have long used PCBs. Thermionic valve equipment usually does not have the valves mounted on the PCB in order to avoid heat damage, but instead use PCBs for the wiring, achieving the economy of mass-produced PCBs without the heat damage.\nBreadboard.\nPrototypes which are subject to modification are often not made on PCBs, using instead breadboard construction. Historically this could be literally a breadboard, a wooden board with components attached to it and joined up with wire. More recently the term is applied to a board of thin insulating material with holes at standard 0.1-inch pitch; components are pushed through the holes to anchor them, and point-to-point wired on the other side of the board. A type of breadboard specifically for prototyping has this layout, but with strips of metal spring contacts beneath a grid of holes into which components are pushed to make electrical connections like any removable connector. Some portion of the terminals in a straight line in one direction are electrically connected, commonly in groups of 5-10 with multiple groups per row, these may be interspersed with columns that span the height of the board for the more common connections (typically the power supply rails). Such breadboards, and stripboards, fall somewhere between PCBs and point-to-point; they do not require design and manufacture of a PCB, and are as easily modified as a point-to-point setup.\nStripboard.\nA stripboard is a board with holes in square grid pattern, commonly with a 0.1-inch pitch; all the holes in a straight line are connected by a copper strip as on a PCB. Components are pushed through from the side without strips and soldered in place. The strips can be interrupted by scraping out a section of the copper, stripboard cutters are available for this task which are effectively a drill bit with a handle, they are used by rotating on the holes in a strip.\n\"Dead bug\" construction.\nFree-form construction can be used in cases where a PCB would be too big or too much work to manufacture for a small number of components. Several methods of construction are used. At one extreme a wiring pen can be used with a perforated board, producing neat and professional results. At the other extreme is \"dead bug\" style, with the ICs flipped upside-down with their pins sticking up into the air like a dead insect, the leads of components are usually soldered directly to other components where possible, with many small circuits having no added wires. While it is messy-looking, free-form construction can be used to make more compact circuits than other methods. This is often used in BEAM robotics and in RF circuits where component leads must be kept short. This form of construction is used by amateurs for one-off circuits, and also professionally for circuit development, particularly at high frequencies.\nFor high-frequency work, a grounded solderable metallic base such as the copper side of an unetched printed circuit board can be used as base and ground plane. Information on high-frequency breadboarding and illustrations of dead bug with ground plane construction are in a Linear Technologies application note.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65922", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65922", "title": "Treaty of Shimonoseki", "text": "1895 treaty ending the First Sino-Japanese War\nThe , also known as the Treaty of Maguan in China or the in Japan, was signed in Shimonoseki, Japan, on April 17, 1895, between the Empire of Japan and the Qing dynasty. The treaty ended the First Sino-Japanese War, in which the Japanese decisively defeated the Chinese land and naval forces. The treaty was signed at the Shunpanr\u014d hotel by Count It\u014d Hirobumi and Viscount Mutsu Munemitsu for Japan and Li Hongzhang and his son Li Jingfang on behalf of China.\nThe peace conference took place from March 20 to April 17, 1895, and the treaty followed and superseded the Sino-Japanese Friendship and Trade Treaty of 1871. It consisted of 11 articles which provided for the termination of China's tributary relations with Korea; required that China pay an indemnity of 200 million taels and cede Taiwan (Formosa), the Penghu (Pescadores) Islands, and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan; and opened four cities (Shashi, Chongqing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou) to Japan as trading ports. However, due to the diplomatic Triple Intervention of Russia, Germany, and France just one week after the treaty was signed, the Japanese withdrew their claim to the Liaodong Peninsula in return for an additional war indemnity of 30 million taels from China.\nChinese scholars and officials vigorously opposed the harsh terms of the treaty, but it was ratified by the Guangxu Emperor. The cession of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands met with strong resistance by the local populace, and the islands were not taken over by Japan until October 1895. At the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1945, Japan surrendered and later signed the Treaty of Taipei with the Republic of China on 28 April 1952, which officially abrogated the Treaty of Shimonoseki.\nTreaty terms.\nThe treaty ended the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u20131895 as a clear victory for Japan.\nChina recognized the \"full and complete independence and autonomy\" of Joseon (the kingdom of Korea) and formally renounced China's traditional claims of imperial overlordship. The ceremonies in which Joseon acknowledged subordination to China were permanently abolished. In the next year, the Yeongeunmun gate outside Seoul, where those ceremonies were performed, was demolished leaving its two stone pillars.\nChina ceded to Japan the Island of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the Liaodong Peninsula in the southern part of present-day Liaoning province (including the city of Dalian). However, Liaodong was subsequently returned to Qing dynasty due to diplomatic intervention of Russia, Germany, and France, which forced Japan to back down and withdraw from the peninsula in the same year.\nChina paid Japan a war indemnity of 200 million Kuping taels, paid over seven years.\nChina opened various ports and rivers to Japanese trade, and granted Japan the same status regarding trade as various western powers had gained in the aftermath of the First and Second Opium Wars.\nValue of the indemnity.\nQing China's indemnity to Japan of 200 million silver Kuping taels, or about . After the Triple intervention, they paid another 30 million taels for a total of over silver, worth about $5 billion US dollars in 2015.\nTreaty and Taiwan.\nDuring the summit between Japanese and Qing representatives in March and April 1895, Prime Minister It\u014d Hirobumi and Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu wanted to reduce the power of the Qing dynasty on not only the Korean Peninsula but also the Taiwan islands. Moreover, Mutsu had already noticed its importance in order to expand Japanese military power towards South China and Southeast Asia. It was also the age of imperialism, so Japan wished to mimic what the Western nations were doing. Imperial Japan was seeking colonies and resources in the Korean Peninsula and mainland China to compete with the presence of Western powers at that time. This was the way the Japanese leadership chose to illustrate how fast Imperial Japan had advanced compared to the West since the 1867 Meiji Restoration, and the extent it wanted to amend the unequal treaties that were held in the Far East by the Western powers.\nAt the peace conference between Imperial Japan and the Qing dynasty, Li Hongzhang and Li Jingfang, the ambassadors at the negotiation desk of the Qing dynasty, originally did not plan to cede Taiwan because they also realized Taiwan's great location for trading with the West. Therefore, even though the Qing had lost wars against Britain and France in the 19th century, the Qing emperor was serious about keeping Taiwan under its rule, which began in 1683. On March 20, 1895, at Shunpanr\u014d () in Shimonoseki in Japan, a one month long peace conference began.\nAt the first half of the conference, Ito and Li talked mainly about a cease-fire agreement, and during the second half of the conference, the contents of the peace treaty were discussed. Ito and Mutsu claimed that yielding the full sovereignty of Taiwan was an absolute condition and requested Li to hand over full sovereignty of the Penghu Islands and the eastern portion of the bay at the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula. Li Hongzhang refused on the grounds that Taiwan had never been a battlefield during the first Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895. By the final stage of the conference, while Li Hongzhang agreed to the transfer of full sovereignty of the Penghu islands and the portion of Liaodong to Imperial Japan, he still refused to hand over Taiwan. As Taiwan had been a province since 1885, Li stated, \"Taiwan is already a province, and therefore not to be given away ().\"\nHowever, Imperial Japan had the military advantage, and eventually Li gave Taiwan up. On April 17, 1895, the peace treaty between Imperial Japan and the Qing dynasty had been signed and was followed by the successful Japanese invasion of Taiwan. This had a huge and lasting impact on Taiwan, the turning over of the island to Imperial Japan marking the end of 200 years of Qing rule despite local resistance in Taiwan against the annexation, which was quashed swiftly by the Japanese. Therefore, Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945, until the end of World War II by the surrender of Japan.\nSignatories and diplomats.\nThe treaty was drafted with John W. Foster, former American secretary of state, advising the Qing Empire. It was signed by Count It\u014d Hirobumi and Viscount Mutsu Munemitsu for the emperor of Japan and Li Hongzhang and Li Jingfang on behalf of the emperor of China. Before the treaty was signed, Li Hongzhang was attacked by a right-wing Japanese extremist on 24 March: he was fired at and wounded on his way back to his lodgings at Injoji temple. The public outcry aroused by the assassination attempt caused the Japanese to temper their demands and agree to a temporary armistice. The conference was temporarily adjourned and resumed on 10 April.\nAftermath.\nEntry of the Western powers.\nThe conditions imposed by Japan on China led to the Triple Intervention of Russia, France, and Germany, western powers all active in China, with established enclaves and ports, just six days after its signing. They demanded that Japan withdraw its claim on the Liaodong Peninsula, concerned that L\u00fcshun, then called Port Arthur by Westerners, would fall under Japanese control. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia (an ally of France) and his imperial advisors, including Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, had designs on Port Arthur, which could serve as Russia's long sought-after 'ice-free' port.\nUnder threat of war from three Western political powers, in November 1895, Japan \u2014 a weaker emerging nation not yet perceived as even a regional power \u2014 returned control of the territory and withdrew its \"de jure\" claim on the Liaodong Peninsula in return for an increased war indemnity from China of 30 million Taels. At that time, the European powers were not concerned with any of the other conditions, or the free hand Japan had been granted in Korea under the other terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. This would prove to be a mistake, as Japan would end up occupying Korea by 1905 and expand into Russia's sphere of influence with the Russo-Japanese War, and then encroach upon Germany's port in Shandong during World War I.\nWithin months after Japan returned the Liaodong peninsula, Russia started construction on the peninsula and a railway to Harbin from Port Arthur, despite Chinese protests. Eventually, Russia agreed to offer a diplomatic solution (See Russian Dalian) to the Chinese Empire, and agreed to a token lease of the region to save face, instead of annexing Manchuria outright, which was its effect. Within two years, Germany, France, and Great Britain had similarly taken advantage of the economic and political opportunities in the weak Chinese Empire (See Scramble for China), each taking control of significant local regions. Japan also took note of how the international community allowed the great powers to treat weaker nation states, and continued its remarkable measures to bootstrap itself into a modern industrial state and military power, with great success as it would demonstrate in the Russo-Japanese War less than a decade later.\nIn Taiwan, pro-Qing officials and elements of the local gentry declared a Republic of Formosa in 1895, but failed to win international recognition.\nIn China, the Treaty was considered a national humiliation by the bureaucracy and greatly weakened support for the Qing dynasty. The previous decades of the Self-Strengthening Movement were considered to be a failure, and support grew for more radical changes in China's political and social systems which led to Hundred Days' Reform in 1898. When the latter movement failed due to resistance from the Manchu nobility, a series of uprisings culminated in the fall of the Qing dynasty itself in 1911.\nThe Triple Intervention is regarded by many Japanese historians as being a crucial historic turning point in Japanese foreign affairs \u2013 from this point on, the nationalist, expansionist, and militant elements began to join ranks and steer Japan from a foreign policy based mainly on economic hegemony toward outright imperialism \u2014 a case of \"the coerced\" turning increasingly \"to coercion\".\nBoth the Republic of China, now controlling Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China, now controlling mainland China, consider the transfer of Taiwan to Japan to have been reversed by the Instrument of Surrender of Japan. Additionally, the Treaty of Shimonoseki is allegedly nullified by the Treaty of Taipei with the Republic of China. However, pro-independence activist Ng Chiau-tong argues that the terms subject to nullification should be limited to those not entirely fulfilled yet, to the exclusion of the cession provision. The People's Republic of China does not recognize the Treaty of Taipei.\nPrelude to war.\nRussia wasted little time after the Triple Intervention to move men and materials down into the Liaodong to start building a railroad from both ends \u2014 Port Arthur and Harbin, as it already had railway construction in progress across northern Manchuria to shorten the rail route to Russia's principal Pacific Ocean naval base at Vladivostok, a port closed by ice four months of each year. Russia also improved the port facilities at Port Arthur and founded a commercial town nearby at Dalniy (modern-day Dalian, which now encompasses Port Arthur as its L\u00fcshunkou District), before inking the lease of the territory.\nWhen the de facto governance of Port Arthur and the Liaodong peninsula was granted de jure to Russia by China along with an increase in other rights she had obtained in Manchuria (especially those in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces) the construction of the 550 mile Southern spurline of the Manchurian Railway was redoubled. Russia finally seemed to have gotten what the Russian Empire had been wanting in its quest to become a global power since the reign of Peter the Great. This ice-free natural harbor of Port Arthur/L\u00fcshun would serve to make Russia a great sea as well as the largest land power. Russia needed this ice-free port to achieve world power status as it was tired of being blocked by the balance of power politics in Europe (The Ottoman Empire and its allies had repeatedly frustrated Russian power fruition).\nHowever, the omission of the geopolitical reality in ignoring the free hand Japan had been granted by the Treaty (of Shimonoseki) with respect to Korea and Taiwan was short-sighted of Russia with respect to its strategic goals; to get to and maintain a strong point in Port Arthur Russia would have to dominate and control many additional hundreds of miles of Eastern Manchuria (the Fengtian province of Imperial China, modern Jilin and Heilongjiang) up to Harbin. Japan had long considered the lands paralleling the whole Korean border as part of its strategic sphere of influence. By leasing \"Liaodong\" and railway concessions, Russia crashed its Sphere of Influence squarely into Japan's.\nThis acted as a further goad to emerging Japanese anger at their disrespectful treatment by all the West. In the immediate fallout of the \"Triple Intervention\", Japanese popular resentment at Russia's deviousness and the perceived weakness of its own government caving in to foreign pressure led to riots in Tokyo. The disturbance almost brought down the government, as well as a strengthening of imperial and expansionist factions within Japan. The Russian spear into the sphere also brought about the ensuing struggle with Russia for dominance in Korea and Manchuria. These events eventually led to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905 by a renewed and modernized Japanese military, which led to a major defeat for Russia that marked the beginning of the end for the Romanov dynasty.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Minor was, at the time, detained in the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, near the village of Crowthorne, in Berkshire, England.\nThe \"professor\" referred to in the North American title is Sir James Murray, the chief editor of the \"OED\" during most of the project. Murray was a talented linguist and had other scholarly interests, and had taught in schools and worked in banking. Faced with the enormous task of producing a comprehensive dictionary, with a quotation illustrating the uses of each meaning of each word, and with evidence for the earliest use of each, Murray enlisted the help of dozens of amateur philologists as volunteer researchers.\nHistory of creation.\nA journalist with three decades of experience, and the author of a dozen travel-inspired books, Winchester's initial proposal to write a book about an obscure lexicographer was originally met with rejection. Only when HarperCollins editor Larry Ashmead read the proposal and championed the book did Winchester pursue the necessary research in earnest. Of the project Ashmead said \"we can make lexicography cool\". It was Ashmead who persuaded Winchester to call the North American edition \"The Professor and the Madman\" (over Winchester's objection that Murray was not a professor), saying \"No one here knows what the hell a Crowthorne is.\"\nReception.\nThe book was a major success. Winchester went on to write \"The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary\" (2003) about the broader history of the \"OED\".\nFilm adaptation.\nA film adaptation of the book, starring Mel Gibson as Murray and Sean Penn as Minor and directed by Farhad Safinia under the pseudonym P. B. Shemran, was released in 2019 with the title \"The Professor and the Madman\". The movie rights for the book were bought by Gibson's Icon Productions in 1998. John Boorman wrote a script and was at one time tapped to direct, as was Luc Besson. Production began in 2016, but the release was delayed by legal disputes between parties in the film's production.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Once the film has been exposed, it must be processed before it is ready for use. Photoplotters are used primarily for industrial production of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and integrated circuit (IC) packaging.\nIn the PCB industry, photoplotting is the first step of making photolithography masks for printed circuit boards. These masks are called \"photoplots\" and are limited in resolution by the technology in use; in 1998, photoplots with resolvable details of 2.5 \u03bcm or more were possible. Integrated circuits are made in a similar fashion utilizing \"photomasks\" with sub-micrometer feature sizes; photomasks are traditionally made by photoreducing photoplotter output. \nOther application of photoplotters include chemical milling and specialized graphic arts.\nHistory.\nThe first photoplotter was introduced by Gerber Scientific, Inc. in the 1960s. The company's file standard, the Gerber format for PCB files, eventually became an industry standard for describing the printed circuit board images such as the copper layers, solder mask and legend.\nEarly machines used a xenon flash lamp, and projected an image mounted in a rotating \"aperture wheel\" onto the photosensitive surface of the film or glass plate. The imaging head assembly traversed over the surface of the media without touching it to produce \"draws\" and \"flashes\". Draws are vectors or arcs created by continuous illumination as the imaging head moves over the photosensitive surface. A flash creates a single simple graphic in a location by shining light through an aperture of the appropriate shape at a fixed location.\nModern photoplotters are generally raster-scan devices that use a laser beam focused to one or more spots, modulated at multi-megahertz rates to form the image.\nThe most recent development related to photoplotting is laser direct imaging (LDI) which utilizes a high-power laser or xenon lamp to directly expose photoresist on a coated substrate instead of exposing photographic film. This eliminates the handling of photographic film.\nThe input of photoplotters is a vector graphics file, typically in Gerber format.\nManufacturers of photoplotters include Gerber Scientific, Orbotech and Ucamco.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Angular displacement may be signed, indicating the sense of rotation (e.g., clockwise); it may also be greater (in absolute value) than a full turn.\nContext.\nWhen a body rotates about its axis, the motion cannot simply be analyzed as a particle, as in circular motion it undergoes a changing velocity and acceleration at any time. When dealing with the rotation of a body, it becomes simpler to consider the body itself rigid. A body is generally considered rigid when the separations between all the particles remains constant throughout the body's motion, so for example parts of its mass are not flying off. In a realistic sense, all things can be deformable, however this impact is minimal and negligible.\nExample.\nIn the example illustrated to the right (or above in some mobile versions), a particle or body P is at a fixed distance \"r\" from the origin, \"O\", rotating counterclockwise. It becomes important to then represent the position of particle P in terms of its polar coordinates (\"r\", \"\u03b8\"). In this particular example, the value of \"\u03b8\" is changing, while the value of the radius remains the same. (In rectangular coordinates (\"x\", \"y\") both \"x\" and \"y\" vary with time.) As the particle moves along the circle, it travels an arc length \"s\", which becomes related to the angular position through the relationship:\n formula_1\nDefinition and units.\nAngular displacement may be expressed with the unit radian or degree. Using the radian provides a very simple relationship between distance traveled around the circle (\"circular arc length\") and the distance \"r\" from the centre (\"radius\"):\n formula_2\nFor example, if a body rotates 360\u00b0 around a circle of radius \"r\", the angular displacement is given by the distance traveled around the circumference - which is 2\u03c0\"r\" - divided by the radius: formula_3 which easily simplifies to: formula_4. Therefore, 1 revolution is formula_5 radians.\nThe above definition is part of the International System of Quantities (ISQ), formalized in the international standard ISO 80000-3 (Space and time), and adopted in the International System of Units (SI).\nAngular displacement may be signed, indicating the sense of rotation (e.g., clockwise); it may also be greater (in absolute value) than a full turn.\nIn the ISQ/SI, angular displacement is used to define the \"number of revolutions\", \"N\" = \u03b8/(2\u03c0 rad), a ratio and hence a quantity of dimension one.\nIn three dimensions.\nIn three dimensions, angular displacement is an entity with a direction and a magnitude. The direction specifies the axis of rotation, which always exists by virtue of the Euler's rotation theorem; the magnitude specifies the rotation in radians about that axis (using the right-hand rule to determine direction). This entity is called an axis-angle.\nDespite having direction and magnitude, angular displacement is not a vector because it does not obey the commutative law for addition. Nevertheless, when dealing with infinitesimal rotations, second order infinitesimals can be discarded and in this case commutativity appears.\nRotation matrices.\nSeveral ways to describe rotations exist, like rotation matrices or Euler angles. See charts on SO(3) for others.\nGiven that any frame in the space can be described by a rotation matrix, the displacement among them can also be described by a rotation matrix. Being formula_6 and formula_7 two matrices, the angular displacement matrix between them can be obtained as &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. When this product is performed having a very small difference between both frames we will obtain a matrix close to the identity.\nIn the limit, we will have an infinitesimal rotation matrix."}

The pseudovector direction formula_2 is normal to the instantaneous plane of rotation or angular displacement. \nThere are two types of angular velocity:\nAngular velocity has dimension of angle per unit time; this is analogous to linear velocity, with angle replacing distance, with time in common. The SI unit of angular velocity is radians per second, although degrees per second (\u00b0/s) is also common. The radian is a dimensionless quantity, thus the SI units of angular velocity are dimensionally equivalent to reciprocal seconds, s\u22121, although rad/s is preferable to avoid confusion with rotation velocity in units of hertz (also equivalent to s\u22121). \nThe sense of angular velocity is conventionally specified by the right-hand rule, implying clockwise rotations (as viewed on the plane of rotation); negation (multiplication by \u22121) leaves the magnitude unchanged but flips the axis in the opposite direction.\nFor example, a geostationary satellite completes one orbit per sidereal day above the equator (approximately 360 degrees per 24 hours) has angular velocity magnitude (angular speed) \"\u03c9\" = 360\u00b0/24\u00a0h = 15\u00b0/h (or 2\u03c0\u00a0rad/24\u00a0h \u2248 0.26\u00a0rad/h) and angular velocity direction (a unit vector) parallel to Earth's rotation axis (&amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, in the geocentric coordinate system). If angle is measured in radians, the linear velocity is the radius times the angular velocity, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. With orbital radius from the Earth's center, the satellite's tangential speed through space is thus \"v\" = \u00d7 0.26/h \u2248 . The angular velocity is positive since the satellite travels prograde with the Earth's rotation (the same direction as the rotation of Earth).\nOrbital angular velocity of a point particle.\nParticle in two dimensions.\nIn the simplest case of circular motion at radius &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, with position given by the angular displacement formula_3 from the x-axis, the orbital angular velocity is the rate of change of angle with respect to time: &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. If formula_4 is measured in radians, the arc-length from the positive x-axis around the circle to the particle is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and the linear velocity is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, so that &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;.\nIn the general case of a particle moving in the plane, the orbital angular velocity is the rate at which the position vector relative to a chosen origin \"sweeps out\" angle. The diagram shows the position vector formula_5 from the origin formula_6 to a particle &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, with its polar coordinates &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. (All variables are functions of time &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.) The particle has linear velocity splitting as &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, with the radial component formula_7 parallel to the radius, and the cross-radial (or tangential) component formula_8 perpendicular to the radius. When there is no radial component, the particle moves around the origin in a circle; but when there is no cross-radial component, it moves in a straight line from the origin. Since radial motion leaves the angle unchanged, only the cross-radial component of linear velocity contributes to angular velocity.\nThe angular velocity \"\u03c9\" is the rate of change of angular position with respect to time, which can be computed from the cross-radial velocity as:\nformula_9\nHere the cross-radial speed formula_10 is the signed magnitude of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, positive for counter-clockwise motion, negative for clockwise. Taking polar coordinates for the linear velocity formula_11 gives magnitude formula_12 (linear speed) and angle formula_13 relative to the radius vector; in these terms, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, so that\nformula_14\nThese formulas may be derived doing &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, being formula_15 a function of the distance to the origin with respect to time, and formula_16 a function of the angle between the vector and the x-axis. Then:\nformula_17\nwhich is equal to:\nformula_18\n(see Unit vector in cylindrical coordinates). \nKnowing &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, we conclude that the radial component of the velocity is given by &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, because formula_19 is a radial unit vector; and the perpendicular component is given by formula_20 because formula_21 is a perpendicular unit vector.\nIn two dimensions, angular velocity is a number with plus or minus sign indicating orientation, but not pointing in a direction. The sign is conventionally taken to be positive if the radius vector turns counter-clockwise, and negative if clockwise. Angular velocity then may be termed a pseudoscalar, a numerical quantity which changes sign under a parity inversion, such as inverting one axis or switching the two axes.\nParticle in three dimensions.\nIn three-dimensional space, we again have the position vector r of a moving particle. Here, orbital angular velocity is a pseudovector whose magnitude is the rate at which r sweeps out angle (in radians per unit of time), and whose direction is perpendicular to the instantaneous plane in which r sweeps out angle (i.e. the plane spanned by r and v). However, as there are \"two\" directions perpendicular to any plane, an additional condition is necessary to uniquely specify the direction of the angular velocity; conventionally, the right-hand rule is used.\nLet the pseudovector formula_22 be the unit vector perpendicular to the plane spanned by r and v, so that the right-hand rule is satisfied (i.e. the instantaneous direction of angular displacement is counter-clockwise looking from the top of &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;). Taking polar coordinates formula_23 in this plane, as in the two-dimensional case above, one may define the orbital angular velocity vector as:\n formula_24\nwhere &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is the angle between &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. In terms of the cross product, this is:\n formula_25\nFrom the above equation, one can recover the tangential velocity as:\n formula_26\nSpin angular velocity of a rigid body or reference frame.\nGiven a rotating frame of three linearly independent unit coordinate vectors, at each instant in time, there always exists a common axis (called the axis of rotation) around which all three vectors rotate with the same angular speed and in the same angular direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). In such a frame, each vector may be considered as a moving particle with constant scalar radius. A collection of such particles is called a rigid body.\nEuler's rotation theorem says that in a rotating frame, the axis of rotation one obtains from one choice of three linearly independent unit vectors is the same as that for any other choice; that is, there is one \"single\" instantaneous axis of rotation to the frame, around which all points rotate at the same angular speed and in the same angular direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). The spin angular velocity of a frame or rigid body is defined to be the pseudovector whose magnitude is this common angular speed, and whose direction is along the common axis of rotation in accordance with the right-hand rule (that is, for counterclockise rotation, it points \"upward\" along the axis, while for clockwise rotation, it points \"downward\").\nIn larger than 3 spatial dimensions, the interpretation of spin angular velocity as a pseudovector is not valid; however, it may be characterized by a more general type of object known as an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor.\nThe addition of angular velocity vectors for frames is also defined by the usual vector addition (composition of linear movements), and can be useful to decompose the rotation as in a gimbal. All components of the vector can be calculated as derivatives of the parameters defining the moving frames (Euler angles or rotation matrices). As in the general case, addition is commutative: &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nIf we choose a reference point formula_27 fixed in a rotating frame, the velocity formula_28 of any point in the frame is given by\n formula_29\nComponents from the basis vectors of a body-fixed frame.\nConsider a rigid body rotating about a fixed point O. Construct a reference frame in the body consisting of an orthonormal set of vectors formula_30 fixed to the body and with their common origin at O. The spin angular velocity vector of both frame and body about O is then\n formula_31\nwhere formula_32 is the time rate of change of the frame vector &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, due to the rotation.\nThis formula is incompatible with the expression for \"orbital\" angular velocity\n formula_33\nas that formula defines angular velocity for a \"single point\" about O, while the formula in this section applies to a frame or rigid body. In the case of a rigid body a \"single\" formula_34 has to account for the motion of \"all\" particles in the body.\nComponents from Euler angles.\nThe components of the spin angular velocity pseudovector were first calculated by Leonhard Euler using his Euler angles and the use of an intermediate frame:\nEuler proved that the projections of the angular velocity pseudovector on each of these three axes is the derivative of its associated angle (which is equivalent to decomposing the instantaneous rotation into three instantaneous Euler rotations). Therefore:\n formula_35\nThis basis is not orthonormal and it is difficult to use, but now the velocity vector can be changed to the fixed frame or to the moving frame with just a change of bases. For example, changing to the mobile frame:\n formula_36\nwhere formula_37 are unit vectors for the frame fixed in the moving body. This example has been made using the Z-X-Z convention for Euler angles.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The strait provides the most direct waterway between the Great Australian Bight and the Tasman Sea, and is also the only maritime route into the economically prominent Port Phillip Bay.\nFormed 8,000 years ago by rising sea levels at the end of the last glacial period, the strait was named after English explorer and physician George Bass (1771\u20131803) by European colonists.\nExtent.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Bass Strait as follows:\n\"On the west.\" The eastern limit of the Great Australian Bight [being a line from Cape Otway, Australia, to King Island and thence to Cape Grim, the northwest extreme of Tasmania].\n\"On the east.\" The western limit of the Tasman Sea between Gabo Island and Eddystone Point [being a line from Gabo Island (near Cape Howe, 37\u00b030'S) to the northeast point of East Sister Island (148\u00b0E) thence along the 148th meridian to Flinders Island; beyond this Island a line running to the Eastward of the Vansittart Shoals to [Cape] Barren Island, and from Cape Barren (the easternmost point of [Cape] Barren Island) to Eddystone Point (41\u00b0S) [in Tasmania].\nDiffering views of location and context.\nSome authorities consider the strait to be part of the Pacific Ocean as in the never-approved 2002 IHO \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\" draft. In the currently in-force IHO 1953 draft, it is instead associated with the Great Australian Bight; the Bight is numbered 62, while the Bass Strait is designated 62-A.\nThe Australian Hydrographic Service does not consider it to be part of its expanded definition of the Southern Ocean, but rather states that it lies with the Tasman Sea. The strait between the Furneaux Islands and Tasmania is Banks Strait, a subdivision of Bass Strait.\nDiscovery and exploration.\nBy Aboriginal peoples.\nAboriginal Tasmanians arrived in Tasmania approximately 40,000 years ago during the last glacial period, across a broad prehistoric land bridge called the Bassian Plain between the nowaday southern Victoria coastline (from Wilsons Promontory to Cape Otway) and the northern Tasmanian shores (from Cape Portland to Cape Grim). After the glacial period ended, sea levels rose and flooded the Bassian Plain to form Bass Strait at around 8,000 years ago, leaving them isolated from the Australian mainland. Aboriginal people lived on Flinders Island until around 4,000 years ago.\nBased on the recorded language groups, there were at least three successive waves of Aboriginal colonisation.\nBy Europeans.\nThe strait was possibly detected by Captain Abel Tasman when he charted Tasmania's coast in 1642. On 5 December Tasman was following the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at Eddystone Point, he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by the Roaring Forties howling through Bass Strait. Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent, not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent hunting.\nThe next European to approach the strait was Captain James Cook in \"HMS Endeavour\" in April 1770. However, after sailing for two hours westward towards the strait against the wind, he turned back east and noted in his journal that he was \"doubtful whether they [i.e. Van Diemen's Land and New Holland] are one land or no\".\nThe strait was named after George Bass, after he and Matthew Flinders sailed across it while circumnavigating Van Diemen's Land (now named Tasmania) in the \"Norfolk\" in 1798\u201399. At Flinders' recommendation, the Governor of New South Wales, John Hunter, in 1800 named the stretch of water between the mainland and Van Diemen's Land \"Bass's Straits\". In 1798 it became known as Bass Strait.\nThe existence of the strait had been suggested in 1797 by the master of \"Sydney Cove\" when he reached Sydney after deliberately grounding his foundering ship and being stranded on Preservation Island (at the eastern end of the strait). He reported that the strong south westerly swell and the tides and currents suggested that the island was in a channel linking the Pacific and southern Indian Ocean. Governor Hunter thus wrote to Joseph Banks in August 1797 that it seemed certain a strait existed.\nWhen news of the 1798 discovery of Bass Strait reached Europe, the French government despatched a reconnaissance expedition commanded by Nicolas Baudin. This prompted Governor King to send two vessels from Sydney to the island to establish a garrison at Hobart.\nMaritime history.\nStrong currents between the Antarctic-driven southeast portions of the Indian Ocean and the Tasman Sea's Pacific Ocean waters provide a strait of powerful, wild storm waves. The shipwrecks on the Tasmanian and Victorian coastlines number in the hundreds, although stronger metal ships and modern marine navigation have greatly reduced the danger.\nMany vessels, some quite large, have disappeared without a trace, or left scant evidence of their passing. Despite myths and legends of piracy, wrecking and alleged supernatural phenomena akin to those of the Bermuda Triangle, such disappearances can be invariably ascribed to treacherous combinations of wind and sea conditions, and the numerous semi-submerged rocks and reefs within the Straits.\nDespite the strait's difficult waters, it provided a safer and less boisterous passage for ships on the route from Europe or India to Sydney in the early 19th century. The strait also saved on the voyage.\nGeography.\nBass Strait is approximately wide and long, with an average depth of . The widest opening is about between Cape Portland on the northeastern tip of Tasmania and Point Hicks on the Australian mainland.\nJennings' study of the submarine topography of Bass Strait described the bathymetric Bass Basin, a shallow depression approximately wide and long (over in area) in the centre of Bass Strait, a maximum depth is the channel between Inner Sister Island and Flinders Island, which navigation charts indicate reaches . Two underwater plateaus, the \"Bassian Rise\" and \"King Island Rise\" located on the eastern and western margins of Bass Strait, respectively, are composed of a basement of Paleozoic granite. These features form sills separating Bass Basin from the adjacent ocean basins. Associated with the less than -deep Bassian Rise is the Furneaux Islands, the largest of which is Flinders Island (maximum elevation ). The surface of the King Island Rise also occurs in water depths of less than , and includes the shallow () \"Tail Bank\" at its northern margin as well as King Island itself. Subaqueous dunes (sandwaves) and tidal current ridges cover approximately of the seabed in Bass Strait.\nDuring Pleistocene, low sea level stands the central basin of Bass Strait was enclosed by raised sills forming a large shallow lake. This occurred during the last glacial maximum (18,000\u00a0BP) when the basin was completely isolated. Sea level rise during the marine transgression flooded the basin, forming a westward embayment from 11,800\u00a0BP to 8700\u00a0BP, and the basin rim was completely flooded by about 8000\u00a0BP, at which point Bass Strait was formed and Tasmania became an isolated island.\nLike the rest of the waters surrounding Tasmania, and particularly because of its limited depth, it is notoriously rough, with many ships lost there during the 19th century. A lighthouse was erected on Deal Island in 1848 to assist ships navigating in the eastern part of the Straits, but there were no guides to the western entrance until the Cape Otway Lighthouse was first lit in 1848, followed by another at Cape Wickham at the northern end of King Island in 1861.\nIslands.\nThere are over 50 islands in Bass Strait. Major islands include:\nWestern section:\nSouth eastern section:\nNorth eastern section:\nProtected areas.\nFederal.\nWithin Bass Strait there are several Commonwealth marine reserves, which are all part of the South-east Network. The two larger reserves, Flinders and Zeehan, extend mostly outside of the Bass Strait area.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nState.\nThe smaller islands of Bass Strait typically have some form of protection status. Most notably the Kent Group National Park covers the Kent Group islands of Tasmania, as well as the surrounding state waters which is a dedicated marine reserve. The national park is wholly contained by the Beagle Commonwealth Marine Reserve.\nVictoria has several marine national parks in Bass Strait, and are all adjacent to the mainland coastline:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNatural resources.\nA number of oil and gas fields exist in the eastern portion of Bass Strait, in what is known as the Gippsland Basin. Most large fields were discovered in the 1960s, and are located about off the coast of Gippsland in water depths of about . These oil fields include the Halibut Field discovered in 1967, the Cobia Field discovered in 1972, the Kingfish Field, the Mackerel Field, and the Fortescue Field discovered in 1978. Large gas fields include the Whiptail field, the Barracouta Field, the Snapper Field, and the Marlin Field. Oil and gas are produced from the Cretaceous-Eocene clastic rocks of the Latrobe Group, deposited with the break-up of Australia and Antarctica. In 2020 activist group No Gas Across the Bass was set up after American company ConocoPhillips put in an application to seismic blast 27km from King Island. Further environmental campaigning followed the Australian government's 2020 Oil and Gas acreage release as this opened up new areas of Tasmania's oceans for exploration.\nThe western field, known as the Otway Basin, was discovered in the 1990s offshore near Port Campbell. Its exploitation began in 2005.\nThe oil and gas is sent via pipeline to gas processing facilities and oil refineries at Longford (Longford gas plant), Western Port (Westernport Refinery closed 1985), Altona (Altona Refinery scheduled to close in 2021) and Geelong (Geelong Oil Refinery), as well as by tanker to New South Wales. Pipelines from the Otway Basin gas fields lead to several processing facilities in the vicinity of Port Campbell (Iona Gas Plant and Otway Gas Plant).\nIn June 2017, the Government of Victoria announced a three-year feasibility study for Australia's first offshore wind farm. The project, which could have 250 wind turbines within a area, is projected to deliver around 8,000\u00a0GWh of electricity, representing some 18 per cent of Victoria's power usage and replacing a large part of the output of Hazelwood Power Station, which was closed in early 2017.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nThe fastest and often the cheapest method of travel across Bass Strait is by air. The major airports in Tasmania are Hobart Airport and Launceston Airport, where the main airlines are Jetstar and Virgin Australia. Qantas also operates services. The smaller airports in the north of the state and on the islands in the strait are served either by Rex Airlines, QantasLink or King Island Airlines.\nCommercial Freight\nMajor commercial freight operator SeaRoad, complete daily sailings between Devonport and Port Melbourne Mon-Sat.\nFerries.\nThe domestic sea route is serviced by two Spirit of Tasmania passenger vehicle ferries, based in Devonport, Tasmania. The ships travel daily between Devonport and Spirit of Tasmania Quay in Geelong as overnight trips, with additional daytime trips during the peak summer season.\nEnergy.\nThe Basslink HVDC electrical cable has been in service since 2006. It has the capacity to carry up to 630 megawatts of electrical power across the strait.\nAlinta owns a submarine gas pipeline, delivering natural gas to large industrial customers near George Town, as well as the Powerco gas network in Tasmania.\nCommunications.\nThe first submarine communications cable across Bass Strait was laid in 1859. Starting at Cape Otway, Victoria, it went via King Island and Three Hummock Island, made contact with the Tasmanian mainland at Stanley Head, and then continued on to George Town. It started failing within a few weeks of completion, and by 1861 it failed completely.\nTasmania is currently connected to the mainland via two Telstra-operated fibre optic cables; since 2006, dark fibre capacity has also been available on the Basslink HVDC cable.\nOther submarine cables include:\nPopular culture.\nIn 1978, one of the most famous UFO incidents in Australian history occurred over Bass Strait. Frederick Valentich was flying a small aeroplane over the strait when he reported to personnel at a local airport that a strange object was buzzing his plane. He then claimed that the object had moved directly in front of his plane; the airport personnel then heard a metallic \"scraping\" sound, followed by silence. Valentich and his plane subsequently vanished and neither Valentich nor his plane were ever seen again.\nThe issue of planes, ships and people having been lost in the strait over time has spawned a number of theories. Perhaps the most thorough list of losses and disappearances has been the oft reprinted book of Jack Loney though it is possible that most losses can be adequately explained by extreme weather events.\nOn the popular Australian soap \"Neighbours\", one of its most dramatic storylines unfolded when a 1940s themed joy flight to Tasmania was sabotaged by a bomb. The plane crashed into Bass Strait in the middle of the night and many character's lives were put at risk, with some drowning.\nNon-motorised crossings.\nBass Strait is regularly crossed by sailing vessels, including during the annual Melbourne to Hobart Yacht Race. The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race passes generally east of the strait but is affected by its weather conditions.\nSailing.\nThe first windsurfer crossing was in 1982 by Mark Paul and Les Tokolyi. In 1998 Australian offshore sailor Nick Moloney took on a different challenge by being the first person to windsurf unaided across the Bass Strait in a time of 22 hours.\nIn terms of dinghy sailing many crossings have been made but in March 2005 Australian Olympic medallist Michael Blackburn set a record when he crossed the strait in just over 13 hours in a Laser sailing dinghy.\nIn March 2009 two young dinghy sailors sailed a B14 (dinghy) from Stanley in north west Tasmania to Walkerville South in Victoria. The purpose of the voyage was to raise funds for the treatment of the endangered Tasmanian Devil, an animal species suffering from a facial tumour disease and, if possible, break the dinghy sailing time record for the crossing. The sailors Adrian Beswick and Josh Philips accompanied by a support vessel successfully completed the crossing in 14 hours 53 minutes.\nKitesurfers have also completed the crossing with Natalie Clark in 2010 become the first female to do the crossing.\nRowing / Paddling.\nIn 1971 lone rower David Bowen from Mount Martha crossed Bass Strait in a dory, leaving from Devonport he landed on Wilson's Promontory.\nThe first crossing by paddleboard was made by Jack Bark, Brad Gaul and Zeb Walsh, leaving Wilsons Promontory in Victoria on 25 February 2014 and arriving at Cape Portland in northeastern Tasmania on 4 March 2014.\nRod Harris, Ian and Peter Richards are credited with the first kayak crossing in 1971. Many sea kayakers have since made the crossing, usually by island hopping on the eastern side of the strait. Fewer sea kayak crossings have been made via King Island, due to the leg between Cape Wickam and Apollo Bay. Andrew McAuley was the first person to cross Bass Strait non-stop in a sea kayak in 2003. He made two more crossings of Bass Strait before he died attempting to cross the Tasman Sea in February 2007. In total, roughly 300 people have crossed bass strait by kayak in modern times.\nSwimming.\nTammy van Wisse swam part of the strait in 1996, from King Island to Apollo Bay in Victoria, a distance of about in 17 hours and 46 minutes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Following the two types of angular velocity, \"spin angular velocity\" and \"orbital angular velocity\", the respective types of angular acceleration are: spin angular acceleration, involving a rigid body about an axis of rotation intersecting the body's centroid; and orbital angular acceleration, involving a point particle and an external axis.\nAngular acceleration has physical dimensions of angle per time squared, with the SI unit radian per second squared (rad\u22c5s\u22122). In two dimensions, angular acceleration is a pseudoscalar whose sign is taken to be positive if the angular speed increases counterclockwise or decreases clockwise, and is taken to be negative if the angular speed increases clockwise or decreases counterclockwise. In three dimensions, angular acceleration is a pseudovector.\nOrbital angular acceleration of a point particle.\nParticle in two dimensions.\nIn two dimensions, the orbital angular acceleration is the rate at which the two-dimensional orbital angular velocity of the particle about the origin changes. The instantaneous angular velocity \"\u03c9\" at any point in time is given by\n formula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the distance from the origin and formula_3 is the cross-radial component of the instantaneous velocity (i.e. the component perpendicular to the position vector), which by convention is positive for counter-clockwise motion and negative for clockwise motion.\nTherefore, the instantaneous angular acceleration \"\u03b1\" of the particle is given by\n formula_4\nExpanding the right-hand-side using the product rule from differential calculus, this becomes\n formula_5\nIn the special case where the particle undergoes circular motion about the origin, formula_6 becomes just the tangential acceleration formula_7, and formula_8 vanishes (since the distance from the origin stays constant), so the above equation simplifies to\n formula_9\nIn two dimensions, angular acceleration is a number with plus or minus sign indicating orientation, but not pointing in a direction. The sign is conventionally taken to be positive if the angular speed increases in the counter-clockwise direction or decreases in the clockwise direction, and the sign is taken negative if the angular speed increases in the clockwise direction or decreases in the counter-clockwise direction. Angular acceleration then may be termed a pseudoscalar, a numerical quantity which changes sign under a parity inversion, such as inverting one axis or switching the two axes.\nParticle in three dimensions.\nIn three dimensions, the orbital angular acceleration is the rate at which three-dimensional orbital angular velocity vector changes with time. The instantaneous angular velocity vector formula_10 at any point in time is given by\n formula_11\nwhere formula_12 is the particle's position vector, formula_2 its distance from the origin, and formula_14 its velocity vector.\nTherefore, the orbital angular acceleration is the vector formula_15 defined by\n formula_16\nExpanding this derivative using the product rule for cross-products and the ordinary quotient rule, one gets:\n formula_17\nSince formula_18 is just formula_19, the second term may be rewritten as formula_20. In the case where the distance formula_2 of the particle from the origin does not change with time (which includes circular motion as a subcase), the second term vanishes and the above formula simplifies to\n formula_22\nFrom the above equation, one can recover the cross-radial acceleration in this special case as:\n formula_23\nUnlike in two dimensions, the angular acceleration in three dimensions need not be associated with a change in the angular \"speed\" formula_24: If the particle's position vector \"twists\" in space, changing its instantaneous plane of angular displacement, the change in the \"direction\" of the angular velocity formula_25 will still produce a nonzero angular acceleration. This cannot not happen if the position vector is restricted to a fixed plane, in which case formula_25 has a fixed direction perpendicular to the plane.\nThe angular acceleration vector is more properly called a pseudovector: It has three components which transform under rotations in the same way as the Cartesian coordinates of a point do, but which do not transform like Cartesian coordinates under reflections.\nRelation to torque.\nThe net \"torque\" on a point particle is defined to be the pseudovector\n formula_27\nwhere formula_28 is the net force on the particle.\nTorque is the rotational analogue of force: it induces change in the rotational state of a system, just as force induces change in the translational state of a system. As force on a particle is connected to acceleration by the equation formula_29, one may write a similar equation connecting torque on a particle to angular acceleration, though this relation is necessarily more complicated.\nFirst, substituting formula_30 into the above equation for torque, one gets\n formula_31\nFrom the previous section:\n formula_32\nwhere formula_33 is orbital angular acceleration and formula_25 is orbital angular velocity. Therefore:\n formula_35\nIn the special case of constant distance formula_2 of the particle from the origin (formula_37), the second term in the above equation vanishes and the above equation simplifies to\n formula_38\nwhich can be interpreted as a \"rotational analogue\" to formula_30, where the quantity formula_40 (known as the moment of inertia of the particle) plays the role of the mass formula_41. However, unlike formula_30, this equation does \"not\" apply to an arbitrary trajectory, only to a trajectory contained within a spherical shell about the origin.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Certain sequences of bytes, most starting with an ASCII escape character and a bracket character, are embedded into text. The terminal interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display verbatim.\nANSI sequences were introduced in the 1970s to replace vendor-specific sequences and became widespread in the computer equipment market by the early 1980s. Although hardware text terminals have become increasingly rare in the 21st century, the relevance of the ANSI standard persists because a great majority of terminal emulators and command consoles interpret at least a portion of the ANSI standard.\nHistory.\nAlmost all manufacturers of video terminals added vendor-specific escape sequences to perform operations such as placing the cursor at arbitrary positions on the screen. One example is the VT52 terminal, which allowed the cursor to be placed at an x,y location on the screen by sending the character, a character, and then two characters representing numerical values equal to the x,y location plus 32 (thus starting at the ASCII space character and avoiding the control characters). The Hazeltine 1500 had a similar feature, invoked using , and then the X and Y positions separated with a comma. While the two terminals had identical functionality in this regard, different control sequences had to be used to invoke them.\nAs these sequences were different for different terminals, elaborate libraries such as termcap (\"terminal capabilities\") and utilities such as tput had to be created so programs could use the same API to work with any terminal. In addition, many of these terminals required sending numbers (such as row and column) as the binary values of the characters; for some programming languages, and for systems that did not use ASCII internally, it was often difficult to turn a number into the correct character.\nThe ANSI standard attempted to address these problems by making a command set that all terminals would use and requiring all numeric information to be transmitted as ASCII numbers. The first standard in the series was ECMA-48, adopted in 1976. It was a continuation of a series of character coding standards, the first one being ECMA-6 from 1965, a 7-bit standard from which ISO 646 originates. The name \"ANSI escape sequence\" dates from 1979 when ANSI adopted ANSI X3.64. The ANSI X3L2 committee collaborated with the ECMA committee TC 1 to produce nearly identical standards. These two standards were merged into an international standard, ISO 6429. In 1994, ANSI withdrew its standard in favor of the international standard.\nThe first popular video terminal to support these sequences was the Digital VT100, introduced in 1978. This model was very successful in the market, which sparked a variety of VT100 clones, among the earliest and most popular of which was the much more affordable Zenith Z-19 in 1979. Others included the Qume QVT-108, Televideo TVI-970, Wyse WY-99GT as well as optional \"VT100\" or \"VT103\" or \"ANSI\" modes with varying degrees of compatibility on many other brands. The popularity of these gradually led to more and more software (especially bulletin board systems and other online services) assuming the escape sequences worked, leading to almost all new terminals and emulator programs supporting them.\nIn 1981, ANSI X3.64 was adopted for use in the US government by FIPS publication 86. Later, the US government stopped duplicating industry standards, so FIPS pub. 86 was withdrawn.\nECMA-48 has been updated several times and is currently at its 5th edition, from 1991. It is also adopted by ISO and IEC as standard ISO/IEC 6429. A version is adopted as a Japanese Industrial Standard, as JIS X 0211.\nRelated standards include ITU T.61, the Teletex standard, and the ISO/IEC 8613, the Open Document Architecture standard (mainly ISO/IEC 8613-6 or ITU T.416). The two systems share many escape codes with the ANSI system, with extensions that are not necessarily meaningful to computer terminals. Both systems quickly fell into disuse, but ECMA-48 does mark the extensions used in them as reserved.\nPlatform support.\nIn the early 1980s, large amounts of software directly used these sequences to update screen displays. This included everything on VMS (which assumed DEC terminals), most software designed to be portable on CP/M home computers, and even lots of Unix software as it was easier to use than the termcap libraries, such as the shell script examples below in this article.\nTerminal emulators for communicating with remote machines almost always implement ANSI escape codes. This includes anything written to communicate with bulletin-board systems on home and personal computers. On Unix terminal emulators such as xterm also can communicate with software running on the same machine, and thus software running in X11 under a terminal emulator could assume the ability to write these sequences.\nAs computers got more powerful even built-in displays started supporting them, allowing software to be portable between CP/M systems. There were attempts to extend the escape sequences to support printers and as an early PDF-like document storage format, the Open Document Architecture.\nDOS and Windows.\nThe IBM PC, introduced in 1981, did not support these or any other escape sequences for updating the screen. Only a few control characters (BEL, CR, LF, BS) were interpreted by the underlying BIOS. Any display effects had to be done with BIOS calls, which were notoriously slow, or by directly manipulating the IBM PC hardware. This made any interesting software non-portable and led to the need to duplicate details of the display hardware in PC Clones.\nDOS version 2.0 included an optional device driver named ANSI.SYS. Poor performance, and the fact that it was not installed by default, meant software rarely (if ever) took advantage of it.\nThe Windows Console did not support ANSI escape sequences, nor did Microsoft provide any method to enable them. Some replacements such as JP Software's TCC (formerly 4NT), Michael J. Mefford's ANSI.COM, Jason Hood's ANSICON and Maximus5's ConEmu enabled ANSI escape sequences. Software such as the Python colorama package or Cygwin modified text in-process as it was sent to the console, extracting the ANSI Escape sequences and emulating them with Windows calls.\nIn 2016, Microsoft released the Windows 10 version 1511 update which unexpectedly implemented support for ANSI escape sequences, over three decades after the debut of Windows. This was done alongside Windows Subsystem for Linux, apparently to allow Unix-like terminal-based software to use the Windows Console. Windows PowerShell 5.1 enabled this by default, and PowerShell 6 made it possible to embed the necessary ESC character into a string with . \nWindows Terminal, introduced in 2019, supports the sequences by default. Since Windows 11 22H2 and Windows Terminal 1.15, Windows Terminal replaces Windows Console as the default.\nC0 control codes.\nAlmost all users assume some functions of some single-byte characters. Initially defined as part of ASCII, the default C0 control code set is now defined in ISO 6429 (ECMA-48), making it part of the same standard as the C1 set invoked by the ANSI escape sequences (although ISO 2022 allows the ISO 6429 C0 set to be used without the ISO 6429 C1 set, and \"vice versa\", provided that 0x1B is always ESC). This is used to shorten the amount of data transmitted, or to perform some functions that are unavailable from escape sequences:\nEscape sequences vary in length. The general format for an ANSI-compliant escape sequence is defined by ANSI X3.41 (equivalent to ECMA-35 or ISO/IEC 2022). The escape sequences consist only of bytes in the range 0x20\u20140x7F (all the non-control ASCII characters), and can be parsed without looking ahead. The behavior when a control character, a byte with the high bit set, or a byte that is not part of any valid sequence, is encountered before the end is undefined.\nFe Escape sequences.\nIf the is followed by a byte in the range 0x40 to 0x5F, the escape sequence is of type . Its interpretation is delegated to the applicable C1 control code standard. Accordingly, all escape sequences corresponding to C1 control codes from ANSI X3.64 / ECMA-48 follow this format.\nThe standard says that, in 8-bit environments, the control functions corresponding to type escape sequences (those from the set of C1 control codes) can be represented as single bytes in the 0x80\u20130x9F range. This is possible in character encodings conforming to the provisions for an 8-bit code made in ISO 2022, such as the ISO 8859 series. However, in character encodings used on modern devices such as UTF-8 or CP-1252, those codes are often used for other purposes, so only the 2-byte sequence is typically used. In the case of UTF-8, representing a C1 control code via the C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement block results in a different two-byte code (e.g. 0xC2,0x8E for U+008E), but no space is saved this way.\nControl Sequence Introducer commands.\nFor Control Sequence Introducer, or CSI, commands, the (written as , or in several programming languages) is followed by any number (including none) of \"parameter bytes\" in the range 0x30\u20130x3F (ASCII codice_1), then by any number of \"intermediate bytes\" in the range 0x20\u20130x2F (ASCII space and ), then finally by a single \"final byte\" in the range 0x40\u20130x7E (ASCII codice_2 to codice_3 are the same as the ANSI output sequences. The codice_4 is normally omitted if no modifier keys are pressed, but most implementations always emit the codice_4 for . (draft section)\nXterm has a comprehensive documentation page on the various function-key and mouse input sequence schemes from DEC's VT terminals and various other terminals it emulates. Thomas Dickey has added a lot of support to it over time; he also maintains a list of default keys used by other terminal emulators for comparison.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is most famous for starring on the CBS radio series \"Dr. Christian\" from 1937\u20131954, which later inspired a TV series with the same name from 1956 to 1957. He also co-starred with Shirley Temple in the film \"Heidi\" (1937). When asked how to pronounce his name, he told \"The Literary Digest\", \"in English \"her'sholt\"; in Danish, \"hairs'hult\".\" From 1924 to 1955, he had 140 motion picture credits: 75 silent film and 65 \"talkies\"; he directed four.\nEarly life.\nHersholt was born Jean Pierre Carl Buron on 12 July 1886 in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. He claimed to have been born into a family of actors, but in reality, both of his parents, Henri Pierre Buron and Clara (n\u00e9e Petersen), were hairdressers.\nHenri was the son of a French Roman Catholic father and a Danish Protestant mother, while Clara was the daughter of a Danish Protestant father and a Danish Jewish mother. Initially, Henri worked as a hairdresser but later became a cigar and wine merchant/vendor. Hersholt appeared in two of the first short films of the Danish film studio Nordisk Film in 1906, but did not find much success in his early years in Denmark. Hersholt emigrated to the United States in 1913 and spent the remainder of his acting career in America.\nCareer.\nHersholt is best remembered for his roles in two iconic films. In 1924, he played Marcus Schouler in the silent film classic \"Greed\" directed by Erich von Stroheim. A decade later, he co-starred with world-famous child actress Shirley Temple as her beloved grandfather living in the remote Alps in the 1937 film version of the classic 1880 children's book, \"Heidi\", written by Swiss author Johanna Spyri. Throughout his extensive film career, he portrayed a wide range of characters, from villains in early silent films to supporting roles where his gentle Danish language accent and pleasant voice made him well-suited to portray a succession of benevolent fathers, doctors, professors, and European noblemen. Hersholt's final on-screen appearance was in the 1955 movie \"Run for Cover\".\nIn the 1936 movie \"The Country Doctor\", starring the famous Dionne quintuplets, Hersholt portrayed Dr. John Luke, a character based on Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe, the Canadian obstetrician who delivered and cared for the Dionne quintuplets. Two sequels followed the movie. Hersholt wanted to portray the role on radio but could not obtain the rights. He chose to create his own doctor character for radio. Since he was a fan of fairy tale anthology author Hans Christian Andersen, he borrowed that name for his character portrayal. This character, \"Dr. Paul Christian,\" was a philosophical doctor who practiced in the typical Midwestern town of River's End. He received assistance from Nurse Judy Price and occasionally from others. On 7 November 1937, \"Dr. Christian\" debuted on the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio network as part of the 'Vaseline Program' opening with the theme music, \"Rainbow on the River.\"\nThe small-town physician's good humor, innate common sense, and scientific training helped drive off a series of villainous types attempting to disrupt the peaceful lifestyle of River's End. The radio series, produced by Dorothy McCann, became a popular and long-running hit. It aired on the CBS network for 17 years until 6 January 1954. Hersholt was so strongly associated with the role that he received mail asking for real-life medical advice. The Dr. Christian series spawned several spin-offs, making it one of the earliest media franchises. For example, Hersholt co-wrote a Dr. Christian novel and starred in a series of six family feature films as Dr. Christian in a franchise spanning two years, from 1939 to 1941. An example of one of these films is \"Dr. Christian Meets the Women\" released in 1940.\nIn 1956, two years after the long-running radio program concluded, the character Dr. Christian made the transition to television and its unique programming style. The script for this new television program was written by a young Gene Roddenberry, who would later become famous for creating the original TV series \" in 1966. This led to the renowned science fiction franchise over the next few decades. The new 'Dr. Christian' TV show differed from the radio series by introducing a new, younger character portrayed by Macdonald Carey as the elder Christian's nephew, \"Dr. Mark Christian\". The show was syndicated through CBS and its production company, Ziv Television, and ran for two seasons from 1956-1957. It was mostly broadcast at non-traditional times on local stations nationwide, after Jean Hersholt's death in early 1956.\nFrom the late 1930s through the mid-1950s, Neil Reagan, the brother of actor and future U.S. president Ronald Reagan, worked as a traveling industry spokesman for the General Electric Company. Additionally, Neil directed the earlier CBS radio series \"Dr. Christian\", with Jean Hersholt.\nIn 1939, Hersholt broadened his social interests and played a critical role in establishing the Motion Picture Relief Fund, now known as the Motion Picture and Television Fund. This fund provides medical care and support for Hollywood industry employees at various levels, offering assistance when experiencing difficulties due to illness, old age, or other challenges. This occurred just four years after the establishment of America's \"social safety net\" with the passage of Social Security old age pension system by the Roosevelt administration. The fund Hersholt supported was used to establish the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. After his death in 1956, his philanthropic endeavors led to the establishment of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. This honorary Academy Award, also known as the \"Oscar,\" is presented to an \"individual in the motion picture industry whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry.\" The fund was later expanded to include those working in the television field.\nAs president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Hersholt was actively involved in various activities to promote and preserve American cinema. On March 20, 1948, during the 20th anniversary of the academy's founding, he presented special awards to several pioneers of the American motion pictures/film industry. The recipients included Colonel William N. Selig, Albert E. Smith, George K. Spoor, and Thomas Armat. These individuals were often referred to as \"the Men Who Invented Hollywood\".\nHersholt's extensive collection of books and other materials by the famous Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is now housed in the special collections division of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.. He translated over 160 of Andersen's fairy tales into English. These were published in 1949 in six volumes as \"The Complete Andersen\", this work is \"... rated as \"The\" standard translation, being one of the best\" in English cited by the Hans Christian Andersen Center of the University of Southern Denmark.\nHersholt was appointed a knight of the Danish Order of the Dannebrog and awarded a medal in 1948, partly due to this literary academic endeavor.\nOn August 31, 1952, the accomplished elder Hersholt appeared as the mystery guest on the popular long-running CBS-TV panel/quiz show \"What's My Line?\" less than four years before his death. The show aired from the 1950s and into the 1960s and was hosted by John Charles Daly.\nFamily.\nHersholt married Via Andersen on 11 April 1914. They had one son, Allan Hersholt.\nHe was the paternal half-uncle (by marriage) of actor Leslie Nielsen and former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Erik Nielsen.\nDeath.\nHersholt died of cancer in Hollywood on the night of 2 June 1956. He is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. His grave is marked with a statue of Klods-Hans (English: Clumsy Hans), a Hans Christian Andersen character who left home to find his way in the world \u2014 much as Hersholt himself had done.\nHonors and awards.\nHersholt was honored with honorary Academy Awards for his services to the industry in 1940, 1949, and 1950. In his honor, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award was named by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He is one of only 11 people with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. One is located at 6501 Hollywood Boulevard for his work in motion pictures, and another one is located at 6701 Hollywood Boulevard for his work in radio.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In general, the silver liang weighed around . The most common government measurement was the \"Kuping\" () liang, weighing . A common commercial weight, the \"Caoping\" () liang weighed of marginally less pure silver.\nImperial China.\nTraditional Chinese silver sycees and other currencies of fine metals were not denominated or made by a central mint and their value was determined by their weight in liangs. They were made by individual silversmiths for local exchange, and as such the shape and amount of extra detail on each ingot were highly variable; square and oval shapes were common but \"boat\", flower, tortoise and others are known. The liang was still used in Qing dynasty coinage as the basis of the silver currency and sycee remained in use until the end of the dynasty in 1911. Common weights were 50, 10, 5 and one liang. Before the year 1840 the government of the Qing dynasty had set the official exchange rate between silver sycees and copper-alloy cash coins was set at 1,000 \"w\u00e9n\" for 1 liang of silver before 1820, but after the year 1840 this official exchange rate was double to 2,000 \"w\u00e9n\" to 1 liang.\nDuring the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor, the government of the Qing dynasty was forced to re-introduce paper money, among the paper money it produced were the Hubu Guanpiao (\u6236\u90e8\u5b98\u7968) silver notes that were denominated in liangs.\nThe forced opening of China during the Qing dynasty created a number of treaty ports alongside the China's main waterways and its coastal areas, these treaty ports would fundamentally change both the monetary system of China as well as its banking system, these changes were introduced by the establishment of European and American merchant houses and later banks that would engage in the Chinese money exchange and trade finance.\nBetween the years 1840 and 1900, 1 market liang was worth 1.38 Spanish dollars.\nVarious Western banking companies, the largest of which were the HSBC, and later Japanese banking companies started to begin to accept deposits. They would issue banknotes which were convertible into silver; these banknotes were popularized among the Chinese public that resided in the treaty ports.\nAn important development during this era was the establishment of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service. This agency was placed in charge of collecting transit taxes for traded goods that were shipped both in and out of the Chinese Empire, these rules and regulations were all stipulated in various trade treaties that were imposed on the Qing by the Western colonial powers. Because these changes were implemented during the height of the Taiping Rebellion, the Western powers had managed to take over the complete administration of the Qing's maritime customs from the imperial Chinese governmental bureaucracy.\nThe Imperial Maritime Customs Service developed the Haikwan liang (\u6d77\u95dc\u5169), this new form of measurement was an abstract unit of silver liang that would become the nationwide standard unit of account in silver for any form of Customs tax. The Haikwan liang was preferred over the Kuping liang (\u5eab\u5e73\u5169) by many merchants across China, this was because the units of the Kuping tliang varied often to the advantage of imperial tax collectors, this form of corruption was an extra source of income for government bureaucrats at the expense of traders. The Haikwan liang unit was completely uniform, it was very carefully defined, and its creation had been negotiated among the various colonial powers and the government of the Qing dynasty. The Haikwan liang was on average 5% to 10% larger than the various local liang units that had existed in China, this was done as it deliberately excluded any form of extra surcharges which were embedded in the other units of the silver liang that existed as a form of intermediary income for local government tax collection, these surcharges were added to local liangs as a form of corruption and these taxes never reached the imperial government under the traditional fiscal regime.\nNear the end of the Qing dynasty, one (sycee, or ) was about 50 liangs.\nConversion rates in imperial China.\nThe local liang took precedence over any central measure. Thus, the Canton liang weighed , the Convention or Shanghai liang was , and the \"Haiguan\" () liang . The conversion rates between various common liangs were well known.\nRepublic of China.\nIn 1933, the Republic of China abolished the liang and completely replaced it with the yuan in a process known as the \"fei liang gai yuan\" (). During this time the Republican government cleared all banknotes denominated in the liang currency, making all bills which used this currency unit obsolete.\nPurchasing power.\nModern studies suggest that, on purchasing power parity basis, one liang of silver was worth about 4,130 yuan RMB in the early Tang dynasty, 2,065 yuan RMB in the late Tang dynasty, and 660.8 yuan RMB in the mid Ming dynasty. As of \u00a02024[ [update]], the price of silver is about 254 yuan RMB/liang of 50\u00a0g.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

Durham left the group in mid-1968 to pursue her solo career. From 1993, she began to make sporadic recordings and performances with the Seekers, though she remained primarily a solo performer. On 1 July 2015, during the annual Victoria Day celebrations, she was named Victorian of the Year for her services to music and a range of charities.\nEarly life.\nDurham was born Judith Mavis Cock on 3 July 1943 in Essendon, Victoria, to William Alexander Cock, a navigator and World War II pathfinder, and his wife, Hazel (\"n\u00e9e\" Durham). From her birth until 1949, she lived on Mount Alexander Road, Essendon. She spent summer holidays at her family's weatherboard house (which since has been demolished) on the west side of Durham Place in Rosebud.\nHer father accepted work in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1949. From early 1950, the family lived in Taroona, a suburb of Hobart, where Durham attended the Fahan School before moving back to Melbourne, residing in Georgian Court, Balwyn, in 1956. She was educated at Ruyton Girls' School in Kew and then enrolled at RMIT.\nDurham at first planned to be a pianist and gained the qualification of Associate in Music, Australia (AMusA), in classical piano at the University of Melbourne Conservatorium. She had some professional engagements playing piano, had classical vocal training as a soprano, and performed blues, gospel, and jazz pieces. Her singing career began one night at the age of 18 when she asked Nicholas Ribush, leader of the Melbourne University Jazz Band, at the Memphis Jazz Club in Malvern, whether she could sing with the band. In 1963, she began performing at the same club with Frank Traynor's Jazz Preachers, using her mother's maiden name of Durham. In that year she also recorded her first EP, \"Judy Durham\", with Frank Traynor's Jazz Preachers for W&amp;G Records.\nThe Seekers.\nThe Seekers consisted of Durham, Athol Guy, Bruce Woodley and Keith Potger, an ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corp.) radio producer. Through Potger's position the three were able to make a demo tape in their spare time. This was given to W&amp;G Records, which wanted another sample of Durham's voice before agreeing to record a Jazz Preachers' album. W&amp;G instead signed the Seekers for an album, \"Introducing the Seekers\", in 1963. Durham, however, recorded two other songs with the Jazz Preachers, \"Muddy Water\" (which appeared on their album \"Jazz from the Pulpit\") and \"Trombone Frankie\" (an adapted version of Bessie Smith's \"Trombone Cholly\").\nIn early 1964, the Seekers sailed to the United Kingdom on SS \"Fairsky\" on which the group provided the musical entertainment. Originally, they had planned to return after 10 weeks, but they received a steady stream of bookings through the Grade Agency because they had sent the agency a copy of their first album. On 4 November 1964 at EMI's Abbey Road Studios, the Seekers recorded \"I'll Never Find Another You\", written and produced by Tom Springfield. In February 1965, the song reached number one in the UK and Australia. The group had further Top 10 hits with \"A World of Our Own\", \"Morningtown Ride\" and \"Someday, One Day\". \"Georgy Girl\" reached number two (\"Billboard\" chart) and number one (\"Cashbox\" chart) in the United States. \"The Carnival Is Over\" is still one of the top 50 best-selling singles in the UK.\nOn 12 March 1967, the Seekers set an official all-time Australian record when more than 200,000 people (nearly one tenth of the city's entire population at that time) flocked to their performance at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne. Their TV special \"The Seekers Down Under\" scored the biggest TV audience ever (with a 67 rating), and early in 1968 they were all awarded the nation's top honour as \"Australians of the Year 1967\". On a tour of New Zealand in February 1968, Durham advised the group that she was leaving the Seekers to pursue a solo career. In a 2016 interview on ABC\u2019s \"One Plus One\", she explained that she also wished to marry before the age of 25 and anticipated that marriage and family responsibilities would limit her ability to continue performing. This, along with her desire to pursue her passion of jazz and gospel music, led her to decide to go solo. Their last concert before Durham left the group was on a live BBC production on 7 July when they performed many of their hits.\nSolo career.\nDurham returned to Australia in August 1968 and her first solo television special, \"An Evening with Judith Durham\", screened on the Nine Network in September. During her solo career, she released albums titled \"For Christmas with Love\", \"Gift of Song\" and \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\". In 1970, she made the television special \"Meet Judith Durham\" in London, ending with her rendition of \"When You Come to the End of a Perfect Day\" by Carrie Jacobs-Bond.\nIn 1975, Durham guest starred in \"The Golden Girl\", an episode of the Australian television series \"Cash and Company.\" Along with husband Ron Edgeworth on piano, she performed six songs; \"Oh Susanna\", \"When Starlight Fades\", \"Maggie Mae\", \"Rock of Ages\", \"There's No Place Like Home\" and \"The Lord Is My Shepherd\".\nDurham staged a series of concerts at The Troubadour, Melbourne, in 1987 with Edgeworth, performing originals the two had written. They returned the following year.\nIn January 1992, Durham released \"Australia Land of Today\" which peaked at number 124 on the ARIA charts.\"\nIn 2003, Durham toured the UK in \"The Diamond Tour\" celebrating her 60th birthday. The tour included the Royal Festival Hall and a CD and DVD of the concert was issued.\nIn 2006, Durham started modernising the music and phrases of \"Advance Australia Fair\", the Australian national anthem; the Aboriginal singer-songwriter Kutcha Edwards also contributed lyrics. Durham first performed it in May 2009 at Federation Hall, St Kilda Road. It was released as a CD single.\nDurham recorded \"The Australian Cities Suite\" album with all proceeds to go to the charitable sector. The album was released in October 2008. This project was to benefit charities working with the Lord Mayor's Charitable Fund, including Orchestra Victoria and the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Australia (Durham was national patron).\nOn 13 February 2009, Durham made a surprise return to the Sydney Myer Music Bowl when she performed the closing number at the \"RocKwiz Salutes the Bowl \u2013 Sidney Myer Music Bowl 50th Anniversary\" with \"The Carnival Is Over\". On 23 May 2009, she performed a one-hour \"a cappella\" concert in Melbourne as a launch for her album \"Up Close and Personal\".\nIn October 2011, Durham signed an exclusive international deal with Decca Records. George Ash, president of Universal Music Australasia, said that \"It is an honour to have Judith Durham join Decca's wonderful roster of artists. When you think of the legends that have graced the Decca Records catalogue it is the perfect home to welcome Judith to, and we couldn't be more excited to work with Judith on not only her new recordings but her incredible catalogue as well.\"\nIn June 2018, to celebrate Durham's 75th birthday, a collection of 14 previously unreleased songs was released on the album \"So Much More\".\nPersonal life.\nOn 21 November 1969, Durham married her musical director, British pianist Ron Edgeworth, at Scots' Church, Melbourne. Edgeworth had been with a group, the Trebletones, on the same tour.\nDurham and her husband were vegetarian; she became a vegan after 2015. She also abstained from alcohol and caffeine.\nThey felt satisfied with each other and did not pursue having children. However, in a TV Interview of March 2010, she stated: \"But, if children had come along, we always said we would have had them.\" They lived in the UK and Switzerland until the mid-1980s when they bought property in Maleny near Nambour, Queensland. In 1990, Durham, Edgeworth and their tour manager, Peter Summers, were involved in a car accident on the Calder Freeway. The driver of the other car died at the scene and Durham sustained a fractured wrist and leg. The response from her fans led to Durham deciding to get back with the other members of the Seekers for a silver jubilee show in 1993. During this reunion, Edgeworth was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, also known as ALS. While the diagnosis was hard for both of them, and caused him to become disabled, they tried to keep a positive outlook. In March, 2010, Judith remarked: \"Once he realized that death was inevitable for him, his attitude was very positive. (In) that he was looking towards after this life, focusing very strongly on that, as a positive thing. And, that helped me enormously, as I was already going through grief from the time of his diagnosis to a large extent.\" He died from the disease on 10 December 1994 with Durham by his side.\nAfter the death of Edgeworth, Durham underwent worry and dealt with the feelings of grief while trying to cope with his loss. \u201cI used to worry a lot about everything, in those days because I felt I was the doer. Now, I\u2019ve relinquished all responsibility for anything! And, it\u2019s much better. I think everyone should do that in their lives, you know. That\u2019s changed my life. As they say - 'let go and let God'\u2026 And that\u2019s the perfect expression. That\u2019s what I have to do. There is no way around that. The day he doesn\u2019t want me to be doing it I won\u2019t be doing it obviously. But, at the moment, that\u2019s the way I approached just about everything.\u201d\nIn the late 1990s, Durham was stalked by a former president of a Judith Durham fan club, a woman who sent her over 40 doormats as an admonishment for perceived ingratitude, and numerous abusive faxes, one threatening another doormat delivery worth over $45,000. The woman was subsequently prosecuted, and she was later imprisoned for other serial crimes.\nIn 2000, Durham broke her hip and was unable to sing \"The Carnival Is Over\" at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney with the Seekers. However, she sang it from a wheelchair at the 2000 Paralympics shortly thereafter.\nIn May 2013, during the Seekers' golden jubilee tour, Durham suffered a stroke that diminished her ability to read and write both visual language and musical scores. During her convalescence, she made progress to rebuild those skills. Her singing ability was not affected by the stroke.\nReligious faith.\nDurham was a devout Christian who had originally been hesitant about secular music. She frequently sang gospel and jazz songs which reflected this trait. She also followed other teachings that provided a moral and ethical framework for how she lived. In the Salvation Army's \"War Cry\" magazine of 12 November 2016, she revealed more information on her beliefs and spirituality and said that her \"love songs were for the Lord\". The article stated that \"Judith describes herself as a deeply spiritual person with a proud belief in the love of God and Jesus Christ, and feels that many of the songs of her long career reflect that reality. The spirituality of the lyrics crosses over from being not just love songs, but love songs for the Lord - songs like 'I'll Never find Another You', 'Walk with Me' and many others ...\" Other songs that were published on the album \"Up Close and Personal\" with the same purpose included: Calling me Home, Colours of My Life, Nobody but You, Let me Find Love, Land of Peace (The Original version of Carry Me), There He Is, Etc. In the same article, she commented after her New Zealand Tour: \"On my recent tour of New Zealand, there wasn't a moment on stage when I wasn't focused on the spiritual context of these songs.\"\nOn 22 December 2016, Durham posted a message on her official Facebook page. It gave an explanation of her concept of God to her followers. Part of it includes: \"When I was just a child, growing up with dear Mum and Dad and sister Beverley, we were wisely taught to say our prayers each night, feeling protected and loved ... I never questioned any of it. For me, to this day, God and the Lord are real and I feel safe and nurtured by that ever-present reality ...\"\nShe also posted: \"A couple of years later, after we moved to Hobart, we started going to 'Sunday School' and\nI learned to sing: 'Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so.' Through the years I have a deeper spiritual understanding. There is a multi cultural, global truth for so many billions of loving souls. We all love the Lord God and God Incarnate according to many different pathways all over the world, and that the spirit of Christmas celebrations always bring that same joyous message. We were taught from our early age to honour our father and mother, and to live in love, peace and humility in the spirit of giving. Let us all be thankful for the food we eat this Christmas and all the blessings showered upon us everyday.\"\nDurham felt that the values that were instilled in her since her youth had been still imprinted in her. She also stated that she had a very wide perception and that she had begun feeling interested in esoteric things.\nHealth and death.\nDurham was born with asthma, (which her mother also had) and at age four caught measles, which left her with a life-long chronic lung disease, bronchiectasis. Along with that, she also had emphysema. As mentioned above, she broke her hip in 2000 and suffered a stroke in 2013.\nDurham died from bronchiectasis at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne on 5 August 2022, at age 79. She was given a state memorial service by the state of Victoria on 6 September 2022 at Hamer Hall. Durham is interred with her husband, Ron Edgeworth, at Springvale Botanical Cemetery, Springvale.\nHonours and awards.\nARIA Music Awards.\nThe ARIA Music Awards are annual ceremonies presented by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) which recognise excellence, innovation and achievement across all genres of the music of Australia.

It was the first high-level programming language to be designed for a computer. Zuse never implemented Plankalk\u00fcl on any of his Z-series machines.\n\"Kalk\u00fcl\" (from Latin \"calculus\") is the German term for a formal system\u2014as in \"Hilbert-Kalk\u00fcl\", the original name for the Hilbert-style deduction system\u2014so \"Plankalk\u00fcl\" refers to a formal system for planning.\nHistory of programming.\nIn the domain of creating computing machines, Zuse was self-taught, and developed them without knowledge about other mechanical computing machines that existed already \u2013 although later on (building the Z3) being inspired by Hilbert's and Ackermann's book on elementary mathematical logic (see Principles of Mathematical Logic). To describe logical circuits, Zuse invented his own diagram and notation system, which he called \"combinatorics of conditionals\" (). After finishing the Z1 in 1938, Zuse discovered that the calculus he had independently devised already existed and was known as propositional calculus.3 What Zuse had in mind, however, needed to be much more powerful (propositional calculus is not Turing-complete and is not able to describe even simple arithmetic calculations). In May 1939, he described his plans for the development of what would become Plankalk\u00fcl. He wrote the following in his notebook:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014Konrad Zuse's notebook3\nWhile working on his doctoral dissertation, Zuse developed the first known formal system of algorithm notation9 capable of handling branches and loops.1856 In 1942 he began writing a chess program in Plankalk\u00fcl. In 1944, Zuse met with the German logician and philosopher Heinrich Scholz, who expressed appreciation for Zuse's utilization of logical calculus. In 1945, Zuse described Plankalk\u00fcl in an unpublished book. The collapse of Nazi Germany, however, prevented him from submitting his manuscript.18\nAt that time the only two working computers in the world were ENIAC and Harvard Mark I, neither of which used a compiler, and ENIAC needed to be reprogrammed for each task by changing how the wires were connected.3\nAlthough most of his computers were destroyed by Allied bombs, Zuse was able to rescue one machine, the Z4, and move it to the Alpine village of Hinterstein8 (part of Bad Hindelang).\nUnable to continue building computers \u2013 which was also forbidden by the Allied Powers \u2013 Zuse devoted his time to the development of a higher-level programming model and language.18 In 1948, he published a paper in the \"Archiv der Mathematik\" and presented at the Annual Meeting of the GAMM.89 His work failed to attract much attention. In a 1957 lecture, Zuse expressed his hope that Plankalk\u00fcl, \"after some time as a Sleeping Beauty, will yet come to life.\"3 He expressed disappointment that the designers of ALGOL 58 never acknowledged the influence of Plankalk\u00fcl on their own work.1815\nPlankalk\u00fcl was republished with commentary in 1972. The first compiler for Plankalk\u00fcl was implemented by Joachim Hohmann in his 1975 dissertation. Other independent implementations followed in 1998 and 2000 at the Free University of Berlin.2\nDescription.\nPlankalk\u00fcl has drawn comparisons to the language APL, and to relational algebra. It includes assignment statements, subroutines, conditional statements, iteration, floating-point arithmetic, arrays, hierarchical record structures, assertions, exception handling, and other advanced features such as goal-directed execution. The Plankalk\u00fcl provides a data structure called \"generalized graph\" (), which can be used to represent geometrical structures.\nMany features of the Plankalk\u00fcl reappear in later programming languages; an exception is its idiosyncratic two-dimensional notation using multiple lines. \nSome features of the Plankalk\u00fcl:217\nData types.\nThe only primitive data type in the Plankalk\u00fcl is a single bit or Boolean ( \u2013 yes-no value in Zuse's terminology). It is denoted by the identifier formula_1. All the further data types are composite, and build up from primitive by means of \"arrays\" and \"records\".679\nSo, a sequence of eight bits (which in modern computing could be regarded as byte) is denoted by formula_2, and Boolean matrix of size formula_3 by formula_4\u00a0 is described by formula_5. There also exists a shortened notation, so one could write formula_6 instead of formula_7.679\nType formula_1 could have two possible values formula_9 and formula_10. So 4-bit sequence could be written like L00L, but in cases where such a sequence represents a number, the programmer could use the decimal representation 9.679\nRecord of two components formula_11 and formula_12 is written as formula_13.679\nType () in Plankalk\u00fcl consists of 3 elements: structured value (), pragmatic meaning () and possible restriction on possible values ().679 User defined types are identified by letter A with number, like formula_14 \u2013 first user defined type.\nExamples.\nZuse used a lot of examples from chess theory:680\nIdentifiers.\nIdentifiers are alphanumeric characters with a number.679 There are the following kinds of identifiers for variables:10\nParticular variable of some kind is identified by number, written under the kind.679 For example:\n formula_15, formula_16, formula_17 etc.\nPrograms and subprograms are marked with a letter P, followed by a program (and optionally a subprogram) number. For example formula_18, formula_19.679\nOutput value of program formula_18 saved there in variable formula_21 is available for other subprograms under the identifier formula_22, and reading value of that variable also means executing related subprogram.680\nAccessing elements by index.\nPlankalk\u00fcl allows access for separate elements of variable by using \"component index\" (). When, for example, program receives input in variable formula_15 of type formula_24 (game state), then formula_25\u00a0\u2014 gives board state, formula_26\u00a0\u2014 piece on square number i, and formula_27 bit number j of that piece.680\nIn modern programming languages, that would be described by notation similar to codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 (although to access a single bit in modern programming languages a bitmask is typically used).\nTwo-dimensional syntax.\nBecause indexes of variables are written vertically, each Plankalk\u00fcl instruction requires multiple rows to write down.\nFirst row contains variable kind, then variable number marked with letter V (), then indexes of variable subcomponents marked with K (), and then () marked with S, which describes variable type. Type is not required, but Zuse notes that this helps with reading and understanding the program.681\nIn the line formula_28 types formula_1 and formula_30 could be shortened to formula_9 and formula_32.681\nExamples:\nIndexes could be not only constants. Variables could be used as indexes for other variables, and that is marked with a line, which shows in which component index would value of variable be used:\nAssignment operation.\nZuse introduced in his calculus an assignment operator, unknown in mathematics before him. He marked it with \"formula_33\", and called it yields-sign (). Use of concept of assignment is one of the key differences between mathematics and computer science.14\nZuse wrote that the expression:\n formula_34\nis analogous to the more traditional mathematical equation:\n formula_35\nThere are claims that Konrad Zuse initially used the glyph as a sign for assignment, and started to use formula_33 under the influence of Heinz Rutishauser.681 Knuth and Pardo believe that Zuse always wrote formula_33, and that was introduced by publishers of \u00ab\u00dcber den allgemeinen Plankalk\u00fcl als Mittel zur Formulierung schematisch-kombinativer Aufgaben\u00bb in 1948.14 In the ALGOL 58 conference in Z\u00fcrich, European participants proposed to use the assignment character introduced by Zuse, but the American delegation insisted on codice_4.681\nThe variable that stores the result of an assignment (l-value) is written to the right side of assignment operator.14 The first assignment to the variable is considered to be a declaration.681\nThe left side of assignment operator is used for an expression (), that defines which value will be assigned to the variable. Expressions could use arithmetic operators, Boolean operators, and comparison operators (formula_38 etc.).682\nThe exponentiation operation is written similarly to the indexing operation - using lines in the two-dimensional notation:45 \nControl flow.\nBoolean values were represented as integers with and . Conditional control flow took the form of a guarded statement , which executed the block if was true. There was also an iteration operator, of the form } which repeats until all guards are false.\nTerminology.\nZuse called a single program a \"Rechenplan\" (\"computation plan\"). He envisioned what he called a \"Planfertigungsger\u00e4t\" (\"plan assembly device\"), which would automatically translate the mathematical formulation of a program into machine-readable punched film stock, something today would be called a translator or compiler.\nExample.\nThe original notation was two-dimensional, i.e. the indentation and thus spatial relation of different terminal symbols mattered in regard to the semantics \"spanning multiple lines\". For a later implementation in the 1990s, a linear notation was developed.\nThe following example defines a function codice_5 (in a linear transcription) that calculates the maximum of three variables:\n P1 max3 (V0[:8.0],V1[:8.0],V2[:8.0]) \u2192 R0[:8.0]\n max(V0[:8.0],V1[:8.0]) \u2192 Z1[:8.0]\n max(Z1[:8.0],V2[:8.0]) \u2192 R0[:8.0]\n END\n P2 max (V0[:8.0],V1[:8.0]) \u2192 R0[:8.0]\n V0[:8.0] \u2192 Z1[:8.0]\n (Z1[:8.0] &lt; V1[:8.0]) \u2192 V1[:8.0] \u2192 Z1[:8.0]\n Z1[:8.0] \u2192 R0[:8.0]\n END\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65946", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65946", "title": "Consumer confidence index", "text": "Economic indicator\nA consumer confidence index (CCI) is an economic indicator published by various organizations in several countries.\nIn simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption. Decreasing consumer confidence implies slowing economic growth, and so consumers are likely to decrease their spending. The idea is that the more confident people feel about the economy and their jobs and incomes, the more likely they are to make purchases. Declining consumer confidence is a sign of slowing economic growth and may indicate that the economy is headed into trouble.\nUsage.\nManufacturers, retailers, banks and the government monitor changes in the CCI in order to factor in the data in their decision-making processes. While index changes of less than 5% are often dismissed as inconsequential, moves of 5% or more often indicate a change in the direction of the economy.\nA month-on-month decreasing trend suggests consumers have a negative outlook on their ability to secure and retain good jobs. Thus, manufacturers may expect consumers to avoid retail purchases, particularly large-ticket items that require financing. Manufacturers may pare down inventories to reduce overhead or delay investing in new projects and facilities. Likewise, banks can anticipate a decrease in lending activity, mortgage applications and credit card use. When faced with a down-trending index, the government has a variety of options, such as issuing a tax rebate or taking other fiscal or monetary action to stimulate the economy.\nConversely, a rising trend in consumer confidence indicates improvements in consumer buying patterns. Manufacturers can increase production and hiring. Banks can expect increased demand for credit. Builders can prepare for a rise in home construction, and government can anticipate improved tax revenues based on the increase in consumer spending.\nConsumer-demand surveys versus consumer-confidence and -sentiment surveys.\nConsumer-demand surveys are interview-based statistical surveys that measure the percentage of households that will buy a car, white goods, PCs, TVs, home furnishings, kitchenware, or toys in, for example, the next three-month period. The surveys provide a percentage of those who will purchase more, less, or the same amount of food and clothing in the next three months than in the corresponding period the year before. If you ask people about their purchasing behavior within the coming six or 12 months, there will be more of those who \"hope to be able to buy\", than if consumers are asked about what they will purchase in the next three months. The shorter the time spans, the closer to actual behavior.\nConsumer confidence and sentiment surveys measure how people are doing financially, how they look at the overall economy of the country or business conditions in the country, if they think that the government is doing a good or a poor job and if people think that it is a good or a bad time to buy a car or to buy or sell a house.\nWhen the business cycle is fairly stable, consumer demand surveys and consumer confidence and sentiment indices will often correlate closely and indicate the same direction of the economy, but in times with a high degree of economic or political uncertainty or during a prolonged crisis, the two types of consumer surveys might differ significantly. In 2011, confidence and sentiment surveys went up from March to April, while consumer demand surveys dropped significantly. In August 2011, the confidence and sentiment surveys dropped significantly and stayed low during September and October, while consumer demand surveys showed resilience, a development confirmed later by official statistics.\nA 2022 study found that the consumer confidence index always plays a positive and statistically significant function in the development of consumption.\nIn Canada.\nThe Conference Board of Canada's index of consumer confidence has been ongoing since 1980. It is constructed from responses to four attitudinal questions posed to a random sample of Canadian households. Those surveyed are asked to give their views about their households' current and expected financial positions and the short-term employment outlook. They are also asked to assess whether now is a good or a bad time to make a major purchase, such as a house, car or other big-ticket items.\nIn Indonesia.\nConsumer Survey-Bank Indonesia (CS-BI) is a monthly survey that has been conducted since October 1999 by Bank Indonesia. The survey represents the consumer confidence about the overall economic condition, general price level, household income, and consumption plans three and six months ahead. Since January 2007, the survey is conducted with approximately 4,600 household respondents (stratified random sampling) in 18 cities: Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Surabaya, Medan, Makassar, Bandar Lampung, Palembang, Banjarmasin, Padang, Pontianak, Samarinda, Manado, Denpasar, Mataram, Pangkal Pinang, Ambon, and Banten. At a significance level of 99%, the survey has a sampling error of 2%. Data canvassing run through interviews by phone and direct visits in particular cities that is based on rotational system. The Balance Score Method (net balance + 100) has been adopted to construct the index, where the index above 100 points indicates optimism (positive responses) and vice versa. The consumer confidence index (CCI), is an average of the current economic condition index (CECI) and consumer expectation index (CEI).\nOther indexes.\nDanareksa conducts a monthly consumer survey to produce the Consumer Confidence Index.\nIn the Republic of Ireland.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, KBC Bank Ireland (formerly IIB Bank) and the Economic and Social Research Institute (a think-tank) have published a monthly consumer sentiment index since January 1996.\nIn the United States.\nIn the United States, The Conference Board, an independent economic research organization, issues monthly measures of consumer confidence based on 5,000 households. Such measurement is indicative of the consumption component level of the gross domestic product. The Federal Reserve looks at the CCI when determining interest rate changes.\nConsumer confidence is defined by The Conference Board as the degree of optimism on the state of the United States economy that consumers are expressing through their activities of savings and spending. Global consumer confidence is not measured. Country-by-country analysis indicates huge variance around the globe. In an interconnected global economy, tracking international consumer confidence is a lead indicator of economic trends.\nThe consumer confidence index started in 1967 and is benchmarked to 1985 = 100. The index is calculated each month on the basis of a household survey of consumers' opinions on current conditions and future expectations of the economy. Opinions on current conditions make up 40% of the index, with expectations of future conditions comprising the remaining 60%. In the glossary on its website, The Conference Board defines the Consumer Confidence Survey as \"a monthly report detailing consumer attitudes and buying intentions, with data available by age, income and region\".\nEach month, The Conference Board surveys 5,000 US households. The survey consists of five questions that ask the respondents' opinions about the following:\nSurvey participants are asked to answer each question as \"positive\", \"negative\" or \"neutral.\" The preliminary results from the consumer confidence survey are released on the last Tuesday of each month at 10am EST.\nOnce the data have been gathered, a proportion known as the \"relative value\" is calculated for each question separately. Each question's positive responses are divided by the sum of its positive and negative responses. The relative value for each question is then compared against each relative value from 1985. This comparison of the relative values results in an \"index value\" for each question.\nThe index values for all five questions are then averaged together to form the consumer confidence index; the average of index values for questions one and three form the present situation index, and the average of index values for questions two, four and five form the expectations index. The data are calculated for the United States as a whole and for each of the country's nine census regions.\nOther indexes.\nIn addition to the Conference Board's CCI, other survey-based indices attempt to track consumer confidence in the United States:\nGiven the potential for sampling biases of individual survey reports, researchers and investors try sometimes to average the values of different index reports into a single aggregated measure of consumer confidence.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The linkage is also called an SS-bond or sometimes a disulfide bridge and usually derived from two thiol groups.\nIn inorganic chemistry, the anion appears in a few rare minerals, but the functional group has tremendous importance in biochemistry. Disulfide bridges formed between thiol groups in two cysteine residues are an important component of the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins.\nCompounds of the form are usually called \"persulfides\" instead.\nOrganic disulfides.\nStructure.\nDisulfides have a C\u2013S\u2013S\u2013C dihedral angle approaching 90\u00b0. The S\u2013S bond length is 2.03 \u00c5 in diphenyl disulfide, similar to that in elemental sulfur.\nDisulfides are usually symmetric but they can also be unsymmetric. Symmetrical disulfides are compounds of the formula . Most disulfides encountered in organosulfur chemistry are symmetrical disulfides. Unsymmetrical disulfides (also called heterodisulfides or mixed disulfides) are compounds of the formula . Unsymmetrical disulfide are less common in organic chemistry, but many disulfides in nature are unsymmetrical. \nCyclic disulfides.\nDisulfides can be components of rings. Lipoic acid, a 1,2-dithiolane is a major example. Rings with more than one disulfide usually tend to polymerize.\nOther specialized organic disulfides.\nThiuram disulfides, with the formula (R2NCSS)2, are disulfides but they behave distinctly because of the thiocarbonyl group.\nProperties.\nDisulfide bonds are strong, with a typical bond dissociation energy of 60\u00a0kcal/mol (251\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121). However, being about 40% weaker than and bonds, the disulfide bond is often the \"weak link\" in many molecules. Furthermore, reflecting the polarizability of divalent sulfur, the bond is susceptible to scission by polar reagents, both electrophiles and especially nucleophiles (Nu): &lt;chem display=block&gt;RS-SR + Nu- -&gt; RS-Nu + RS-&lt;/chem&gt; \nThe disulfide bond is about 2.05\u00a0\u00c5 in length, about 0.5\u00a0\u00c5 longer than a bond. Rotation about the axis is subject to a low barrier. Disulfides show a distinct preference for dihedral angles approaching 90\u00b0. When the angle approaches 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0, then the disulfide is a significantly better oxidant.\nDisulfides where the two R groups are the same are called symmetric, examples being diphenyl disulfide and dimethyl disulfide. When the two R groups are not identical, the compound is said to be an asymmetric or mixed disulfide.\nAlthough the hydrogenation of disulfides is usually not practical, the equilibrium constant for the reaction provides a measure of the standard redox potential for disulfides:\n&lt;chem&gt;RSSR + H2 -&gt; 2 RSH&lt;/chem&gt;\nThis value is about \u2212250\u00a0mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode (pH\u00a0=\u00a07). By comparison, the standard reduction potential for ferrodoxins is about \u2212430\u00a0mV.\nSynthesis.\nDisulfide bonds are usually formed from the oxidation of thiol () groups, especially in biological contexts. The transformation is depicted as follows:\n&lt;chem&gt;2 RSH &lt;=&gt; RS-SR + 2 H+ + 2 e-&lt;/chem&gt;\nA variety of oxidants participate in this reaction including oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Such reactions are thought to proceed via sulfenic acid intermediates. In the laboratory, iodine in the presence of base is commonly employed to oxidize thiols to disulfides. Several metals, such as copper(II) and iron(III) complexes affect this reaction. Alternatively, disulfide bonds in proteins often formed by thiol-disulfide exchange:\n &lt;chem&gt;RS-SR + R'SH &lt;=&gt; R'S-SR + RSH&lt;/chem&gt;\nSuch reactions are mediated by enzymes in some cases and in other cases are under equilibrium control, especially in the presence of a catalytic amount of base.\nThe alkylation of alkali metal di- and polysulfides gives disulfides. \"Thiokol\" polymers arise when sodium polysulfide is treated with an alkyl dihalide. In the converse reaction, carbanionic reagents react with elemental sulfur to afford mixtures of the thioether, disulfide, and higher polysulfides. These reactions are often unselective but can be optimized for specific applications.\nSynthesis of unsymmetrical disulfides (heterodisulfides).\nMany specialized methods have been developed for forming unsymmetrical disulfides. Reagents that deliver the equivalent of \"\" react with thiols to give asymmetrical disulfides:\n &lt;chem&gt;RSH + R'SNR\"_2 -&gt; RS-SR' + HNR\"_2&lt;/chem&gt;\nwhere is the phthalimido group.\nBunte salts, derivatives of the type are also used to generate unsymmetrical disulfides:\n&lt;chem&gt;Na[O3S2R] + NaSR' -&gt; RSSR' + Na2SO3&lt;/chem&gt;\nReactions.\nThe most important aspect of disulfide bonds is their scission, as the bond is usually the weakest bond in an organic molecule (missing citation). Many specialized organic reactions have been developed to cleave the bond. \nA variety of reductants reduce disulfides to thiols. Hydride agents are typical reagents, and a common laboratory demonstration \"uncooks\" eggs with sodium borohydride. Alkali metals effect the same reaction more aggressively: &lt;chem display=block&gt;RS-SR + 2 Na -&gt; 2 NaSR,&lt;/chem&gt; followed by protonation of the resulting metal thiolate: &lt;chem display=block&gt;NaSR + HCl -&gt; HSR + NaCl&lt;/chem&gt; \nIn biochemistry labwork, thiols such as \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME) or dithiothreitol (DTT) serve as reductants through thiol-disulfide exchange. The thiol reagents are used in excess to drive the equilibrium to the right: &lt;chem display=block&gt;RS-SR + 2 HOCH2CH2SH &lt;=&gt; HOCH2CH2S-SCH2CH2OH + 2 RSH&lt;/chem&gt;\nThe reductant tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) is useful, beside being odorless compared to \u03b2-ME and DTT, because it is selective, working at both alkaline and acidic conditions (unlike DTT), is more hydrophilic and more resistant to oxidation in air. Furthermore, it is often not needed to remove TCEP before modification of protein thiols.\nIn Zincke cleavage, halogens oxidize disulfides to a sulfenyl halide:&lt;chem display=block&gt;ArSSAr + Cl2 -&gt; 2 ArSCl&lt;/chem&gt;\nMore unusually, oxidation of disulfides gives first thiosulfinates and then thiosulfonates:\nRSSR\u00a0+ [O]\u00a0\u2192 RS(=O)SR\nRS(=O)SR\u00a0+ [O]\u00a0\u2192 RS(=O)2SR\nThiol-disulfide exchange.\nIn thiol\u2013disulfide exchange, a thiolate group displaces one sulfur atom in a disulfide bond . The original disulfide bond is broken, and its other sulfur atom is released as a new thiolate, carrying away the negative charge. Meanwhile, a new disulfide bond forms between the attacking thiolate and the original sulfur atom.\nThiolates, not thiols, attack disulfide bonds. Hence, thiol\u2013disulfide exchange is inhibited at low pH (typically, below 8) where the protonated thiol form is favored relative to the deprotonated thiolate form. (The p\"K\"a of a typical thiol group is roughly 8.3, but can vary due to its environment.)\nThiol\u2013disulfide exchange is the principal reaction by which disulfide bonds are formed and rearranged in a protein. The rearrangement of disulfide bonds within a protein generally occurs via intra-protein thiol\u2013disulfide exchange reactions; a thiolate group of a cysteine residue attacks one of the protein's own disulfide bonds. This process of disulfide rearrangement (known as \"disulfide shuffling\") does not change the number of disulfide bonds within a protein, merely their location (i.e., which cysteines are bonded). Disulfide reshuffling is generally much faster than oxidation/reduction reactions, which change the number of disulfide bonds within a protein. The oxidation and reduction of protein disulfide bonds \"in vitro\" also generally occurs via thiol\u2013disulfide exchange reactions. Typically, the thiolate of a redox reagent such as glutathione, dithiothreitol attacks the disulfide bond on a protein forming a \"mixed disulfide bond\" between the protein and the reagent. This mixed disulfide bond when attacked by another thiolate from the reagent, leaves the cysteine oxidized. In effect, the disulfide bond is transferred from the protein to the reagent in two steps, both thiol\u2013disulfide exchange reactions.\nThe \"in vivo\" oxidation and reduction of protein disulfide bonds by thiol\u2013disulfide exchange is facilitated by a protein called thioredoxin. This small protein, essential in all known organisms, contains two cysteine amino acid residues in a vicinal arrangement (i.e., next to each other), which allows it to form an internal disulfide bond, or disulfide bonds with other proteins. As such, it can be used as a repository of reduced or oxidized disulfide bond moieties.\nNomenclature and misnomers.\nThiosulfoxides are isomeric with disulfides, having the second sulfur branching from the first and not partaking in a continuous chain, i.e. &gt;S=S rather than \u2212S\u2212S\u2212.\nCompounds with three sulfur atoms, such as CH3S\u2212S\u2212SCH3, are called trisulfides. More extended species are well known, especially in rings.\nDisulfide is also used to refer to compounds that contain two sulfide (S2\u2212) centers. The compound carbon disulfide, CS2 is described with the structural formula i.e. S=C=S. This molecule is not a disulfide in the sense that it lacks a S-S bond. Similarly, molybdenum disulfide, MoS2, is not a disulfide in the sense again that its sulfur atoms are not linked.\nDisulfide bonds are analogous but more common than related peroxide, thioselenide, and diselenide bonds. Intermediate compounds of these also exist, for example thioperoxides such as hydrogen thioperoxide, have the formula R1OSR2 (equivalently R2SOR1). These are isomeric to sulfoxides in a similar manner to the above; i.e. &gt;S=O rather than \u2212S\u2212O\u2212.\nOccurrence in biology.\nOccurrence in proteins.\nDisulfide bonds can be formed under oxidising conditions and play an important role in the folding and stability of some proteins, usually proteins secreted to the extracellular medium. Since most cellular compartments are reducing environments, in general, disulfide bonds are unstable in the cytosol, with some exceptions as noted below, unless a sulfhydryl oxidase is present.\nDisulfide bonds in proteins are formed between the thiol groups of cysteine residues by the process of oxidative folding. The other sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine, cannot form disulfide bonds. A disulfide bond is typically denoted by hyphenating the abbreviations for cysteine, e.g., when referring to ribonuclease A the \"Cys26\u2013Cys84 disulfide bond\", or the \"26\u201384 disulfide bond\", or most simply as \"C26\u2013C84\" where the disulfide bond is understood and does not need to be mentioned. The prototype of a protein disulfide bond is the two-amino-acid peptide cystine, which is composed of two cysteine amino acids joined by a disulfide bond. The structure of a disulfide bond can be described by its \"\u03c7\"ss dihedral angle between the C\u03b2\u2212S\u03b3\u2212S\u03b3\u2212C\u03b2 atoms, which is usually close to \u00b190\u00b0.\nThe disulfide bond stabilizes the folded form of a protein in several ways:\nA \"disulfide species\" is a particular pairing of cysteines in a disulfide-bonded protein and is usually depicted by listing the disulfide bonds in parentheses, e.g., the \"(26\u201384, 58\u2013110) disulfide species\". A \"disulfide ensemble\" is a grouping of all disulfide species with the same number of disulfide bonds, and is usually denoted as the 1S ensemble, the 2S ensemble, etc. for disulfide species having one, two, etc. disulfide bonds. Thus, the (26\u201384) disulfide species belongs to the 1S ensemble, whereas the (26\u201384, 58\u2013110) species belongs to the 2S ensemble. The single species with no disulfide bonds is usually denoted as R for \"fully reduced\". Under typical conditions, disulfide reshuffling is much faster than the formation of new disulfide bonds or their reduction; hence, the disulfide species within an ensemble equilibrate more quickly than between ensembles.\nThe native form of a protein is usually a single disulfide species, although some proteins may cycle between a few disulfide states as part of their function, e.g., thioredoxin. In proteins with more than two cysteines, non-native disulfide species may be formed, which are almost always misfolded. As the number of cysteines increases, the number of nonnative species increases factorially.\nIn bacteria and archaea.\nDisulfide bonds play an important protective role for bacteria as a reversible switch that turns a protein on or off when bacterial cells are exposed to oxidation reactions. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in particular could severely damage DNA and kill the bacterium at low concentrations if not for the protective action of the SS-bond. Archaea typically have fewer disulfides than higher organisms.\nIn eukaryotes.\nIn eukaryotic cells, in general, stable disulfide bonds are formed in the lumen of the RER (rough endoplasmic reticulum) and the mitochondrial intermembrane space but not in the cytosol. This is due to the more oxidizing environment of the aforementioned compartments and more reducing environment of the cytosol (see glutathione). Thus disulfide bonds are mostly found in secretory proteins, lysosomal proteins, and the exoplasmic domains of membrane proteins.\nThere are notable exceptions to this rule. For example, many nuclear and cytosolic proteins can become disulfide-crosslinked during necrotic cell death. Similarly, a number of cytosolic proteins which have cysteine residues in proximity to each other that function as oxidation sensors or redox catalysts; when the reductive potential of the cell fails, they oxidize and trigger cellular response mechanisms. The virus \"Vaccinia\" also produces cytosolic proteins and peptides that have many disulfide bonds; although the reason for this is unknown presumably they have protective effects against intracellular proteolysis machinery.\nDisulfide bonds are also formed within and between protamines in the sperm chromatin of many mammalian species.\nDisulfides in regulatory proteins.\nAs disulfide bonds can be reversibly reduced and re-oxidized, the redox state of these bonds has evolved into a signaling element. In chloroplasts, for example, the enzymatic reduction of disulfide bonds has been linked to the control of numerous metabolic pathways as well as gene expression. The reductive signaling activity has been shown, thus far, to be carried by the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system, channeling electrons from the light reactions of photosystem I to catalytically reduce disulfides in regulated proteins in a light dependent manner. In this way chloroplasts adjust the activity of key processes such as the Calvin\u2013Benson cycle, starch degradation, ATP production and gene expression according to light intensity. Additionally, It has been reported that disulfides plays a significant role on redox state regulation of Two-component systems (TCSs), which could be found in certain bacteria including photogenic strain. A unique intramolecular cysteine disulfide bonds in the ATP-binding domain of SrrAB TCs found in \"Staphylococcus aureus\" is a good example of disulfides in regulatory proteins, which the redox state of SrrB molecule is controlled by cysteine disulfide bonds, leading to the modification of SrrA activity including gene regulation.\nIn hair and feathers.\nOver 90% of the dry weight of hair comprises proteins called keratins, which have a high disulfide content, from the amino acid cysteine. The robustness conferred in part by disulfide linkages is illustrated by the recovery of virtually intact hair from ancient Egyptian tombs. Feathers have similar keratins and are extremely resistant to protein digestive enzymes. The stiffness of hair and feather is determined by the disulfide content. Manipulating disulfide bonds in hair is the basis for the permanent wave in hairstyling. Reagents that affect the making and breaking of S\u2212S bonds are key, e.g., ammonium thioglycolate. The high disulfide content of feathers dictates the high sulfur content of bird eggs. The high sulfur content of hair and feathers contributes to the disagreeable odor that results when they are burned.\nIn disease.\nCystinosis is a condition where cystine precipitates in various organs. This accumulation interferes with bodily function and can be fatal. This disorder can be resolved by treatment with cysteamine. Cysteamine functions by the converting the symmetrical disulfide cystine to a more soluble mixed disulfide and cysteine:\nInorganic disulfides.\nThe disulfide anion is S22\u2212, or \u2212S\u2212S\u2212. In disulfide, sulfur exists in the reduced state with oxidation number \u22121. Its electron configuration then resembles that of a chlorine atom. It thus tends to form a covalent bond with another S\u2212 center to form S22\u2212 group, similar to elemental chlorine existing as the diatomic Cl2. Oxygen may also behave similarly, e.g. in peroxides such as H2O2. Examples:\nApplications.\nAside from the major role in biology, disulfides are found in rubber that has been vulcanized with sulfur. The vulcanization of rubber results in crosslinking groups which consist of disulfide (and polysulfide) bonds; in analogy to the role of disulfides in proteins, the S\u2212S linkages in rubber strongly affect the stability and rheology of the material. Although the exact mechanism underlying the vulcanization process is not entirely understood (as multiple reaction pathways are present but the predominant one is unknown), it has been extensively shown that the extent to which the process is allowed to proceed determines the physical properties of the resulting rubber\u2014namely, a greater degree of crosslinking corresponds to a stronger and more rigid material. The current conventional methods of rubber manufacturing are typically irreversible, as the unregulated reaction mechanisms can result in complex networks of sulfide linkages; as such, rubber is considered to be a thermoset material.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65951", "revid": "1558654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65951", "title": "Fielding (cricket)", "text": "Collecting the ball to force dismissal\nFielding in the sport of cricket is the action of fielders in collecting the ball after it is struck by the striking batter, to limit the number of runs that the striker scores and/or to get a batter out by either catching a hit ball before it bounces, or by running out either batter before they can complete their current run. There are a number of recognised fielding positions and they can be categorised into the offside and leg side of the field. Fielding also involves trying to prevent the ball from making a boundary where four \"runs\" are awarded for reaching the perimeter and six for crossing it without touching the grass. \nA fielder may field the ball with any part of their body. However, if, while the ball is in play, they wilfully field it otherwise (e.g. by using their hat) the ball becomes dead and five penalty runs are awarded to the batting side, unless the ball previously struck a batter not attempting to hit or avoid the ball. Most of the rules covering fielders are set out in Law 28 of the \"Laws of cricket\". Fake fielding is the action when a fielder makes bodily movements to feign fielding to fool batters into making mistakes and is a punishable offence under the ICC rules.\nFielding position names and locations.\nThere are 11 players in a team: one is the bowler and another is the wicket-keeper, so only nine other fielding positions can be occupied at any time. Where fielders are positioned is a tactical decision made by the captain of the fielding team. The captain (usually in consultation with the bowler and sometimes other members of the team) may move players between fielding positions at any time except when a bowler is in the act of bowling to a batter, though there are exceptions for fielders moving in anticipation of the ball being hit to a particular area.\nThere are a number of named basic fielding positions, some of which are employed very commonly and others that are used less often. However, these positions are neither fixed nor precisely defined, and fielders can be placed in positions that differ from the basic positions. The nomenclature of the positions is somewhat esoteric, but roughly follows a system of polar coordinates \u2013 one word (leg, cover, mid-wicket) specifies the angle from the batter, and is sometimes preceded by an adjective describing the distance from the batter (silly, short, deep or long). Words such as \"backward\", \"forward\", or \"square\" can further indicate the angle.\nThe image shows the location of most of the named fielding positions based on a right-handed batter. The area to the left of a right-handed batter (from the batter's point of view \u2013 facing the bowler) is called the \"leg side\" or \"on side\", while that to the right is the \"off side\". If the batter is left-handed, the leg and off sides are reversed and the fielding positions are a mirror image of those shown.\nCatching positions.\nSome fielding positions are used offensively. That is, players are put there with the main aim being to catch out the batter rather than to stop or slow down the scoring of runs. These positions include Slip (often there are multiple slips next to each other, designated \"First slip\", \"Second slip\", \"Third slip\", etc., numbered outwards from the wicket-keeper \u2013 collectively known as the \"slip cordon\") meant to catch balls that just edge off the bat; Gully; Fly slip; Leg slip; Leg gully; the \"short\" and \"silly\" positions. \"Short leg\", also known as \"bat pad\", is a position specifically intended to catch balls that unintentionally strike the bat and leg pad, and thus end up only a metre or two to the leg side.\nOther positions.\nThe bowler after delivering the ball must avoid running on the pitch, and so usually ends up fielding near silly mid on or silly mid off. Fast bowlers will continue running to exit the pitch and only change direction for balls dropped in front of the wicket. Spin bowlers with the slowest run-ups will usually cease their movement immediately after their delivery, planting their feet before the ball arrives to the batsman to react to a ball hit back up the pitch toward them. The bowler is generally understood to have the responsibility to defend the stumps at the non-strikers end of the pitch and so after a shot is made they will return to the stumps to catch any incoming throw, on rare occasions where a wicket-keeper has fallen or had to run to gather the ball the bowler may be the closest to the non-strikers stumps as well and so will move to the other end of the pitch. Once the play is dead they will walk back toward their bowling mark. In the laws of cricket the ball play is considered dead after the runners have ceased attempting to score and the ball has been returned to either the wicket-keeper or the bowler.\nModifiers.\nAdditionally, commentators or spectators discussing the details of field placement will often use the terms for descriptive phrases such as \"gully is a bit wider than normal\" (meaning they are more to the side than normal) or \"mid off is standing too deep, they should come in shorter\" (meaning they are too far away and should be positioned closer to the batter).\nRestrictions on field placement.\nFielders may be placed anywhere on the field, subject to the following rules. At the time the ball is bowled:\nThe restriction for one-day cricket is designed to prevent the fielding team from setting extremely defensive fields and concentrating solely on preventing the batting team from scoring runs.\nIf any of these rules is violated, an umpire will call the delivery a no-ball. Additionally a player may not make any significant movement that is not in response to the striker's actions after the ball comes into play and before the ball reaches the striker. If this happens, an umpire will call and signal 'dead ball'. For close fielders, anything other than minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker is significant. In the outfield, fielders may move in towards the striker or striker's wicket; indeed, they usually do. However, anything other than slight movement off line or away from the striker is to be considered significant.\nTactics of field placement.\nWith only nine fielders (in addition to the bowler and wicket-keeper), there are not enough to cover every part of the field simultaneously. The captain of the fielding team must decide which fielding positions to use, and which to leave vacant. The placement of fielders is one of the major tactical considerations for the fielding captain.\nAttacking and defending.\nAn attacking field is one in which fielders are positioned in such a way that they are likely to take catches, and thus likely to get the batter out. Such a field generally involves having many fielders close to the batter. For a pace bowler, an attacking field will usually include multiple slips (termed a \"cordon\") and a gully; these are common positions for catching mishit shots. For a spin bowler, attacking positions include one or two slips, short leg or silly point.\nA defensive field is one in which most of the field is within easy reach of one or more fielders; the batter will therefore find it difficult to score runs. This generally involves having most fielders some distance from, and in front of, the batter, in positions where the ball is most likely to be hit. Defensive fields generally have multiple fielders stationed close to the boundary rope to prevent fours being scored, and others close to the fielding circle, where they can prevent singles.\nMany elements govern the decisions on field placements, including: the tactical situation in the match; which bowler is bowling; how long the batter has been in; the wear on the ball; the state of the wicket; the light and weather conditions; or the time remaining until the next interval in play.\nOff- and leg-side fields.\nAnother consideration when setting a field is how many fielders to have on each side of the pitch. With nine fielders to place, the division must necessarily be unequal, but the degree of inequality varies.\nWhen describing a field setting, the numbers of fielders on the off side and leg side are often abbreviated into a shortened form, with the off side number quoted first. For example, a \"5\u20134 field\" means 5 fielders on the off side and 4 on the leg side.\nUsually, most fielders are placed on the off side. This is because most bowlers tend to concentrate the line of their deliveries on or outside the off stump, so most shots are hit into the off side.\nWhen attacking, there may be 3 or 4 slips and 1 or 2 gullies, potentially using up to six fielders in that region alone. This would typically be accompanied by a mid off, mid on, and fine leg, making it a 7\u20132 field. Although there are only two fielders on the leg side, they should get relatively little work as long as the bowlers maintain a line outside off stump. This type of field leaves large gaps in front of the wicket, and is used to entice the batters to attack there, with the hope that they make a misjudgment and edge the ball to the catchers waiting behind them.\nAs fields get progressively more defensive, fielders will move out of the slip and gully area to cover more of the field, leading to 6\u20133 and 5\u20134 fields.\nIf a bowler, usually a leg spin bowler, decides to attack the batter's legs in an attempt to force a stumping, bowl him behind their legs, or induce a catch on the leg side, the field may stack 4\u20135 towards the leg side. It is unusual to see more than five fielders on the leg side, because of the restriction that there must be no more than two fielders placed behind square leg. \nSometimes a spinner will bowl leg theory and have seven fielders on the leg side, and will bowl significantly wide of the leg stump to prevent scoring. Often the ball is so wide that the batter cannot hit the ball straight of mid-on while standing still, and cannot hit to the off side unless they try unorthodox and risky shots such as a reverse sweep or pull, or switch their handedness. The batter can back away to the leg side to hit through the off side, but can expose their stumps in doing so.\nThe reverse tactic can be used, by fast and slow bowlers alike, by placing seven or eight fielders on the off side and bowling far outside off stump. The batter can safely allow the ball to pass without fear of it hitting the stumps, but will not score. If they want to score they will have to try and risk an edge to a wide ball and hit through the packed off side, or try to drag the ball from far outside the stumps to the sparsely populated leg side.\nAnother attacking placement on the leg side is the \"leg side trap\", which involves placing fielders near the boundary at deep square and backward square leg and bowling bouncers to try to induce the batter to hook the ball into the air. For slower bowlers, the leg trap fieldsmen tend to be placed within 10\u201315\u00a0m from the bat behind square, to catch leg glances and sweeps.\nProtective equipment.\nNo member of the fielding side other than the wicket-keeper may wear gloves or external leg guards, though fielders (in particular players fielding near to the bat) may also wear shin protectors, groin protectors ('boxes') and chest protectors beneath their clothing. Apart from the wicket-keeper, protection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires.\nFielders are permitted to wear a helmet and face guard. This is usually employed in a position such as silly point or silly mid-wicket, where proximity to the batter gives little time to avoid a shot directly at their head. If the helmet is only being used for overs from one end, it will be placed behind the wicket-keeper when not in use. Some grounds have purpose-built temporary storage for the helmet, shin pads etc., in the form of a cavity beneath the field, accessed through a hatch about across flush with the grass. 5 penalty runs are awarded to the batting side should the ball touch a fielder's headgear whilst it is not being worn, unless the ball previously struck a batter not attempting to hit or avoid the ball. This rule was introduced in the 19th century to prevent the unfair practice of a fielder using a hat (often a top hat) to take a catch.\nAs cricket balls are hard and can travel at high speeds off the bat, protective equipment is recommended to prevent injury. There have been a few recorded deaths in cricket, but they are extremely rare, and not always related to fielding.\nFielding skills.\nFielding in cricket requires a range of skills.\nClose catchers require the ability to be able to take quick reaction catches with a high degree of consistency. This can require considerable efforts of concentration as a catcher may only be required to take one catch in an entire game, but their success in taking that catch may have a considerable effect on the outcome of the match.\nInfielders field between 20 and 40 yards away from the batter. The ball will often be hit at them extremely hard, and they require excellent athleticism as well as courage in stopping it from passing them. Infield catches range from simple, slow moving chances known as \"dollies\" to hard hit balls that require a spectacular diving catch. Finally, infielders are the main source of run outs in a game of cricket, and their ability to get to the ball quickly, throw it straight and hard and make a direct hit on the stumps is an important skill.\nOutfielders field furthest from the bat, typically right on the boundary edge. Their main role is to prevent the ball from going over the boundary and scoring four or six runs. They need good footspeed to be able to get around the field quickly, and a strong arm to be able to make the 50\u201380-yard throw. Outfielders also often have to catch high hit balls that go over the infield.\nFielding specialities.\nMany cricketers are particularly adept in one fielding position and will usually be found there:\nPlayers are not selected purely because of their fielding skills in modern organised cricket. All players are expected to win their place in the team as a specialist batter, bowler or all-rounder. Due to the lack of restrictions on substitute fielders some teams will use a well regarded fielder from local club sides as an 'emergency fielder', who temporarily takes the place of another player and is prohibited from bowling, batting or acting as captain. An example of this was in the 2005 Ashes series with England using Gary Pratt, a 24 year old batter who was already past the peak of his batting career in first class cricket. Pratt fielded a quick single from Damien Martyn then threw down the stumps to dismiss Australian Captain Ricky Ponting.\nWicket-keepers were the one exception to the rule, as their specialist position was viewed as being so important that fielding as a keeper was more important than their batting, although they were still generally expected to be competent enough to play at the #7 position in the batting order, before the usual four bowlers. Jack Russell and Alec Stewart were in a constant selection battle for England's wicket-keeper position, with Stewart's superior batting competing with Russell who was considered the best wicket-keeper in the world. The back and forth over who should keep wickets lasted for Russell's entire test career from 1989 through to his retirement in 1998. In the early 2000's the role of Wicket-keeper-batter was introduced with the success of the heavy hitting Adam Gilchrist, elevating the expectations on the batting side of a wicket-keeper while retaining high level fielding ability. Wicket-keepers are allowed to bowl though this is extremely rare at higher levels, and no serious attempt has been made to use a wicket-keeper as a regular bowler in top level international cricket.\nThrowing a cricket ball.\nThere have been many competitions for throwing a cricket ball the furthest distance, particularly in the earlier years of the game. \"Wisden\" describes how the record was set around 1882, by one Robert Percival at Durham Sands Racecourse, at 140 yards and two feet (128.7 m). Former Essex all-rounder Ian Pont threw a ball 138 yards (126.19 m) in Cape Town in 1981. There are unconfirmed reports that J\u0101nis L\u016bsis, the non-cricketer Soviet javelin thrower, who won the Olympic gold medal in 1968, once threw a ball 150 yards.\nSpecialist fielding coaches.\nThe use of specialist fielding coaches has become more prevalent since the turn of the 21st century, following the trend of specialist batting and bowling coaches within professional cricket. According to cricket broadcaster Henry Blofeld, \"Dressing rooms were once populated by the team and the twelfth man, one physiotherapist at most, perhaps a selector and the occasional visitor. That was all. Now, apart from the two main coaches, there are 'emergency fielders' galore; you can hardly see yourself for batting, bowling, fielding coaches, psychoanalysts and statistical wizards and a whole army of physiotherapists\". Baseball fielding coaches have been sought out for this purpose before.\nSee also.\nOther sports\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Antigonae is in Orff's words a \"musical setting\" for the Greek tragedy of the same name by Sophocles. However, it functions as an opera.\nThe opera is a line-by-line setting of the German translation of Sophocles' play by Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin. However, Orff did not treat H\u00f6lderlin's translation of the play as a traditional opera libretto, but rather as the basis for a \"musical transformation\" of the tragic language of the drama of Ancient Greece. Sophocles's play was written in 442 BC, and H\u00f6lderlin's 1804 translation copies faithfully the mood and movement of Greek tragedy.\nSynopsis.\nThe opera begins in the early morning following a battle in Thebes between the armies of the two sons of Oedipus: Eteocles and Polynices. King Kreon (Creon), who ascended the throne of Thebes after both brothers are killed in battle, decrees that Polynices is not to be buried. Antigonae, his sister, defies the order, but is caught. Kreon decrees that she be buried alive in spite of the fact that she is betrothed to his son, Haemon. The gods, through the blind prophet Tiresias, express their disapproval of Kreon's decision, which convinces him to rescind his order, and he goes to bury Polynices. However, Antigonae has already hanged herself rather than be buried alive. When Kreon arrives at the tomb where she was to be interred, his son, Haemon, attacks him and then kills himself. Finally, when Kreon's wife, Eurydice, is informed of Haemon's and Antigonae's death she, too, takes her own life. At the end of the play, and the opera, Kreon is the only principal left alive.\nMusic.\nOrff's musical setting of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin's Sophocles translation from 1804 created a novel form of musical theatre in which the poetic text itself becomes musicalized through the declamation of the singing voices. An extraordinary reduction of the structures of the pitch domain, in connection with the predominance of rhythmic patterns, has been described as an essential feature of Orff's late style. Especially the large choruses, which exhibit a pronounced tendency to build up large soundscapes from highly individual timbres, demonstrate the composer's method of thinking in constellations of basic pitches without veritable chord syntax. Orff's renunciation of the grammar of harmonic tonality allowed the composer, as the musical equivalent of H\u00f6lderlin's archaic language, to turn the declamation of the singing voices itself into the vehicle for the dramatic action. As Pietro Massa has been able to show, an intensive exchange of ideas with the classical philologist Wolfgang Schadewaldt, the musicologist Thrasybulos Georgiades and the stage director Wieland Wagner, who had originally been selected as director for the world premieres of \"Oedipus der Tyrann\" and \"Prometheus\" by the composer, accompanied the genesis of Orff's operas on Greek drama.\nConcentrating on an ensemble of percussion instruments with and without definite pitches, originally certainly born out of the fascination that the orchestra's only still evolving group exercised on 20th-century composers, also appears to be a veritable patent solution for a composer who is interested in creating pitch organizations had never been a central concern. The idea of a differentiated cooperation based on the division of musical functions, which has distinguished the orchestra of Western art music that has grown organically over the centuries, appears in the orchestra of Orff's operas on H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s translations from Sophokles transposed on instrument constellations that were previously unknown to European art music. In the score of \"Antigonae\", six grand pianos and a group of xylophones, which were mostly given only marginal tasks in the traditional orchestra, take on the role that the group of strings had in the orchestration of Viennese classical music. On the other hand, traditional instruments of the European orchestral tradition \u2013 such as flutes, oboes, trumpets and double basses \u2013 become entrusted in \"Antigonae\" and \"Oedipus der Tyrann\" with functions that had been reserved to rare percussion instruments in the orchestra of the 19th century: As special timbres with an almost exotic sound appeal, they appear reserved for the turning points of the work's dramaturgical structure.\nIn the history of 20th-century music, Orff's operas on Greek Antiquity constitute an extraordinarily original and highly personal pathway for the avantgarde music theatre after 1950. In the course of the last two decades, Orff's H\u00f6lderlin operas have received more attention than in the years before 2000, not least because of pronounced similarities between Orff's musical language and more recent tendencies of Minimal Music. Of his three operas on drama from Greek Antiquity, especially \"Antigonae\" has been able to assert itself in the repertoire, since Arthur Honegger 's opera \"Antigone\" (Brussels, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, 1927), despite its libretto by Jean Cocteau, has not been able to enter the standard operatic repertory.\nInstrumentation.\nAccording to the score, which is published by Schott Music, \"Antigonae\" is scored for an unusual orchestra with a strong percussion section. This orchestra is to be well screened from the audience when the opera is performed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n(*) At several points, the strings are struck with various items, including wooden drum sticks on the higher strings, timpani sticks on the lower strings, and also a plectrum.\nThe percussion section requires 10 to 15 players to perform on the following instruments:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n(*) These are Orff Schulwerk instruments.\nFor the percussion, Carl Orff insisted on using the right kind of instruments. The two bells must be of typical shape; tubular bells and \"plate\" bells are not acceptable. The castanets must be of the type without handles, e.g. those only connected together via a string.\nCarl Orff also gave extensive performance directions that should be taken into account at performances. For instance, some of the 12 pianists switch to other pianos at several sections. In another place, the entire trumpet section is required to perform some passages backstage before returning to the orchestra.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65953", "revid": "22624187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65953", "title": "Antigone (Sophocles play)", "text": "Tragedy by Sophocles\nAntigone ( ; ) is an Athenian tragedy written by Sophocles in either 442 or 440 BC and first performed at the Festival of Dionysus of the same year. It is thought to be the second-oldest surviving play of Sophocles, preceded by \"Ajax\", which was written around the same period. The play is one of a triad of tragedies known as the three Theban plays, following \"Oedipus Rex\" and \"Oedipus at Colonus\". Even though the events in Antigone occur last in the order of events depicted in the plays, Sophocles wrote \"Antigone\" first. The story expands on the Theban legend that predates it, and it picks up where Aeschylus' \"Seven Against Thebes\" ends. The play is named after the main protagonist Antigone.\nAfter Oedipus' self-exile, his sons Eteocles and Polynices engaged in a civil war for the Theban throne, which resulted in both brothers dying while fighting each other. Oedipus' brother-in-law and new Theban ruler Creon ordered the public honoring of Eteocles and the public shaming of Thebes' traitor Polynices. The play follows the attempts of their sister Antigone to bury the body of Polynices, going against the decision of her uncle Creon and placing her relationship with her brother above human laws.\nSynopsis.\nPrior to the beginning of the play, the brothers Eteocles and Polynices, leading opposite sides in Thebes' civil war, died fighting each other for the throne. Creon, the new ruler of Thebes and brother of the former Queen Jocasta, has decided that Eteocles will be honored and Polynices will be in public shame. The rebel brother's body will not be sanctified by holy rites and will lie unburied on the battlefield, prey for carrion animals, the harshest punishment at the time. Antigone and Ismene are the sisters of the dead Polynices and Eteocles.\nIn the opening of the play, Antigone brings Ismene outside the palace gates late at night for a secret meeting: Antigone wants to bury Polynices' body, in defiance of Creon's edict, as the Greeks believed that the omission of proper burial rights is an insult to human dignity. Ismene refuses to help her, not believing that it will actually be possible to bury their brother, who is under guard, but she is unable to stop Antigone from going to bury her brother herself.\nThe Chorus, consisting of Theban elders, enter and cast the background story of the Seven against Thebes into a mythic and heroic context.\nCreon enters and seeks the support of the Chorus in the days to come and, in particular, wants them to back his edict regarding the disposal of Polynices' body. The leader of the Chorus pledges his support out of deference to Creon. A sentry enters, fearfully reporting that the body has been given funeral rites and a symbolic burial with a thin covering of earth, though no one saw who actually committed the crime. Creon, furious, orders the sentry to find the culprit or face death himself, the sentry leaves. \nThe Chorus sings of the ingenuity of human beings; but add that they do not wish to live in the same city as law-breakers.\nThe sentry returns, bringing Antigone with him. The sentry explains that the watchmen uncovered Polynices' body and then caught Antigone as she performed the funeral rituals. Creon questions her after sending the sentry away, and she does not deny what she has done. She argues unflinchingly with Creon about the immorality of the edict and the morality of her actions. Creon becomes furious, and seeing Ismene upset, thinks she must have known of Antigone's plan. He summons her. Ismene tries to confess falsely to the crime, wishing to die alongside her sister, but Antigone will not have it. Creon orders that the two women be imprisoned.\nThe Chorus sings of the troubles of the house of Oedipus.\nHaemon, Creon's son, enters to pledge allegiance to his father, even though he is engaged to Antigone. He initially seems willing to forsake Antigone, but when he gently tries to persuade his father to spare Antigone, claiming that \"under cover of darkness the city mourns for the girl\", the discussion deteriorates, and the two men are soon bitterly insulting each other. When Creon threatens to execute Antigone in front of his son, Haemon leaves, vowing never to see Creon again.\nThe Chorus sings of the power of love.\nAntigone is brought in under guard on her way to execution. She sings a lament. The Chorus compares her to the goddess Niobe, who was turned into a rock, and say it is a wonderful thing to be compared to a goddess. Antigone accuses them of mocking her.\nCreon decides to spare Ismene and to bury Antigone alive in a cave. By not killing her directly, he hopes to pay minimal respects to the gods. She is brought out of the house, and this time, she is sorrowful instead of defiant. She expresses her regrets at not having married and dying for following the laws of the gods. She is taken away to her living tomb.\nThe Chorus encourages Antigone by singing of the great women of myth who suffered.\nTiresias, the blind prophet, enters. Tiresias warns Creon that Polynices should now be urgently buried because the gods are displeased, refusing to accept any sacrifices or prayers from Thebes. However, Creon accuses Tiresias of being corrupt. Tiresias responds that Creon will lose \"a son of [his] own loins\" for the crimes of leaving Polynices unburied and putting Antigone into the earth (he does not say that Antigone should not be condemned to death, only that it is improper to keep a living body underneath the earth). Tiresias also prophesies that all of Greece will despise Creon and that the sacrificial offerings of Thebes will not be accepted by the gods. The leader of the Chorus, terrified, asks Creon to take Tiresias' advice to free Antigone and bury Polynices. Creon assents, leaving with a retinue of men.\nThe Chorus delivers a choral ode to the god Dionysus.\nA messenger enters to tell the leader of the Chorus that Haemon has killed himself. Eurydice, Creon's wife and Haemon's mother, enters and asks the messenger to tell her everything. The messenger reports that Creon saw to the burial of Polynices. When Creon arrived at Antigone's cave, he found Haemon lamenting over Antigone, who had hanged herself. Haemon unsuccessfully attempted to stab Creon, then stabbed himself. Having listened to the messenger's account, Eurydice silently disappears into the palace.\nCreon enters, carrying Haemon's body. He understands that his own actions have caused these events and blames himself. A second messenger arrives to tell Creon and the Chorus that Eurydice has also killed herself. With her last breath, she cursed her husband for the deaths of her sons, Haemon and Megareus. Creon blames himself for everything that has happened, and, a broken man, he asks his servants to help him inside. The order he valued so much has been protected, and he is still the king, but he has acted against the gods and lost his children and his wife as a result. After Creon condemns himself, the leader of the Chorus closes by saying that although the gods punish the proud, punishment brings wisdom.\nHistorical context.\n\"Antigone\" was written at a time of national fervor. In 441/0 BCE, Sophocles was appointed as one of the ten strategoi to lead a military expedition against Samos. Kathrin Rosenfield notes that it is striking that a prominent play in a time of such imperialism contains little political propaganda, no impassioned apostrophe, and\u2014with the exception of the epiklerate (the right of the daughter to continue her dead father's lineage) and arguments against anarchy\u2014makes no contemporary allusion or passing reference to Athens. Rather than become sidetracked with the issues of the time, \"Antigone\" remains focused on the characters and themes within the play. It does, however, expose the dangers of the absolute ruler, or tyrant, in the person of Creon, a king to whom few will speak freely and openly their true opinions, and who therefore makes the grievous error of condemning Antigone, an act that he pitifully regrets in the play's final lines. Athenians, proud of their democratic tradition, would have identified his error in the many lines of dialogue which emphasize that the people of Thebes believe he is wrong, but have no voice to tell him so. Athenians would identify the folly of tyranny.\nNotable features.\nThe Chorus in \"Antigone\" contrasts with the chorus in Aeschylus' \"Seven Against Thebes\", the play of which \"Antigone\" is a continuation. In a scene modern scholars believe to have been written after Aeschylus's death in order to make it consonant with Sophocles's play, the chorus in \"Seven Against Thebes\" is largely supportive of Antigone's decision to bury her brother. Here, the chorus is composed of old men who are largely unwilling to see civil disobedience in a positive light. The chorus also represents a typical difference in Sophocles' plays from those of both Aeschylus and Euripides. A chorus of Aeschylus' almost always continues or intensifies the moral nature of the play, while one of Euripides' frequently strays far from the main moral theme. The chorus in \"Antigone\" lies somewhere in between; it remains within the general moral in the immediate scene, but allows itself to be carried away from the occasion or the initial reason for speaking.\nSignificance and interpretation.\nOnce Creon has discovered that Antigone buried her brother against his orders, the ensuing discussion of her fate is devoid of arguments for mercy because of youth or sisterly love from the Chorus, Haemon or Antigone herself. Most of the arguments to save her center on a debate over which course adheres best to strict justice.\nBoth Antigone and Creon claim divine sanction for their actions; but Tiresias the prophet supports Antigone's claim that the gods demand Polynices' burial. It is not until the interview with Tiresias that Creon transgresses and is guilty of sin. He had no divine intimation that his edict would be displeasing to the gods and against their will. He is here warned that it is, but he defends it and insults the prophet of the gods. This is his sin, and it is this that leads to his punishment. The terrible calamities that overtake Creon are not the result of his exalting the law of the state over the unwritten and divine law that Antigone vindicates, but are his intemperance that led him to disregard the warnings of Tiresias until it was too late. This is emphasized by the Chorus in the lines that conclude the play.\nThe German poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, whose translation had a strong impact on the philosopher Martin Heidegger, brings out a more subtle reading of the play: he focuses on Antigone's legal and political status within the palace, her privilege to be the heiress (according to the legal instrument of the epiklerate) and thus protected by Zeus. According to the legal practice of classical Athens, Creon is obliged to marry his closest relative (Haemon) to the late king's daughter in an inverted marriage rite, which would oblige Haemon to produce a son and heir for his dead father in law. Creon would be deprived of grandchildren and heirs to his lineage \u2013 a fact that provides a strong realistic motive for his hatred against Antigone. This modern perspective has remained submerged for a long time.\nHeidegger, in his essay, \"The Ode on Man in Sophocles' Antigone\", focuses on the chorus' sequence of strophe and antistrophe that begins on line 278. His interpretation is in three phases: first to consider the essential meaning of the verse, and then to move through the sequence with that understanding, and finally to discern what was nature of humankind that Sophocles was expressing in this poem. In the first two lines of the first strophe, in the translation Heidegger used, the chorus says that there are many strange things on earth, but there is nothing stranger than man. Beginnings are important to Heidegger, and he considered those two lines to describe the primary trait of the essence of humanity within which all other aspects must find their essence. Those two lines are so fundamental that the rest of the verse is spent catching up with them. The authentic Greek definition of humankind is the one who is strangest of all. Heidegger's interpretation of the text describes humankind in one word that captures the extremes \u2014 \"deinotaton\". Man is \"deinon\" in the sense that he is the terrible, violent one, and also in the sense that he uses violence against the overpowering. Man is twice \"deinon\". In a series of lectures in 1942, \"H\u00f6lderlin's Hymn, The Ister\", Heidegger goes further in interpreting this play, and considers that Antigone takes on the destiny she has been given, but does not follow a path that is opposed to that of the humankind described in the choral ode. When Antigone opposes Creon, her suffering the uncanny is her supreme action.\nThe problem of the second burial.\nAn important issue still debated regarding Sophocles' \"Antigone\" is the problem of the second burial. When she poured dust over her brother's body, Antigone completed the burial rituals and thus fulfilled her duty to him. Having been properly buried, Polynices' soul could proceed to the underworld whether or not the dust was removed from his body. However, Antigone went back after his body was uncovered and performed the ritual again, an act that seems to be completely unmotivated by anything other than a plot necessity so that she could be caught in the act of disobedience, leaving no doubt of her guilt. More than one commentator has suggested that it was the gods, not Antigone, who performed the first burial, citing both the guard's description of the scene and the chorus's observation. It's possible, however, that Antigone not only wants her brother to have burial rites, but that she wants his body to stay buried. The guard states that after they found that someone covered Polynices' body with dirt, the birds and animals left the body alone (lines 257\u2013258). But when the guards removed the dirt, then the birds and animals returned, and Tiresias emphasizes that birds and dogs have defiled the city's altars and hearths with the rotting flesh from Polynices' body; as a result of which the gods will no longer accept the peoples' sacrifices and prayers (lines 1015\u20131020). It's possible, therefore, that after the guards remove the dirt protecting the body, Antigone buries him again to prevent the offense to the gods. Even though Antigone has already performed the burial rite for Polynices, Creon, on the advice of Tiresias (lines 1023\u20131030), makes a complete and permanent burial for his body.\nRichard C. Jebb suggests that the only reason for Antigone's return to the burial site is that the first time she forgot the Choa\u00ed (libations), and \"perhaps the rite was considered completed only if the Choa\u00ed were poured while the dust still covered the corpse.\"\nGilbert Norwood explains Antigone's performance of the second burial in terms of her stubbornness. His argument says that had Antigone not been so obsessed with the idea of keeping her brother covered, none of the deaths of the play would have happened. This argument states that if nothing had happened, nothing would have happened, and does not take much of a stand in explaining why Antigone returned for the second burial when the first would have fulfilled her religious obligation, regardless of how stubborn she was. This leaves that she acted only in passionate defiance of Creon and respect to her brother's earthly vessel.\nTycho von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff justifies the need for the second burial by comparing Sophocles' \"Antigone\" to a theoretical version where Antigone is apprehended during the first burial. In this situation, news of the illegal burial and Antigone's arrest would arrive at the same time and there would be no period of time in which Antigone's defiance and victory could be appreciated.\nJ. L. Rose maintains that the problem of the second burial is solved by close examination of Antigone as a tragic character. Being a tragic character, she is completely obsessed by one idea, and for her this is giving her brother his due respect in death and demonstrating her love for him and for what is right. When she sees her brother's body uncovered, therefore, she is overcome by emotion and acts impulsively to cover him again, with no regards to the necessity of the action or its consequences for her safety.\nBonnie Honig uses the problem of the second burial as the basis for her claim that Ismene performs the first burial, and that her pseudo-confession before Creon is actually an honest admission of guilt.\nThemes.\nCivil disobedience.\nA well established theme in \"Antigone\" is the right of the individual to reject society's infringement on one's freedom to perform a personal obligation. Antigone comments to Ismene, regarding Creon's edict, that \"He has no right to keep me from my own.\" Related to this theme is the question of whether Antigone's will to bury her brother is based on rational thought or instinct, a debate whose contributors include Goethe.\nThe contrasting views of Creon and Antigone with regard to laws higher than those of state inform their different conclusions about civil disobedience. Creon demands obedience to the law above all else, right or wrong. He says that \"there is nothing worse than disobedience to authority\" (\"An.\" 671). Antigone responds with the idea that state law is not absolute, and that it can be broken in civil disobedience in extreme cases, such as honoring the gods, whose rule and authority outweigh Creon's.\nNatural law and contemporary legal institutions.\nCreon's decree to leave Polynices unburied in itself makes a bold statement about what it means to be a citizen, and what constitutes abdication of citizenship. It was the firmly kept custom of the Greeks that each city was responsible for the burial of its citizens. Herodotus discussed how members of each city would collect their own dead after a large battle to bury them. In \"Antigone\", it is therefore natural that the people of Thebes did not bury the Argives, but very striking that Creon prohibited the burial of Polynices. Since he is a citizen of Thebes, it would have been natural for the Thebans to bury him. Creon is telling his people that Polynices has distanced himself from them, and that they are prohibited from treating him as a fellow-citizen and burying him as is the custom for citizens.\nIn prohibiting the people of Thebes from burying Polynices, Creon is essentially placing him on the level of the other attackers\u2014the foreign Argives. For Creon, the fact that Polynices has attacked the city effectively revokes his citizenship and makes him a foreigner. As defined by this decree, citizenship is based on loyalty. It is revoked when Polynices commits what in Creon's eyes amounts to treason. When pitted against Antigone's view, this understanding of citizenship creates a new axis of conflict. Antigone does not deny that Polynices has betrayed the state, she simply acts as if this betrayal does not rob him of the connection that he would have otherwise had with the city. Creon, on the other hand, believes that citizenship is a contract; it is not absolute or inalienable, and can be lost in certain circumstances. These two opposing views \u2013 that citizenship is absolute and undeniable and alternatively that citizenship is based on certain behavior \u2013 are known respectively as citizenship 'by nature' and citizenship 'by law.'\nFidelity.\nAntigone's determination to bury Polynices arises from a desire to bring honor to her family, and to honor the higher law of the gods. She repeatedly declares that she must act to please \"those that are dead\" (\"An.\" 77), because they hold more weight than any ruler, that is the weight of divine law. In the opening scene, she makes an emotional appeal to her sister Ismene saying that they must protect their brother out of sisterly love, even if he did betray their state. Antigone believes that there are rights that are inalienable because they come from the highest authority, or authority itself, that is the divine law.\nWhile he rejects Antigone's actions based on family honor, Creon appears to value family himself. When talking to Haemon, Creon demands of him not only obedience as a citizen, but also as a son. Creon says \"everything else shall be second to your father's decision\" (\"An.\" 640\u2013641). His emphasis on being Haemon's father rather than his king may seem odd, especially in light of the fact that Creon elsewhere advocates obedience to the state above all else. It is not clear how he would personally handle these two values in conflict, but it is a moot point in the play, for, as absolute ruler of Thebes, Creon is the state, and the state is Creon. It is clear how he feels about these two values in conflict when encountered in another person, Antigone: loyalty to the state comes before family fealty, and he sentences her to death.\nPortrayal of the gods.\nIn \"Antigone\" as well as the other Theban Plays, there are very few references to the gods. Hades is the god who is most commonly referred to, but he is referred to more as a personification of Death. Zeus is referenced a total of 13 times by name in the entire play, and Apollo is referenced only as a personification of prophecy. This lack of mention portrays the tragic events that occur as the result of human error, and not divine intervention. The gods are portrayed as chthonic, as near the beginning there is a reference to \"Justice who dwells with the gods beneath the earth.\" Sophocles references Olympus twice in \"Antigone.\" This contrasts with the other Athenian tragedians, who reference Olympus often.\nEquity.\nFollowing in the Aristotelian tradition, \"Antigone\" is also seen as a case-study for equity. Catharine Titi has likened \"Antigone\"'s 'divine' law to modern peremptory norms of customary international law (ius cogens) and she has discussed Antigone's dilemma as a situation that invites the application of equity \"contra legem\" in order to correct the law.\nModern adaptations.\nDrama.\nMarie Senf, a playwright from the Federal Republic of Germany, wrote the anti-totalitarian, anti-fascist and also acrobatic \"Antigone\". This \"Antigone\" was premiered at the Schauspiel Dortmund - Dortmund Drama Theatre on January 25th, 2025.\nThis production contains an intertemporal dramatic allusion to Charlie Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\" and Istvan Szabo's \"Mephisto\". And the political, cultural and historical spirit of Marie Senff's dramatic creation continues the Thespian civil tradition of Bertolt Brecht's \"Antigone\".\nLiterature.\nSara Uribe's \"Ant\u00edgona Gonz\u00e1lez\", a book of prose set in Tamaulipas, Mexico exploring violent and fatal effects of the drug war, draws heavily on Antigone to reflect everyone in Latin America searching for the missing loved one.\nIn 2017 Kamila Shamsie published \"Home Fire\", which transposes some of the moral and political questions in Antigone into the context of Islam, ISIS and modern-day Britain.\n2023 saw bestselling author Veronica Roth publish a speculative fiction version of Antigone, \"Arch-Conspirator\", which explores concepts of gender equity, reproductive rights, and the loss of freedoms under self-righteous tyranny.\nCinema.\nGeorge Tzavellas adapted the play into a 1961 film, which he also directed. It featured Irene Papas as Antigone.\nLiliana Cavani's 1969 \"The Year of the Cannibals\" is a contemporary political fantasy based upon the Sophocles play, with Britt Ekland as Antigone and Pierre Cl\u00e9menti as Tiresias.\nThe 1978 omnibus film \"Germany in Autumn\" features a segment by Heinrich B\u00f6ll entitled \"The Deferred Antigone\" where a fictional production of Antigone is presented to television executives who reject it as \"too topical\".\nIn 1992, Jean-Marie Straub and Dani\u00e8le Huillet made a film adaptation based on Brecht\u2019s stage version of H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s translation \u2014 \"Die Antigone des Sophokles nach der H\u00f6lderlinschen \u00dcbertragung f\u00fcr die B\u00fchne bearbeitet von Brecht (1948)\".\nA 2019 Canadian film adaption transposed the story into one of a modern-day immigrant family in Montreal. It was adapted and directed by Sophie Deraspe, with additional inspiration from the Death of Fredy Villanueva. Antigone was played by Nah\u00e9ma Ricci.\nTelevision.\nVittorio Cottafavi directed two television productions of the play, in 1958 for RAI Radiotelevisione Italiana and in 1971 for Rai 1. Valentina Fortunato and Adriana Asti, respectively, performed the title role.\nIt was filmed for Australian TV in 1966.\nIn 1986, Juliet Stevenson starred as Antigone, with John Shrapnel as Creon and John Gielgud as Tiresias in the BBC's \"The Theban Plays\".\n\"Antigone at the Barbican\" was a 2015 filmed-for-TV version of a production at the Barbican directed by Ivo van Hove; the translation was by Anne Carson and the film starred Juliette Binoche as Antigone and Patrick O'Kane as Kreon.\nOther TV adaptations of \"Antigone\" have starred Irene Worth (1949) and Dorothy Tutin (1959), both broadcast by the BBC.\nNotes.\nExplanatory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65954", "revid": "51060402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65954", "title": "John Cage", "text": "American avant-garde composer (1912\u20131992)\nJohn Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 \u2013 August 12, 1992) was an American composer and music theorist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives.\nCage's teachers included Henry Cowell (1933) and Arnold Schoenberg (1933\u201335), both known for their radical innovations in music, but Cage's major influences lay in various East and South Asian cultures. Through his studies of Indian philosophy and Zen Buddhism in the late 1940s, Cage came to the idea of aleatoric or chance-controlled music, which he started composing in 1951. The \"I Ching\", an ancient Chinese classic text and decision-making tool, became Cage's standard composition tool for the rest of his life. In a 1957 lecture, \"Experimental Music\", he described music as \"a purposeless play\" which is \"an affirmation of life \u2013 not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we're living\".\nCage's best known work is the 1952 composition \"4\u203233\u2033\", a piece performed in the absence of deliberate sound; musicians who perform the work do nothing but be present for the duration specified by the title. The content of the composition is intended to be the sounds of the environment heard by the audience during performance. The work's challenge to assumed definitions about musicianship and musical experience made it a popular and controversial topic both in musicology and the broader aesthetics of art and performance. Cage was also a pioneer of the prepared piano (a piano with its sound altered by objects placed between or on its strings or hammers), for which he wrote numerous dance-related works and a few concert pieces. These include \"Sonatas and Interludes\" (1946\u201348).\nLife.\n1912\u20131931: Early years.\nCage was born September 5, 1912, at Good Samaritan Hospital in downtown Los Angeles. His father, John Milton Cage Sr. (1886\u20131964), was an inventor, and his mother, Lucretia (\"Crete\") Harvey (1881\u20131968), worked intermittently as a journalist for the \"Los Angeles Times\". The family's roots were deeply American: in a 1976 interview, Cage mentioned that George Washington was assisted by an ancestor named John Cage in the task of surveying the Colony of Virginia. Cage described his mother as a woman with \"a sense of society\" who was \"never happy\", while his father is perhaps best characterized by his inventions: sometimes idealistic, such as a diesel-fueled submarine that gave off exhaust bubbles, the senior Cage being uninterested in an undetectable submarine; others revolutionary and against the scientific norms, such as the \"electrostatic field theory\" of the universe. John Cage Sr. taught his son that \"if someone says 'can't' that shows you what to do.\" In 1944\u201345, Cage wrote two small character pieces dedicated to his parents: \"Crete\" and \"Dad\". The latter is a short lively piece that ends abruptly, while \"Crete\" is a slightly longer, mostly melodic contrapuntal work.\nWhen Cage was 18 months old, he ate two or three strychnine tablets. \"At first the baby's life was despaired of,\" an article stated, but \"a stomach pump was administered with success\".\nCage's first experiences with music were from private piano teachers in the Greater Los Angeles area and several relatives, particularly his aunt Phoebe Harvey James who introduced him to the piano music of the 19th century. He received first piano lessons when he was in the fourth grade at school, but although he liked music, he expressed more interest in sight reading than in developing virtuoso piano technique, and apparently was not thinking of composition. During high school, one of his music teachers was Fannie Charles Dillon. By 1928, though, Cage was convinced that he wanted to be a writer. He graduated that year from Los Angeles High School as a valedictorian, having also in the spring given a prize-winning speech at the Hollywood Bowl proposing a day of quiet for all Americans. By being \"hushed and silent,\" he said, \"we should have the opportunity to hear what other people think,\" anticipating \"4\u203233\u2033\" by more than thirty years.\nCage enrolled at Pomona College in Claremont as a theology major in 1928. At Pomona, he encountered the work of the artist Marcel Duchamp via Professor Jos\u00e9 Pijoan, of the writer James Joyce via Don Sample, of the philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamy and of the composer Henry Cowell. In 1930, he dropped out of Pomona, having come to believe that \"college was of no use to a writer\" after an incident described in his 1991 autobiographical statement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCage persuaded his parents that a trip to Europe would be more beneficial to a future writer than college studies. He subsequently hitchhiked to Galveston and sailed to Le Havre, where he took a train to Paris. Cage stayed in Europe for some 18 months, trying his hand at various forms of art. First, he studied Gothic and Greek architecture, but decided he was not interested enough in architecture to dedicate his life to it. He then took up painting, poetry and music. It was in Europe that, encouraged by his teacher Lazare L\u00e9vy, he first heard the music of contemporary composers (such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith) and finally got to know the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, which he had not experienced before.\nAfter several months in Paris, Cage's enthusiasm for America was revived after he read Walt Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass\"\u2014he wanted to return immediately, but his parents, with whom he regularly exchanged letters during the entire trip, persuaded him to stay in Europe for a little longer and explore the continent. Cage started traveling, visiting various places in France, Germany, and Spain, as well as Capri and, most importantly, Majorca, where he started composing. His first compositions were created using dense mathematical formulas, but Cage was displeased with the results and left the finished pieces behind when he left. Cage's association with theater also started in Europe: during a walk in Seville he witnessed, in his own words, \"the multiplicity of simultaneous visual and audible events all going together in one's experience and producing enjoyment.\"\n1931\u20131936: Apprenticeship.\nCage returned to the United States in 1931. He went to Santa Monica, California, where he made a living partly by giving small, private lectures on contemporary art. He got to know various important figures of the Southern California art world, including arts patron Galka Scheyer and his later composition teacher Richard Buhlig. By 1933, Cage had decided to concentrate on music rather than painting. \"The people who heard my music had better things to say about it than the people who looked at my paintings had to say about my paintings\", Cage later explained. In 1933, he sent some of his compositions to Henry Cowell; the reply was a \"rather vague letter\", in which Cowell suggested that Cage study with Arnold Schoenberg\u2014Cage's musical ideas at the time included composition based on a 25-tone row, somewhat similar to Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. Cowell also advised that, before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, a former Schoenberg pupil. Weiss had been asked by Schoenberg to be his assistant and to train students who might not be ready for Schoenberg's teaching.\nFollowing Cowell's advice, Cage traveled to New York City in 1933 and started studying with Weiss as well as taking lessons from Cowell himself at The New School. He supported himself financially by taking up a job washing walls at a YWCA (Young Women's Christian Association) in Brooklyn. Cage's routine during that period was apparently very tiring, with just four hours of sleep on most nights, and four hours of composition every day starting at 4\u00a0am. Several months later, still in 1933, Cage became sufficiently good at composition to approach Schoenberg. He could not afford Schoenberg's price, and when he mentioned it, the older composer asked whether Cage would devote his life to music. After Cage replied that he would, Schoenberg offered to tutor him free of charge.\nCage studied with Schoenberg in California: first at University of Southern California and then at University of California, Los Angeles, as well as privately. The older composer became one of the biggest influences on Cage, who \"literally worshipped him\", particularly as an example of how to live one's life being a composer. The vow Cage gave, to dedicate his life to music, was apparently still important some 40 years later, when Cage \"had no need for it [i.e. writing music]\", he continued composing partly because of the promise he gave. Schoenberg's methods and their influence on Cage are well documented by Cage himself in various lectures and writings. Particularly well-known is the conversation mentioned in the 1958 lecture \"Indeterminacy\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;After I had been studying with him for two years, Schoenberg said, \"In order to write music, you must have a feeling for harmony.\" I explained to him that I had no feeling for harmony. He then said that I would always encounter an obstacle, that it would be as though I came to a wall through which I could not pass. I said, \"In that case I will devote my life to beating my head against that wall.\"\nCage studied with Schoenberg for two years, but although he admired his teacher, he decided to leave after Schoenberg told the assembled students that he was trying to make it impossible for them to write music. Much later, Cage recounted the incident: \"... When he said that, I revolted, not against him, but against what he had said. I determined then and there, more than ever before, to write music.\" Although Schoenberg was not impressed with Cage's compositional abilities during these two years, in a later interview, where he initially said that none of his American pupils were interesting, he further stated in reference to Cage: \"There was one ... of course he's not a composer, but he's an inventor\u2014of genius.\" Cage would later adopt the \"inventor\" moniker and deny that he was in fact a composer.\nAt some point in 1934\u201335, during his studies with Schoenberg, Cage was working at his mother's arts and crafts shop, where he met artist Xenia Andreyevna Kashevaroff. She was an Alaskan-born daughter of a Russian priest; her work encompassed fine bookbinding, sculpture and collage. Although Cage was involved in relationships with Don Sample and with architect Rudolph Schindler's wife Pauline, when he met Xenia, he fell in love immediately. Cage and Kashevaroff were married in the desert at Yuma, Arizona, on June 7, 1935.\n1937\u20131949: Modern dance and Eastern influences.\nThe newly-married couple first lived with Cage's parents in Pacific Palisades, then moved to Hollywood. During 1936\u201338, Cage changed jobs multiple times, including to one that started his lifelong association with modern dance: dance accompanist at the University of California, Los Angeles. He produced music for choreographies and at one point taught a course on \"Musical Accompaniments for Rhythmic Expression\" at UCLA with his aunt Phoebe. It was during that time that Cage first started experimenting with unorthodox instruments, such as household items, metal sheets, and so on. This was inspired by Oskar Fischinger, who told Cage that \"everything in the world has a spirit that can be released through its sound.\" Although Cage did not share the idea of spirits, these words inspired him to begin exploring the sounds produced by hitting various non-musical objects.\nIn 1938, on Cowell's recommendation, Cage drove to San Francisco to find employment and to seek out fellow Cowell student and composer Lou Harrison. According to Cowell, the two composers had a shared interest in percussion and dance and would likely hit it off. Indeed, upon meeting the two immediately established a strong bond and began a working relationship that continued for several years. Harrison soon helped Cage to secure a faculty position at Mills College, teaching the same program as at UCLA and collaborating with choreographer Marian van Tuyl. Several famous dance groups were present, and Cage's interest in modern dance grew further. After several months, he left and moved to Seattle, Washington, where he found work as composer and accompanist for choreographer Bonnie Bird at the Cornish College of the Arts. The Cornish School years proved to be a particularly important period in Cage's life. Aside from teaching and working as accompanist, Cage organized a percussion ensemble that toured the West Coast and brought the composer his first fame. His reputation was enhanced further with the invention of the prepared piano\u2014a piano which has had its sound altered by objects placed on, beneath, or between the strings\u2014in 1940. This concept was originally intended for a performance staged in a room too small to include a full percussion ensemble. It was also at the Cornish School that Cage met several people who became lifelong friends, such as painter Mark Tobey and dancer Merce Cunningham. The latter was to become Cage's lifelong romantic partner and artistic collaborator.\nCage left Seattle in the summer of 1941 after the painter L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy invited him to teach at the Chicago School of Design (what later became the IIT Institute of Design). The composer accepted partly because he hoped to find opportunities to organize a center for experimental music that were not available in Seattle. These opportunities did not materialize. Cage taught at the Chicago School of Design and worked as accompanist and composer at the University of Chicago. At one point, his reputation as percussion composer landed him a commission from the Columbia Broadcasting System to compose a soundtrack for a radio play by Kenneth Patchen. The result, \"The City Wears a Slouch Hat\", was received well, and Cage deduced that more important commissions would follow. Hoping to find these, he left Chicago for New York City in the spring of 1942.\nIn New York, the Cages first stayed with painter Max Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim. Through them, Cage met important artists such as Piet Mondrian, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Jackson Pollock, Marcel Duchamp, and many others. Guggenheim was very supportive: the Cages could stay with her and Ernst for any length of time, and she offered to organize a concert of Cage's music at the opening of her gallery, which included paying for transportation of Cage's percussion instruments from Chicago. After she learned that Cage had secured a concert at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Guggenheim withdrew all support, and, even after the ultimately successful MoMA concert, Cage was left homeless, unemployed, and penniless. The commissions he hoped for did not happen. He and Xenia spent the summer of 1942 with dancer Jean Erdman and her husband Joseph Campbell. Without the percussion instruments, Cage again turned to prepared piano, producing a substantial body of works for performances by various choreographers, including Merce Cunningham, who had moved to New York City several years earlier. Cage and Cunningham eventually became romantically involved, and Cage's marriage, already breaking up during the early 1940s, ended in divorce in 1945. Cunningham remained Cage's partner for the rest of his life. Cage also countered the lack of percussion instruments by writing, on one occasion, for voice and closed piano: the resulting piece, \"The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs\" (1942), quickly became popular and was performed by the celebrated duo of Cathy Berberian and Luciano Berio. In 1944, he appeared in Maya Deren's \"At Land\", a 15-minute silent experimental film.\nLike his personal life, Cage's artistic life went through a crisis in the mid-1940s. The composer was experiencing a growing disillusionment with the idea of music as means of communication: the public rarely accepted his work, and Cage himself, too, had trouble understanding the music of his colleagues. In early 1946, Cage agreed to tutor Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the US to study Western music. In return, he asked her to teach him about Indian music and philosophy. Cage also attended, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, D. T. Suzuki's lectures on Zen Buddhism, and read further the works of Coomaraswamy. The first fruits of these studies were works inspired by Indian concepts: \"Sonatas and Interludes\" for prepared piano, \"String Quartet in Four Parts\", and others. Cage accepted the goal of music as explained to him by Sarabhai: \"to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences\".\nEarly in 1946, his former teacher Richard Buhlig arranged for Cage to meet Berlin-born pianist Grete Sultan, who had escaped from Nazi persecution to New York in 1941. They became close, lifelong friends, and Cage later dedicated part of his \"Music for Piano\" and his monumental piano cycle \"Etudes Australes\" to her. In 1949, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship.\n1950s: Discovering chance.\nAfter a 1949 performance at Carnegie Hall, New York, Cage received a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation, which enabled him to make a trip to Europe, where he met composers such as Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez. More important was Cage's chance encounter with Morton Feldman in New York City in early 1950. Both composers attended a New York Philharmonic concert, where the orchestra performed Anton Webern's \"Symphony\", followed by a piece by Sergei Rachmaninoff. Cage felt so overwhelmed by Webern's piece that he left before the Rachmaninoff; and in the lobby, he met Feldman, who was leaving for the same reason. The two composers quickly became friends; some time later Cage, Feldman, Earle Brown, David Tudor and Cage's pupil Christian Wolff came to be referred to as \"the New York school\".\nIn early 1951, Wolff presented Cage with a copy of the \"I Ching\"\u2014a Chinese classic text which describes a symbol system used to identify order in chance events. This version of the \"I Ching\" was the first complete English translation and had been published by Wolff's father, Kurt Wolff of Pantheon Books in 1950. The \"I Ching\" is commonly used for divination, but for Cage it became a tool to compose using chance. To compose a piece of music, Cage would come up with questions to ask the \"I Ching\"; the book would then be used in much the same way as it is used for divination. For Cage, this meant \"imitating nature in its manner of operation\". His lifelong interest in sound itself culminated in an approach that yielded works in which sounds were free from the composer's will:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When I hear what we call music, it seems to me that someone is talking. And talking about his feelings, or about his ideas of relationships. But when I hear traffic, the sound of traffic\u2014here on Sixth Avenue, for instance\u2014I don't have the feeling that anyone is talking. I have the feeling that sound is acting. And I love the activity of sound ... I don't need sound to talk to me.\nAlthough Cage had used chance on a few earlier occasions, most notably in the third movement of \"Concerto for Prepared Piano and Chamber Orchestra\" (1950\u201351), the \"I Ching\" opened new possibilities in this field for him. The first results of the new approach were \"Imaginary Landscape No. 4\" for 12 radio receivers, and \"Music of Changes\" for piano. The latter work was written for David Tudor, whom Cage met through Feldman\u2014another friendship that lasted until Cage's death. Tudor premiered most of Cage's works until the early 1960s, when he stopped performing on the piano and concentrated on composing music. The \"I Ching\" became Cage's standard tool for composition: he used it in practically every work composed after 1951, and eventually settled on a computer algorithm that calculated numbers in a manner similar to throwing coins for the \"I Ching\".\nDespite the fame \"Sonatas and Interludes\" earned him, and the connections he cultivated with American and European composers and musicians, Cage was quite poor. Although he still had an apartment at 326 Monroe Street (which he had occupied since around 1946), his financial situation in 1951 worsened so much that while working on \"Music of Changes\", he prepared a set of instructions for Tudor as to how to complete the piece in the event of his death. Nevertheless, Cage managed to survive and maintained an active artistic life with lectures and performances.\nIn 1952\u20131953, he completed another mammoth project\u2014the \"Williams Mix\", a piece of tape music, which Earle Brown and Morton Feldman helped to put together. Also in 1952, Cage composed the piece that became his best-known and most controversial creation: \"4\u203233\u2033\". The score instructs the performer not to play the instrument during the entire duration of the piece\u2014four minutes, thirty-three seconds\u2014and is meant to be perceived as consisting of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed. Cage had conceived of \"a silent piece\" years earlier, but was reluctant to write it down; indeed, the premiere (given by Tudor on August 29, 1952, at Woodstock, New York) caused an uproar in the audience. The reaction to \"4\u203233\u2033\" was just a part of the larger picture: on the whole, it was the adoption of chance procedures that had disastrous consequences for Cage's reputation. The press, which used to react favorably to earlier percussion and prepared piano music, ignored his new works, and many valuable friendships and connections were lost. Pierre Boulez, who used to promote Cage's work in Europe, was opposed to Cage's particular approach to the use of chance, and so were other composers who came to prominence during the 1950s, such as Karlheinz Stockhausen.\nDuring this time, Cage was also teaching at the avant-garde Black Mountain College just outside Asheville, North Carolina. Cage taught at the college in the summers of 1948 and 1952 and was in residence the summer of 1953. While at Black Mountain College in 1952, he organized what has been called the first \"happening\" (see discussion below) in the United States, later titled \"Theatre Piece No. 1\", a multi-layered, multi-media performance event staged the same day as Cage conceived it that \"that would greatly influence 1950s and 60s artistic practices\". In addition to Cage, the participants included Cunningham and Tudor.\nFrom 1953 onward, Cage was busy composing music for modern dance, particularly Cunningham's dances (Cage's partner adopted chance too, out of fascination for the movement of the human body), as well as developing new methods of using chance, in a series of works he referred to as \"The Ten Thousand Things\". In the summer of 1954 he moved out of New York and settled in Gate Hill Cooperative, a community in Stony Point, New York, where his neighbors included David Tudor, M. C. Richards, Karen Karnes, Stan VanDerBeek, and Sari Dienes. The composer's financial situation gradually improved: in late 1954 he and Tudor were able to embark on a European tour. From 1956 to 1961 Cage taught classes in experimental composition at The New School, and from 1956 to 1958 he also worked as an art director and designer of typography. Among the works completed during the last years of the decade were \"Concert for Piano and Orchestra\" (1957\u201358), a seminal work in the history of graphic notation, and \"Variations I\" (1958).\n1960s: Fame.\nCage was affiliated with Wesleyan University and collaborated with members of its music department from the 1950s until his death in 1992. At the university, the philosopher, poet, and professor of classics Norman O. Brown befriended Cage, an association that proved fruitful to both. In 1960 the composer was appointed a fellow on the faculty of the Center for Advanced Studies (now the Center for Humanities) in the Liberal Arts and Sciences at Wesleyan, where he started teaching classes in experimental music. In October 1961, Wesleyan University Press published \"\", a collection of Cage's lectures and writings on a wide variety of subjects, including the famous \"Lecture on Nothing\" that was composed using a complex time length scheme, much like some of Cage's music. \"Silence\" was Cage's first book of six but it remains his most widely read and influential. In the early 1960s Cage began his lifelong association with C.F. Peters Corporation. Walter Hinrichsen, the president of the corporation, offered Cage an exclusive contract and instigated the publication of a catalog of Cage's works, which appeared in 1962.\nEdition Peters soon published a large number of scores by Cage, and this, together with the publication of \"Silence\", led to much greater prominence for the composer than ever before\u2014one of the positive consequences of this was that in 1965, Betty Freeman set up an annual grant for living expenses for Cage which continued until his death. By the mid-1960s, Cage was receiving so many commissions and requests for appearances that he was unable to fulfill them. This was accompanied by a busy touring schedule; consequently Cage's compositional output from that decade was scant. After the orchestral \"Atlas Eclipticalis\" (1961\u201362), a fully notated work based on star charts, Cage gradually shifted to, in his own words, \"music (not composition).\" The score of \"0\u203200\u2033\", completed in 1962, originally comprised a single sentence: \"In a situation provided with maximum amplification, perform a disciplined action\", and in the first performance the disciplined action was Cage writing that sentence. The score of \"Variations III\" (1962) abounds in instructions to the performers, but makes no references to music, musical instruments, or sounds.\nMany of the \"Variations\" and other 1960s pieces were in fact \"happenings\", an art form established by Cage and his students in late 1950s. Cage's \"Experimental Composition\" classes at The New School have become legendary as an American source of Fluxus, an international network of artists, composers, and designers. The majority of his students had little or no background in music. Most were artists. They included Jackson Mac Low, Allan Kaprow, Al Hansen, George Brecht, Ben Patterson, and Dick Higgins, as well as many others Cage invited unofficially. Famous pieces that resulted from the classes include George Brecht's \"Time Table Music\" and Al Hansen's \"Alice Denham in 48 Seconds\". As set forth by Cage, \"happenings\" were theatrical events that abandon the traditional concept of stage-audience and occur without a sense of definite duration. Instead, they are left to chance. They have a minimal script, with no plot. In fact, a \"happening\" is so-named because it occurs in the present, attempting to arrest the concept of passing time. Cage believed that theater was the closest route to integrating art and real life. The term \"happenings\" was coined by Allan Kaprow, one of his students, who defined it as a genre in the late fifties. Cage met Kaprow while on a mushroom hunt with George Segal and invited him to join his class. In following these developments Cage was strongly influenced by Antonin Artaud's seminal treatise \"The Theatre and Its Double\", and the happenings of this period can be viewed as a forerunner to the ensuing Fluxus movement. In October 1960, Mary Bauermeister's Cologne studio hosted a joint concert by Cage and the video artist Nam June Paik (Cage's friend and mentee), who in the course of his performance of \"Etude for Piano\" cut off Cage's tie and then poured a bottle of shampoo over the heads of Cage and Tudor.\nIn 1967, Cage's book \"A Year from Monday\" was first published by Wesleyan University Press. Cage's parents died during the decade: his father in 1964, and his mother in 1969. Cage had their ashes scattered in Ramapo Mountains, near Stony Point, and asked for the same to be done to him after his death.\n1969\u20131987: New departures.\nCage's work from the sixties features some of his largest and most ambitious, not to mention socially utopian pieces, reflecting the mood of the era yet also his absorption of the writings of both Marshall McLuhan, on the effects of new media, and R. Buckminster Fuller, on the power of technology to promote social change. \"HPSCHD\" (1969), a gargantuan and long-running multimedia work made in collaboration with Lejaren Hiller, incorporated the mass superimposition of seven harpsichords playing chance-determined excerpts from the works of Cage, Hiller, and a potted history of canonical classics, with 52 tapes of computer-generated sounds, 6,400 slides of designs, many supplied by NASA, and shown from sixty-four slide projectors, with 40 motion-picture films. The piece was initially rendered in a five-hour performance at the University of Illinois in 1969, in which the audience arrived after the piece had begun and left before it ended, wandering freely around the auditorium in the time for which they were there.\nAlso in 1969, Cage produced the first fully notated work in years: \"Cheap Imitation\" for piano. The piece is a chance-controlled reworking of Erik Satie's \"Socrate\", and, as both listeners and Cage himself noted, openly sympathetic to its source. Although Cage's affection for Satie's music was well-known, it was highly unusual for him to compose a personal work, one in which the composer \"is\" present. When asked about this apparent contradiction, Cage replied: \"Obviously, \"Cheap Imitation\" lies outside of what may seem necessary in my work in general, and that's disturbing. I'm the first to be disturbed by it.\" Cage's fondness for the piece resulted in a recording\u2014a rare occurrence, since Cage disliked making recordings of his music\u2014made in 1976. Overall, \"Cheap Imitation\" marked a major change in Cage's music: he turned again to writing fully notated works for traditional instruments, and tried out several new approaches, such as improvisation, which he previously discouraged, but was able to use in works from the 1970s, such as \"Child of Tree\" (1975).\n\"Cheap Imitation\" became the last work Cage performed in public himself. Arthritis had troubled Cage since 1960, and by the early 1970s his hands were painfully swollen and rendered him unable to perform. Nevertheless, he still played \"Cheap Imitation\" during the 1970s, before finally having to give up performing. Preparing manuscripts also became difficult: before, published versions of pieces were done in Cage's calligraphic script; now, manuscripts for publication had to be completed by assistants. Matters were complicated further by David Tudor's departure from performing in the early 1970s. Tudor decided to concentrate on composition instead, and so Cage, for the first time in two decades, had to rely on other performers and their respective abilities. Such performers included Grete Sultan, Paul Zukofsky, Margaret Leng Tan, and many others. Aside from music, Cage continued writing books of prose and poetry (mesostics). \"M\" was first published by Wesleyan University Press in 1973. In January 1978 Cage was invited by Kathan Brown of Crown Point Press to engage in printmaking, and Cage would go on to produce series of prints every year until his death; these, together with some late watercolors, constitute the largest portion of his extant visual art. In 1979 Cage's \"Empty Words\" was first published by Wesleyan University Press.\n1987\u20131992: Final years and death.\nIn 1987, Cage completed a piece called \"Two\", for flute and piano, dedicated to performers Roberto Fabbriciani and Carlo Neri. The title referred to the number of performers needed; the music consisted of short notated fragments to be played at any tempo within the indicated time constraints. Cage went on to write some forty such \"Number Pieces\", as they came to be known, usually employing a variant of the same technique; one of the last was \"Eighty\" (1992, premiered in Munich on October 28, 2011). The process of composition in many of the later Number Pieces, was simple selection of pitch range and pitches from that range, using chance procedures; the music has been linked to Cage's anarchic leanings. \"One11\" (i.e., the eleventh piece for a single performer), completed in early 1992, was Cage's first and only foray into film. Cage conceived his last musical work with Michael Bach: \"ONE13\" for violoncello with curved bow and three loudspeakers, which was published years later.\nAnother new direction, also taken in 1987, was opera: Cage produced five operas, all sharing the same title \"Europera\", between 1987\u201391. \"Europeras I\" and \"II\" require greater resources than \"III\", \"IV\", and \"V\", which are on a chamber scale. They were commissioned by the Oper Frankfurt to celebrate his 75th birthday, and according to music critic Mark Swed, they took \"an enormous effort on the composer's part\u2013requiring two full-time assistants and two computers humming day and night.\" These pieces caused quite a stir in the world of opera at the time with their unconventional methods for staging and sequencing. Many standard pieces of operatic repertoire were used, but not in any preset order; rather, they were selected by chance, meaning no two performances were exactly alike. Many of those who were to be a part of these performances refused to participate, citing the impossibility of the requests Cage was making. Days before \"Europeras I and II\" were to be premiered, Frankfurt's opera house was damaged by fire, setting into motion a series of setbacks leading to a theatrical run met with mixed reactions, including a performance so bad that Cage penned a letter to his musicians criticizing their interpretation of his composition.In the course of the 1980s, Cage's health worsened progressively. He suffered not only from arthritis, but also from sciatica and arteriosclerosis. He had a stroke that left the movement of his left leg restricted, and, in 1985, broke an arm. During this time, Cage pursued a macrobiotic diet. Nevertheless, ever since arthritis started plaguing him, the composer was aware of his age, and, as biographer David Revill observed, \"the fire which he began to incorporate in his visual work in 1985 is not only the fire he has set aside for so long\u2014the fire of passion\u2014but also fire as transitoriness and fragility.\" On August 11, 1992, while preparing evening tea for himself and Cunningham, Cage had another stroke. He was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, where he died on the morning of August 12. He was 79.\nAccording to his wishes, Cage's body was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Ramapo Mountains, near Stony Point, New York, at the same place where he had scattered the ashes of his parents. The composer's death occurred only weeks before a celebration of his 80th birthday organized in Frankfurt by composer Walter Zimmermann and musicologist Stefan Schaedler. The event went ahead as planned, including a performance of the \"Concert for Piano and Orchestra\" by David Tudor and Ensemble Modern. Merce Cunningham died of natural causes in July 2009.\nMusic.\nEarly works, rhythmic structure, and new approaches to harmony.\nCage's first completed pieces have been lost. According to the composer, the earliest works were very short pieces for piano, composed using complex mathematical procedures and lacking in \"sensual appeal and expressive power.\" Cage then started producing pieces by improvising and writing down the results, until Richard Buhlig stressed to him the importance of structure. Most works from the early 1930s, such as \"Sonata for Clarinet\" (1933) and \"Composition for 3 Voices\" (1934), are highly chromatic and betray Cage's interest in counterpoint. Around the same time, the composer also developed a type of a tone row technique with 25-note rows. After studies with Schoenberg, who never taught dodecaphony to his students, Cage developed another tone row technique, in which the row was split into short motives, which would then be repeated and transposed according to a set of rules. This approach was first used in \"Two Pieces for Piano\" (c.\u20091935), and then, with modifications, in larger works such as \"Metamorphosis\" and \"Five Songs\" (both 1938).\nSoon after Cage started writing percussion music and music for modern dance, he started using a technique that placed the rhythmic structure of the piece into the foreground. In \"Imaginary Landscape No. 1\" (1939) there are four large sections of 16, 17, 18, and 19 bars, and each section is divided into four subsections, the first three of which were all 5 bars long. \"First Construction (in Metal)\" (1939) expands on the concept: there are five sections of 4, 3, 2, 3, and 4 units respectively. Each unit contains 16 bars, and is divided the same way: 4 bars, 3 bars, 2 bars, etc. Finally, the musical content of the piece is based on sixteen motives. Such \"nested proportions\", as Cage called them, became a regular feature of his music throughout the 1940s. The technique was elevated to great complexity in later pieces such as \"Sonatas and Interludes\" for prepared piano (1946\u201348), in which many proportions used non-integer numbers (1\u00bc, \u00be, 1\u00bc, \u00be, 1\u00bd, and 1\u00bd for \"Sonata I\", for example), or \"A Flower\", a song for voice and closed piano, in which two sets of proportions are used simultaneously.\nIn late 1940s, Cage started developing further methods of breaking away with traditional harmony. For instance, in \"String Quartet in Four Parts\" (1950) Cage first composed a number of \"gamuts\": chords with fixed instrumentation. The piece progresses from one \"gamut\" to another. In each instance the \"gamut\" was selected only based on whether it contains the note necessary for the melody, and so the rest of the notes do not form any directional harmony. \"Concerto for prepared piano\" (1950\u201351) used a system of charts of durations, dynamics, melodies, etc., from which Cage would choose using simple geometric patterns. The last movement of the concerto was a step towards using chance procedures, which Cage adopted soon afterwards.\nChance.\nA chart system was also used (along with nested proportions) for the large piano work \"Music of Changes\" (1951), only here material would be selected from the charts by using the \"I Ching\". All of Cage's music since 1951 was composed using chance procedures, most commonly using the \"I Ching\". For example, works from \"Music for Piano\" were based on paper imperfections: the imperfections themselves provided pitches, coin tosses and \"I Ching\" hexagram numbers were used to determine the accidentals, clefs, and playing techniques. A whole series of works was created by applying chance operations, i.e. the \"I Ching\", to star charts: \"Atlas Eclipticalis\" (1961\u201362), and a series of etudes: \"Etudes Australes\" (1974\u201375), \"Freeman Etudes\" (1977\u201390), and \"Etudes Boreales\" (1978). Cage's etudes are all extremely difficult to perform, a characteristic dictated by Cage's social and political views: the difficulty would ensure that \"a performance would show that the impossible is not impossible\"\u2014this being Cage's answer to the notion that solving the world's political and social problems is impossible. Cage described himself as an anarchist, and was influenced by Henry David Thoreau.\nAnother series of works applied chance procedures to pre-existing music by other composers: \"Cheap Imitation\" (1969; based on Erik Satie), \"Some of \"The Harmony of Maine\"\" (1978; based on Belcher), and \"Hymns and Variations\" (1979). In these works, Cage would borrow the rhythmic structure of the originals and fill it with pitches determined through chance procedures, or just replace some of the originals' pitches. Yet another series of works, the so-called \"Number Pieces\", all completed during the last five years of the composer's life, make use of \"time brackets\": the score consists of short fragments with indications of when to start and to end them (e.g. from anywhere between 1\u203215\" and 1\u203245\", and to anywhere from 2\u203200\" to 2\u203230\").\nCage's method of using the \"I Ching\" was far from simple randomization. The procedures varied from composition to composition, and were usually complex. For example, in the case of \"Cheap Imitation\", the exact questions asked to the \"I Ching\" were these:\nIn another example of late music by Cage, \"Etudes Australes\", the compositional procedure involved placing a transparent strip on the star chart, identifying the pitches from the chart, transferring them to paper, then asking the \"I Ching\" which of these pitches were to remain single, and which should become parts of aggregates (chords), and the aggregates were selected from a table of some 550 possible aggregates, compiled beforehand.\nFinally, some of Cage's works, particularly those completed during the 1960s, feature instructions to the performer, rather than fully notated music. The score of \"Variations I\" (1958) presents the performer with six transparent squares, one with points of various sizes, five with five intersecting lines. The performer combines the squares and uses lines and points as a coordinate system, in which the lines are axes of various characteristics of the sounds, such as lowest frequency, simplest overtone structure, etc. Some of Cage's graphic scores (e.g. \"Concert for Piano and Orchestra\", \"Fontana Mix\" (both 1958)) present the performer with similar difficulties. Still other works from the same period consist just of text instructions. The score of \"0\u203200\u2033\" (1962; also known as \"4\u203233\u2033 No. 2\") consists of a single sentence: \"In a situation provided with maximum amplification, perform a disciplined action.\" The first performance had Cage write that sentence.\n\"Musicircus\" (1967) simply invites the performers to assemble and play together. The first \"Musicircus\" featured multiple performers and groups in a large space who were all to commence and stop playing at two particular time periods, with instructions on when to play individually or in groups within these two periods. The result was a mass superimposition of many different musics on top of one another as determined by chance distribution, producing an event with a specifically theatric feel. Many Musicircuses have subsequently been held, and continue to occur even after Cage's death. The English National Opera (ENO) became the first opera company to hold a Cage Musicircus on March 3, 2012, at the London Coliseum. The ENO's Musicircus featured artists including Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones and composer Michael Finnissy alongside ENO music director Edward Gardner, the ENO Community Choir, ENO Opera Works singers, and a collective of professional and amateur talents performing in the bars and front of house at London's Coliseum Opera House.\nThis concept of circus was to remain important to Cage throughout his life and featured strongly in such pieces as \"Roaratorio, an Irish circus on Finnegans Wake\" (1979), a many-tiered rendering in sound of both his text \"Writing for the Second Time Through Finnegans Wake\", and traditional musical and field recordings made around Ireland. The piece was based on James Joyce's famous novel, \"Finnegans Wake\", which was one of Cage's favorite books, and one from which he derived texts for several more of his works.\nImprovisation.\nSince chance procedures were used by Cage to eliminate the composer's and the performer's likes and dislikes from music, Cage disliked the concept of improvisation, which is inevitably linked to the performer's preferences. In a number of works beginning in the 1970s, he found ways to incorporate improvisation. In \"Child of Tree\" (1975) and \"Branches\" (1976) the performers are asked to use certain species of plants as instruments, for example the cactus. The structure of the pieces is determined through the chance of their choices, as is the musical output; the performers had no knowledge of the instruments. In \"Inlets\" (1977) the performers play large water-filled conch shells \u2013 by carefully tipping the shell several times, it is possible to achieve a bubble forming inside, which produced sound. Yet, as it is impossible to predict when this would happen, the performers had to continue tipping the shells \u2013 as a result the performance was dictated by pure chance.\nVisual art, writings, and other activities.\nAlthough Cage started painting in his youth, he gave it up to concentrate on music instead. His first mature visual project, \"Not Wanting to Say Anything About Marcel\", dates from 1969. The work comprises two lithographs and a group of what Cage called \"plexigrams\": silk screen printing on plexiglas panels. The panels and the lithographs all consist of bits and pieces of words in different typefaces, all governed by chance operations.\nFrom 1978 to his death, Cage worked at Crown Point Press, producing series of prints every year. The earliest project completed there was the etching \"Score Without Parts\" (1978), created from fully notated instructions, and based on various combinations of drawings by Henry David Thoreau. This was followed, the same year, by \"Seven Day Diary\", which Cage drew with his eyes closed, but which conformed to a strict structure developed using chance operations. Finally, Thoreau's drawings informed the last works produced in 1978, \"Signals\".\nBetween 1979 and 1982, Cage produced a number of large series of prints: \"Changes and Disappearances\" (1979\u201380), \"On the Surface\" (1980\u201382), and \"D\u00e9reau\" (1982). These were the last works in which he used engraving. In 1983 he started using various unconventional materials such as cotton batting, foam, etc., and then used stones and fire (\"Eninka\", \"Variations\", \"Ryoanji\", etc.) to create his visual works. In 1988\u20131990, he produced watercolors at the Mountain Lake Workshop.\nIn the 1980s, Cage participated in the Mountain Lake Workshop, an experimental art symposium directed by Virginia Tech professor Ray Kass in southwestern Virginia. There, he produced a series of collaborative visual works that extended his interest in chance operations, including large-scale watercolor and print projects. Beginning in 1983, he worked with watercolors using methods such as controlled pours, chance-derived grids, and painting around stones with brushes made from feathers, techniques that emphasized indeterminacy within a structured process. The workshops allowed Cage to apply his musical concepts to visual art, and this period became a notable part of his late visual art practice. It is documented in \"The Mountain Lake Symposium and Workshop: Art in Locale\" (2018).\nThe only film Cage produced was one of the Number Pieces, \"One11\", commissioned by composer and film director Henning Lohner who worked with Cage to produce and direct the 90-minute monochrome film. It was completed only weeks before his death in 1992. \"One11\" consists entirely of images of chance-determined play of electric light. It premiered in Cologne, Germany, on September 19, 1992, accompanied by the live performance of the orchestra piece \"103\".\nThroughout his adult life, Cage was also active as lecturer and writer. Some of his lectures were included in several books he published, the first of which was \"Silence: Lectures and Writings\" (1961). \"Silence\" included not only simple lectures, but also texts executed in experimental layouts, and works such as \"Lecture on Nothing\" (1949), which were composed in rhythmic structures. Subsequent books also featured different types of content, from lectures on music to poetry\u2014Cage's mesostics.\nCage was also an avid amateur mycologist. In the fall of 1969, he gave a lecture on the subject of edible mushrooms at the University of California, Davis as part of his \"Music in Dialogue\" course. He co-founded the New York Mycological Society with four friends, and his mycology collection is presently housed by the Special Collections department of the McHenry Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\nReception and influence.\nCage's pre-chance works, particularly pieces from the late 1940s such as \"Sonatas and Interludes\", earned critical acclaim: the \"Sonatas\" were performed at Carnegie Hall in 1949. Cage's adoption of chance operations in 1951 cost him a number of friendships and led to numerous criticisms from fellow composers. Adherents of serialism such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen dismissed indeterminate music; Boulez, who was once on friendly terms with Cage, criticized him for \"adoption of a philosophy tinged with Orientalism that masks a basic weakness in compositional technique.\" Prominent critics of serialism, such as the Greek composer Iannis Xenakis, were similarly hostile towards Cage: for Xenakis, the adoption of chance in music was \"an abuse of language and ... an abrogation of a composer's function.\"\nAn article by teacher and critic Michael Steinberg, \"Tradition and Responsibility\", criticized avant-garde music in general:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The rise of music that is totally without social commitment also increases the separation between composer and public, and represents still another form of departure from tradition. The cynicism with which this particular departure seems to have been made is perfectly symbolized in John Cage's account of a public lecture he had given: \"Later, during the question period, I gave one of six previously prepared answers regardless of the question asked. This was a reflection of my engagement in Zen.\" While Mr. Cage's famous silent piece [i.e. \"4\u203233\u2033\"], or his \"Landscapes\" for a dozen radio receivers may be of little interest as music, they are of enormous importance historically as representing the complete abdication of the artist's power.\nCage's aesthetic position was criticized by, among others, prominent writer and critic Douglas Kahn. In his 1999 book \"Noise, Water, Meat: A History of Sound in the Arts\", Kahn acknowledged the influence Cage had on culture, but noted that \"one of the central effects of Cage's battery of silencing techniques was a silencing of the social.\"\nWhile much of Cage's work remains controversial, his influence on countless composers, artists, and writers is notable. After Cage introduced chance procedures to his works, Boulez, Stockhausen, and Xenakis remained critical, yet all adopted chance procedures in some of their works (although in a much more restricted manner); and Stockhausen's piano writing in his later \"\" was influenced by Cage's \"Music of Changes\" and David Tudor. Other composers who adopted chance procedures in their works included Witold Lutos\u0142awski, Mauricio Kagel, and many others. Music in which some of the composition and/or performance is left to chance was labelled \"aleatoric music\"\u2014a term popularized by Pierre Boulez. Helmut Lachenmann's work was influenced by Cage's work with extended techniques.\nCage's rhythmic structure experiments and his interest in sound influenced a number of composers, starting at first with his close American associates Earle Brown, Morton Feldman, and Christian Wolff (and other American composers, such as La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass), and then spreading to Europe. For example, many composers of the English experimental school acknowledge his influence: Michael Parsons, Christopher Hobbs, John White, Gavin Bryars, who studied under Cage briefly, and Howard Skempton. The Japanese composer T\u014dru Takemitsu has also cited Cage's influence. In 1986, he received an honorary doctorate from the California Institute of the Arts. Cage is a 1989 Kyoto Prize Laureate; the prize was established by Kazuo Inamori. The John Cage Award was endowed and established in 1992 by Foundation for Contemporary Arts in honor of the late composer, with recipients including Meredith Monk, Robert Ashley, and Toshi Ichiyanagi.\nFollowing Cage's death Simon Jeffes, founder of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, composed a piece entitled \"CAGE DEAD\", using a melody based on the notes contained in the title, in the order they appear: C, A, G, E, D, E, A and D.\nCage's influence was also acknowledged by rock acts such as Sonic Youth (who performed some of the Number Pieces) and Stereolab (who named a song after Cage), composer and rock and jazz guitarist Frank Zappa, and various noise music artists and bands: musicologist Paul Hegarty traced the origin of noise music to \"4\u203233\u2033\". The development of electronic music was also influenced by Cage: in the mid-1970s Brian Eno's label Obscure Records released works by Cage. Prepared piano, which Cage popularized, is featured heavily on Aphex Twin's 2001 album \"Drukqs\". Cage's work as musicologist helped popularize Erik Satie's music, and his friendship with Abstract expressionist artists such as Robert Rauschenberg helped introduce his ideas into visual art. Cage's ideas also found their way into sound design: for example, Academy Award-winning sound designer Gary Rydstrom cited Cage's work as a major influence. Radiohead undertook a composing and performing collaboration with Cunningham's dance troupe in 2003 because the music-group's leader Thom Yorke considered Cage one of his \"all-time art heroes\". In The Tragically Hip's 2000 song Tiger the Lion from their album Music @ Work, lyricist Gord Downie refers to Cage and his theories.\nCentenary commemoration.\nIn 2012, among a wide range of American and international centennial celebrations, an eight-day festival was held in Washington DC, with venues found notably more among the city's art museums and universities than performance spaces. Earlier in the centennial year, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas presented Cage's \"Song Books\" with the San Francisco Symphony at Carnegie Hall in New York. Another celebration came, for instance, in Darmstadt, Germany, which in July 2012 renamed its central station the John Cage Railway Station during the term of its annual new-music courses. At the Ruhrtriennale in Germany, Heiner Goebbels staged a production of \"Europeras 1 &amp; 2\" in a 36,000 sq ft converted factory and commissioned a production of \"\" created and performed by Robert Wilson. Jacaranda Music had four concerts planned in Santa Monica, California, for the centennial week. John Cage Day was the name given to several events held during 2012 to mark the centenary of his birth.\nA 2012 project was curated by Juraj Kojs to celebrate the centenary of Cage's birth, titled \"On Silence: Homage to Cage.\" It consisted of 13 commissioned works created by composers from around the globe such as Kasia Glowicka, Adrian Knight and Henry Vega, each being 4 minutes and 33 seconds long in honor of Cage's famous 1952 opus, \"4\u203233\u2033\". The program was supported by the Foundation for Emerging Technologies and Arts, Laura Kuhn and the John Cage Trust.\nIn a homage to Cage's dance work, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company in July 2012 \"performed an engrossing piece called 'Story/Time'. It was modeled on Cage's 1958 work 'Indeterminacy', in which [Cage and then Jones, respectively,] sat alone onstage, reading aloud ... series of one-minute stories [they]'d written. Dancers from Jones's company performed as [Jones] read.\"\nNotes, references, sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal links.\nGeneral information and catalogues\nLink collections\nSpecific topics\nListening\nMedia\nExhibitions"}
{"id": "65955", "revid": "439456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65955", "title": "Denim", "text": "Warp-faced textile\nDenim is a sturdy cotton warp-faced textile in which the weft passes under two or more warp threads. This twill weave produces a diagonal ribbing that distinguishes it from cotton duck. Denim, as it is recognized today, was first produced in N\u00eemes, France.\nDenim is available in a range of colors, but the most common denim is indigo denim in which the warp thread is dyed while the weft thread is left white. As a result of the warp-faced twill weaving, one side of the textile is dominated by the blue warp threads, and the other side is dominated by the white weft threads. Jeans fabricated from this cloth are thus predominantly white on the inside. Denim is used to create a wide variety of garments, accessories, and furniture.\nEtymology.\n\"Denim\" originated as a contraction of the French phrase ('serge from N\u00eemes').\nHistory.\nDenim has been used in the United States since the mid-19th century. Denim initially gained popularity in 1873 when Jacob W. Davis, a tailor from Nevada, manufactured the first pair of rivet-reinforced denim pants. The popularity of denim jeans outstripped the capacity of Davis's small shop, so he moved his production to the facilities of dry goods wholesaler Levi Strauss &amp; Co., which had been supplying Davis with bolts of denim fabric.\nThroughout the 20th century, denim was used for durable uniforms like those issued to staff of the French national railways. In the post-war years, the Royal Air Force issued olive-drab denim coveralls (colloquially known as \"denims\") for dirty work.\nBy the 1970s, denim jeans were such an integral part of youth culture that automobile manufactures, beginning with American Motors Corporation began offering denim-like interior finishes. (Because denim cannot pass fire resistance safety standards, indigo-colored spun nylon or vinyl was used, with contrast-stitching and copper rivets helping to sell the effect.) A Levi's-branded trim package debuted with AMC's 1973 model year. Similar packages were available from Volkswagen from 1973 to 1975 (the \"Jeans Beetle\") and from Jeep from 1975 through 1977.\nCreating denim.\nAll denim is created through generally the same process:\nYarn production.\nTraditional denim yarn is composed entirely of cotton. Once cotton fibers are cleaned and combed into long, cohesive lengths of similar-length fiber, they are spun into yarn using an industrial machine. Throughout the creation of denim, washes, dyes, or treatments are used to change the appearance of denim products.\nSome yarns may substitute an elastane component such as Spandex/Lycra for up to 3% of the cotton, the woven form of which (typically called 'stretch denim') may have a elasticity of up to 15%.\nDyeing.\nDenim was originally dyed with indigo dye extracted from plants, often from the genus \"Indigofera\". In South Asia, indigo dye was extracted from the dried and fermented leaves of \"Indigofera tinctoria\"; this is the plant that is now known as \"true indigo\" or \"natural indigo\". In Europe, the use of \"Isatis tinctoria\", or woad, can be traced back to the 8th century BC, although it was eventually replaced by \"Indigofera tinctoria\" as the superior dye product. However, most denim today is dyed with synthetic indigo dye. In all cases, the yarn undergoes a repeated sequence of dipping and oxidation\u2014the more dips, the stronger the color of the indigo.\nBefore 1915, cotton yarns were dyed using a skein dyeing process, in which individual skeins of yarn were dipped into dye baths. Rope dyeing machines were developed in 1915, and slasher or sheet dyeing machines were developed in the 1970s. These methods involve a series of rollers that feed continuous yarns in and out of dye vats. In rope dyeing, continuous yarns are gathered together into long ropes or groups of yarns \u2013 after these bundles are dyed, they must be re-beamed for weaving. In sheet dyeing, parallel yarns are laid out as a sheet in the same order in which they will be woven; because of this, uneven dye circulation in the bath can lead to side-to-side color variations in the woven cloth. Rope dyeing eliminates this possibility because color variations can be evenly distributed across the warp during beaming.\nDenim fabric dyeing is divided into two categories: indigo dyeing (Indigo dye is a unique shade of blue) and sulfur dyeing (Sulfur dye is a synthetic organic dye and it is formed by sulphurisation of organic intermediates, this contains nitro or amino groups). Indigo dyeing produces the traditional blue color or shades similar to it. Sulfur dyeing produces specialty black and other colors, such as red, pink, purple, grey, rust, mustard, and green.\nWeaving.\nMost denim made today is made on a shuttleless loom that produces bolts of fabric or wider, but some denim is still woven on the traditional shuttle loom, which typically produces a bolt wide. Shuttle-loom-woven denim is usually recognizable by its \"selvedge\" (sometimes written 'selvage'), the edge of a fabric created as a continuous cross-yarn (the weft) reverses direction at the edge side of the shuttle loom. The selvedge is traditionally accentuated with warp threads of one or more contrasting colors, which can serve as an identifying mark.\nAlthough quality denim can be made on either loom, selvedge denim has come to be associated with premium products since final production that showcases the selvedge requires greater care of assemblage.\nThe weight of denim can vary greatly, with a yard of fabric weighing anywhere from , with being typical.\nUses.\nDenim is frequently used for a wide array of consumer products, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nArt.\nDenim has been a medium for many artists.

The Italian libretto was written by Francesco Maria Piave based on the 1832 play \"Le roi s'amuse\" by Victor Hugo. Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere at La Fenice in Venice on 11 March 1851.\nThe work, Verdi's sixteenth in the genre, is widely considered to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career. Its tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua, his hunch-backed court jester Rigoletto, and Rigoletto's daughter Gilda. The opera's original title, \"La maledizione\" (The Curse), refers to a curse placed on both the Duke and Rigoletto by the Count Monterone, whose daughter the Duke has seduced with Rigoletto's encouragement. The curse comes to fruition when Gilda falls in love with the Duke and sacrifices her life to save him from the assassin hired by her father.\nComposition history.\nLa Fenice of Venice commissioned Verdi in 1850 to compose a new opera. He was prominent enough by this time to enjoy some freedom in choosing texts to set to music. He initially asked Francesco Maria Piave (with whom he had already created \"Ernani\", \"I due Foscari\", \"Macbeth\", \"Il corsaro\" and \"Stiffelio\") to examine the play \"Kean\" by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re, but soon came to believe that they needed to find a more energetic subject.\nThat came in the form of Victor Hugo's controversial five-act play \"Le roi s'amuse\" (\"The king amuses himself\"). Verdi later explained that \"The subject is grand, immense, and there is a character that is one of the greatest creations that the theatre can boast of, in any country and in all history.\" However, Hugo's depiction of a venal, cynical, womanizing king (Francis I of France) was considered unacceptably scandalous. The play had been banned in France following its premiere nearly twenty years earlier (not to be staged again until 1882); now it was to come before the Austrian Board of Censors (as Austria at that time directly controlled much of Northern Italy.)\nFrom the beginning, both composer and librettist knew this step would not be easy. As Verdi wrote in a letter to Piave: \"Use four legs, run through the town and find me an influential person who can obtain the permission for making \"Le Roi s'amuse\".\" Guglielmo Brenna, secretary of La Fenice, promised the duo that they would not have problems with the censors. He was wrong, and rumours began to spread in early summer that the production would be forbidden. In August, Verdi and Piave retired to Busseto, Verdi's hometown, to prepare a defensive scheme as they continued work on the opera. Despite their best efforts, including frantic correspondence with La Fenice, the Austrian censor De Gorzkowski emphatically denied consent to the production of \"La Maledizione\" (its working title) in a December 1850 letter, calling the opera \"a repugnant [example of] immorality and obscene triviality.\"\nPiave set to work revising the libretto, eventually pulling from it another opera, \"Il Duca di Vendome\", in which the sovereign was a duke and both the hunchback and the curse disappeared. Verdi was completely against this proposed solution, preferring to negotiate directly with the censors over each and every point of the work. Brenna, La Fenice's sympathetic secretary, mediated the dispute by showing the Austrians some letters and articles depicting the bad character, but great value, of the artist. By January 1851 the parties had settled on a compromise: the action of the opera would be moved, and some of the characters would be renamed. In the new version, the Duke would preside over Mantua and belong to the Gonzaga family. (The House of Gonzaga had long been extinct by the mid-19th century, and the Dukedom of Mantua no longer existed.) The scene in which he retired to Gilda's bedroom would be deleted, and his visit to the \"Taverna\" (inn) would no longer be intentional, but the result of a trick. The hunchbacked jester (originally called Triboulet) was renamed Rigoletto (from the French word \"rigoler\", \"giggle\") from a parody of a comedy by Jules-\u00c9douard Alboize de Pujol: \"Rigoletti, ou Le dernier des fous\" (Rigoletti, or The last of the jesters) of 1835. By 14 January, the opera's definitive title had become \"Rigoletto\".\nVerdi finally completed the composition on 5 February 1851, a little more than a month before the premiere. Piave had already arranged for the sets to be designed while Verdi was still working on the final stages of act 3. The singers were given some of their music to learn on 7 February. However, Verdi kept at least a third of the score at Busseto. He brought it with him when he arrived in Venice for the rehearsals on 19 February, and would continue refining the orchestration throughout the rehearsal period. For the premi\u00e8re, La Fenice had cast Felice Varesi as Rigoletto, the tenor Raffaele Mirate as the Duke, and Teresa Brambilla as Gilda (although Verdi would have preferred Teresa De Giuli Borsi). Due to a high risk of unauthorised copying, Verdi demanded extreme secrecy from all his singers and musicians, particularly Mirate: the \"Duke\" had the use of his score for only a few evenings before the premi\u00e8re, and was made to swear that he would not sing or even whistle the tune of \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" except during rehearsal.\nPerformance history.\n19th-century productions.\n\"Rigoletto\" premiered on 11 March 1851 in a sold-out La Fenice as the first part of a double bill with Giacomo Panizza's ballet \"Faust\". Gaetano Mares conducted, and the sets were designed and executed by Giuseppe Bertoja and Francesco Bagnara. The opening night was a complete triumph, especially the \"scena drammatica\" and the Duke's cynical aria, \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\", which was sung in the streets the next morning (Verdi had maximised the aria's impact by only revealing it to the cast and orchestra a few hours before the premiere, and forbidding them to sing, whistle or even think of the melody outside of the theatre). Many years later, Giulia Cora Varesi, the daughter of Felice Varesi (the original Rigoletto), described her father's performance at the premiere. Varesi was very uncomfortable with the false hump he had to wear; he was so uncertain that, even though he was quite an experienced singer, he had a panic attack when it was his turn to enter the stage. Verdi immediately realised he was paralysed and roughly pushed him on the stage, so he appeared with a clumsy tumble. The audience, thinking it was an intentional gag, was very amused.\n\"Rigoletto\" was a great box-office success for La Fenice and Verdi's first major Italian triumph since the 1847 premiere of \"Macbeth\" in Florence. It initially had a run of 13 performances and was revived in Venice the following year, and again in 1854. Despite a rather disastrous production in Bergamo shortly after its initial run at La Fenice, the opera soon entered the repertory of Italian theatres. By 1852, it had premiered in all the major cities of Italy, although sometimes under different titles due to the vagaries of censorship (e.g. as \"Viscardello\", \"Lionello\", and \"Clara de Perth\"). From 1852, it also began to be performed in major cities worldwide, reaching as far afield as Alexandria and Constantinople in 1854 and both Montevideo and Havana in 1855. The UK premiere took place on 14 May 1853 at what is now the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London with Giovanni Matteo Mario as the Duke of Mantua and Giorgio Ronconi as Rigoletto, conducted by Michael Costa. In the US, the opera was first seen on 19 February 1855 at New York's Academy of Music in a performance by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company.\n20th century and beyond.\nSeveral modern productions have radically changed the original setting. These include Jonathan Miller's 1982 production for the English National Opera, which is set amongst the Mafia in New York City's Little Italy during the 1950s; Doris D\u00f6rrie's 2005 production for the Bavarian State Opera, where the Court of Mantua became The Planet of the Apes; director Linda Brovsky's production for Seattle Opera, placing the story in Mussolini's fascist Italy, in 2004 (repeated in 2014); and Michael Mayer's 2013 production for the Metropolitan Opera, which is set in a casino in 1960s Las Vegas. Different characters portray different archetypes from the Rat Pack era, with the Duke becoming a Frank Sinatra-type character and Rigoletto becoming Don Rickles. In March 2014, Lindy Hume, artistic director of Australia's Opera Queensland staged the opera set in the party-going world of disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.\nPlace: Mantua\nTime: the sixteenth century\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\n\"Scene 1: Mantua. A magnificent hall in the ducal palace. Doors at the back open into other rooms, splendidly lit up. A crowd of lords and ladies in grand costumes are seen walking about in the rear rooms; page boys come and go. The festivities are at their height. Music is heard from offstage. The Duke and Borsa enter from a door in the back.\"\nAt a ball in his palace, the Duke sings of a life of pleasure with as many women as possible, and mentions that he particularly enjoys cuckolding his courtiers: \"Questa o quella\" (\"This woman or that\"). He mentions to Borsa that he has seen an unknown beauty in church and desires to possess her, but he also wishes to seduce the Countess of Ceprano. Rigoletto, the Duke's hunchbacked court jester, mocks the husbands of the ladies to whom the Duke is paying attention, including the Count Ceprano. He humorously advises the Duke to get rid of Count Ceprano by prison, exile, or death. The Duke laughs indulgently, but Ceprano is not amused. Marullo, one of the guests at the ball, informs the courtiers that Rigoletto has a \"lover\", which astonishes them (Marullo is not aware that the \"lover\" is actually Rigoletto's daughter). The courtiers, at Ceprano's suggestion, resolve to take vengeance on Rigoletto for making fun of them. The festivities are interrupted by the arrival of the elderly Count Monterone, whose daughter the Duke had seduced. Rigoletto provokes him further by making fun of his helplessness to avenge his daughter's honor. Monterone confronts the Duke, and is immediately arrested by the Duke's guards. Before being led off to prison, Monterone curses both the Duke for the attack on his daughter and Rigoletto for having mocked his righteous anger. The curse terrifies Rigoletto, who believes the popular superstition that an old man's curse has real power.\n\"Scene 2: The end of a dead-end street. On the left, a house of discreet appearance with one small courtyard surrounded by walls. In the yard there is one tall tree and a marble seat; in the wall, a door that leads to the street; above the wall, a terrace supported by arches. The second floor door opens on to the said terrace, which can also be reached by a staircase in front. To the right of the street is the very high wall of the garden and a side of the Ceprano palace. It is night.\"\nPreoccupied with the old man's curse, Rigoletto approaches the house where he is concealing his daughter from the world and is accosted by the assassin Sparafucile, who walks up to him and offers his services. Rigoletto declines for the moment, but leaves open the possibility of hiring Sparafucile later, should the need arise. Sparafucile wanders off, after repeating his own name a few times. Rigoletto contemplates the similarities between the two of them: \"Pari siamo!\" (\"We are alike!\"); Sparafucile kills men with his sword, and Rigoletto uses \"a tongue of malice\" to stab his victims. Rigoletto opens a door in the wall and embraces his daughter Gilda. They greet each other warmly: \"Figlia!\" \"Mio padre!\" (\"Daughter!\" \"My father!\"). Rigoletto has been concealing his daughter from the Duke and the rest of the city, and she does not know her father's occupation. Since he has forbidden her to appear in public, she has been nowhere except to church and does not even know her own father's name.\nWhen Rigoletto has gone, the Duke appears and overhears Gilda confess to her nurse Giovanna that she feels guilty for not having told her father about a young man she had met at the church. She says that she fell in love with him, but that she would love him even more if he were a student and poor. As she declares her love, the Duke enters, overjoyed. Gilda, alarmed, calls for Giovanna, unaware that the Duke had given her money to go away. Pretending to be a student, the Duke convinces Gilda of his love: \"\u00c8 il sol dell'anima\" (\"Love is the sunshine of the soul\"). When she asks for his name, he hesitantly calls himself Gualtier Mald\u00e8. Hearing sounds and fearing that her father has returned, Gilda sends the Duke away after they quickly trade vows of love: \"Addio, addio\" (\"Farewell, farewell\"). Alone, Gilda meditates on her love for the Duke, whom she believes is a student: \"Gualtier Mald\u00e8!... Caro nome che il mio cor\" (\"Dearest name\").\nLater, Rigoletto returns: \"Riedo!... perch\u00e9?\" (\"I've returned!... why?\"), while the hostile courtiers outside the walled garden (believing Gilda to be the jester's mistress, unaware she is his daughter) get ready to abduct the helpless girl. They tell Rigoletto that they are actually abducting the Countess Ceprano. He sees that they are masked and asks for a mask for himself; while they are tying the mask onto his face, they also blindfold him. Blindfolded and deceived, he holds the ladder steady while they climb up to Gilda's room: Chorus: \"Zitti, zitti\" (\"Softly, softly\"). With her father's unknowing assistance Gilda is carried away by the courtiers. Left alone, Rigoletto removes his mask and blindfold, and realizes that it was in fact Gilda who was carried away. He collapses in despair, remembering the old man's curse.\nAct 2.\n\"A room in the ducal palace. There are doors on both sides as well as a larger one at the far end by the sides of which hang full length portraits of the Duke and his wife. There is one high-backed chair at a table covered with velvet and other furnishings.\"\nThe Duke is concerned that Gilda has disappeared: \"Ella mi fu rapita!\" (\"She was stolen from me!\") and \"Parmi veder le lagrime\" (\"I seem to see tears\"). The courtiers then enter and inform him that they have captured Rigoletto's mistress: Chorus: \"Scorrendo uniti\" (\"We went together at nightfall\"). By their description, he recognizes it to be Gilda and rushes off to the room where she is held: \"Possente amor mi chiama\" (\"Mighty love beckons me\"). Rigoletto enters singing and feigning nonchalance, but also looking anxiously for any trace of Gilda, who he fears may have fallen into the hands of the Duke. The courtiers pretend not to notice his anxiety, but quietly laugh at him with each other. A page arrives with a message from the Duke's wife \u2013 the Duchess wishes to speak to her husband \u2013 but the courtiers reply suggestively that the Duke cannot be disturbed at the moment. Rigoletto realizes this must mean that Gilda is with the Duke. To the courtiers' surprise, he reveals that Gilda is his daughter. He first demands, then tearfully pleads with the courtiers to return her to him: \"Cortigiani, vil razza dannata\" (\"Accursed race of courtiers\"). Rigoletto attempts to run into the room in which Gilda is being held, but the courtiers block his way. After a time, Gilda enters, and Rigoletto orders the courtiers to leave him alone with her. The courtiers leave the room, believing Rigoletto has gone mad. Gilda describes to her father what has happened to her in the palace: \"Tutte le feste al tempio\" (\"On all the holy days\") and he attempts to console her. Monterone is led across the room on the way to prison and pauses in front of the portrait of the Duke to regret that his curse on the libertine has had no effect. As the guards lead Monterone away, Rigoletto mutters that the old man is mistaken; he, Rigoletto, the dishonored buffoon, shall make thunder and lightning rain from heaven onto the offender's head. He repeats this vow as Gilda pleads for mercy for her lover the Duke: Duet:\"S\u00ec! Vendetta, tremenda vendetta!\" (\"Yes! Revenge, terrible revenge!\").\nAct 3.\n\"The right bank of the river Mincio. On the left is a two-story house, half ruined. Through a large arch on the ground floor a rustic tavern can be seen as well as a rough stone staircase that leads to an attic room with a small bed which is in full view as there are no shutters. In the wall downstairs that faces the street is a door that opens to the inside. The wall is so full of holes and cracks that everything that happens inside is easily seen from the exterior. At the back of the stage are deserted areas by the river which flows behind a parapet that has half collapsed into ruins. Beyond the river is Mantua. It is night. Gilda and Rigoletto, both uneasy, are standing in the road; Sparafucile is seated at a table in the tavern.\"\nA portion of Sparafucile's house is seen, with two rooms open to the view of the audience. Rigoletto and Gilda arrive outside. The Duke's voice can be heard from inside, singing \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" (\"Woman is fickle\"). Sparafucile's sister, Maddalena, has lured him to the house. Rigoletto and Gilda listen from outside as the Duke flirts with Maddalena. Gilda laments that the Duke is unfaithful; Rigoletto assures her that he is arranging revenge: \"Bella figlia dell'amore\" (\"Beautiful daughter of love\").\nRigoletto orders Gilda to put on a man's clothes to prepare to leave for Verona and tells her that he plans to follow later. After she leaves, he completes his bargain with the assassin, who is ready to murder his guest for 20 scudi. Rigoletto then withdraws.\nWith falling darkness, a thunderstorm approaches and the Duke decides to spend the rest of the night in the house. Sparafucile directs him to the upstairs sleeping quarters, resolving to kill him in his sleep.\nGilda, who still loves the Duke despite knowing him to be unfaithful, returns dressed as a man and stands outside the house. Maddalena, who is smitten with the Duke, begs Sparafucile to spare his life: \"\u00c8 amabile invero cotal giovinotto/ Ah, pi\u00f9 non ragiono!\". Sparafucile, a man of his word, is reluctant but promises her that if by midnight another victim can be found, he will kill the other instead of the Duke. Gilda, overhearing this exchange, resolves to sacrifice herself for the Duke, and enters the house: \"Trio: Se pria ch'abbia il mezzo la notte toccato\". Sparafucile stabs her and she collapses, mortally wounded.\nAt midnight, when Rigoletto arrives with money, he receives a corpse wrapped in a sack, and rejoices in his triumph. Weighting it with stones, he is about to cast the sack into the river when he hears the voice of the Duke, sleepily singing a reprise of his \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" aria. Bewildered, Rigoletto opens the sack and, to his despair, discovers his dying daughter. For a moment, she revives and declares she is glad to die for her beloved: \"V'ho ingannato\" (\"Father, I deceived you\"). She dies in his arms. Rigoletto cries out in horror: \"La maledizione!\" (\"The curse!\")\nInstrumentation.\nThe orchestra calls for 2 flutes (Flute 2 doubles piccolo), 2 oboes (Oboe 2 doubles English horn), 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in E\u266d, D, C, A\u266d, G, and F, 2 trumpets in C, D, and E\u266d, 3 trombones, cimbasso, timpani, bass drum and cymbals, strings.\nMusic.\nThe short orchestral preludio is based on the theme of the curse, intoned quietly on brass at first and building in intensity until it bursts into a passionate outcry by the full orchestra, subsiding once more and ending with repeated drum rolls alternating with brass, cumulatively increasing in volume to come to a somber conclusion. At curtain rise, great contrast is immediately felt as jolly dance music is played by an offstage band while the Duke and his courtiers have a lighthearted conversation. The Duke sings the cynical \"Questa o quella\" to a flippant tune and then further contrast is again achieved as he attempts to seduce the Countess Ceprano while the strings of a chamber orchestra onstage play an elegant minuet. The off stage dance music resumes as an ensemble builds between Rigoletto, the angry courtiers and the Duke, interrupted by the furious entry of Monterone. Slithery effects in the strings accompany Rigoletto as he brutally mocks the old man, who responds with his curse, leading to a final dramatic ensemble.\nIn its great variety of tone and texture, its use of instrumental resources (the orchestra in the pit, an offstage band, and a chamber ensemble of strings on the stage), its dramatic pacing and the way the music is continuous rather than consisting of one \"number\" after another, this concise opening scene is unprecedented in Italian opera.\nThe duet between Rigoletto and Sparafucile that opens the second scene of the first act is also unprecedented in its structure, being a free-ranging dialogue with melodies not in the voices but in the orchestra, on a solo cello, solo bass, and low woodwinds to create a distinctive sinister atmosphere.\nThe famous quartet in act three is actually a double duet with each of the characters given a musical identity\u2014the ardent wooing of the Duke, with the main melody, as Maddalena laughingly puts him off, while outside Gilda has a sobbing figure in her vocal line and her father implacably urges revenge. \nVictor Hugo resented his play, which had been banned in France, being transformed into an Italian opera and considered it plagiarism (there were no copyright restrictions against this at the time). When Hugo attended a performance of the opera in Paris, however, he marveled at the way Verdi's music in the quartet allowed the emotions of the four different characters to be heard together and yet distinguished clearly from each other at the same time and wished that he could achieve such an effect in a spoken drama.\nThe section following the quartet, marked \"Scena e Terzetto Tempesta\" (scene and storm trio) is also, as Julian Budden has written,\"without any antecedent\". Very different from the storm music that can be heard in Rossini's \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" or \"La Cenerentola\", that of the storm in \"Rigoletto\" is not an interlude between acts or scenes, but is totally integrated into the unfolding of the plot, with its strings in the bass register, its interventions of oboe and piccolo, and especially the male chorus behind the scenes humming through closed mouths to create the sound of the wind, a completely original effect. Composer and professor of experimental music Dieter Schnebel (1930\u20132018) wrote of this scene\nThe central storm scene is, so to speak, a film with sound, whose moving images show an exterior and interior drama. The furtive encounters between people in the darkness, irregularly broken by lightning, are exposed by the empty fifths, the tremolos of strings, the brief breakthroughs of the wind instruments, the thunderclaps and the sinister sighs of the chorus, which express as well an external process that is internal: death arrives with thunderclaps. The music always passes in this scene from jerky recitatives to fluid arias...\nMusicologist Julian Budden regards the opera as \"revolutionary\", just as Beethoven' \"Eroica\" Symphony was: \"the barriers between formal melody and recitative are down as never before. In the whole opera, there is only one conventional double aria [...and there are...] no concerted act finales.\" Verdi used that same word\u2014\"revolutionary\"\u2014in a letter to Piave, and Budden also refers to a letter which Verdi wrote in 1852 in which the composer states that \"I conceived \"Rigoletto\" almost without arias, without finales but only an unending string of duets.\"\nBudden's conclusions about this opera and its place in Verdi's output are summed up by noting that:\nJust after 1850 at the age of 38 Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with \"Rigoletto\". The so-called \"ottocento\" in music is finished. Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but in a totally new spirit.\nCritical reception.\nAlthough immensely successful with audiences from the beginning, many critics in various countries condemned the work for its dark and bitterly tragic plot combined with a succession of mere popular tunes, as they thought of the music. After the first performance in Venice in 1851 the \"Gazzetta ufficiale di Venezia\" deplored the fact that in his opinion the libretto was inspired by \"the Satanic school\" and Verdi and Piave had sought beauty from the \"deformed and repulsive\".\nTypical of critical reaction in Britain, Austria and Germany was the review in the \"Frankfurter Nachrichten\" of July 24, 1859: \"It is well known that this shoddy work presents all the vices and virtues of Verdi's music: light music, pleasant dance rhythms for frightful scenes; that death and corruption are represented as in all the works of this composer by galops and party favours.\"\nIn the second half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, \"Rigoletto\" has received high praise even from avant-garde and experimental composers such as Luigi Dallapiccola, Luciano Berio and Ernst Krenek. Igor Stravinsky wrote \"I say that in the aria 'La donna \u00e8 mobile', for example, which the elite thinks only brilliant and superficial, there is more substance and feeling than in the whole of Wagner's \"Ring\" cycle.\"\nRecordings and adaptations.\nThere have been dozens of commercial recordings of \"Rigoletto\". The earliest ones include the 1912 performance in French with Fran\u00e7ois Ruhlmann conducting the orchestra and chorus of the Op\u00e9ra Comique (Path\u00e9) and the 1916 performance in Italian with Lorenzo Molajoli conducting the orchestra and chorus of La Scala (Columbia Records). The first LP edition of \"Rigoletto\" (also the first opera recording on LP) was released by RCA Victor in 1950 conducted by Renato Cellini and featured Leonard Warren in the title role. The opera has also been recorded in German with Wilhelm Sch\u00fcchter conducting the orchestra and chorus of the Berlin State Opera in a 1953 recording for EMI Records and in English with Mark Elder conducting the orchestra and chorus of the English National Opera in a 1983 recording for EMI. In the 21st century there have been several live performances released on DVD including a 2001 performance from London's Royal Opera House with Paolo Gavanelli as Rigoletto and Marcelo \u00c1lvarez as the Duke (BBC/Opus Arte) and a 2006 performance at the Opernhaus Z\u00fcrich with Leo Nucci as Rigoletto and Piotr Becza\u0142a as The Duke (ArtHaus Musik). The Duke of Mantua's arias, particularly \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" and \"Questa o quella\", have long been showcases for the tenor voice and appear on numerous recital discs. Amongst Enrico Caruso's earliest recordings are both these arias, recorded with piano accompaniment in 1902 and again in 1908 with orchestra. Luciano Pavarotti, who has recorded the arias for several recital discs, also sings the role of the Duke on three complete studio recordings of the opera: Decca (1971) conducted by Richard Bonynge; Decca (1989) conducted by Riccardo Chailly and Deutsche Grammophon (1993) conducted by James Levine.\n\"Rigoletto\" has been a popular subject for movies since the silent film era. On 15 April 1923, Lee de Forest presented 18 short films in his sound-on-film process Phonofilm, including an excerpt of act 2 of \"Rigoletto\" with Eva Leoni and Company. One of the most famous films based on the opera is the 1987 film by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle starring Luciano Pavarotti as The Duke and Ingvar Wixell as Rigoletto. Some film versions are based on the opera's plot, but do not use Verdi's music. Curtiss Clayton's 2003 film \"Rick\", set in modern-day New York, has a plot based on \"Rigoletto\", but apart from \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" heard in the background during a restaurant scene, does not include any other music from the opera. In the 21st century, the opera was filmed as \"Rigoletto Story\" directed by Vittorio Sgarbi with costumes by Vivienne Westwood. First screened at the Venice Biennale in 2004, it subsequently received two Grammy nominations. In September 2010, RAI Television filmed the opera on location in Mantua with the court scenes taking place in the Palazzo Te. The film faithfully followed Verdi's original specification for the action to take place over two days, and each act was performed at the time of day indicated in the libretto. Broadcast live to 148 countries, the film starred Pl\u00e1cido Domingo in the title role, and Vittorio Grigolo as The Duke. The plot of the film \"Quartet\" revolves around the quartet \"Bella figlia dell'amore\", with which the film concludes.\nAdaptations of the opera's music include Franz Liszt's \"Rigoletto Paraphrase\", a piano transcription of \"Bella figlia dell'amore\" (the famous quartet from act 3), a \"Fantasia\" \"on Rigoletto\" (Op. 82) by Sigismond Thalberg which was published in Paris in the 1860s, Josef Strauss Neue \"Melodien - Quadrille\" (Op. 254) based on motives from Rigoletto, Il Trovatore, La Traviata, and other operas from Bellini and Donizetti and Mats Lidstr\u00f6m's \"Rigoletto Fantasy\" from 2009.\nNotes and references.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

One of the most successful tennis players of all time, he was ranked as the world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 286 weeks (third-most of all time), and finished as the year-end No. 1 six consecutive times. Sampras won 64 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including 14 men's singles majors, which was an all-time record at the time of his retirement: seven Wimbledon Championships, two Australian Opens and an Open Era joint-record five US Opens. He also won five Tour Finals, two Grand Slam Cups, eleven Masters events, and was part of the winning United States Davis Cup teams in 1992 and 1995.\nSampras became the youngest male singles champion at the 1990 US Open at just }. He claimed his first Wimbledon title in 1993, and would win the title seven times in an eight-year span. Sampras remained the best player for the rest of the decade, finishing each year as No. 1 for a record six consecutive seasons. Following a decline in form at the turn of the century, Sampras claimed his 14th and last major at the 2002 US Open over long-time rival and compatriot Andre Agassi, and retired from the sport thereafter, aged 31.\nSampras was a major practitioner of the serve-and-volley style of tennis. His precise and powerful serve, regarded as one of the best in the sport's history, earned him the nickname \"Pistol Pete\". In 2007, he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nPete Sampras was born on August 12, 1971, in Washington, D.C. He is the third child of Soterios \"Sammy\" and Georgia (n\u00e9e Vroustouris) Sampras. His father was born in the United States to a Greek father, Costas \"Gus\" Sampras, and a Polish-Jewish mother, Sarah Steinberg. His mother is also Greek; when she was 19, she immigrated to the United States from the village of Sellasia in Sparta. Sampras attended regular services of the Greek Orthodox Church on Sundays. At the age of 3, he discovered a tennis racket in the basement of his home and spent hours hitting balls against the wall.\nIn 1978, the Sampras family moved to Palos Verdes, California, and the warmer climate there allowed the seven year-old Sampras to play tennis for most of the year. From early on, his great idol was Rod Laver, and at the age of 11, Sampras met and played tennis with the legend. The Sampras family joined the Jack Kramer Club, and it was here that Sampras's talent became apparent. As a teenager, Sampras trained with tennis coach Robert Lansdorp. The forehand he learned from Lansdorp was the same forehand he used throughout his career. The key was an emphasis on driving through the ball and not hitting extreme topspin. He was spotted by Dr. Peter Fischer, a pediatrician and tennis enthusiast, who coached Sampras until 1989. Fischer was responsible for converting Sampras's double-handed backhand to single-hand with the goal of being better prepared to win Wimbledon.\nProfessional career.\n1988: Turning professional.\nSampras turned professional in 1988, at the age of 16, and finished the year ranked world No. 97 after starting the year at No. 893. His first professional match was a loss to Sammy Giammalva Jr. at the February Ebel U.S. Pro Indoor in Philadelphia. However, just one week later, at the Lipton International Players Championships in Miami, Sampras defeated two top-40 players, before losing to No. 18 Emilio S\u00e1nchez. He did not defeat another top-40 player for almost six months, at which point he defeated No. 39 Michiel Schapers at a US Open warm-up tournament in Rye Brook, New York. In his first Grand Slam singles match, Sampras lost to No. 69 Jaime Yzaga of Peru in the first round of the US Open. Sampras did not advance past the quarterfinals in his next three tournaments, although he did record wins over No. 79 Jim Courier in their first career match-up, along with defeating No. 8 Tim Mayotte.\n1989: First major match wins.\nThe following year, Sampras slightly improved his ranking to a year-ending No. 81. He lost in the first round of the 1989 Australian Open to Christian Saceanu and, at that year's French Open, won a Grand Slam singles match for the first time in his career; in the second round he lost to eventual champion and fellow American teenager Michael Chang in their first career match-up. A few weeks later, Sampras lost in the first round of Wimbledon to Todd Woodbridge. At the US Open, Sampras defeated defending champion and fifth-seeded Mats Wilander in the second round before losing to No. 13 Jay Berger in the fourth round. To end the year, Sampras lost in the first round in four consecutive tournaments.\n1990: US Open champion.\nAt the Australian Open, Sampras upset twelfth-ranked Tim Mayotte in the first round before losing to thirteenth-ranked Yannick Noah in the fourth round in four sets. His first professional singles title came in February at the Ebel U.S. Pro Indoor in Philadelphia, where he defeated sixth-ranked Andre Agassi, eighth-ranked Mayotte, and eighteenth-ranked Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez in the final. This title elevated his ranking into the top 20 for the first time. Sampras finished 1990 at No. 5, having started the year ranked No. 61 just prior to the start of the Australian Open.\nSampras did not play in the 1990 French Open and lost in the first round of Wimbledon to Christo van Rensburg. Sampras played seven consecutive weeks during the North American summer hard-court season. He defeated John McEnroe in the quarterfinals of the Canadian Open, but then lost to Chang in the semifinals. He also reached the semifinals of the tournament in Los Angeles, where he lost to No. 2 Stefan Edberg. He did not advance past the quarterfinals in his next three tournaments, losing to Chang, Richey Reneberg, and Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107.\nIn September, Sampras captured his first Grand Slam title, at the US Open. Along the way, he defeated sixth-ranked Thomas Muster in the fourth round and third-ranked Ivan Lendl in a five-set quarterfinal, breaking Lendl's streak of eight consecutive US Open finals. He then defeated 20th-ranked McEnroe in a four-set semifinal to set up a final with fourth-ranked Agassi. Sampras beat Agassi in straight sets to become the US Open's youngest-ever male singles champion at the age of 19 years and 28 days. He played five more tournaments and won the Grand Slam Cup to complete his year.\n1991: Year-end title.\nSampras lost in the second round of the French Open (to Thierry Champion) and played \"very inconsistently\" in losing a second round match to Derrick Rostagno at Wimbledon. Upon entering the US Open as the defending champion that year, he caused controversy when, after losing in the quarterfinals to Jim Courier, Sampras said that he was not disappointed and felt relieved that the pressure to defend his title was no longer on him. This led to widespread criticism, which included disparaging remarks from Courier and Jimmy Connors. Sampras captured the first of his five career titles at the year-end Tennis Masters Cup.\n1992: First Masters title.\nSampras reached the quarterfinals of the French Open for the first time, losing to Andre Agassi in straight sets. He made it to the Wimbledon semifinals, losing a serve dominated four set match to Goran Ivanisevic. He won at Cincinnati beating Ivan Lendl in the final. He was the runner-up at the US Open to Stefan Edberg. Sampras later stated that his loss in the US Open final that year was a \"wake-up call\" and that he needed to figure out how to become the world No. 1. He also played doubles with John McEnroe on the US team that won the Davis Cup on home soil, beating Switzerland 3\u20131.\n1992 was also the year when Sampras made his only competitive appearance at the Olympics. The event was played on clay, his worst surface. Nonetheless, Sampras advanced to the third round before giving up a two-set lead and losing to Andrei Cherkasov of Russia.\n1993: Two major titles, world No. 1.\nSampras reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in January, losing again to Stefan Edberg. In April, Sampras attained the No. 1 ranking for the first time. His rise to the top of the rankings was controversial because he had not recently won any Grand Slam titles. A few days after becoming world number one, Sampras beat world number two Jim Courier in the final at Hong Kong on a final set tie break, serving 15 aces. Sampras allowed Sergi Bruguera to dictate play from the baseline and lost in four sets in the French Open quarter finals. He consolidated his number one ranking in July by claiming his first of seven Wimbledon titles, beating former world No. 1 and fellow American Jim Courier in the final. This was followed by his second US Open title, where he beat Cedric Pioline in the final (Pioline made 45 unforced errors during the three set match). Sampras finished the year as the clear No. 1 and set a new ATP Tour record that year by becoming the first player to serve more than 1,000 aces in a season.\n1994: Australian and Wimbledon titles.\nSampras won the first of two Australian Open titles in 1994, defeating American Todd Martin in the final. Sampras was suffering from a stomach ailment as the start of the Key Biscayne final was delayed. Andre Agassi was offered a walkover but declined. Sampras recovered and served 7 aces in his final two service games to win in three sets. Sampras allowed Boris Becker a total of five games in three sets in the Italian Open final and entered the French Open trying to win his fourth consecutive Grand Slam. Sampras failed to become the first man since Rod Laver to win four consecutive Grand Slam titles, losing to Jim Courier in the quarters. Courier's ranking was falling and Sampras had won his previous four matches against him but the clay surface \"neutralized Sampras' serve\". Sampras then defended his Wimbledon in July, beating Ivanisevic in the final. Criticisms were made about the length of the points, as only three rallies contained more than five shots. Sampras was suffering from fatigue and lost in five sets to Jaime Yzaga in the fourth round of the US Open.\n1995: Wimbledon and US titles, world No. 1.\nIn 1995, Sampras battled for the world No. 1 ranking with compatriot Andre Agassi. Sampras experienced one of the most emotional matches of his career against Courier in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. Sampras' longtime coach and close friend, Tim Gullikson, had mysteriously collapsed during the tournament and was forced to return to the United States. Gullikson was later diagnosed with brain cancer, to which he succumbed the following year. Saddened by Gullikson's illness, Sampras began visibly weeping during the match when a spectator shouted at Sampras, urging him to win it for Gullikson. Sampras nevertheless managed to defeat Courier, but lost the final to Andre Agassi in four sets. Paul Annacone took over as Sampras' full-time coach after Gullikson's illness made it impossible for him to continue coaching.\nSampras defeated Agassi in the final at Indian Wells and lost to him in the Key Biscayne final on a final set tie break. At the French Open, Sampras lost in five sets in round one to Gilbert Schaller, making 99 unforced errors. He then won his third straight Wimbledon title over Boris Becker in a four set final in which he served 23 aces and didn't face a break point. \"Unfortunately, he owns the Centre Court now. I used to own it a few years back, but it belongs to him now\" said Becker afterwards. Sampras lost in the final of the Canadian Masters to Agassi. Sampras faced Agassi in the final of the US Open. Agassi \"knew Sampras would have to play excellent tennis to beat him. And he knew that Sampras had done exactly that.\" Sampras served 24 aces during his four set victory.\nSampras was the key figure for champion United States in the Davis Cup, beating Russia in the final in Moscow, 3\u20132. Sampras was included in all of the three wins. After the opening match (a 5-set thriller against Chesnokov) Sampras was so exhausted that he collapsed and needed help to get into the locker room.\n1996: Only Wimbledon loss over eight years.\nIn the year's first major, the Australian Open, the top-seeded Sampras lost to the unseeded Mark Philippoussis in straight sets in the third round. Sampras had what would end up being his best run ever at that year's French Open, defeating two past former champions Sergi Bruguera and Jim Courier (in 5 sets on both occasions and overcoming a 2\u20130 deficit against the latter) before losing in a semifinal match to the eventual winner, Yevgeny Kafelnikov in straight sets.\nIn the eight Wimbledons inclusive between 1993 and 2000, 1996 was the only year that Sampras would fail to win the tournament. Sampras lost in the quarterfinals that year to the 17th-seed and eventual champion Richard Krajicek, who defeated Sampras in straight sets.\nIn the quarterfinals of the US Open, Sampras vomited on the court at 1\u20131 in the final set tiebreak (due to dehydration) while facing \u00c0lex Corretja. At 7-6 in the tie break Corretja had match point, but Sampras saved it with a lunge volley and went on to win. Sampras advanced to the finals, where he defeated No. 2 Michael Chang in straight sets to defend his US Open title.\nSampras finished off the year by claiming the season-ending ATP Tour World Championship for the third time in his career beating Boris Becker in five sets in a match which Sampras said was \"one of the best matches I have ever been part of\".\n1997: Australian and Wimbledon titles.\nIn January in the fourth round of the Australian Open on a scorching hot day, Sampras was 4-2 down in the fifth set and a point away from going a double break down against Dominik Hrbat\u00fd, before winning the fifth set. He went on to beat Carlos Moy\u00e1 in the final. In July, he won Wimbledon for the fourth time, defeating C\u00e9dric Pioline in the final. Sampras also won singles titles in San Jose, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Munich, and Paris, and the ATP Tour World Championships in Hanover, Germany. He became the only player to win both the Grand Slam Cup and the ATP Tour World Championships in the same year. Sampras lost in the fourth round of the US Open to Petr Korda on a fifth set tie break, despite leading 3-0 in the final set.\nHe had a 10\u20131 win\u2013loss record against top-10 opponents and was undefeated in eight singles finals. He held the No. 1 ranking for the entire year and joined Jimmy Connors (1974\u20131978) as the only male players to hold the year-end No. 1 ranking for five consecutive years. His prize money earnings of US$6,498,211 for the year was a career high.\n1998: Wimbledon title, six straight years No. 1.\nIn 1998, Sampras's No. 1 ranking was challenged by Chilean player Marcelo R\u00edos. Sampras failed to defend his Australian Open title, losing in the quarterfinals to Karol Ku\u010dera, and won Wimbledon only after a hard-fought five-set victory in the final over Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107. This was Sampras's only Grand Slam final which went to five sets.\nSampras lost in the final of the Cincinnati Masters to Patrick Rafter. Sampras faced Rafter again in the semifinals of the US Open, losing in five sets after sustaining injury while leading the match two sets to one, and Rafter went on to win his second consecutive US Open title. Sampras lost another semifinal at the Tennis Masters Cup to eventual champion \u00c0lex Corretja. Nevertheless, Sampras finished the year as the top-ranked player for the sixth year in a row.\n1999: Wimbledon title.\nThe year started with a withdrawal from the Australian Open due to fatigue, and Sampras failed to win a title during the early part of the season. However, he then went on a 24-match winning streak encompassing the Stella Artois Championships, Wimbledon (equaling Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles), Los Angeles, and Cincinnati (a rematch of the previous year's final with Patrick Rafter). Sampras' straight sets victory over Andre Agassi in the Wimbledon final is often cited as one of the greatest performances in a Wimbledon final. Despite this\u2014on account of a herniated disc in his back forcing retirement at the RCA Championships and withdrawal from the US Open\u2014he lost his no. 1 ranking to Agassi the following day, when the ATP Tour rankings were updated.\nSampras' ranking was hurt by a combination of withdrawing from the Australian and US Opens, tournaments in which he had strong performances during the previous year, and the resurgence of longtime rival Agassi, putting an end to Sampras' six consecutive years of finishing as world No. 1. Agassi took over the top ranking and held it for the rest of the season, but Sampras recovered and managed to beat Agassi in the year-end championships for the fifth and final time, enabling him to remain third in the rankings.\n2000: 13 majors and return to No. 1.\nSampras reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in early 2000, falling to the eventual champion Agassi in a five-set match. He won the Ericsson Open for the third time in March. After getting knocked out in the first round at the French Open, he won his seventh and final title at Wimbledon, battling through tendinitis in his right shin and a painful back injury in the process equalling the then all time gentleman's singles title record of William Renshaw. In the final, Sampras was a set down and 4\u20131 down in the second set tie break against Patrick Rafter, but went on to win in four sets. This was his 13th Grand Slam singles title, breaking the all-time record of Roy Emerson that had stood for over 30 years.\nIn the 2000 US Open, Sampras overcame Richard Krajicek in four sets at the quarterfinals (including a comeback from 2\u20136 down in a tiebreaker), and upcoming star Lleyton Hewitt in the semi-finals, but lost the final to Marat Safin. Sampras' run to the final briefly returned him to the No. 1 ranking, but Gustavo Kuerten ended the year atop the rankings. This would be the last time Sampras was ranked No. 1, extending his ATP record career total to 286 weeks. (The record was surpassed by Roger Federer in 2012.)\n2001: Drop in ranking.\nAt the Australian Open, Sampras ended a six year 13 win streak against Todd Martin, losing in the fourth round in four sets. Sampras' 31-match Wimbledon win streak ended in a five set loss to Roger Federer, aged 19, in the fourth round; this was the only time the two ever played against each other in an official professional match. At the US Open, Sampras reached the final but lost in straight sets to Lleyton Hewitt. Overall, this season was the first in 12 years that Sampras did not win a single title, and he finished the year ranked No. 10, also his lowest since 1989.\n2002: 14th major and retirement.\nSampras lost in the fourth round of the Australian Open to Marat Safin in four sets. \"Muttering, slouching, slamming his racket to the ground and smacking a ball into the stands, Pete Sampras was in typical French Open form\" as he lost to Andrea Gaudenzi in round one, a sixth consecutive early loss at Roland Garros for Sampras. He suffered an early exit from Wimbledon too, losing in the second round to No. 145 fast-court specialist George Bastl of Switzerland. After that loss, Sampras asked his former coach Paul Annacone to return and coach through the US Open. Sampras had a relatively poor summer leading up to the US Open, losing at Cincinnati to No. 70-ranked Wayne Arthurs in the second round, and then was eliminated at the opening round at Long Island by No. 85. Paul-Henri Mathieu.\nAt the US Open, Sampras was seeded 17th. Greg Rusedski, whom Sampras had defeated in a long five-set third round match at the US Open, said that Sampras was \"a step and a half slower\" and predicted that Sampras would lose his next match. Sampras, however, then defeated two young stars, Tommy Haas in the fourth round and Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals. He then defeated Sjeng Schalken in the semifinals to reach his third consecutive US Open final, and eighth US Open final overall, tying Ivan Lendl's all-time record. This time, Sampras faced Agassi, whom he had met in his first Grand Slam final 12 years earlier. After a four-set battle between the two veterans, Sampras claimed a then-record 14th Grand Slam singles title and matched Jimmy Connors' Open Era record of five US Open singles championships.\nSampras did not compete in any tour events in the following 12 months, but he did not officially announce his retirement until August 2003, just prior to the US Open. He chose not to defend his title there, but his retirement announcement was timed so that he could say farewell at a special ceremony organized for him at the Open. He thus became the only man in the open era to win the final Grand Slam tournament at which he competed. At the time of his retirement, many regarded Sampras as the greatest player of all time.\nPost-retirement activity.\nOn April 6, 2006, Sampras resurfaced and played his first exhibition match in River Oaks, Houston, Texas, against 23-year-old Robby Ginepri. Ginepri won the match in two sets. Sampras later announced that he would be playing in World Team Tennis events.\nIn 2007, Sampras played in a few events on the Outback Champions Series, a group of tournaments for former ATP players who met certain criteria during their careers. Sampras won his first two events on tour, defeating Todd Martin in both finals. John McEnroe said that Sampras would be worthy of a top five seeding at Wimbledon were he to enter the tournament.\nOn November 20, 2007, Sampras lost the first of three exhibition matches in Asia against then world #1 Roger Federer in Seoul, Korea. Two days later in Kuala Lumpur, Sampras again lost to Federer in two tiebreaks. However, Sampras was able to win the last match of the series, winning in two sets on fast carpet.\nOn February 18, 2008, in an exhibition match during the SAP Open, Sampras defeated another active player, former No. 2 Tommy Haas. Sampras dispatched the German in 43 minutes.\nOn March 10, 2008, Sampras played another exhibition match against No. 1 Roger Federer at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Sampras lost in three tight sets, despite serving for the match.\nIn 2009, Sampras won two Outback Champions Series titles. He beat McEnroe in the final of the Champions Cup Boston in February and Patrick Rafter in the final of The Del Mar Development Champions Cup in March.\nSampras was present at the 2009 Wimbledon final between Andy Roddick and Roger Federer to witness Federer eclipse his mark of 14 major titles and become the most successful man in Grand Slam history. His record of 14 majors had lasted for seven years.\nThe following year along with Federer, Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal, Sampras played an exhibition doubles match at Indian Wells to raise money for the people of Haiti who had been affected by the earthquake.\nIn November 2010, Sampras reported that many of his trophies and memorabilia had been stolen from a West Los Angeles public storage facility. The loss included the trophy from his first Australian Open victory, two Davis Cups, an Olympic ring and six trophies for finishing top in the year-end rankings. Most of the stolen items have since been recovered and returned.\nOn November 17, 2011, Sampras lost an exhibition match against Milos Raonic. His serve approached 200\u00a0km/h (124\u00a0mph) throughout the night.\nRivalries.\nSampras vs. Agassi.\nThey had contrasting playing styles, with Sampras and Agassi being considered respectively the greatest server and the greatest serve returner of their eras. Sampras led 20-14 in matches against Agassi.\nThe 1990 US Open (their first meeting in a Grand Slam final), Agassi lost to Sampras in straight sets. Their next Grand Slam meeting was at the 1992 French Open, where Agassi won the quarterfinal in straight sets. Their next Grand Slam meeting was the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 1993, where Agassi was the defending champion and Sampras was the newly crowned No. 1. Sampras won in five sets.\nNotable Sampras\u2013Agassi matches of 1995 were the finals of the Australian Open, the Newsweek Champions Cup, the Lipton International Players Championships, the Canadian Open, and the US Open, with Sampras winning the Newsweek Champions Cup and the US Open.\nThe next time Sampras and Agassi met in a Grand Slam final was at Wimbledon in 1999, where Sampras won in straight sets. They faced each other twice in the season-ending ATP Tour World Championships, with Sampras losing the round-robin match, but winning the final.\nThey played each other once in 2000. The top-ranked Agassi defeated No. 3 Sampras in the semifinals of the Australian Open in five sets. Sampras defeated Agassi in the 2001 US Open quarterfinals in four tie break sets. There were no breaks of serve during the match.\nThe final of the 2002 US Open was their first meeting in a US Open final since 1995. Sampras won in four sets. This was the final ATP tour singles match of Sampras's career.\nIn 2009, in Macau Agassi and Sampras met for the first time on court since the 2002 US Open final. Sampras won the exhibition in three sets. In August 2010, Sampras played an exhibition with Agassi at the indoor arena Coliseo Cubierto El Campin in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.\nSampras vs. Becker.\nThey had similar playing styles. They both had strong serves. They often came to the net after serving. Sampras said \"when you have two guys that serve extremely big and volley pretty well, you are not going to have long rallies\".\nOverall Sampras led 12-7 against Becker. They had a close rivalry on indoor carpet with Becker leading 7-6. Sampras led 3-0 on grass, 2-0 on hard courts and 1-0 on clay. Sampras beat Becker 3 times at Wimbledon between 1993 and 1997 (including the 1995 final). Becker said \"I can't say that this is my place anymore. I used to own it, but Pete Sampras had taken over the keys.\"\nSampras vs. Rafter.\nSampras led 12-4 in matches against Patrick Rafter.\nUp to Rafter winning the 1997 US Open, Sampras led their rivalry 5\u20131. He beat Rafter three times in late 1997. \"We're not the best of mates,\" Rafter said of Sampras after 1997 Davis Cup semifinals, \"I wouldn't go out for a beer with him, put it that way. I don't know what the story is. There's a bit of feeling.\"\nIn 1998, Rafter beat Sampras in the Cincinnati Masters final. Rafter's serve was called out on match point, but the umpire overruled the call to give Rafter the ace and the title. Sampras was displeased, and stood at the baseline for several seconds, making Rafter wait at the net, and then refused to shake the umpire's hand. Sampras, at the time winner of 11 Grand Slams, when asked about the difference between himself and Rafter, said \"Ten grand slams\", that a controversial line-call cost him the match, and that a player had to come back and win another Grand Slam title in order to be considered great.\nThe two met in the semifinals of the 1998 US Open, where Sampras called for a trainer, and Rafter broke Sampras twice in the deciding fifth set. Sampras's loss denied him the chance to match Jimmy Connors' five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson's 12 Grand Slam singles titles. Sampras cited a leg injury as the reason Rafter won, upsetting the Australian: \"We are out there busting our guts and he doesn't show a lot of respect at the end of the day. He tries to play down the reason why he lost, giving no respect to the other player, and that is what really upsets me about him and the reason I try to piss him off as much as I can\", said Rafter. Sampras said of Rafter (after Pat had won the US Open final), \"When I see him holding the US Open trophy, it pisses me off.\" Rafter responded by calling Sampras a \"cry baby\" and saying that it would be better for tennis if someone besides the American were No. 1.\nSampras lost a third consecutive time against Rafter at the World Team Cup, in straight sets, just before the French Open. By the summer of 1999, having compiled a 24-match winning streak of four titles including Wimbledon, Sampras beat Rafter in the Cincinnati Masters final. The two were friendly in the trophy ceremony.\nThe next Sampras-Rafter match was the 2000 Wimbledon final. It was the first time in years their parents would see their sons play. Sampras lost the first-set tiebreaker, and trailed in the second-set tiebreaker 1-4 before winning the set, then won the third and fourth sets for the Championship, as dusk fell. That victory gave Sampras his 13th Grand Slam title, breaking Roy Emerson's record. After the match ended, Sampras called Rafter \"all class, on and off the court\", while Rafter said he was lucky to overcome early season injuries to make the final.\nSampras beat Rafter in the 2001 Indian Wells quarterfinals and Pete beat Pat again in the fourth round of the 2001 US Open. This match ended Rafter's Grand Slam singles career.\nPlaying style.\nSampras was an all-court player who would often serve and volley. Possessing an all-around skill, in the early years of his career, when not serving, his strategy was to be offensive from the baseline, put opponents in a defensive position, and finish points at the net. In his later years, he became even more offensive and would either employ a chip-and-charge strategy or try to hit an offensive shot on the return and follow his return to the net.\nHe had an accurate and powerful first serve \u2013 widely considered among players, commentators and fans as one of the best of all time. He had great disguise on both his first and second serves, and his second serve was nearly as powerful as his first. He was known for producing aces on critical points, even with his second serves.\nSampras was able to hit winners from both his forehand and backhand from all over the court. He was able to catch attacks wide to his forehand using his speed and hitting a forehand shot on the run. When successfully executed, he won many points outright or put opponents immediately on the defensive, due to the considerable pace and flat nature of the shot. This style did not help him on clay courts, according to some critics.\nEquipment.\nSampras used one racket type, the Wilson Pro Staff Original, for his entire professional career\u2014a racket first introduced in 1983. He played with Babolat natural gut, with all his rackets re-strung before each match (used or not) at 75\u00a0lbs tension (more or less, depending on conditions). His rackets had weight added to bring them close to 400 g, but the frame proper was a production model manufactured at a Wilson factory on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. The handles were custom-built.\nPost-retirement, Sampras has used a slightly modified Pro Staff Tour 90 and, from 2008, a new version of the original Pro Staff, produced with in-between head size of 88 square inches and heavier weight at 349\u00a0grams unstrung.\nSince mid-2010, Sampras has been spotted at multiple exhibitions playing with a Babolat Pure Storm Tour, along with Babolat's popular RPM Blast strings.\n\"I need a little more pop. ... I need it if I'm going to play some tennis,\" he said after playing Ga\u00ebl Monfils in an exhibition at the SAP Open.\nDuring a good part of 2011, Sampras used a racquet that was painted all black, with Tourna Grip and Tourna Damper.\nIn the late 1980s, Sampras signed a three-year endorsement contract with Sergio Tacchini. It was extended to five years before Sampras signed with Nike in 1994. He wore Nike apparel and Nike Air Oscillate footwear on court.\nPersonal life.\nSampras's mother was born in Greece and his father was born in the United States to a Greek father and Polish mother. His older sister, Stella Sampras Webster, is the women's tennis head coach at UCLA, and his younger sister, Marion, is a teacher in Los Angeles. His older brother, Gus, has been tournament director at the Scottsdale ATP event. In 2007 he became president of the firm managing Pete's business activities.\nOn September 30, 2000, Sampras married American actress and former Miss Teen USA Bridgette Wilson. On November 21, 2002, their first son was born. On July 29, 2005, the couple had their second son. They reside in Lake Sherwood, California. Both Sampras and Wilson were committed to raising their children out of the public eye and both retired from their careers to focus on family life.\nSampras has \u03b2-thalassemia minor, a genetic trait that sometimes causes mild anemia.\nPolitically, Sampras is a Republican. He supported John McCain in 2008.\nTennis legacy.\nDuring his tennis career Sampras won 14 major singles titles, a record when he retired in 2002. He was 14\u20134 in major finals and, while he never won the French Open, he dominated on grass with seven Wimbledon victories. Sampras won the US Open in 1990 as the youngest champion in history, and finished his career with his fifth US title. He won five year-end championships and was world No. 1 for 286 weeks and a record six consecutive years. Sampras won 64 top-level singles titles and was also a member of two champion US Davis Cup teams. Due to his achievements, Sampras is regarded by many as one of the greatest tennis players in the history of the sport.\nIn particular, Sampras is remembered for his excellent technique, devastating serve, and his mastery of the serve-and-volley playstyle. Sampras' natural attacking serve-and-volley, his quiet demeanor, and all-round game, made him the perfect foil against power-baseliner Andre Agassi, his counterpoint in style, and biggest rival. It is considered one the sport's greatest rivalries in history. Sampras won their head-to-head meetings 20\u201314, and 9\u20137 in finals.\nIn 2005, \"Tennis Magazine\" named Sampras the greatest player since 1965. In 2012 Tennis Channel produced the \"100 Greatest of All Time\" where Sampras was ranked the third greatest male player. After winning Wimbledon in 2000, AP News called Sampras the greatest of his generation. Sampras himself said \"In a lot of ways, I felt like I was born to win Wimbledon.\"\nPlayers and sportswriters have agreed that Sampras' place in tennis history is lofty. Roy Emerson, whose 12 major singles titles record Sampras broke, said \"Sampras is the greatest of all time, and I have to give him a pat on the back for getting there...\" Former player Tony Roche and sportswriter Paul Gable have also called Sampras the greatest of all time. And John McEnroe called Sampras the toughest opponent he ever played.\nCareer statistics.\nGrand Slam performance timeline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Performance key/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W\u2013L) win\u2013loss record.\nOther awards.\nSummary of professional awards.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "65962", "revid": "31504254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65962", "title": "George Everest", "text": "British surveyor and geographer (1790\u20131866)\nSir George Everest, (, ; 4 July 1790\u00a0\u2013 1 December 1866) was a British surveyor and geographer who served as Surveyor General of India from 1830 to 1843.\nAfter a military education, Everest joined the East India Company and arrived in India at the age of 16. He was eventually made an assistant to William Lambton on the Great Trigonometric Survey, and replaced Lambton as superintendent of the survey in 1823. Everest was largely responsible for surveying the meridian arc from the southernmost point of India north to Nepal, a distance of about , a task that took from 1806 to 1841 to complete. He was made Surveyor General of India in 1830, retiring in 1843 and returning to England.\nIn 1865, the Royal Geographical Society renamed Peak XV\u2014at the time only recently identified as the world's highest peak\u2014to Mount Everest in his honour. Andrew Scott Waugh, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and successor as surveyor general, had been responsible for putting his name forward in 1856. Everest's name was used as a compromise due to the difficulty of choosing between multiple local names for the mountain. He initially objected to the honour, as he had had nothing to do with its discovery and believed his name was not easily written or pronounced in Hindi.\nBiography.\nEverest was born on 4 July 1790, but his birthplace is uncertain. He was baptised at St Alfege Church in Greenwich, London, on 27 January 1791. He was born either at Greenwich or at Gwernvale Manor, his family's estate near Crickhowell, Brecknockshire (now part of Powys) in Wales. Everest was the eldest son and third of six children born to Lucetta Mary (n\u00e9e Smith) and William Tristram Everest. His father was a solicitor and justice of the peace, part of a \"Greenwich family of long standing\", and was successful enough to acquire a large estate in south Wales. His grandfather John Everest, the son of a butcher, was the first in the family to enter the legal profession. The Everest family in Greenwich can be traced at least as far back as the late 1600s, when Tristram Everest\u2013John's great-grandfather\u2013was a butcher in Church Street.\nEverest was educated at the Royal Military College in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, followed by a year at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, the military engineers' and artillery training college. He joined the East India Company as a cadet in 1806 (before he had reached the required age of 16). He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Bengal Artillery, and sailed for India in the same year.\nEverest was a Freemason and initiated on an unknown date in Neptune Lodge, Penang, under the authority of the United Grand Lodge of England. After returning to England, he joined Prince of Wales' Lodge, London, on 20 February 1829.\nEarly career in India.\nLittle is known about Everest's earliest years in India, but when he first arrived in the country at 16 years old he showed a talent for mathematics and astronomy. He was seconded to Java in 1814, where Lieutenant-Governor Stamford Raffles appointed him to survey the island. Everest returned to Bengal in 1816, where he improved British knowledge of the Ganges and the Hooghly River. He later surveyed a semaphore line from Calcutta to Benares, covering approximately . Everest's work came to the attention of Colonel William Lambton, the leader of the Great Trigonometrical Survey (GTS), who appointed him as his chief assistant. He joined Lambton at Hyderabad, India in 1818, where he was in the process of surveying a meridian arc northward from Cape Commorin. He was responsible for much of the fieldwork, but then in 1820 contracted malaria, necessitating a period of recovery spent at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.\nRecovering from malaria, Everest returned to India in 1821. He succeeded Lambton as superintendent of the GTS upon Lambton's death in 1823, and during the following years extended his predecessor's efforts on the arc up to Sironj, in present-day Madhya Pradesh. Everest was prone to suffer from poor health, however, and the effects of a bout of fever and rheumatism left him half paralysed. He returned to England in 1825, where he spent the following five years recuperating. During that time, Everest was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1827. Most of his free time was spent lobbying the East India Company for better equipment and studying the methods used by the Ordnance Survey; he frequently corresponded with Thomas Frederick Colby.\nHe became acquainted with Indian thought, according to his niece Mary Boole:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My uncle, George Everest, was sent to India in 1806 at the age of sixteen.\u00a0[...] the boy went out ignorant, un-spoiled and fresh. He made the acquaintance of a learned Brahman who taught him\u2014not the details of his own ritual, as European missionaries do, but\u2014the essential factor in all true religion, the secret of how man may hold communion with the Infinite Unknown.\nIt is very likely he introduced Indian thought to others as well:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Some time about 1825, he came to England for two or three years, and made a fast and lifelong friendship with Herschel and with Babbage, who was then quite young.(.) My uncle returned from india. He never interfered with anyone's religious beliefs or customs. But no one under his influence could continue to believe in anything in the Bible being specially sacred, except the two elements which it has in common with other sacred books: the knowledge of our relation to others and of man's power to hold direct converse with the unseen truth.\nSurveyor General of India.\nIn June 1830, Everest returned to India to continue his work on the GTS, and was simultaneously appointed Surveyor General of India. The arc from Cape Commorin to the northern border of British India was finally completed in 1841, under the supervision of Andrew Scott Waugh. To his dismay, much of his time was spent on administrative concerns, as well as combating criticism from home. The East India Company had provisionally appointed Thomas Jervis as Everest's successor, and Jervis subsequently delivered a series of lectures to the Royal Society on the perceived deficiencies of Everest's methods.\nIn response, Everest penned a series of open letters to Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, the society's president, in which he lambasted the society \"for meddling in matters of which they know little\". Jervis withdrew from consideration, and Everest successfully secured the appointment of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Waugh as his successor. He resigned in November 1842 and his commission was formally revoked in December 1843, at which point he returned to England.\nLater life.\nIn London on 11 November 1846 Everest married Emma Wing, aged 23, of Hampstead, London. They had six children.\nIn 1847, Everest published \"An Account of the Measurement of Two Sections of the Meridional Arc of India\", for which he was awarded a medal by the Royal Astronomical Society. He was later elected to fellowship of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Royal Geographical Society. Everest was promoted to colonel in 1854, made a Commander of the Order of the Bath in February 1861, and created a Knight Bachelor in March 1861. He died at his home in Hyde Park Gardens on 1 December 1866, and was buried in St Andrew's Church, Hove near Brighton.\nNaming of Mount Everest.\nGeorge Everest had no direct connection with the mountain which bears his name, which he never saw. He was, however, responsible for hiring Andrew Scott Waugh, who made the first formal observations of the mountain, and Radhanath Sikdar, who calculated its height. Before its significance was realised, Mount Everest was originally known as Peak \"B\" and later as Peak XV. In March 1856, Waugh wrote to the Royal Geographical Society to announce that the mountain was believed to be the highest in the world, and proposed that it be named \"after my illustrious predecessor\", as it was \"without any local name that we can discover\" \u2013 the \"native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal\". There were in fact several native names among the Nepalese and Tibetans, but those areas were closed off to the British at the time and people living further to the south of the Himalayas did not have a specific name for the peak. In the decade after 1856, Waugh's proposal was widely debated by the Royal Geographical Society and similar bodies. Other scholars of India put forward native names that they believed to be correct, such as Brian Houghton Hodgson's \"Deva-dhunga\" and Hermann Schlagintweit's \"Gaurisankar\". Everest himself objected to his name being used, as \"the native of India\" could not pronounce it and it could not be easily written in Hindi. Nonetheless, in 1865 the society officially settled on \"Mount Everest\" as the name.\nFamily.\nEverest had several siblings, including two younger brothers. George's first younger brother was Robert Everest, chaplain to the East India Company and author of \"A Journey Through the United States and Part of Canada\". His second (his youngest brother) was the Thomas Roupell Everest, the father of Mary Everest and a lay homoeopath. George Everest's third child, Ethel Everest, was an associate of Emma Cons and friend of Lilian Baylis. She provided financial support for the founding of Morley College in south London.\nOne of Everest's sons, Lancelot Feilding Everest, was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn. He practised as a barrister in chambers in London and was also the principal author of \"The Law of Estoppel\". Lancelot's eldest son, Cyril Feilding Everest, enlisted in the Canadian Infantry on 17 November 1914 and was killed in action on 9 October 1916 at the Battle of the Somme.\nEverest's niece, Mary Everest, married mathematician George Boole in Gloucestershire on 11 September 1855. In spite of the absence of formal training, Mary was a fine mathematician in her own right, as was one of her daughters, Alicia Boole Stott. Alicia's son, Leonard Boole Stott, studied medicine and became a pioneer in the treatment and control of tuberculosis, work for which he was later appointed an OBE Mary Boole's daughter Margaret was the mother of Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor OM, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, a renowned mathematician and physicist, and a major figure in fluid dynamics and wave theory.\nSir George Everest house in Mussoorie, India.\nEverest owned a house in Mussoorie, India for about 11 years. He purchased it, sight unseen, from General William Sampson Whish (1787\u20131853). Built in 1832, the house is known today as Sir George Everest's House and Laboratory, or Park House. The house is in Park Estate about west of Gandhi Chowk / Library Bazaar (the west end of Mall Road in Mussoorie). The location has panoramic views of the Doon Valley on one side and the Aglar River valley and the Himalayan Range to the north. After renovation at a cost of Rs 23.71 crore, the house was opened as a museum in December 2021.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In these sports, players or teams play their boules/balls towards a target ball.\nIn p\u00e9tanque, the objective is to score points by positioning one's boules closer to the target ball than those of the opponent after all boules have been thrown. This is achieved by throwing or rolling boules closer to the small target ball, officially called a \"jack\" (), or by hitting the opponents' boules away from the target, while standing inside a circle with both feet on the ground. The game is normally and best played on hard dirt or gravel. It can be played in public areas in parks or in dedicated facilities called \"boulodromes\".\nThe current form of the game was codified in 1907 or 1910 in La Ciotat, in Provence, France. The French name \"p\u00e9tanque\" (borrowed into English, with or without the acute accent) comes from \"petanca\" in the Proven\u00e7al dialect of the Occitan language, deriving from the expression \"p\u00e8 tancat\" , meaning 'foot fixed' or 'foot planted' (on the ground).\nHistory.\nInvention of the game.\nBoules games have a very long history, dating back through the Middle Ages to ancient Rome, and before that to ancient Greece.\nIn France in the second half of the 19th century, a form of boules known as \"jeu proven\u00e7al\" or \"boule lyonnaise\" was extremely popular. Players rolled their boules or ran three steps in this game before throwing one. P\u00e9tanque originally developed as an offshoot or variant of \"jeu proven\u00e7al\" in 1910, in what is now called the \"Jules Lenoir Boulodrome\" in the town of La Ciotat near Marseilles.\nJules Lenoir, a former \"jeu proven\u00e7al\" player, suffered from such severe rheumatism that he could no longer run before throwing a boule and could scarcely stand. A good friend named Ernest Pitiot was a local caf\u00e9 owner. To accommodate his friend Lenoir, Pitiot developed a variant form of the game in which the length of the pitch or field was reduced by roughly half, and a player, instead of running to throw a boule, stood, stationary, in a circle. They called the game \"pieds tanqu\u00e9s\", \"feet planted\" (on the ground), a name that eventually evolved into the game's current name, \"p\u00e9tanque\".\nThe first p\u00e9tanque tournament was organized by Ernest Pitiot and his brother Joseph Pitiot, in 1910 in La Ciotat. The game spread quickly and soon became France's most popular form of boules.\nBefore the mid-1800s, European boules games were played with solid wooden balls, usually made from boxwood root, a very hard wood. The late 1800s saw the introduction of cheap mass-manufactured nails, and wooden boules gradually began to be covered with nails, producing \"boules clout\u00e9es\" (\"nailed boules\"). After World War I, round shot manufacturing technology was adapted to allow the manufacture of hollow, all-metal boules.\nPaul Courtieu introduced the first all-metal boule, \"la Boule Int\u00e9grale,\" in the mid-1920s. The \"Int\u00e9grale\" was cast in a single piece from a bronze-aluminum alloy. Shortly thereafter, Jean Blanc invented a process of manufacturing steel boules by stamping two steel blanks into hemispheres and then welding the two hemispheres together to create a boule. With this technological advance, hollow all-metal balls rapidly became the norm.\nGlobal spread of the game.\nAfter the development of the all-metal boule, p\u00e9tanque spread rapidly from Provence to the rest of France, then to the rest of Europe, and then to Francophone colonies and countries around the globe. Today, many countries have their own national governing bodies.\nIn France, the \"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de P\u00e9tanque et Jeu Proven\u00e7al\" (FFPJP) has over 300,000 licensed members.\nThere are strong national federations in Germany, Spain and England. P\u00e9tanque is actively played in many nations with histories of French colonial influence, especially in Southeast Asia, including Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Puducherry in India, as well as some parts of Africa. The sport is also popular in Madagascar and Thailand.\nP\u00e9tanque was featured at the 2015 All-Africa Games hosted by the Republic of the Congo, a former French colony.\nP\u00e9tanque is not widely played in the Americas. There is a Canadian p\u00e9tanque federation based in Qu\u00e9bec. In the United States, the Federation of P\u00e9tanque USA (FPUSA) reports that about 30,000 play nationwide. As of 1 December 2015, FPUSA counted 2,141 members in the US, in 52 affiliated clubs.\nOn the international level, the governing body of p\u00e9tanque is the \"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de P\u00e9tanque et Jeu Proven\u00e7al\" (FIPJP). It was founded in 1958 in Marseille and has almost 800,000 members as of 2022[ [update]].\nNational and international competitions.\nThere are a number of important world championship tournaments.\nThe FIPJP world championships take place every two years. Men's championships are held in even-numbered years, while Women's and Youth championships are held in odd-numbered years.\nPerhaps the best-known international championship is the \"Mondial la Marseillaise \u00e0 P\u00e9tanque\", which takes place every year in Marseille, France, with more than 10,000 participants and more than 150,000 spectators.\nThe largest annual tournament in the United States is the P\u00e9tanque Amelia Island Open (formerly the P\u00e9tanque America Open), held in each year in November at Amelia Island, Florida.\nP\u00e9tanque is not currently an Olympic sport, although the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Sports de Boules\u2014which was created in 1985 by several international boules organizations specifically for this purpose\u2014has been lobbying the Olympic committee since 1985 to make it part of the Olympic Games. P\u00e9tanque has appeared in every edition of The World Games from 1985 onward. The 2022 World Games in the United States included women\u2019s p\u00e9tanque, the first time that only women's events were held as part of the boules sports programme at The World Games.\nPlaying the game.\nBased on the rules of the \"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de P\u00e9tanque &amp; Jeu Proven\u00e7al\".\nEquipment.\nP\u00e9tanque is played by two teams, each comprising one, two, or three players. Three boules are used per player in singles and doubles games, and two per player in triples games. A small wooden ball called a \"jack\" (\"cochonnet\") serves as the target for the players' throws.\nThe area where a game of p\u00e9tanque is played is called a \"terrain\". A game can be played in an open area such as a public park, where the boundaries of the terrain are not marked, or more formally on a \"marked terrain\" where the terrain boundaries are marked (traditionally, by strings tightly strung between nails driven into the ground).\nIn p\u00e9tanque, players throw while standing in a circle (\"cercle\"). Traditionally, this was simply scratched in the dirt. From around 2005, red plastic \"prefabricated\" circles were introduced and are now widely used in formal games. A circle drawn on the ground must be in diameter, while a plastic circle must have an inside diameter of .\nThe \"ends\".\nA game consists of several \"ends\" (\"m\u00e8nes\"). An end consists of the throwing out of the jack, followed by the two teams throwing their boules. After both teams have thrown all of their boules, the team with the boule closest to the jack wins the end.\nThe winning team scores one point for each of its boules that is closer than the opposing team's closest boule. Each end therefore gives the winning team a minimum of one point, and a potential maximum of six in a doubles/triples game. The first team to score 13 points wins the game.\nOrder of play.\nA coin toss is held between the teams at the start of the game. The winning team draws/places the circle, and one of its members stands inside and throws the jack to a distance of . One member then throws a boule, followed by a member of the opposing team. From this point on, the team whose boule is closest to the jack is said to \"hold the point,\" and the opposing team throws the next boule. A team's turn ends upon either gaining the point or running out of boules; in the latter case, the opposing team throws all of its remaining boules.\nIf at any point the closest boules from each team are equidistant from the jack, then the team that threw the last boule throws again. If the boules are still equidistant after this throw, then the teams play alternately until the tie is broken. If the boules remain equidistant once the end is complete, then neither team scores any points.\nThe team that wins an end starts the next one. A player from the winning team draws/places a circle around the jack, stands inside, and throws the jack to start the end.\nScoring.\nAn end is complete when both teams have played all of their boules, or when the jack is knocked out of play (goes \"dead\").\nIf an end is complete with the jack still in play (\"live\"), then the team with the boule nearest to it scores one point for each of its boules that is closer than the opposing team's nearest boule. However, neither team scores any points if their closest boules are the same distance from the jack.\nIf the jack is dead at the completion of an end, and if only one team still has boules to play, then that team scores one point for each unused boule. Otherwise, neither team scores.\nEquipment specifications.\nBoules.\nLeisure boules are boules that do not meet the FIPJP standards for competition boules, but are less expensive than competition boules and completely adequate for \"backyard\" games. Unlike competition boules, leisure boules are a \"one size fits all\" affair\u2014they come in one weight and size.\nCompetition boules must meet specifications set by the FIPJP. They must be hollow and made of metal (usually steel) with a diameter between and a weight between . When purchasing competition boules, a purchaser has a choice of a number of characteristics, including the size, weight, and hardness of the boules, as well as the striations (patterned grooves on the surface of the boules).\nJack.\nThe jack, or target ball, is a small ball made of wood, traditionally boxwood or beechwood, in diameter. In the past, jacks were often left \"natural\"\u2014unfinished or with a clear finish\u2014but nowadays they are often painted in bright colours. In French, the jack is known by a variety of names, including \"but\" (goal or target), \"cochonnet\" (piglet), \"bouchon\" (\"little ball\" in Proven\u00e7al language, not related to the French word \"bouchon\" that designates a bung), \"le petit\" (the little one), and \"gari\" (\"rat\", also in Proven\u00e7al language).\nPlaying area.\nP\u00e9tanque can be played on almost any flat, open space. The ground may be irregular and interrupted by trees or rocks, and the surface is likely to be uneven, with some areas hard and smooth and other areas rough and stony. When an area is constructed specifically for the purposes of playing p\u00e9tanque, the playing surface is typically loose gravel, decomposed granite, brick grog or crushed sea shell. Sandy beaches are not suitable, although light plastic boules are sometimes used to adapt the game for the beach. There is no requirement for backboards or sideboards (as in bocce), but dedicated playing areas are often enclosed in boards or some other structural barrier.\nIn France, village squares and park pathways are often used as p\u00e9tanque playing areas. In addition, many towns have recreational facilities (\"boulodromes\") constructed specifically for playing p\u00e9tanque.\nAn area where a single p\u00e9tanque game is played is called a \"terrain\". A \"playing area\" (\"aire de jeu\") is an area containing one or more terrains. For tournaments, a large playing area is subdivided and marked off (typically using nails and string) into rectangular \"marked terrains\" (also known as \"lanes\" (\"cadres\") or \"pistes\") so that multiple games may be carried on simultaneously. For tournament play, a marked terrain is a rectangle at least wide and long.\nStrategy.\nPointing and shooting.\nGenerally speaking, a player throws a boule with one of two objectives:\nThe best throw is called a \"carreau\". It is a shot that knocks away the opponent's boule, leaving the thrown boule exactly in its place.\nPlayers who are skilful enough to shoot effectively are called 'shooters' (\"tireurs\"); players who usually point are called 'pointers' (\"pointeurs\") As a matter of strategy, pointers play first and shooters are held in reserve in case the opponents place well.

'Boules' itself is a French loanword that usually refers to the game especially played in France.\nBoules-type games are traditional and popular in many European countries and are also popular in some former French colonies in Africa and Asia. Boules games are often played in open spaces (town squares and parks) in villages and towns. Dedicated playing areas for boules-type games are typically large, level, rectangular courts made of flattened earth, gravel, or crushed stone, enclosed in wooden rails or back boards. To win, a team must reach 15 points, with a few exceptions.\nBoules games in history.\nAs early as the 6th century BC the ancient Greeks are recorded to have played a game of tossing coins, then flat stones, and later stone balls, called \"spheristics\", trying to have them go as far as possible. The ancient Romans modified the game by adding a target that had to be approached as closely as possible. This Roman variation was brought to Provence by Roman soldiers and sailors. A Roman sepulchre (now in the Campana Collection in the Louvre) shows children playing this game, stooping down to measure the points.\nAfter the Romans, the stone balls were replaced by wooden balls. In the Middle Ages, Erasmus referred to the game as in Latin, but it became commonly known as boules (i.e. 'balls'), and it was played throughout Europe. King Henry III of England banned the playing of the game by his archers \u2013 he wanted them to be practicing archery, not playing boules. In the 14th century, Charles IV and Charles V of France forbade the sport to commoners; only in the 17th century was the ban lifted.\nBy the 19th century, in England the game had become bowls or \"lawn bowling\". In France it was known as and was played throughout the country. The French artist Meissonnier made two paintings showing people playing the game, and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac described a match in .\nIn the South of France, the game evolved into (or ), in which players rolled their boules or ran three steps before throwing a boule. The game was extremely popular in France in the second half of the 19th century (the first official club was established in France in 1854). It was played informally in villages all over Provence, usually on squares of land in the shade of plane trees. Matches of around the start of the 20th century are memorably described in the memoirs of novelist Marcel Pagnol.\nIn 1910, an offshoot of called p\u00e9tanque was developed in the town of La Ciotat, in Provence. It eventually became the dominant boules sport in France, and is widely played in other European countries.\nTypes.\nBoules games may be sub-divided into two categories based on typical throwing technique: \nBoules games may also be subdivided into two other categories based on typical throwing technique: \nAlternatively, boules games may be subdivided into categories based on the structure and material of the ball: \nAlternatively, boules games may be subdivided into categories based on the shape of the ball: \nThere may be other variations as well, for instance in the way the ball is launched, in the dimensions of the playing area, whether obstacles (such as trees) are considered in-bounds or out-of-bounds, and whether it is legal to play balls off of enclosing boards or obstacles. \nFinally, some boules games (bocce, p\u00e9tanque) began as variations of earlier games, deliberately created and designed to accommodate the needs of players with physical disabilities.\nSuch variations produce a wide variety of boules-type games played all over the world.\nTerminology.\nIn Italian bocce, balls may be thrown in three ways: , and .\nBalls.\nThere is a wide variation in the size and materials of the balls used in boules-type games.\nOriginally, in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, the balls were probably made of stone.\nGallic tribes, which were introduced to boules by the Romans, used wooden boules. In 19th-century France, boules were typically made of a very hard wood, boxwood root.\nIn the mid-19th century, techniques were developed for the mass production of iron nails. Following this technological improvement, boxwood balls studded with nails (boules clout\u00e9es) were introduced in an effort to improve the durability of the balls. This eventually led to the development of balls that were completely covered in nails, creating a ball that appeared almost to be made of metal.\nBy the 1920s, the growing popularity of boules in France created a demand that could not be satisfied using the available supplies of natural boxwood root, which were beginning to disappear. Paul Courtieu and Vincent Miles had the idea of manufacturing a ball made entirely of metal. Avoiding steel-based alloys (which were too hard and rust-prone) they developed an alloy based on aluminum and bronze, and (in 1923) patented a metal ball made of two welded-together hemispheres. A year later, in 1924, they filed a patent for a ball that was cast in a single piece -- \"La Boule int\u00e9grale\". Louis Tarchier and Jean Blanc are generally credited with developing, around 1925, the process by which virtually all metal boules are manufactured today\u2014steel blanks are pressed into hollow hemispheres which are then soldered together and machined to make a hollow steel boule.\nToday, some boules sports (e.g. bocce) still use wooden (or epoxy composite) balls, while others (e.g. p\u00e9tanque) use metal balls. The wooden balls used in bocce tend to be bigger than the smaller metal balls used in p\u00e9tanque.\nGames.\nThe same game can be known by different names in different languages and locations or the same name can be used for different local variations of a game.\nThe category of boules games includes the following:\nInternational boules organizations.\nThe Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Sports de Boules (CMSB) was created (on 21 December 1985 in Monaco) by three international boules organizations for the purpose of lobbying the Olympic committee to make boules sports part of the summer Olympics. To date, its efforts have been unsuccessful. However, boccia has been part of the Paralympic Games since the 1984 Summer Paralympics. The organizations that joined together to create the CMSB were the following:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65968", "revid": "525927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65968", "title": "City News Bureau of Chicago", "text": "City News Bureau of Chicago (CNB), or City Press (1890\u20132005), was a news bureau that served as one of the first cooperative news agencies in the United States. It was founded in 1890 by the newspapers of Chicago to provide a common source of local and breaking news and also used by them as a training ground for new reporters, described variously as \"journalism's school of hard knocks\" or \"the reporter's boot camp.\" Hundreds of reporters \"graduated\" from the City News Bureau into newspaper dailies\u2014both local and national\u2014or other avenues of writing.\nOperations.\nThe City News Bureau had reporters in all important news sites, courthouses, Chicago City Hall, the County Building, Criminal Courts, as well as having as many as ten police reporters on duty. It operated around the clock and all year round. The reporters, though young, worked in competition with some of the best reporters in the country, working on the same stories as all the others, questioning politicians and police, and fighting for scoops.\nThey covered every single death reported to the coroner's office, every important meeting, every news conference, every court case that had once been a news story, even if the trial wasn't newsworthy.\nThe training was rigorous. The reporters were all amateurs when they came to work, but the rewrite men were professionals, accustomed to teaching in a hard school. Turnover was rapid at CNB as reporters eagerly sought newspaper jobs as soon as they felt they had paid their dues in CNB trenches.\nOne graduate was Kurt Vonnegut. He described his work there in the late 1940s in terms that could have been used by almost any other City Press reporter of any era:\n\"I'm very proud I worked there. It was like being a soldier.\"\n\"Well, the Chicago City News Bureau was a tripwire for all the newspapers in town when I was there, and there were five papers, I think. We were out all the time around the clock and every time we came across a really juicy murder or scandal or whatever, they\u2019d send the big time reporters and photographers, otherwise they\u2019d run our stories. So that\u2019s what I was doing, and I was going to university at the same time.\"\nA legendary story held that a young reporter who called in a story of the slaying of an infant was sent back to get the answer to the question, \"What color were the dead baby's eyes?\" Certainly, all the young reporters were sent back to get more information so that they would learn to get it in the first place. Another watchword: \"If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out with two independent sources\" or \"If your mother says she loves you, check it out.\"\nThe City News Bureau had special operations for covering elections in Chicago and Cook County, providing regular updates precinct by precinct years before such coverage was common. A similar service reported on the scores of most high-school games in Chicago, but otherwise there was no sports coverage.\nThe film \"Call Northside 777\", in which James Stewart plays a reporter whose articles free an innocent man from prison, was based on a story that originated at the City News Bureau.\nThe City News Bureau broke the story of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929, but, for once, didn't quite believe its reporter, Walter Spirko, and sent the following bulletin:\nSix men are reported to have been seriously injured . . .\nSpirko continued as a Chicago reporter for many years, breaking a story of thieving policemen known as the Summerdale police scandal.\nThe City News Bureau didn't always confine its scoops to local stories. One momentous non-local event originated on a quiet Sunday in 1941, when a reporter at the Damen Avenue police station on the city's near-northwest side was slowly twisting a dial on the desk sergeant's short wave radio when he heard the static-punctuated voice of an amateur radio operator telling another \"ham\" that \"bombs are falling all over Honolulu.\" The eavesdropping reporter could hear explosions in the background of the radio transmission. He phoned what he had heard to his city editor, who immediately sent bulletins to the CNB's four major newspapers and the member of the Associated Press. It caught the AP by surprise and within seconds the report was on news wires worldwide. CNB was the first to break the news of Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor.\nPlaywright Charles MacArthur, co-author of the play \"The Front Page\", was a City Press reporter; several of the characters in the play were based on City Press personalities, notably the skittish assistant managing editor Larry Mulay.\nOther well-known alumni: syndicated columnist and \"Politico\" editor Roger Simon, reclusive media mogul Fred Eychaner, environmental journalist William Allen, investigative reporter Seymour Hersh, \"The New York Times\" columnist David Brooks (author of \"Bobos in Paradise\"), pop artist Claes Oldenburg, public-television personality John Callaway, editor Russell Freeburg, consumer advocate David Horowitz, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mike Royko, Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Herbert Lawrence Block (commonly known as Herblock), and Jack Star, later to become senior editor of Look (American magazine) and perennial freelance writer for Chicago Magazine.\nClarence John Boettiger, son-in-law of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, became a \"Chicago Tribune\" police reporter after working for the City News Bureau to begin his career. Elizabeth Austin of the bureau later became a speechwriter for one Illinois governor and communications director for another. Tom Quinn, who worked for City News in 1964 while a student at Northwestern, later managed Jerry Brown's first campaign for governor of California, became chairman of California's Air Resources Board and the state's Environmental Secretary, and served as chairman for two of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's campaigns. \nOther mainstays of City News Bureau's staff included Arnold Dornfeld, Melvyn Douglas, Susan Kuczka, Paul Zimbrakos, Milton Golin, Bernard Judge. Isaac Gershman served as managing editor from 1931-1964.\nThe City News Bureau had three teletype wires, one for the Chicago dailies, one for radio and television stations, and one for press releases. In addition, it owned a pneumatic tube system that ran under Chicago streets connecting all the Chicago dailies, including those that no longer existed. The office kept a speaker system tuned live 24 hours to the coded Chicago police radio dispatcher frequency, announcing addresses to which City News Bureau reporters were sent.\nAs Chicago went down to only two daily newspapers, the City News Bureau slowly faded and was reduced to a minor operation. It was still widely used by both papers, the \"Chicago Tribune\" and \"Chicago Sun-Times\", until the \"Sun-Times\" decided to pull out of the joint ownership agreement it had inherited from the City News Bureau's original owners, for which the \"Sun-Times\" was a successor paper. The PR Newswire, which was part of City News, was sold; the \"Sun-Times\" decided it cost too much to keep City News running, and it was closed after its last dispatch February 28, 1999. Electronic news media\u2014both radio and television\u2014both used City News throughout the 1990s, until the \"Sun-Times\", owned by Conrad Black's Hollinger International, decided to pull out. (After Black was indicted in 2005 on charges of looting Hollinger, some speculated his desire to squeeze cash out of the company's properties helped hasten the demise of the original City News.)\nThe New City News Service, owned by the \"Tribune\", opened soon thereafter, and soon changed its name to the City News Service. Though smaller, it was run by Paul Zimbrakos, a 40-plus year employee of the old CNB, and the bureau's last editor. \"Sun-Times\" management had thought they would be able to create a new, cheaper wire service, staffed with few people. When that venture\u2014called Alliance News\u2014failed, for a while the \"Sun-Times\" used the part-time help of Medill News Service, staffed by unpaid journalism students from the Medill School of Journalism. The \"Sun-Times\", however, was barred from receiving the New City News Service wire because of its being in competition with the \"Tribune\".\nThough the \"Tribune\" had been hailed by former City Newsers as a savior of CNB, on December 1, 2005, the \"Tribune\" informed the 19 employees of City News Service that their jobs were being eliminated as part of cost-cutting measures going on throughout the Tribune Company. (See Associated Press and other news stories of December 1 &amp; December 2, 2005.) \"Tribune\" editors and executives reasoned that CNS was providing the \"Tribune's\" competitors' Web sites with news that the paper itself should have exclusively, the better to compete in an age of Internet news distribution.\nThe City News Service closed at the end of 2005, and was swallowed into a smaller \"Tribune\" Internet news operation.\nCity News lives on, in spirit, at least, at the \"Sun-Times\". In February 2006, the \"Sun-Times\" worked to fill the void felt at the city's TV and radio stations by the demise of the old City News by starting its own 24-hour newswire, the STNG Wire. The key to the operation, staffed by veterans of both the original and the \"Tribune\"-run City News, is the Daybook, the invaluable daily listing of press conferences, court activity and other events throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, which is shared with subscribers and the Sun Times News Group family. The STNG wire also covers the blood and guts news\u2014the fires, murders, shootings, stabbings, automobile accidents\u2014that City News was known for, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nFormer City News Editor Paul Zimbrakos continues to teach young journalists through his City News Bureau course at Loyola University Chicago. Here is the course description from the Loyola School of Communication website:\n\"In fall 2009 the School of Communication started offering students access to a Chicago news gathering institution the City News Bureau. For over 100 years Chicago hosted one of the best news bureaus in the country. Young reporters learned at The City New Bureau of Chicago how the city worked and how they could best cover the city. We are re-launching that bureau in the form of a course this fall. It will be taught by two remarkable journalism veterans. Paul Zimbrakos was the Managing Editor of the bureau for a number of years before it closed its doors and tutored many of the best journalists in the country. Jack Smith was the former CBS Bureau Chief in Chicago and Washington DC. Together they will make this class a rich learning lab and help students discover how best to cover a city and its inner-workings.\"\nZimbrakos died May 31, 2022, according to CBS News Chicago. https://\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The population was 7,282 at the 2020 census.\nHistory.\nSalem was founded in 1823 as the county seat of the newly formed Marion County. It is situated halfway between the Indiana and Missouri borders on what was originally the Vincennes-St. Louis Road, now U.S. Highway 50.\nSalem was formerly a sundown town. For decades, Salem had signs on each main road going into town telling African Americans that they were not allowed in town after sundown.\nIn the late 1930s, production increased in local oil fields, leading to a significant population increase in the city.\nGeography.\nSalem is located in central Marion County. U.S. Route 50 passes through the city center as Main Street, leading east to Flora and west to Carlyle. Illinois Route 37 (Broadway) crosses US 50 in the center of town, leading north to Alma and south to Dix. Interstate 57 passes through the west side of Salem, with access from Exit 116 (US 50); the Interstate leads northeast to Effingham and south to Mount Vernon.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Salem has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.17%, are water. Town Creek flows through the east side of the city, running to Crooked Creek just south of the city limits.

{"id": "65974", "revid": "45366078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65974", "title": "First-person narrative", "text": "Mode where a story is narrated by one character at a time, speaking for and about themselves\nA first-person narrative (also known as a first-person perspective, voice, point of view, etc.) is a mode of storytelling in which a storyteller recounts events from that storyteller's own personal point of view, using first-person grammar such as \"I\", \"me\", \"my\", and \"myself\" (also, in plural form, \"we\", \"us\", etc.). It must be narrated by a first-person character, such as a protagonist (or other focal character), re-teller, witness, or peripheral character. Alternatively, in a visual storytelling medium (such as video, television, or film), the first-person perspective is a graphical perspective rendered through a character's visual field, so the camera is \"seeing\" out of a character's eyes. \nA classic example of a first-person protagonist narrator is Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" (1847), in which the title character is telling the story in which she herself is also the protagonist: \"I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me\". \"Srikanta\" by Bengali writer Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay is another first-person perspective novel which is often called a \"masterpiece\". Srikanta, the title character and protagonist of the novel, tells his own story: \"What memories and thoughts crowd into my mind, as, at the threshold of the afternoon of my wandering life, I sit down to write the story of its morning hours!\"\nThis device allows the audience to see the narrator's mind's eye view of the fictional universe, but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view. Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An unreliable narrator is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions.\nPoint of view device.\nAn example of the telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of \"I\", is Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\", which begins with \"Call me Ishmael.\"\nFirst-person narration may sometimes include an embedded or implied audience of one or more people. The story may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.\nIdentity.\nA story written in the first person is most often told by the main character, but may also be told from the perspective of a less important character as they witness events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else.\nReliability.\nFirst-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience sees the story through the narrator's views and knowledge only. The narrator is an imperfect witness by definition, because they do not have a complete overview of events. Furthermore, they may be pursuing some hidden agenda (an \"unreliable narrator\").\nCharacter weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written. Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and are they to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. Unreliable narrators are not uncommon.\nIn the first-person-plural point of view, narrators tell the story using \"we\". That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:\nOther examples include \"Twenty-Six Men and a Girl\" by Maxim Gorky, \"The Treatment of Bibi Haldar\" by Jhumpa Lahiri, \"During the Reign of the Queen of Persia\" by Joan Chase, \"Our Kind\" by Kate Walbert, \"I, Robot\" by Isaac Asimov, and \"We Didn't\" by Stuart Dybek.\nFirst-person narrators can also be multiple, as in Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa's \"In a Grove\" (the source for the movie \"Rashomon\") and Faulkner's novel \"The Sound and the Fury\". Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.\nThere can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in Robert A. Heinlein's \"The Number of the Beast\". The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their \"own\" chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in a linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak \"live\" about the same event.\nThe first-person narrator may be the principal character (e.g., Gulliver in \"Gulliver's Travels\"), someone very close to them who is privy to their thoughts and actions (Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes stories) or one who closely observes the principal character (such as Nick Carraway in \"The Great Gatsby\"). These can be distinguished as \"first-person major\" or \"first-person minor\" points of view.\nNarrators can report others' narratives at one or more removes. These are called \"frame narrators\": examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in \"Wuthering Heights\" by Emily Bront\u00eb; and the unnamed narrator in \"Heart of Darkness\" by Joseph Conrad. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator's character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants' gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.\nA rare form of the first person is the first-person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third-person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story's world is generally provided or implied unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Three notable examples are \"The Book Thief\" by Markus Zusak, where the narrator is Death, \"From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\", where the narrator is the titular character but is describing the story of the main characters, and \"The Lovely Bones\" by Alice Sebold, where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, extracorporeal viewpoint, her family's struggle to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known.\nAutobiography.\nIn autobiographical fiction, the first-person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first-person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include Jim Carroll in \"The Basketball Diaries\" and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. in \"Timequake\" (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book\u2014\"the book in your hands\"\u2014and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include \"The Name of the Rose\" by Umberto Eco, and \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\" by Mark Haddon. Another example is a fictional \"Autobiography of James T. Kirk\" which was \"Edited\" by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek) as he wrote the novel.\nDetective fiction.\nSince the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, the first-person narrative is often used for detective fiction, so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective principal assistant, the \"Watson\", to be the narrator: this derives from the character of Dr. Watson in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.\nForms.\nFirst-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"Notes from Underground\"; dramatic monologue, also in Albert Camus' \"The Fall\"; or explicitly, as Mark Twain's \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\"\nOther forms include temporary first-person narration as a story within a story, wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily, and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.\nStyles.\nWith a first-person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first-person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice, and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.\nFirst-person narratives can tend towards a stream of consciousness and interior monologue, as in Marcel Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\". The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a false document, such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\". As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a frame story presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell their own story, as in Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\".\nFirst-person narrators are often unreliable narrators since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\"), lie (as in \"The Quiet American\" by Graham Greene, or \"The Book of the New Sun\" series by Gene Wolfe), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in \"The Remains of the Day\" by Kazuo Ishiguro, or in Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"). Henry James discusses his concerns about \"the romantic privilege of the 'first person'\" in his preface to \"The Ambassadors\", calling it \"the darkest abyss of romance.\"\nOne example of a multi-level narrative structure is Joseph Conrad's novella \"Heart of Darkness\", which has a double framework: an unidentified \"I\" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses the first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an \"I\" narrator introducing a storyteller as \"he\" (Marlow), who talks about himself as \"I\" and introduces another storyteller as \"he\" (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of \"I\".\nFilms.\nFirst-person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.\nAn example of first-person narration in a film would be the narration given by the character Greg Heffley in the film adaptation of the popular book series \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
