The problem with this system became obvious the first year, since Karl Struss and Charles Rosher were nominated for their work together on \".\" Still, three other films shot individually by either Rosher or Struss were also listed as part of the nomination. In the second year, 1929, there were no nominations at all, although the Academy has a list of unofficial titles that were under consideration by the Board of Judges. In the third year, 1930, films, not cinematographers, were nominated, and the final award did not show the cinematographer's name.\nFinally, for the 1931 awards, the modern system in which individuals are nominated for a single film was adopted in all profession-related categories. From 1939 to 1966 with the exception of 1957, there were also separate awards for color and black-and-white cinematography. After \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1966), the most recent black-and-white films to win since then are \"Schindler's List\" (1993), \"Roma\" (2018) and \"Mank\" (2020).\nFloyd Crosby won the award for \"\" in 1931, which was the last silent film to win in this category. Hal Mohr won the only write-in Academy Award ever, in 1935 for \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Mohr was also the first person to win for both black-and-white and color cinematography.\nNo winners are lost, although some of the earliest nominees (and of the unofficial nominees of 1928\u201329) are lost, including \"The Devil Dancer\" (1927), \"The Magic Flame\" (1927), and \"4 Devils\" (1928). \"The Right to Love\" (1930) is incomplete, and \"Sadie Thompson\" (1927) is incomplete and partially reconstructed with stills.\nDavid Lean holds the record for the director with the most films that won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the Oscars with five wins out of six nominations for \"Great Expectations\", \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"Lawrence of Arabia\", \"Doctor Zhivago\", and \"Ryan's Daughter\".\nThe first nominees shot primarily on digital video were \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" and \"Slumdog Millionaire\" in 2009, with \"Slumdog Millionaire\" being the first winner. The following year, \"Avatar\" was the first nominee and winner to be shot entirely on digital video.\nIn January 2017, Bradford Young became the first African-American cinematographer to be nominated for an Academy Award, for his work on \"Arrival\".\nIn 2018, Rachel Morrison became the first woman to receive a nomination. Prior to that, it had been the last non-acting Academy Award category to never nominate a woman.\nIn 2019, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n became the first winner of this category to have also served as director on the film, for \"Roma\". This followed a public dispute between Cuar\u00f3n and the Academy over the Academy's plan to shorten the Oscars broadcast by relegating four awards, including cinematography, to the commercial breaks in the show. Cuar\u00f3n objected by saying, \"In the history of cinema, masterpieces have existed without sound, without color, without a story, without actors and without music. No single film has ever existed without cinematography ...\"\nWinners and nominees.\nWinners are listed first in colored row, followed by the other nominees.\nShortlisted finalists.\nFinalists for Best Cinematography were selected by branch members, who voted for ten finalists which were screened to determine the five nominees.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61836", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61836", "title": "Treponema pallidum", "text": "Species of bacterium\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTreponema pallidum, formerly known as \"Spirochaeta pallida\", is a microaerophilic, gram-negative, spirochaete bacterium with subspecies that cause the diseases syphilis, bejel (also known as endemic syphilis), and yaws. It is known to be transmitted only among humans and baboons. \"T. pallidum\" can enter the host through mucosal membranes or open lesions in the skin and is primarily spread through sexual contact. It is a helically coiled microorganism usually 6\u201315 \u03bcm long and 0.1\u20130.2 \u03bcm wide. \"T. pallidum\"'s lack of both a tricarboxylic acid cycle and processes for oxidative phosphorylation results in minimal metabolic activity. As a chemoorganoheterotroph, \"Treponema pallidum\" is an obligate parasite that acquires its glucose carbon source from its host. Glucose can be used not only as a primary carbon source but also in glycolytic mechanisms to generate ATP needed to power the bacterium given its minimal genome. The treponemes have cytoplasmic and outer membranes. Using light microscopy, treponemes are visible only by using dark-field illumination. \"T. pallidum\" consists of three subspecies, \"T. p. pallidum, T. p. endemicum,\" and \"T. p. pertenue,\" each of which has a distinct related disorder. The ability of \"T. pallidum\" to avoid host immune defenses has allowed for stealth pathogenicity. The unique outer membrane structure and minimal expression of surface proteins of \"T. pallidum\" has made vaccine development difficult. \"Treponema pallidum\" can be treated with high efficacy by antibiotics that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis such as the beta-lactam antimicrobial penicillin-G.\nSubspecies.\nThree subspecies of \"T. pallidum\" are known:\nThe three subspecies causing yaws, bejel, and syphilis are morphologically and serologically indistinguishable. The genomes of three of the \"T. pertenue\" strains are similar to those of the \"T. pallidum\" strain, differing by only 0.2%, corresponding to virulence factors. The three subspecies can be distinguished by genetics, using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), which utilizes techniques such as PCR, restriction digest and gel electrophoresis. Genes \"tprC\", \"tprI\", and the 5' flanking region of \"tpp15\" can be used to differentiate between the three subspecies based on DNA fragment lengths and location of bands in gel electrophoresis. These bacteria were originally classified as members of separate species, but DNA hybridization analysis indicates they are members of the same species. \"Treponema carateum\", the cause of pinta, remains a separate species because no isolate is available for DNA analysis. Disease transmittance in subspecies \"T. p. endemicum\" and \"T. p. pertenue\" is considered non-venereal. \"T. p. pallidum\" is the most invasive pathogenic subspecies, while \"T. carateum\" is the least invasive of the species. \"T. p. endemicum\" and \"T. p. pertenue\" are intermediately invasive.\nLaboratory identification.\n\"Treponema pallidum\" was first microscopically identified in syphilitic chancres by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin in 1905. Historically, this bacterium was identified in the clinical laboratory through visualization in dark field microscopy. This bacterium can be detected with special stains, such as the Dieterle stain. \"T. pallidum\" is also detected by serology, including nontreponemal VDRL, rapid plasma reagin, treponemal antibody tests (FTA-ABS), \"T. pallidum\" immobilization reaction, and syphilis TPHA test.\nMicrobiology.\nPhysiology.\n\"Treponema pallidum\" is a helically shaped bacterium with high motility consisting of an outer membrane, peptidoglycan layer, inner membrane, protoplasmic cylinder, and periplasmic space. It is often described as gram-negative, but its outer membrane lacks lipopolysaccharide, which is found in the outer membrane of other gram-negative bacteria. It has an endoflagellum (periplasmic flagellum) consisting of four main polypeptides, a core structure, and a sheath. The flagellum is located within the periplasmic space and wraps around the protoplasmic cylinder. The flagellum is arranged in a helical shape. The flagellar motor for \"T. pallidum\" lacks a P-ring, normally used for motility, and has a collar component instead, which is imbedded in the periplasm. The peptidoglycan layer interacts with the endoflagellum which may aid in motility. \"T. pallidum\"'s outer membrane has the most contact with host cells and contains few transmembrane proteins, limiting antigenicity, while its cytoplasmic membrane is covered in lipoproteins. The outer membrane adhesins of \"T. pallidum\", including fibronectin- and laminin-binding proteins, have the main function of attaching to host cells and cell-surface receptors, and they share antigenically related functional domains. The genus \"Treponema\" has ribbons of cytoskeletal cytoplasmic filaments that run the length of the cell just underneath the cytoplasmic membrane.\nOuter membrane and surface antigens.\nThe of \"T. pallidum\" has several features that have made it historically difficult to research. These include details such as its fragility. The treponemal outer membrane (OM) proteins are key factors for the bacterium's pathogenesis, persistence, and immune evasion strategies. \"Treponema's\" reputation as a \"stealth pathogen\" is primarily due to this unique (OM) structure, which serves to evade immune detection.\nThe outer membrane of \"Treponema pallidum\" contains a strikingly low concentration of transmembrane proteins, approximately 100-fold lower than other gram-negative bacteria or other spirochetes. This protects the cells from antibodies attacking it, hence they exhibit a \"puzzling lack of antigenicity\". The genome also revealed a bundle of 12 proteins and some putative hemolysins are potential virulence factors of \"T. pallidum.\" One protein, TprK, appears to constantly mutate to avoid immune response from its host.\nTP0126.\nThe TP0126 protein has been linked to the outer membrane protein family (OMP). This protein will sit in the outer membrane like a porin, which is supported by circular dichroism recombinant TP0126, and will increase the virulence factor. Researchers have classified the TP0126 protein in this class due to the homology between the protein and the porins of the OMPs. This protein is encoded by the TP0126 gene, which is conserved over all strains of \"T. pallidum.\" \nTP0326.\nTP0326 is an ortholog of the \u03b2-barrel assembly machine Bam A. BamA apparatus inserts newly synthetized and exported outer membrane proteins into the outer membrane.\nTP0453.\nTP0453 is a 287 amino acid protein associated with the inner membrane of the microbe's outer membrane. This protein lacks the extensive beta sheet structure that is characteristic of other membrane proteins, and does not traverse the outer membrane. This protein's function has been hypothesized to be involved with control of nutrient uptake.\nTP0624.\nOuter Membrane Protein A (OmpA) domain-containing proteins are necessary for maintaining structural integrity in gram-negative bacteria. These domains contain peptidoglycan binding sites which creates a \"structural bridge between the peptidoglycan layer and the outer memebrane.\" The protein TP0624 found in \"T.\" \"pallidum\" has been proposed to facilitate this structural link, as well as interactions between outer membrane proteins and corresponding domains on the thin peptidoglycan layer.\nTP0751.\nThe TP0751 protein is a protein that is unique to \"T. pallidum\", and it is thought to aid in attachment to the host's extra cellular membrane. Since this protein aids in the attachment to the host, it sits on the surface of the cells, and in 2005, it was discovered that the TP0751 protein will attach to the laminin component in the host's extracellular matrix. With that, it is thought that the TP0751 protein plays a key role in dissemination with the host.\nTP0965.\nTP0965 is a protein that is critical for membrane fusion in \"T. pallidum\", and is located in the periplasm. TP0965 causes endothelial barrier dysfunction, a hallmark of late-stage pathogenesis of syphilis. It does this by reducing the expression of tight junction proteins, which in turn increases the expression of adhesion molecules and endothelial cell permeability, which eventually leads to disruption of the endothelial layer.\nTreponema repeat family of proteins.\nThe \"Treponema\" repeat family of proteins (Tpr) are proteins expressed during the infection process. Tprs are formed by a conserved N-terminal domain, an amino-terminal stretch of about 50 amino acids, a central variable region, and a conserved C-terminal domain. The many different types of Tpr include TprA, TprB, TprC, TprD, and TprE, but variability of TprK is the most relevant due to the immune escape characteristics it allows.\nAntigen variation in TprK is regulated by gene conversion. In this way, fragments of the seven variable regions (V1\u2013V7), by nonreciprocal recombination, present in TprK and the 53 donor sites of TprD can be combined to produce new structured sequences. TprK antigen variation can help \"T. pallidum\" to evade a strong host immune reaction and can also allow the reinfection of individuals. This is possible because the newly structured proteins can avoid antibody-specific recognition. It is also suspected that the genes that encode for the TprK protein are essential in pathogenesis during the infection of syphilis.\nTo introduce more phenotypic diversity, \"T. pallidum\" may undergo phase variation. This process mainly happens in TprF, TprI, TprG, TprJ, and TprL, and it consists of a reversible expansion or contraction of polymeric repeats. These size variations can help the bacterium to quickly adapt to its microenvironment, dodge immune response, or even increase affinity to its host.\nCulture.\nIn the past century since its initial discovery, culturing the bacteria in vitro has been difficult. Without the ability to grow and maintain the bacteria in a laboratory setting, discoveries regarding its metabolism and antimicrobial sensitivity were greatly impaired. However, successful long-term cultivation of \"T.\" \"pallidum\" in vitro was reported in 2017. This was achieved using Sf1Ep epithelial cells from rabbits, which were a necessary condition for the continued multiplication and survival of the system. The medium TpCM-2 was used, an alteration of more simple media which previously only yielded a few weeks of culture growth. This success was the result of switching out minimal essential medium (MEM) with CMRL 1066, a complex tissue culture medium. With development, new discoveries about \"T.\" \"pallidum\"'s requirements for growth and gene expression may occur and in turn, yield research beneficial for the treatment and prevention of syphilis, outside of a host. However, continuous efforts to grow \"T. pallidum\" in axenic culture have been unsuccessful, indicating that it does not satisfy Koch's postulates. The challenge likely stems from the organism's strong adaptation to residing in mammalian tissue, resulting in a reduced genome and significant impairments in metabolic and biosynthetic functions.\nOptimal growth occurs at 33-35\u00a0\u00b0C, hence infection and lesion development occur on warmer skin areas, but not on colder ones such as the colder ear.\nMetabolism.\nThe bacteria rely on the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH). GPDH is an alternative when managing electrons that are produced during metabolism. In the absence of the electron transport chain, \"T. pallidum\" uses GPDH to recycle the NAD+ by oxidizing glycerol-3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and make NAD+ to keep glycolysis and other redox-dependent energy reactions. By doing this, it helps balance the ATP yield without weighing down the protein's limited supply for essential tasks.\n\"T. pallidum\" uses an enzyme called pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase rather than ATP as a way to save energy and optimize its limited resources.\n\"T. pallidum\" manages without a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation by using different efficient strategies including redox balancing and substrate-level to survive the nutrient-limited host environment.\n\"T. pallidum\" lacks enzyme orthologs for superoxide dismutase, however it does possess a superoxide reductase, maintaining the ability to reduce reactive oxygen species. In addition, \"T. pallidum\" encodes an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C, which allows for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water and alcohols. This enzyme relies on TP0919, a protein present in the cytoplasm of \"T. pallidum\".\n\"T.pallidum\" primarily relies on glucose as its primary carbon source through glycolysis, but one study has proposed the bacterium uses an acetogenic-energy conservation pathway as a way to catabolize D-lactate as an alternative carbon source. Currently, three proteins from the pathway have been identified, of which include D-lactate dehydrogenase, phosphotransacetylase, and the acetate kinase. The acetate kinase specifically acts to catabolize D-lactate for substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, producing acetate as a byproduct. This pathway, which takes place in the cytoplasm, can also generate ATP by assisting the maintenance of the electrochemical gradient that lies between the periplasm and cytoplasm of \"T.pallidum.\"\nGenome.\nThe genome of \"T. pallidum\" was first sequenced in 1998 and revealed a small 1.14 Mbp genome, one of the smallest bacterial genomes. The G + C content is 52.8%. The DNA sequences of \"T. pallidum\" species are more than 99.7% identical, and PCR-based assays are effective at differentiating these species. About 92.9% of DNA was determined to be open reading frames, 55% of which had predicted biological functions, while 17% matched hypothetical proteins of unknown function in other organisms and the remainder (28%) did not have significant similarity to other known sequences.\nThe small size of the \"T. pallidum\" genome indicates that the species has limited metabolic capabilities, and thus mostly relies on its host for many molecules typically provided by biosynthetic pathways. For instance, it is missing genes encoding key enzymes in oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, \"T.\" \"pallidum\" is no longer able to synthesize fatty acids, nucleic acids, and amino acids, instead relying on its mammalian hosts for these materials. \"T.pallidum\"'s low levels of diversity within its DNA sequence, forces the pathogen to utilize horizontal gene transfer for genetic diversity, although the specific mechanism is not well understood. It may possibly be a clonal species that still employs recombination.\nThe strains \"T. pallidum\" \"pertenue\" (TPE) and \"T.pallidum\" \"endemicum\" (TEN) also experience gene transfer via different subspecies but are notably geographically isolated. Coinfection in humans of two separate subspecies strains may be possible, as indicated by a recombination event at the \"T.pallidium\" clade within their phylogenetic lineage.\nClinical significance.\nThe clinical features of syphilis, yaws, and bejel occur in multiple stages that affect the skin. The skin lesions observed in the early stage last for weeks or months. The skin lesions are highly infectious, and the spirochetes in the lesions are transmitted by direct contact. The lesions regress as the immune response develops against \"T. pallidum\". The latent stage that results can last a lifetime in many cases. In a few cases, the disease exits latency and enters a tertiary phase, in which destructive lesions of skin, bone, and cartilage ensue. Unlike yaws and bejels, syphilis in its tertiary stage often affects the heart, eyes, and nervous system, as well.\nSyphilis.\n\"Treponema pallidum pallidum\" is a motile spirochete that is generally acquired by close sexual contact, entering the host via breaches in squamous or columnar epithelium. The organism can also be transmitted to a fetus by transplacental passage during the later stages of pregnancy, giving rise to congenital syphilis. The helical structure of \"T. p. pallidum\" allows it to move in a corkscrew motion through mucous membranes or enter minuscule breaks in the skin. In women, the initial lesion is usually on the labia, the walls of the vagina, or the cervix; in men, it is on the shaft or glans of the penis. It gains access to the host's blood and lymph systems through tissue and mucous membranes. In more severe cases, it may gain access to the host by infecting the skeletal bones and central nervous system of the body. Despite effective antibiotic treatment since the mid twentieth century, this infection has been emerging globally in the last few decades. In 2021, approximately 6 million new infections occurred globally. In laboratory cultures, some contemporary variants of \"T. p. pallidum\" strains have been failing to respond to the second line antibiotic azithromycin. This phylogenetic divergence and global presence point to the emergence of a pandemic strain cluster. In addition to phylogenetic divergence, the switch to confidential record keeping\u00a0resulted in an overall decrease in quality of tracking and recording disease prevalence.\nThe incubation period for a \"T. p. pallidum\" infection is usually around 21 days, but can range from 10 to 90 days.\nDue to its problematic cultivation in laboratory conditions, much is still unknown about the pathogenesis of \"T\". \"pallidum.\" In 2023, Hu YT et al. published an article about the \"in vitro\" interaction between microglia cells and \"T. pallidum\", which could prove to be significant in case of neurosyphilis. They have confirmed underlying mechanism of how the bacteria induce microglial apoptosis and simultaneously inhibit its clearance. They have discovered that T. pallidum activates microglia and induces autophagy on one side, but on the other side it interferes with mTORC1/TFEB pathway. This pathway is an important pathway, where the inhibition of mTORC1 signalling causes the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). TFEB is a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis and its translocation to the nucleus induces the transcription of lysosomal genes and the production of lysosomes. \"T. pallidum\" interferes in this pathway by activating mTORC1, which inhibits nuclear translocation of TFEB, which consequently inhibits lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic flux. That leads into accumulation of autophagosomes, which in turn leads to microglial apoptosis and prevents the clearance of \"T. pallidum\". This study offers good foundation for further studies of \"T. pallidum\" pathogenesis and potentially new therapeutic targets.\nYaws.\nThe causative agent of yaws is \"Treponema pallidum pertenue\", which is transmissible by direct physical contact between infected people. Yaws is not sexually transmitted, and occurs in tropical, humid environments of Africa, Pacific Islands, Asia and South America. Unlike syphilis, which displays vertical transmission, one strain of \"T. p. pertenue\" researched was not vertically transmissible in a guinea pig model, and yaws cannot be spread from mother to offspring. Yaws appears as skin lesions, usually papules, commonly on the lower extremities, but present in other areas such as the arms, trunk and hands. Three stages of yaws disease have been documented: primary yaws which presents as inflamed sores on the lower body, secondary yaws which presents as a variety of skin abnormalities along with bone inflammation, and tertiary yaws, also referred to as latent yaws, which occurs when \"T. p. pertenue\" is serologically detected in the host but no clinical signs are displayed until relapse, which often occurs years later. Yaws is treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin and benzathine penicillin-G.\nBejel.\nBejel is caused by \"Treponema pallidum endemicum\" and is a disease is that endemic in hot and dry climates. The transmission path has not been fully mapped, however infections are thought to be transmitted via direct contact with lesion secretions or fomites rather than by sexual transmission. Bejel typically causes skin lesions, which first appear as small ulcers in the mouth, and secondary lesions that form in the oropharynx, or around the nipples of nursing women. Bejel can be treated with benzathine penicillin-G.\nNon-human infection.\n\"Treponema pallidum\" has been found in non-human primates in multiple different geographical regions. In Tanzania specifically, \"T. pallidum\" geographical distribution closely aligns with the distribution of yaws in humans. The most common strains in NHPs are \"T. p. pertenue\" and \"T. p.endemicum.\" It is unclear however whether or not these NHP strains can naturally infect humans, but flies have been proposed as possible vectors in an alternative transmission route. Clinically, these infections range from asymptomatic to severe skin ulceration that affect the face or genitalia in these primates. Infection of NHPs is largely reliant on ecological patterns, behaviors, and interactions between the species. There are no current treatments available for infected NHPs.\nTreatment.\nDuring the early 1940s, rabbit models in combination with the drug penicillin allowed for a long-term drug treatment. These experiments established the groundwork that modern scientists use for syphilis therapy. Penicillin can inhibit \"T. pallidum\" in 6\u20138 hours, though the cells still remain in lymph nodes and regenerate. Penicillin is not the only drug that can be used to inhibit \"T. pallidum\"; any \u03b2-lactam antibiotics or macrolides can be used. The \"T. pallidum\" strain 14 has built-in resistance to some macrolides, including erythromycin and azithromycin. Resistance to macrolides in \"T. pallidum\" strain 14 is believed to derive from a single-point mutation that increased the organism's livability. Many of the syphilis treatment therapies only lead to bacteriostatic results, unless larger concentrations of penicillin are used for bactericidal effects. Penicillin overall is the most recommended antibiotic by the Centers for Disease Control, as it shows the best results with prolonged use. It can inhibit and may even kill \"T. pallidum\" at low to high doses, with each increase in concentration being more effective. The Guideline Development Group has recommended the development of a new treatment, a short course treatment that is administered orally and can cross the placental barriers in pregnant women.\nVaccine.\nNo vaccine for syphilis is currently available, but doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis can be used to prevent infections. The outer membrane of \"T. pallidum\" has too few surface proteins for an antibody to be effective.The outer membrane of \"T.\" \"pallidum\" has very few confirmed surface-exposed proteins, which due to the organism's elaborate biology and slow growth, has hindered progress towards the development of an effective syphilis vaccine. In contrast, some of the antigenic targets of \"T.\" \"pallidum\" are located in the periplasmic space or inner membrane, rather than being fully surface-exposed, which limits antibodies' effectiveness when trying to clear the infection. In the last century, several prototypes have been developed, and while none of them provided protection from the infection, some prevented bacteria from disseminating to distal organs and promoted accelerated healing.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An obligate human pathogen, it primarily colonizes the mucosal lining of the urogenital tract; however, it is also capable of adhering to the mucosa of the nose, pharynx, rectum, and conjunctiva. It causes the sexually transmitted genitourinary infection gonorrhea as well as other forms of gonococcal disease including disseminated gonococcemia, septic arthritis, and gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.\n\"N. gonorrhoeae\" is oxidase positive and a microaerophile that is capable of surviving phagocytosis and growing inside neutrophils. Culturing it requires carbon dioxide supplementation and enriched agar (chocolate agar) with various antibiotics (Thayer\u2013Martin). It exhibits antigenic variation through genetic recombination of its pili and surface proteins that interact with the immune system.\nSexual transmission is through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Sexual transmission may be prevented through the use of barrier protection. Perinatal transmission may occur during childbirth, though it is preventable through antibiotic treatment of the mother before birth and application of antibiotic eye gel on the eyes of the newborn. Gonococcal infections do not result in protective immunity; therefore, individuals may be infected multiple times. Reinfection is possible due to \"N. gonorrhoeae's\" ability to evade the immune system by varying its surface proteins.\nAsymptomatic infection is common in both males and females. Untreated infection may spread to the rest of the body (disseminated gonorrhea infection), especially the joints (septic arthritis). Untreated infection in women may cause pelvic inflammatory disease and possible infertility due to the resulting scarring. Gonorrhoea is diagnosed through cultures, Gram staining, or nucleic acid tests (i.e. polymerase chain reaction) of urine samples, urethral swabs, or cervical swabs. Chlamydia co-testing and testing for other STIs is recommended due to high rates of co-infection.\nAntibiotic resistance in \"N. gonorrhoeae\" is a growing public health concern, especially given its propensity to develop resistance easily. This ability of \"N. gonorrhoeae\" to rapidly adapt to novel antimicrobial treatments has been seen several times since the 1930s, making numerous treatment plans obsolete. Some strains have exhibited resistance to the current ceftriaxone treatments.\nMicrobiology.\n\"Neisseria\" species are fastidious, Gram-negative cocci (though some species are rod-shaped and occur in pairs or short chains) that require nutrient supplementation to grow in laboratory cultures. They are facultative intracellular pathogens, meaning they can persist and colonize within host cells but can also multiply outside the host cellular environment. They typically appear in pairs (diplococci), resembling the shape of coffee beans. Members of this genus do not form endospores and are nonmotile, except for pathogenic species, which are capable of moving using twitching motility; most are also obligate aerobes. Of the 17 species that colonize humans, only two are pathogenic: \"N. gonorrhoeae,\" which causes gonorrhea, and \"N. meningitidis\", a leading cause of bacterial meningitis.\nCulture and identification.\n\"N. gonorrhoeae\" can be isolated on Thayer\u2013Martin agar (or VPN) agar in an atmosphere enriched with 3-7% carbon dioxide. Thayer\u2013Martin agar is a chocolate agar plate (heated blood agar) containing nutrients and antimicrobials (vancomycin, colistin, nystatin, and trimethoprim). This agar preparation facilitates the growth of \"Neisseria\" species while inhibiting the growth of contaminating bacteria and fungi. Martin Lewis and New York City agar are other types of selective chocolate agar commonly used for \"Neisseria\" growth. \"N. gonorrhoeae\" is oxidase positive (possessing cytochrome c oxidase) and catalase positive (able to convert hydrogen peroxide to oxygen). When incubated with the carbohydrates lactose, maltose, sucrose, and glucose, \"N. gonorrhoeae\" will oxidize only the glucose.\nMetabolism.\nCarbon.\nUnlike other \"Neisseria\" species that can also metabolize maltose, \"N. gonorrhoeae\" is capable of using only glucose, pyruvate, and lactate as central carbon sources, and glucose is catabolized via both the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) and pentose phosphate (PP) pathways, and the ED pathway is the primary oxidative method. Use of these pathways is necessary as \"N. gonorrhoeae\" is incapable of glucose catabolism via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway due its lack of the phosphofructokinase (PFK) gene; however, the fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase enzyme is present to allow for gluconeogenesis to occur.\nGlucose is first metabolized through the ED pathway to produce pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, the latter of which can then further metabolized by enzymes of the EMP pathway to yield another molecule of pyruvate. The resultant pyruvate molecules are then converted into acetyl-CoA, which can then be incorporated as a substrate for the citric acid cycle (CAC) to yield high-energy electron carriers that will be used by the electron transport chain (ETC) for ATP production; however, the CAC is largely used for generating biosynthetic precursors rather than for catabolic purposes. This is due in part to inhibited expression of several CAC enzymes in the presence of glucose, pyruvate, or lactate. These enzymes, namely citrate synthase, aconitase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase, are needed for the incorporation of acetate. Instead, a partial CAC has been observed, where \u03b1-ketoglutarate is formed by glutamate dehydrogenase or transamination of oxaloacetate and glutamate by aspartate aminotransferase (yielding aspartate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate). The CAC then continues from there to yield oxaloacetate, which is an important precursor molecule for several biosynthetic pathways. Another differentiating aspect of the gonococcal CAC is the lack of malate dehydrogenase, which is instead replaced by a membrane-bound malate:quinone-oxidoreductase that operates independently of NAD+ by directly transferring electrons to ubiquinone.\nConversely, acetyl-CoA that does not enter the CAC but enters the phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (PTA-AckA) pathway, where it can be converted into acetate by phosphorylation (to form acetyl phosphate and release coenzyme A) and dephosphorylation to form ATP. While this acetate can enter the CAC for further oxidation, this does not occur so long as other carbon sources such as glucose or lactate are present, in which case it is excreted from the cell or incorporated for lipid synthesis. \"N. gonorrhoeae\" lack the glyoxylate shunt, preventing them from using acetate to form CAC intermediates to replenish the cycle.\nA significant portion of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate formed in gonococci is recycled via the gluconeogenic pathway to reform glucose 6-phosphate, as well as the intermediate fructose 6-phosphate. Both of these can then be used for pentose synthesis in the PP pathway via the oxidative and non-oxidative pathways, respectively, for subsequent nucleotide formation as well as energy production.\n\"N. gonorrhoeae\", like other pathogenic members of the genus \"Neisseria\", are capnophiles, meaning they require higher-than-normal concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) to grow, either in the form of CO2 or bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) depending on the bacterial strain. This requirement must be met exogenously during the lag and stationary growth phases, though it appears to be met through high metabolic CO2 productions in the exponential phase. Assimilation of this CO2 in \"Neisseria\" species is done by carbonic anhydrase and phosphoenolpyruvate enzymes in the periplasmic space and the cytoplasm, respectively.\nLactate catabolism is also of particular importance for gonococci, both for pathogenicity and for growth. External lactate is transported in to the cell via lactate permease (LctP). The \"N. gonorrhoeae\" genome encodes for three lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymes for that allow for metabolism of both \"L\"-lactate and \"D\"-lactate: a cytoplasmic NAD+-dependent \"D\"-lactate dehydrogenase (LdhA), which is responsible for and two membrane-bound LDHs, one specific to \"L\"-lactate (LldD) and the other specific to \"D\"-lactate (LdhD). The membrane-bound LDHs have been determined to be flavoprotein-containing respiratory enzymes that directly oxidize lactate to reduce ubiquinone. While these enzymes do not directly pump protons (H+ ions) into the periplasmic space, it is proposed that the reduction of ubiquinone by these enzymes is capable of feeding into the larger ETC.\nElectron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.\nAs an obligate human pathogen and a facultative anaerobic capnophile, \"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\" typically colonizes mucosal surfaces in microaerobic environments, such as those in the genitourinary tract. Growth in areas where oxygen concentrations are limited requires a terminal oxidase with a high affinity for oxygen; in gonococci, oxygen reduction is performed by a \"ccb3\" -type cytochrome oxidase. In addition to aerobic respiration, gonococci can also perform anaerobic respiration via the reduction of nitrite (NO2) to nitric oxide (NO) as well as reduction of NO to nitrous oxide (N2O).\nSeveral enzymes contribute electrons to the intramembranous ubiquinone pool, the first step in the ETC. These include the membrane-bound LDHs (LldD and LdhD), NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (aka NADH dehydrogenase; Nuo complex I), Na+-translocating NADH dehydrogenase (Nqr), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and the membrane-bound NAD+-independent malate:quinone-oxidoreductase (MqR).\nFollowing the initial transfer of electrons to ubiquinone, proposed schematics for the organization of the gonococcal ETC suggest the electrons can be further passed down the chain by reduction of the cytochrome \"bc1\" complex or can be directly transferred to NO as a terminal electron acceptor by NO reductase (NorB). In the case of the former, electrons can then be passed from the \"bc1\" complex along two alternative pathways via the reduction of either cytochrome \"c4\" or \"c5\". Both of these cytochromes transfer electrons to the terminal cytochrome \"ccb3\" oxidase for the reduction of O2 to form H2O under aerobic conditions.\nGonococci also reduce NO2 via an inducible outer membrane-attached copper-containing nitrite reductase (AniA, a member of the NirK protein family) under anaerobic conditions, though this process has also been noted in microaerobic conditions as a means of supplementing growth. This leads to the formation of NO that is subsequently reduced to N2O in a partial denitrification pathway. The \"ccb3\" oxidase of \"N. gonorrhoeae\", dissimilarly to other members of the \"Neisseria\" genus, is a tri-heme protein that can transfer electrons not only to O2 (conserved across \"Neisseria\" species) but also to AniA for NO2 reduction. This is in addition to the typical process of receiving electrons transferred from cytochrome \"c5\".\nThe general purpose of the ETC is the formation of the electrochemical gradient of hydrogen ions (H+ or protons), resulting from concentration differences across the plasma membrane, needed to power ATP production in a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. In gonococci, movement of protons into the periplasmic space is accomplished by the Nuo complex I, the cytochrome \"bc1\" complex, and cytochrome \"ccb3\". Subsequently, ATP synthesis is performed by the F1F0 ATP synthase, a two-part protein complex present in gonococci as well as numerous other species across phylogenetic domains. This complex couples proton translocation back into the cytoplasm along its gradient with mechanical rotation to generate ATP.\nIron.\nThe general purpose of the ETC is the formation of the electrochemical gradient of hydrogen ions (H+ or protons), resulting from concentration differences across the plasma membrane, needed to power ATP production in a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. In gonococci, movement of protons into the periplasmic space is accomplished by the Nuo complex I, the cytochrome \"bc1\" complex, and cytochrome \"ccb3\". Subsequently, ATP synthesis is performed by the F1F0 ATP synthase, a two-part protein complex present in gonococci as well as numerous other species across phylogenetic domains. This complex couples proton translocation back into the cytoplasm along its gradient with mechanical rotation to generate ATP.\nTo acquire the necessary iron, gonococci produce TonB-dependent transporters (TDTs) on the surface of their outer membrane that can directly extract iron, along with other metals, from their respective carrier proteins. Some of these include transferrin binding proteins A (TbpA) and B (TbpB), lactoferrin-binding proteins A (LbpA) and B (LbpB), and hemoglobin/hemoglobin-haptoglobin binding proteins HpuB and HpuA. In addition to these proteins, gonococci are also capable of using siderophores, or compounds that are capable of chelating iron in the environment, that are produced by other bacteria; however, gonococcal cells are incapable of synthesizing siderophores themselves. These xenosiderophores are taken up by the TDT FetA through the outer membrane and then brought into the cell by the \"fetBCDEF\" transporter system.\nAlong with the sequestration defence that can be further upregulated by host inflammation, humans also produce siderocalins that can chelate siderophores as a further method of inhibiting pathogenic bacterial growth. These are sometimes ineffective against \"N. gonorrhoeae\", which can colonize intracellularly, particularly in phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. Increases in host intracellular iron also downregulate some of the intracellular pathogen-killing mechanisms; coincidentally, pathogenic \"Neisseria\" can alter several host cell mechanisms that ultimately allow the pathogen to take most of the available iron from the host immune cell.\nSurface molecules.\nOn its surface, \"N. gonorrhoeae\" bears hair-like pili, surface proteins with various functions, and sugars called lipooligosaccharide. The pili mediate adherence, movement, and DNA exchange. The opacity-associated (Opa) proteins interact with the immune system, as do the porins. Lipooligosaccharide is an endotoxin that provokes an immune response. All of these are antigenic and exhibit antigenic variation. The pili, Opa proteins, porins, and even the lipooligosaccharide have mechanisms to inhibit the immune response, making asymptomatic infection possible.\nOpa proteins.\nPhase-variable opacity-associated (Opa) adhesin proteins are used by \"N. gonorrhoeae\" as part of evading the immune response in a host cell. At least 12 Opa proteins are known, and the many variations of surface proteins make recognizing \"N. gonorrhoeae\" and mounting a defense by immune cells more difficult. Opa proteins are in the outer membrane and facilitate a response when the bacteria interacts with a variety of host cells. These proteins bind to various epithelial cells, and allow \"N. gonorrhoeae\" to increase the length of infection as well as increase the amount of invasion into other host cells.\nType IV pili.\nDynamic polymeric protein filaments called type IV pili allow \"N. gonorrhoeae\" to do many bacterial processes, including adhesion to surfaces, transformation competence, twitching motility, and immune response evasions. To enter the host the bacteria uses the pili to adhere to and penetrate mucosal surfaces. The pili are a pivotal virulence factor for \"N. gonorrhoeae\"; without them, the bacterium is unable to promote colonization. For motility, individual bacteria use their pili in a manner that resembles a grappling hook: first, they are extended from the cell surface and attach to a substrate. Subsequent pilus retraction drags the cell forward. The resulting movement is referred to as twitching motility. \"N. gonorrhoeae\" can pull 100,000 times its own weight, and the pili used to do so are amongst the strongest biological motors known to date, exerting one nanonewton. The PilF and PilT ATPase proteins are responsible for powering the extension and retraction of the type IV pilus, respectively. The adhesive functions of the gonococcal pilus play a role in microcolony aggregation and biofilm formation. These pili are also used to avoid immune responses from the cell they are invading by having their type IV pili antigenically vary. The main pilus filament is replaced by variable DNA sequences very frequently. By doing this process rapidly, they can create a diversity of pili on their surface and evade the host cell's immune response.\nLipooligosaccharide.\nLipooligosaccharide is a low-weight version of lipopolysaccharide present on the surfaces of most other Gram-negative bacteria. It is a sugar (saccharide) side chain attached to lipid A (thus \"lipo-\") in the outer membrane coating the cell wall of the bacteria. The root \"oligo\" refers to the fact that it is a few sugars shorter than the typical lipopolysaccharide. As an endotoxin, it provokes inflammation. The shedding of lipooligosaccharide by the bacteria is sometimes responsible for issues associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Although it functions primarily as an endotoxin, lipooligosaccharide may disguise itself with host sialic acid and block initiation of the complement cascade.\nAntigenic variation.\n\"N. gonorrhoeae\" evades the immune system through a process called antigenic variation. This process allows \"N. gonorrhoeae\" to recombine its genes and alter the antigenic determinants that adorn its surface, such as the Type IV pili. Simply stated, the chemical composition of molecules are changed due to changes at the genetic level. \"N. gonorrhoeae\" is able to vary the composition of its pili and lipooligosaccharide. Of these, the pili exhibit the most antigenic variation due to chromosomal rearrangement. The \"pilS\" gene is an example of this ability to rearrange, as its combination with the \"pilE\" gene is estimated to produce over 100 variants of the PilE protein. These changes allow for adjustment to local environmental differences at the site of infection, evasion of recognition by targeted antibodies, and inhibit the formation of an effective vaccine.\nIn addition to gene rearrangement, it is also naturally competent, meaning it can acquire extracellular DNA from the environment via its type IV pilus, specifically proteins PilQ and PilT. These processes allow \"N. gonorrhoeae\" to acquire and spread new genes, disguise itself with different surface proteins, and prevent the development of immunological memory \u2013 an ability which has contributed to antibiotic resistance and impeded vaccine development.\nPhase variation.\nPhase variation is similar to antigenic variation, but instead of changes at the genetic level altering the composition of molecules, these genetic changes result in the activation or deactivation of a gene. Phase variation most often arises from a frameshift in the expressed gene. The Opa proteins of \"N. gonorrhoeae\" rely strictly on phase variation. Every time the bacteria replicate, they may switch multiple Opa proteins on or off through slipped-strand mispairing. That is, the bacteria introduce frameshift mutations that bring genes in or out of frame. The result is that different Opa genes are translated every time. Pili are varied by antigenic variation, but also phase variation. Frameshifts occur in both the \"pilE\" and \"pilC\" genes, effectively turning off the expression of pili in situations when they are not needed, such as during intracellular colonization as opposed to extracellular mucosal cell surface adhesion.\nSurvival of gonococci.\nAfter gonococci invade and transcytose the host epithelial cells, they land in the submucosa, where neutrophils promptly consume them. The pili and Opa proteins on the surface may interfere with phagocytosis, but most gonococci end up in neutrophils. The exudates from infected individuals contain many neutrophils with ingested gonococci. Neutrophils release an oxidative burst of reactive oxygen species in their phagosomes to kill the gonococci. However, a significant fraction of the gonococci can resist killing through the action of their catalase, which breaks down reactive oxygen species and can reproduce within the neutrophil phagosomes.\nThe bacterial RecA protein, which mediates repair of DNA damage, plays a crucial role in gonococcal survival. \"N. gonorrhoeae\" may replace DNA damaged in neutrophil phagosomes with DNA from neighboring gonococci. The process in which recipient gonococci integrate DNA from neighboring gonococci into their genome is called transformation.\nGenome.\nThe genomes of several strains of \"N\". \"gonorrhoeae \"have been sequenced. Most of them are about 2.1 Mb in size and encode 2,100 to 2,600 proteins (although most seem to be in the lower range). For instance, strain NCCP11945 consists of one circular chromosome (2,232,025 bp) encoding 2,662 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) and one plasmid (4,153 bp) encoding 12 predicted ORFs. The estimated coding density over the entire genome is 87%, and the average G+C content is 52.4%, values that are similar to those of strain FA1090. The NCCP11945 genome encodes 54 tRNAs and four copies of 16S-23S-5S rRNA operons.\nHorizontal gene transfer.\nHorizontal gene transfer, also termed lateral gene transfer, is the sharing of genetic information amongst living organisms. This transmission of information is a driving force of antibiotic resistance in \"N. gonorrhoeae\". Studies have identified that \"N. gonorrhoeae\" has obtained methods of antimicrobial resistance by way of horizontal gene transfer from other \"Neisseria\" species including \"N.\" \"lactamica\", \"N. macacae\", and \"N. mucosa.\" \nTransformation in \"N. gonorrhoeae\" is performed by the type IV pilus, where the DNA is bound and brought into the cell, followed by processing and homologous recombination.\nFound in some genomes of \"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\", the gonococcal genetic island (GGI), a genomic island (GI) specific to gonococci, has been identified as a mobile genetic element that is horizontally acquired. GGI is involved with antimicrobial resistance, transmission of genetic information, and iron acquisition. The genes within the gonococcal genetic island encode for the infamous type IV secretion system (T4SS), which is responsible for DNA secretion and is essential for biofilm formation.\nIn 2011, researchers at Northwestern University found evidence of a human DNA fragment in a \"N. gonorrhoeae\" genome, the first example of horizontal gene transfer from humans to a bacterial pathogen.\nDisease.\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms of infection with \"N. gonorrhoeae\" differ depending on the site of infection and many infections are asymptomatic independent of sex. Depending on the route of transmission, \"N. gonorrhoeae\" may cause infection of the throat (pharyngitis) or infection of the anus/rectum (proctitis).\nDisseminated gonococcal infections can occur when \"N. gonorrhoeae\" enters the bloodstream, often spreading to the joints and causing a rash (dermatitis-arthritis syndrome). Dermatitis-arthritis syndrome results in joint pain (arthritis), tendon inflammation (tenosynovitis), and painless non-pruritic (non-itchy) dermatitis. Disseminated infection and pelvic inflammatory disease in women tend to begin after menses due to reflux during menses, facilitating spread. In rare cases, disseminated infection may cause infection of the meninges of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or infection of the heart valves (endocarditis).\nMale.\nIn symptomatic men, the primary symptom of genitourinary infection is urethritis \u2013 burning with urination (dysuria), increased urge to urinate, and a pus-like (purulent) discharge from the penis. The discharge may be foul-smelling. If untreated, scarring of the urethra may result in difficulty urinating. Infection may spread from the urethra in the penis to nearby structures, including the testicles (epididymitis/orchitis), or to the prostate (prostatitis).\nFemale.\nIn symptomatic women, the primary symptoms of genitourinary infection are increased vaginal discharge, burning with urination (dysuria), increased urge to urinate, pain with intercourse, or menstrual abnormalities. Pelvic inflammatory disease results if \"N. gonorrhoeae\" ascends into the pelvic peritoneum (via the cervix, endometrium, and fallopian tubes). The resulting inflammation and scarring of the fallopian tubes can lead to infertility and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease develops in 10 to 20% of the females infected with \"N. gonorrhoeae\".\nNeonates (perinatal infection).\nIn perinatal infection, the primary manifestation is infection of the eye (neonatal conjunctivitis or ophthalmia neonatorum) when the newborn is exposed to \"N. gonorrhoeae\" in the birth canal. The eye infection can lead to corneal scarring or perforation, ultimately resulting in blindness. If the newborn is exposed during birth, conjunctivitis occurs within 2\u20135 days after birth and is severe. Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, once common in newborns, is prevented by the application of erythromycin (antibiotic) gel to the eyes of babies at birth as a public health measure. Silver nitrate is no longer used in the United States.\nTransmission.\n\"N. gonorrhoeae\" is most often transmitted through vaginal, oral, or anal sex; nonsexual transmission is unlikely in adult infection. It can also be transmitted to a newborn during passage through the birth canal if the mother has an untreated genitourinary infection. Given the high rate of asymptomatic infection, it is recommended that pregnant women be tested for gonococcal infection before birth. Communal baths, shared towels or fabrics, rectal thermometers, and improper hand hygiene by caregivers have been identified as potential means of transmission in pediatric settings.\nTraditionally, the bacterium was thought to move attached to spermatozoa, but this hypothesis did not explain female-to-male transmission of the disease. A recent study suggests that rather than \"surf\" on wiggling sperm, \"N. gonorrhoeae\" bacteria use pili to anchor onto proteins in the sperm and move through coital fluid.\nInfection.\nSuccessful transmission is followed by adherence to the epithelial cells found at the infected mucosal site by the bacterium's type IV pili. The pili's ability to attach and subsequently retract pulls \"N. gonorrhoeae\" towards the epithelial membrane at the surface of the mucosal cell. Post attachment, \"N. gonorrhoeae\" replicates its genome and divides to form microcolonies. Gonococcal infection is sometimes aided by the membrane cofactor protein, CD46, as it has been known to act as a receptor for gonococcal pilus. Additionally, interaction with pili has been shown to cause cytoskeletal rearrangement of the host cell, further demonstrating that gonococcal pili engagement disrupts the response of the host cell and increases the likelihood of successful infection. During growth and colonization, \"N. gonorrhoeae\" stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from host immune cells that result in the recruitment of neutrophils to the area. These phagocytic cells typically take in foreign pathogens and destroy them; however, \"N. gonorrhoeae\"'s ability to manipulate the host cell response allows the pathogen to survive within these immune cells and evade elimination.\nLaboratory diagnosis.\nThe primary detection methods for \"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\" are nucleic acid amplification tests, which are the most sensitive techniques available. Other methods of detection include microscopy and culture.\nPrevention.\nTransmission is reduced by using latex barriers (e.g., condoms or dental dams) during sex and by limiting sexual partners. Condoms and dental dams should be used during oral and anal sex as well. Spermicides, vaginal foams, and douches are not effective methods for transmission prevention.\nVaccine.\nA vaccine against \"N. gonorrhoeae\" is becoming more necessary due to the growing incidence of cases, increasing antimicrobial resistance, and its impact on reproductive health. There are problems that have hampered vaccine development including: the absence of immunity post-infection, exclusively human hosts, and antigenic and phase variation of potential vaccine targets. Currently, there are several \"N. gonorrhoeae\" vaccines in development, including an outer membrane vesicle vaccine. This includes the NGoXIM, the native OMV, and Bexsero/4CMenB vaccine candidates, which are all in the late clinical stages of development. The creation of a vaccine for \"N. gonorrhoeae\" has several potential public health impacts. In one estimate, a vaccine for the heterosexual population given before sexual activity occurs showed that the prevalence of \"N. gonorrhoeae\" could be reduced by up to 90% after 20 years. In 2023, the FDA gave fast-track designation to a gonorrhoea vaccine candidate from GSK\n. NHS England has also launched the world's first vaccination program against gonorrhea, using a vaccine against \"Neisseria meningitidis\" which was found to be partially effective against \"N. gonorrhoeae\" \nTreatment.\nCurrently, the CDC recommends a single dose of the injectable cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, as the first line of defense against gonococcal infections. Individuals weighing less than 150\u00a0kg are typically prescribed a ceftriaxone concentration of 500\u00a0mg, while individuals who weigh over 150\u00a0kg are typically prescribed a dose of 1 g. Although ceftriaxone is not the only cephalosporin that has been effective at treating gonorrhoeae, it is the most advantageous. In the event of a cephalosporin allergy, the CDC recommends a dual treatment of gentamicin and azithromycin. Each drug should be administered as a single dose, with the gentamicin entering intramuscularly at a concentration of 240\u00a0mg, along with 2 g of azithromycin taken orally. If an individual is not allergic to cephalosporins but ceftriaxone is unavailable, an alternative treatment is a single dose of 800\u00a0mg cefixime consumed orally. In all of these cases, combination therapy and co-treatment for chlamydia is recommended, as simultaneous infections are common. \nAntibiotic resistance.\nAntibiotic resistance in gonorrhea was first identified in the 1940s. Gonorrhea was treated with penicillin, but doses had to be progressively increased to remain effective. By the 1970s, penicillin-and tetracycline-resistant gonorrhea emerged in the Pacific Basin. These resistant strains then spread to Hawaii, California, the rest of the United States, Australia and Europe. Fluoroquinolones were the next line of defense, but soon resistance to this antibiotic emerged, as well. Since 2007, standard treatment has been third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, which are considered to be our \"last line of defense\". Recently, a high-level ceftriaxone-resistant strain of gonorrhea called H041 was discovered in Japan. Lab tests found it to be resistant to high concentrations of ceftriaxone, as well as most of the other antibiotics tested. Within \"N. gonorrhoeae\", genes exist that confer resistance to every single antibiotic used to cure gonorrhea, but thus far, they do not coexist within a single gonococcus. However, because of \"N. gonorrhoeae\"'s high affinity for horizontal gene transfer, antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea is seen as an emerging public health threat.\nBefore 2007, fluoroquinolones were a common treatment recommendation for gonorrhoeae. The CDC stopped suggesting these systemic bacterial agents once a resistant strain of \"N. gonorrhoeae\" emerged in the United States. The removal of fluoroquinolones as a potential treatment left cephalosporins as the only viable antimicrobial option for gonorrhea treatment. Wary of further gonococcal resistance, the CDC's recommendations shifted in 2010 to a dual therapy strategy\u2014cephalosporin with either azithromycin or doxycycline. Despite these efforts, resistant \"N. gonorrhoeae\" had been reported in five continents by 2011, further limiting treatment options and recommendations. Antimicrobial resistance is not universal and \"N. gonorrhoeae\" strains in the United States continue to respond to a combination regimen of ceftriaxone and azithromycin.\nSerum resistance.\nAs a Gram negative bacterium, \"N. gonorrhoeae\" requires defense mechanisms to protect itself against the complement system (or complement cascade), whose components are found with human serum. There are three different pathways that activate this system however, they all result in the activation of complement protein 3 (C3). A cleaved portion of this protein, C3b, is deposited on pathogenic surfaces and results in opsonization as well as the downstream activation of the membrane attack complex. \"N. gonorrhoeae\" has several mechanisms to avoid this action. As a whole, these mechanisms are referred to as serum resistance.\nHistory.\nName origin.\n\"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\" is named for Albert Neisser, who isolated it as the causative agent of the disease gonorrhea in 1878. Galen (130 AD) coined the term \"gonorrhea\" from the Greek \"gonos\" which means \"seed\" and \"rhoe\" which means \"flow\". Thus, gonorrhea means \"flow of seed\", a description referring to the white penile discharge, assumed to be semen, seen in male infection.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1878, Albert Neisser isolated and visualized \"N. gonorrhoeae\" diplococci in samples of pus from 35 men and women with the classic symptoms of genitourinary infection with gonorrhea \u2013 two of whom also had infections of the eyes. In 1882, Leistikow and Loeffler were able to grow the organism in culture. Then in 1883, Max Bockhart proved conclusively that the bacterium isolated by Albert Neisser was the causative agent of the disease known as gonorrhea by inoculating the penis of a healthy man with the bacteria. The man developed the classic symptoms of gonorrhea days after, satisfying the last of Koch's postulates. Until this point, researchers debated whether syphilis and gonorrhea were manifestations of the same disease or two distinct entities. One such 18th-century researcher, John Hunter, tried to settle the debate in 1767 by inoculating a man with pus taken from a patient with gonorrhea. He erroneously concluded that syphilis and gonorrhea were indeed the same disease when the man developed the copper-colored rash that is classic for syphilis. Although many sources repeat that Hunter inoculated himself, others have argued that it was another man. After Hunter's experiment other scientists sought to disprove his conclusions by inoculating other male physicians, medical students, and incarcerated men with gonorrheal pus, who all developed the burning and discharge of gonorrhea. One researcher, Ricord, took the initiative to perform 667 inoculations of gonorrheal pus on patients of a mental hospital, with zero cases of syphilis. Notably, the advent of penicillin in the 1940s made effective treatments for gonorrhea available.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

All have been set in India, told from the perspective of Parsis, and explore themes of family life, poverty, discrimination, and the corrupting influence of society.\nEarly life and education.\nRohinton Mistry was born in Bombay, India, to a Parsi family. His brother is the playwright and author Cyrus Mistry. He earned a BA in Mathematics and Economics from St. Xavier's College, Bombay.\nHe emigrated to Canada with his wife-to-be Freny Elavia in 1975 and they married shortly afterwards. He worked in a bank for a while, before returning to academia at the University of Toronto where he obtained a BA in English and Philosophy.\nCareer.\nWhile attending the University of Toronto (Woodsworth College) he became the first to win two Hart House literary prizes for stories published in the \"Hart House Review\", and \"Canadian Fiction Magazine\"'s annual Contributor's Prize for 1985.\nThree years later, Penguin Books Canada published his collection of 11 short stories, \"Tales from Firozsha Baag\".

They can be realized via operations from within the group itself, hence the adjective \"inner\". These inner automorphisms form a subgroup of the automorphism group, and the quotient of the automorphism group by this subgroup is defined as the outer automorphism group.\nDefinition.\nIf G is a group and g is an element of G (alternatively, if G is a ring, and g is a unit), then the function\nformula_1\nis called (right) conjugation by g (see also conjugacy class). This function is an endomorphism of G: for all formula_2\nformula_3\nwhere the second equality is given by the insertion of the identity between formula_4 and formula_5 Furthermore, it has a left and right inverse, namely formula_6 Thus, formula_7 is both an monomorphism and epimorphism, and so an isomorphism of G with itself, i.e. an automorphism. An inner automorphism is any automorphism that arises from conjugation. \nWhen discussing right conjugation, the expression formula_8 is often denoted exponentially by formula_9 This notation is used because composition of conjugations satisfies the identity: formula_10 for all formula_11 This shows that right conjugation gives a right action of G on itself.\nA common example is as follows: \nDescribe a homomorphism formula_12 for which the image, formula_13, is a normal subgroup of inner automorphisms of a group formula_14; alternatively, describe a natural homomorphism of which the kernel of formula_12 is the center of formula_14 (all formula_17 for which conjugating by them returns the trivial automorphism), in other words, formula_18. There is always a natural homomorphism formula_19, which associates to every formula_17 an (inner) automorphism formula_21 in formula_22. Put identically, formula_23.\nLet formula_24 as defined above. This requires demonstrating that (1) formula_21 is a homomorphism, (2) formula_21 is also a bijection, (3) formula_12 is a homomorphism. \nInner and outer automorphism groups.\nThe composition of two inner automorphisms is again an inner automorphism, and with this operation, the collection of all inner automorphisms of G is a group, the inner automorphism group of G denoted Inn(\"G\").\nInn(\"G\") is a normal subgroup of the full automorphism group Aut(\"G\") of G. The outer automorphism group, Out(\"G\") is the quotient group\nformula_35\nThe outer automorphism group measures, in a sense, how many automorphisms of G are not inner. Every non-inner automorphism yields a non-trivial element of Out(\"G\"), but different non-inner automorphisms may yield the same element of Out(\"G\").\nSaying that conjugation of x by a leaves x unchanged is equivalent to saying that a and x commute:\nformula_36\nTherefore the existence and number of inner automorphisms that are not the identity mapping is a kind of measure of the failure of the commutative law in the group (or ring).\nAn automorphism of a group G is inner if and only if it extends to every group containing G.\nBy associating the element \"a\" \u2208 \"G\" with the inner automorphism \"f\"(\"x\") \n \"x\"\"a\" in Inn(\"G\") as above, one obtains an isomorphism between the quotient group \"G\" / Z(\"G\") (where Z(\"G\") is the center of G) and the inner automorphism group:\nformula_37\nThis is a consequence of the first isomorphism theorem, because Z(\"G\") is precisely the set of those elements of G that give the identity mapping as corresponding inner automorphism (conjugation changes nothing).\nNon-inner automorphisms of finite p-groups.\nA result of Wolfgang Gasch\u00fctz says that if G is a finite non-abelian p-group, then G has an automorphism of p-power order which is not inner.\nIt is an open problem whether every non-abelian p-group G has an automorphism of order p. The latter question has positive answer whenever G has one of the following conditions:\nTypes of groups.\nThe inner automorphism group of a group G, Inn(\"G\"), is trivial (i.e., consists only of the identity element) if and only if G is abelian.\nThe group Inn(\"G\") is cyclic only when it is trivial.\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, the inner automorphisms may exhaust the entire automorphism group; a group whose automorphisms are all inner and whose center is trivial is called complete. This is the case for all of the symmetric groups on n elements when n is not 2 or 6. When \"n\" \n 6, the symmetric group has a unique non-trivial class of non-inner automorphisms, and when \"n\" \n 2, the symmetric group, despite having no non-inner automorphisms, is abelian, giving a non-trivial center, disqualifying it from being complete.\nIf the inner automorphism group of a perfect group G is simple, then G is called quasisimple.\nLie algebra case.\nAn automorphism of a Lie algebra \ud835\udd0a is called an inner automorphism if it is of the form Ad\"g\", where Ad is the adjoint map and g is an element of a Lie group whose Lie algebra is \ud835\udd0a. The notion of inner automorphism for Lie algebras is compatible with the notion for groups in the sense that an inner automorphism of a Lie group induces a unique inner automorphism of the corresponding Lie algebra.\nExtension.\nIf G is the group of units of a ring, A, then an inner automorphism on G can be extended to a mapping on the projective line over A by the group of units of the matrix ring, M2(\"A\"). In particular, the inner automorphisms of the classical groups can be extended in that way.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also informally known by the nickname Tiff or Tiffy, an acronym of his initials.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nOne of three sons, Findley was born in Toronto, Ontario, to Allan Gilmour Findley, a stockbroker, and his wife, the former Margaret Maude Bull. His paternal grandfather was president of Massey-Harris, the farm-machinery company. He was raised in the upper class Rosedale district of the city, attending boarding school at St. Andrew's College (although leaving during grade 10 for health reasons). He pursued a career in the arts, studying dance and acting, and had significant success as an actor before turning to writing. He was part of the original Stratford Festival company in the 1950s, acting alongside Alec Guinness, and appeared in the first production of Thornton Wilder's \"The Matchmaker\" at the Edinburgh Festival. He also played Peter Pupkin in \"Sunshine Sketches\", the CBC Television adaptation of Stephen Leacock's \"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town\".\nCareer.\nThough Findley had declared his homosexuality as a teenager, he married actress/photographer Janet Reid in 1959. The union lasted only three months and was dissolved by divorce or annulment two years later. He eventually became the domestic partner of writer Bill Whitehead, whom he met in 1962. Findley and Whitehead also collaborated on several documentary projects in the 1970s, including the television miniseries \"The National Dream\" and \"Dieppe 1942\". Whitehead and Findley won the ACTRA Award for Best Writing in a Television Documentary at the 4th ACTRA Awards in 1975 for \"The National Dream\".\nThrough Wilder, Findley became a close friend of actress Ruth Gordon, whose work as a screenwriter and playwright inspired Findley to consider writing as well. After Findley published his first short story in the \"Tamarack Review\", Gordon encouraged him to pursue writing more actively, and he eventually left acting in the 1960s.\nFindley's first two novels, \"The Last of the Crazy People\" (1967) and \"The Butterfly Plague\" (1969), were originally published in Britain and the United States after having been rejected by Canadian publishers. Findley's third novel, \"The Wars\", was published to great acclaim in 1977 and went on to win the Governor General's Award for English-language fiction. Director Robin Phillips subsequently adapted the novel into the 1983 theatrical film \"The Wars\".\nFindley received a Governor General's Award, the Canadian Authors Association Award, an ACTRA Award, the Order of Ontario, the Trillium Book Award, and in 1985 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was a founding member and chair of the Writers' Union of Canada, and a president of the Canadian chapter of PEN International.\nHis writing was typical of the Southern Ontario Gothic style \u2013 Findley, in fact, first invented its name \u2014 and was heavily influenced by Jungian psychology. Mental illness, gender and sexuality were frequent recurring themes in his work. Many of his novels centred on a protagonist who was struggling to find the moral and ethical and rational course of action in a situation that had spun wildly out of control. His characters often carried dark personal secrets, and were often conflicted \u2013 sometimes to the point of psychosis \u2014 by these burdens.\nHe publicly mentioned his homosexuality, passingly and perhaps for the first time, on a broadcast of the programme \"The Shulman File\" in the 1970s, taking host Morton Shulman completely by surprise.\nFindley and Whitehead resided at Stone Orchard, a farm near Cannington, Ontario, and in the south of France. In 1996, Findley was honoured by the French government, who declared him a Chevalier de l'Ordre des arts et des lettres.\nFindley was also the author of several dramas for television and stage. \"Elizabeth Rex\", his most successful play, premiered at the Stratford Festival to rave reviews and won a Governor General's award. His 1993 play \"The Stillborn Lover\" was adapted by Shaftesbury Films into the television film \"External Affairs\", which aired on CBC Television in 1999. \"Shadows\", first performed in 2001, was his last completed work. Findley was also an active mentor to a number of young Canadian writers, including Marnie Woodrow and Elizabeth Ruth.\nIn the final years of Findley's life, declining health led him to move his Canadian residence to Stratford, Ontario, and Stone Orchard was purchased by Canadian dancer Rex Harrington.\nIn 2002, he was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.\nDeath.\nFindley died on June 20, 2002, in Brignoles, France, not far from his house in Cotignac. \"Tiff: A Life of Timothy Findley\", a biography by Sherrill Grace, was published in 2020.\nFindley and the development of his theatrical play \"The Stillborn Lover\" were profiled by Terence Macartney-Filgate in the 1992 documentary film \"\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is best known for her 1993 novel \"The Stone Diaries\", which won the U.S. Pulitzer Prize for Fiction as well as the Governor General's Award in Canada.\nEarly life and education.\nShields was born Carol Ann Warner in Oak Park, Illinois. She studied at Hanover College, in Indiana, where she received a BA in English in 1957, and became a member of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority. A United Nations scholarship encouraged Shields to spend a junior year abroad 1955\u20131956 at the University of Exeter in England. Shields did post-graduate work at the University of Ottawa, where she received an MA in 1975.\nIn 1955, while on British Council sponsored study week in Scotland, she met a Canadian engineering student, Donald Hugh Shields. The couple married in 1957 and moved to Canada, where they had a son and four daughters. Shields later became a Canadian citizen.\nCareer.\nIn 1973, Shields became editorial assistant for the journal \"Canadian Slavonic Papers\" while living in Ottawa 1968\u20131978. Her first novel, \"Small Ceremonies\", was published in 1976, followed by \"The Box Garden\" in 1977. That year she worked as a sessional lecturer in the English Department at the University of Ottawa. She taught Creative Writing at the University of British Columbia while living in Vancouver from 1978 to 1980.\nShields' third novel, \"Happenstance\", was published in 1980; that year, she and her husband settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba, after he was hired to teach in the University of Manitoba's Faculty of Engineering. It was here that Shields wrote her better-known books.\nFrom the fall of 1982 onward, Shields taught in the English Department at the University of Manitoba, first as an Assistant Professor (1982\u20131992), then as an Associate Professor (1992\u20131995). She published the novel in 1987, and \"The Republic of Love\" in 1992. \"The Stone Diaries\" (1993) won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the 1993 Governor General's Award, the only book to have ever received both awards. It won the U.S. National Book Critics Circle Award in 1994, and was nominated in 1993 for the Booker Prize. The Stone Diaries was named one of the best books of the year by \"Publishers Weekly\". It was also chosen as a \"Notable Book\" by \"The New York Times Book Review\", which wrote \"The Stone Diaries reminds us again why literature matters.\"\nShields was made Full Professor of English in 1995, and, in 1996, she became chancellor of the University of Winnipeg.\nShields was the author of several short story collections, including \"Various Miracles\" (1985), \"The Orange Fish\" (1989), and \"Dressing Up for the Carnival\" (2000). She was the recipient of a Canada Council Major Award, two National Magazine Awards, the 1990 Marian Engel Award, the Canadian Authors Award, and a CBC short story award. She was appointed as an officer of the Order of Canada in 1998 and was elevated to companion of the Order in 2002. Shields was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and a member of the Order of Manitoba.\nCarol Shields won the 1998 Orange Prize for Fiction for her 1997 novel \"Larry's Party\". Her last novel, \"Unless\" (2002), was nominated for the 2002 Giller Prize, the Governor General of Canada Literary Award, the Booker Prize and the 2003 Orange Prize for Fiction. It was awarded the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize.\nOn retirement in 2000, Shields became Professor Emerita at the University of Manitoba. That year, after Don's retirement, the couple moved to Victoria, British Columbia.\nShields also studied the works of Jane Austen. She wrote the biography entitled \"Jane Austen\", which won the $25,000 Charles Taylor Prize for literary non-fiction in April 2002, an award accepted by her daughter Meg on her behalf in Toronto, on April 22, 2002.\nHer last novel, \"Unless\", contains a passionate defence of female writers who write of 'domestic' subjects.\nCarol Shields wrote plays including \"Departures and Arrivals\" which has been performed hundreds of times by both amateur and professional theaters. Other celebrated plays include \"Thirteen Hand\" (1993), \"Fashion, Power, Guilt, and the Charity of Families\" (co-authored with daughter Catherine Shields)(1995), and \"Unless\" (with daughter Sara Cassidy) (2005). Collections of poems by Shields were published in 1972 \"Others\", 1974 \"Intersect\", and 1992 \"Coming to Canada\".\nTwo collections of essays written by women about what they were not told became best sellers in Canada. \"Dropped Threads\" (2001) and \"Dropped Threads 2\" (2003) were edited by Shields and her friend and colleague Marjorie Anderson.\nDeath and legacy.\nShields died in 2003 of breast cancer at age 68 in Victoria.\nFollowing her death, six of her short stories were adapted by Shaftesbury Films into the dramatic anthology series \"The Shields Stories\". Her earlier short story collections were republished as \"Collected Stories of Carol Shields\" in 2005. Films based on Carol Shields's novels include \"Swann\" (1996) and \"The Republic of Love\" (2003). Her final novel, \"Unless\", was adapted as a play in 2016 by Alan Gilsenan.\nShields' eldest daughter, Anne Giardini, is also a writer. Giardini has contributed to the \"National Post\" as a columnist, and has published her first novel, \"The Sad Truth About Happiness\". Anne's second novel, \"Advice for Italian Boys\", was published in 2009. Giardini and her son, Nicholas, edited a book of Shields' thoughts and advice on writing, \"Startle and Illuminate\", published in 2016.\nShields' youngest daughter, Sara Cassidy, has published many children's books and young adult novels, including \"Slick\" (2010), \"Windfall\" (2011), A Boy Named Queen (2016), and Nevers (2019), which was nominated for the Governor General's Award for young people's literature.\nIn 2020, the Carol Shields Prize for Fiction was announced as a new literary award to honor writing by Canadian and American women and non-binary authors.\nIn 2022, Shields was posthumously inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame for her contributions as an author.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61843", "revid": "37685991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61843", "title": "Academy Award for Best Visual Effects", "text": "Academy Award given for the best achievement in visual effects\nThe Academy Award for Best Visual Effects is presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for the best achievement in visual effects. It has been handed to four members of the team directly responsible for creating the film's visual effects since 1980.\nHistory.\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences first recognized the technical contributions of special effects to movies at its inaugural dinner in 1929, presenting a plaque for \"Best Engineering Effects\" to the first Best Picture Oscar winner, the World War I flying drama \"Wings\".\nProducer David O. Selznick, then production head at RKO Studios, petitioned the Academy Board of Governors to recognize the work of animator Willis O'Brien for his groundbreaking work on 1933's \"King Kong\". However, the Academy did not have a category to acknowledge its visual achievements at the time.\nIt was not until 1938 when a film was actually recognized for its effects work, when a \"Special Achievement Award for Special Effects\" was given to the Paramount film \"Spawn of the North\". The following year, \"Best Special Effects\" became a recognized category, although on occasion the Academy has chosen to honor a single film outright rather than nominate two or more films. From 1939 to 1963, it was an award for a film's visual effects as well as audio effects, so it was often given to two persons, although some years only one or the other type of effect was recognized. For the 22nd Academy Awards, RKO was nominated for the work done on \"Mighty Joe Young\" (1949), and when they won, it was Willis H. O'Brien who went on stage to accept the statue. In 1964, it was given only for visual effects, and the following year the name of the category was changed to \"Best Special Visual Effects\".\nHonorees for this award have been bestowed several times as a Special Achievement Academy Award. In 1977, the category was given its current name \"Best Visual Effects.\" For decades, shortlisted finalists were selected by a steering committee. They are presently chosen by the visual effects branch executive committee. 1990 was the last year there were no official nominees. \"Back to the Future Part III\", \"Dick Tracy\", \"Ghost\" and \"Total Recall\" advanced to a second stage of voting, but only \"Total Recall\" received a requisite average and it was given a special achievement Oscar.\nThere have been three wholly animated films nominated in this category: \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" in 1993, \"Kubo and the Two Strings\" in 2016, and \"The Lion King\" in 2019. There have been three semi-animated films nominated, which also won: \"Mary Poppins\" in 1964, \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" in 1971, and \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" in 1988. In 2024, \"Godzilla Minus One\" became the first non-English-language film ever to win in the category.\nRules.\nIn 1979, there were five films nominated. For most of the next three decades, there were three nominees a year, although at some times there were two and at others, a single film was given the award outright.\nIn 2007, it was decided that a list of no more than 15 eligible films would be chosen, from which a maximum of seven would be shortlisted for further consideration. A vote would then proceed, with a maximum of three nominees. Since 2010, there are ten shortlisted finalists which, using a form of range voting, produce five nominees. No more than four people may be nominated for a single film.\nAccording to the official Academy Award https://, the criteria are:\n(a) consideration of the contribution the visual effects make to the overall production and\n(b) the artistry, skill and fidelity with which the visual illusions are achieved.\nFilmmakers.\nA number of filmmakers have had their movies honored for their achievements in visual effects; i.e., six by director James Cameron (who began his career in Hollywood as an effects technician), five films produced by George Pal, five by director/producer George Lucas, four by directors Richard Fleischer, Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, three by directors Robert Zemeckis, Christopher Nolan, and Denis Villeneuve, and two by directors Clarence Brown, Cecil B. DeMille, Mark Robson, Ridley Scott, Robert Stevenson.\nOnly two directors have won in the same category: Four time Best Director nominee Stanley Kubrick's only Oscar win for 1968's \"\", and Japanese filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki's first Oscar win for 2023's \"Godzilla Minus One\". The credits for \"2001\" list four effects contributors, including Douglas Trumbull. However, according to the rules of the Academy in effect at the time, only three persons could be nominated for their work on a single film, which would have resulted in the omission of either Trumbull, Tom Howard, Con Pederson or Wally Veevers. Ultimately, it was Kubrick's name that was submitted as a nominee in this category, resulting in his winning the award, which many consider a slight to the four men whose work contributed to the film's success.\nEngineering Effects Award.\nThe table below display the Oscar nominees for Best Engineering Effects.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0indicates competitive winner\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0indicates non-competitive winner\nSpecial Effects Awards.\nThe tables below display the Oscar nominees for Best Special Effects including the recipients of the Special Achievement Awards.\nVisual Effects Awards.\nThe tables below display the Oscar nominees for Best Visual Effects including the recipients of the Special Achievement Awards.\nShortlisted finalists.\nFinalists for Best Visual Effects are selected by the Visual Effects Branch Executive Committee. Beginning with a long list of up to 20 titles, the committee then advances ten films to the shortlist. Prior to the 83rd Academy Awards, only fifteen films were long-listed, and only seven films were shortlisted. The full membership of the Visual Effects Branch is invited to view excerpts and is provided with supporting information at a \"bake-off\" where balloting determines the five nominees.

All sequels are also considered adaptations by this standard, being based on the story and characters of the original film.\nPrior to its current name, the award was known as the Academy Award for Best Screenplay Based On Material From Another Medium. The Best Adapted Screenplay category has been a part of the Academy Awards since their inception.\nSuperlatives.\nThe first person to win twice in this category was Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who won the award in two consecutive years, 1949 and 1950. Others to win twice in this category include George Seaton, Robert Bolt (who also won in consecutive years), Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo, Alvin Sargent, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Michael Wilson, Alexander Payne and Christopher Hampton. Payne won both awards as part of a writing team, with Jim Taylor for \"Sideways\" and Jim Rash and Nat Faxon for \"The Descendants\". Michael Wilson was blacklisted at the time of his second Oscar, so the award was given to a front (novelist Pierre Boulle). However, the Academy officially recognized him as the winner several years later.\nBilly Wilder, Charles Brackett, Paddy Chayefsky, Francis Ford Coppola, Horton Foote, William Goldman, Robert Benton, Bo Goldman, Waldo Salt, and the Coen brothers have won Oscars for both original and adapted screenplays.\nFrances Marion (\"The Big House\") was the first woman to win in any screenplay category, although she won for her original script for Best Writing, which then included both original and adapted screenplays before a separate award for Best Original Screenplay was introduced. Sarah Y. Mason (\"Little Women\") was the first woman to win for adaptation from previously established material; she shared the award with her husband, Victor Heerman. They are also the first of two married couples to win in this category;\u00a0Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh (\"\") are the others.\nPierre Collings and Sheridan Gibney (\"The Story of Louis Pasteur\") were the first to win for adapting their own work.\nPhilip G.

{"id": "61849", "revid": "12845131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61849", "title": "Dorking", "text": "Market town in Surrey, England\nDorking () is a market town in Surrey in South East England about south-west of London. It is in Mole Valley District and the council headquarters are to the east of the centre. The High Street runs roughly east\u2013west, parallel to the Pipp Brook and along the northern face of an outcrop of Lower Greensand. The town is surrounded on three sides by the Surrey Hills National Landscape and is close to Box Hill and Leith Hill.\nThe earliest archaeological evidence of human activity is from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods, and there are several Bronze Age bowl barrows in the local area. The town may have been the site of a staging post on Stane Street during Roman times, however the name 'Dorking' suggests an Anglo-Saxon origin for the modern settlement. A market is thought to have been held at least weekly since early medieval times and was highly regarded for the poultry traded there. The Dorking breed of domestic chicken is named after the town.\nThe local economy thrived during Tudor times, but declined in the 17th century due to poor infrastructure and competition from neighbouring towns. During the early modern period many inhabitants were nonconformists, including the author, Daniel Defoe, who lived in Dorking as a child. Six of the \"Mayflower\" Pilgrims, including William Mullins and his daughter Priscilla, lived in the town before setting sail for the New World.\nDorking started to expand during the 18th and 19th centuries as transport links improved and farmland to the south of the centre was released for housebuilding. The new turnpike, and later the railways, facilitated the sale of lime produced in the town, but also attracted wealthier residents, who had had no previous connection to the area. Residential expansion continued in the first half of the 20th century, as the Deepdene and Denbies estates began to be broken up. Further development is now constrained by the Metropolitan Green Belt, which encircles the town.\nToponymy.\nThe origins and meaning of the name Dorking are uncertain. Early spellings include \"Dorchinges\" (1086), \"Doreking\" (1138\u201347), \"Dorkinges\" (1180), and \"Dorkingg\" (1219). Both principal elements in the name are disputed. The first element may be from a personal name, \"Deorc\", or some variant, of either Brittonic or Old English origin. Alternatively it may derive from the Brittonic words \"Dorce\", a river name meaning \"clear, bright stream\", or \"duro\", meaning a \"fort\", \"walled town\" or \"gated place\". The second element, if originally plural (\u2011\"ingas\"), might mean \"(settlement belonging to the) followers of ...\", but if singular (\u2011\"ing\") might mean \"place\", \"stream\", \"wood\" or \"clump\".\nGeography.\nLocation and topography.\nDorking is in central Surrey, about south of London and east of Guildford. It is close to the intersection of two valleys \u2013 the north-south Mole Gap (where the River Mole cuts through the North Downs) and the west\u2013east Vale of Holmesdale (a narrow strip of low-lying land between the North Downs and the Greensand Ridge). The highest point in the town is the Glory Wood, south east of the centre, where the summit () is marked by a Bronze Age bowl barrow.\nThe basic plan of the town centre has not changed since medieval times (and may be Anglo-Saxon in origin). The main streets (the High Street, West Street and South Street) meet at Pump Corner, forming a \"\u00a0Y\u00a0\" shape. Together, West Street and the High Street run approximately west\u2013east, paralleling the Pipp Brook, a tributary of the Mole, which runs to the north of the centre.\nThe town is surrounded by the Metropolitan Green Belt (which also covers the Glory Wood) and is bordered on three sides by the Surrey Hills National Landscape. Several Sites of Special Scientific Interest are close by, including the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment, immediately to the north. The National Trust owns several properties in the area, including Box Hill, Leith Hill Tower and Polesden Lacey.\nGeology.\nThe rock strata on which Dorking sits, belong primarily to the Lower Greensand Group. This group is multilayered and includes the sandy Hythe Beds, the clayey Sandgate Beds and the quartz-rich Folkestone Beds. The lower greensand was deposited in the early Cretaceous, most likely in a shallow sea with low oxygen levels. Over the subsequent 50 million years, other strata were deposited on top of the Lower Greensand, including Gault clay, Upper Greensand and the chalk of the North and South Downs.\nFollowing the Cretaceous, the sea covering the south of England began to retreat and the land was pushed higher. The Weald (the area covering modern-day south Surrey, south Kent, north Sussex and east Hampshire) was lifted by the same geological processes that created the Alps, resulting in an anticline which stretched across the English Channel to the Artois region of northern France. Initially an island, this dome-like structure was drained by the ancestors of the rivers which today cut through the North and South Downs, including the Mole. The dome was eroded away over the course of the Cenozoic, exposing the strata beneath and resulting in the escarpments of the Downs and the Greensand Ridge.\nIn Dorking, the dividing line between the Lower Greensand and Gault clay is marked by the course of the Pipp Brook. In the south of the town, the Hythe Beds take the form of iron-rich, soft, fine-grained sandstone, whereas the Sandgate Beds have a more loamy composition. The quartz-rich Folkestone Beds have a lower iron content, and contain veins of silver sand and rose-coloured ferruginous sand. Running along the north bank of the Pipp Brook (with a width of around ) is the outcrop of Gault, a blue-black shaly clay, beyond which is a narrow band of Upper Greensand, a hard, grey mica-rich sandstone. In the extreme north west of the town, the marly Lower Chalk was quarried for lime production until the early 20th century.\nAmmonite fossils are found in the north of the town, including \"Stoliczkia\", \"Callihoplites\", \"Acanthoceras\" and \"Euomphaloceras\" species in the Lower Chalk and \"Puzosia\" species in the Upper Greensand. Foraminifera fossils have been found in the Hythe Beds adjacent to the Horsham road, to the west of Tower Hill.\nHistory and development.\nPre-history.\nThe earliest evidence of human activity in Dorking comes from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods and includes flint tools and flakes found during construction development in South Street. During the rebuilding of the Waitrose supermarket in South Street in 2013, charred hazelnut shells, radiocarbon dated to between 8625 and 8465 BCE, were discovered. A ring ditch containing two ceramic urns, was also found. Other ditches identified during the same excavation may indicate the presence of a Bronze Age field system, although the date of these later earthworks is less certain. Bowl barrows from the same period have been found at the Glory Wood (to the south of the town centre), on Milton Heath (to the west) and on Box Hill (to the northeast).\nRoman and Saxon.\nThere is thought to have been a settlement at Dorking in Roman times, although its size and extent are unclear. Coins from the reigns of Hadrian (117\u2013138 AD), Commodus (180\u2013192) and Claudius Gothicus (214\u2013270), as well as tiles and pottery fragments, have been found in the town. Stane Street, the Roman road linking London to Chichester, was constructed during the first century AD and is thought to have run through Dorking. The exact course through the town is not known and no definitive archaeological evidence has been discovered for the route in the gap between the crossing of the River Mole at the Burford Bridge and North Holmwood. A posting station is thought to have been located in the area and sites have been proposed in the town centre, at Pixham and at the Burford Bridge, where the road crossed the River Mole.\nAlthough the name Dorking implies a settlement that was well established by the time of the Norman Conquest, archaeological evidence of Saxon activity in the town centre is limited to pottery sherds. Probable Saxon cemeteries have been found close to Yew Tree Road (to the north of the centre) and at Vincent Lane (to the west). In 1817, the so-called \"Dorking Hoard\" of around 700 silver pennies, dating from the mid-8th to the late-9th centuries, was found near the source of the Pipp Brook on the northern slopes of Leith Hill. In the late Saxon period, the manor and parish were administered as part of the Wotton Hundred and may have been part of a large royal estate centred on Leatherhead.\nGovernance.\nDorking appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as the Manor of \"Dorchinges\". It was held by William the Conqueror, who had assumed the lordship in 1075 on the death of Edith of Wessex, widow of Edward the Confessor. The settlement included one church, three mills worth 15s 4d, 16 ploughs, woodland and herbage for 88 hogs and of meadow. It rendered \u00a318 per year in 1086. The residents included 38 villagers, 14 smallholders and 4 villeins, which placed it in the top 20% of settlements in England by population.\nIn around 1087, William II granted the manor of Dorking to Willam de Warenne, the first Earl of Surrey, whose descendants have held the lordship almost continuously until the present day. By the early 14th century, the manor had been divided for administrative purposes into four tithings: Eastburgh and Chippingburgh (corresponding respectively to the eastern and western halves of the modern town); Foreignburgh (the area covered by the Holmwoods) and Waldburgh (which would later be renamed Capel). On the death of the seventh Earl, John de Warenne, in 1347, the manor passed to his brother-in-law, Richard Fitzalan, the third Earl of Arundel. In 1580 both Earldoms passed through the female line to Phillip Howard, whose father, Thomas Howard, had forfeited the title of Duke of Norfolk and had been executed for his involvement in the Ridolfi plot to assassinate Elizabeth I. The dukedom was restored to the family in 1660, following the accession of Charles II.\nAs the status of the de Warennes and their descendants increased, they became less interested in the town. In the 14th and 15th centuries, prominent local families (including the Sondes and the Goodwyns) were able to buy the leases on some of the lordship lands. One such area was the Deepdene, first mentioned in a court roll of 1399. This woodland was held by several tenants, before being inherited in 1652 by Charles Howard, the fourth son of the 15th Earl of Arundel, in whose family it remained until 1790. The estate was expanded by successive owners, including the Anglo-Dutch banker Thomas Hope and his eldest son Henry Thomas Hope, who commissioned William Atkinson to remodel the main house as a \"sumptuous High Renaissance palazzo\".\nUnlike the neighbouring towns of Guildford and Reigate, Dorking was never granted a Borough Charter and remained under the control of the Lord of the Manor throughout the Middle Ages. Reforms during the Tudor period reduced the importance of manorial courts and the day-to-day administration of towns such as Dorking became the responsibility of the vestry of the parish church. There was little change in local government structure over the subsequent three centuries, until the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 transferred responsibility for poor relief to the Poor Law Commission, whose local powers were delegated to the newly formed poor law union in 1836. In 1841, the Dorking Union constructed a new workhouse, south of the town centre, designed by William Shearburn. The entrance block still stands and is now part of Dorking Hospital.\nA local board of health (LBH) was established in Dorking in 1881 to administer infrastructure including roads, street lighting and drainage. The LBH organised the first regular domestic refuse collection and, by mid-1888, had created a new sewerage system (including a treatment works at Pixham). The Local Government Act 1888 transferred many administrative responsibilities to the newly formed Surrey County Council and was followed by an 1894 Act that created the Dorking Urban District Council (UDC). Initially the offices of the UDC were in South Street, but in 1931 the Council moved to Pippbrook House, a Gothic Revival country house to the north east of the town centre, designed as a private residence by George Gilbert Scott in 1856.\nThe Local Government Act 1972 created Mole Valley District Council (MVDC), by combining the UDCs of Dorking and Leatherhead with the majority of the Dorking and Horley Rural District. In 1984, the new council moved into purpose-built offices, designed by Michael Innes, at the east end of the town.\nTransport and communications.\npx;\"&gt;\npx; overflow:hidden; position:relative; background-color:white;\"&gt;\npx; top:-3045 px; width:3300 px; position:absolute;\"&gt; \nExtract from \"Twenty Four Miles Round London\" (1820) by William Mogg showing the turnpike road running through Dorking\nFollowing the end of Roman rule in Britain, there appears to have been no systematic planning of transport infrastructure in the local area for over a millennium. During Saxon times, the section of Stane Street between Dorking and Ockley was bypassed by the longer route via Coldharbour and the upper surface of the Roman road was most likely quarried to provide stone for local building projects. Two routes linked the town to London, the first via the Mole crossing at Burford Bridge to Leatherhead and the second, the \"Winter Road\", climbed the south-facing scarp slope of Box Hill from Boxhurst and ran northeastwards to meet the London-Brighton road at Tadworth.\nThe development of Guildford ( to the west) was stimulated by the construction of the Wey Navigation in the 1650s. In contrast, although several schemes were proposed to make the Mole navigable, none were enacted and transport links to Dorking remained poor. As a result, the local economy began to suffer and the town declined through the late 17th and early 18th centuries.\nThe turnpike road through Dorking was authorised by the Sussex and Surrey Roads Act 1755 (28 Geo. 2 c. 45). The new turnpike dramatically improved the accessibility of the town from the capital and a report from 1765 noted both that the Thursday grain market had increased in size and that the local flour mills were significantly busier. A mail coach operated return journeys between Dorking and London six days per week and several stagecoaches used the route daily until the mid-19th century. In contrast, the east\u2013west Reigate\u2013Guildford road remained the responsibility of the parishes through which it ran and only minimal improvements were made before the start of the 20th century.\nThe first railway line to reach Dorking was the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway (RG&amp;RR), authorised by Acts of Parliament in 1846, 1847 and 1849. Dorking station (now Dorking West) was opened in 1849 northwest of the town, initially as a temporary terminus for trains from Reigate. Local residents had expressed a preference for the station to be sited closer to the town centre at Meadowbank, but since the line passed through a deep cutting at this point it was deemed impractical to provide the necessary freight facilities at this location. Two years later a second station, now known as Dorking Deepdene, was opened on the same line.\nThe second railway line to serve the town was authorised by Acts of Parliament in 1862 and 1864 and was opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1867. A west-south connecting spur to the RG&amp;RR was provided on opening, but was removed around 1900, before being briefly restored between 1941 and 1946 as a wartime resilience measure.\nDorking station was provided with extensive goods facilities, a locomotive yard and a turntable (later the site of the car park). It was built with two platforms, but a third was added in 1925, when the railway line was electrified from Leatherhead. The original building was demolished in 1980 and was replaced by a larger structure, designed by Gordon Lavington, which integrated the station with offices for Biwater.\nIn the late 1920s, improvements were made to the Dorking-Reigate road (now the A25), including the construction of Deepdene Bridge over the River Mole. The bypass road (now the A24) was opened in 1934 following considerable local opposition to the route, which cut through the Deepdene estate.\nCommerce and industry.\nA market at Dorking is first recorded in 1240 and in 1278, the sixth Earl of Surrey, John de Warenne, claimed that it had been held twice weekly since \"time out of mind\". The early medieval market was probably centred around Pump Corner and between South Street and West Street, but it appears to have moved east to the widest part of the High Street by the early 15th century.\nIn the century following the Norman conquest, agricultural activity was focused on the lordship lands, which lay to the north of the Pipp Brook. However, as the Middle Ages progressed, woodland to the south and west of the centre was cleared enabling farms owned by the Goodwyns, Stubbs and Sondes families to expand. By the start of the Tudor period, there were at least five watermills in Dorking \u2013 two at Pixham (one on the Pipp Brook, owned by the Sondes and one on the Mole, owned by the Brownes), two close to the town centre (both owned by the manor) and one at Milton, on the road to Westcott. There may also have been a windmill on Tower Hill.\nThe town flourished in Tudor times and, in the 1590s, a market house was built between what is now St Martin's Walk and the White Horse Hotel. The antiquarian John Aubrey, who visited the town between 1673 and 1692, noted that the weekly market (which took place on Thursdays) was \"the greatest... for poultry in England\" and noted that \"Sussex wheat\" was also sold. The free-draining Lower Greensand found in the Dorking area is particularly suited for rearing chickens and the local soils provide grit to assist the birds' digestive systems. The Dorking fowl, which has five claws instead of the normal four, is named after the town. \nWine made from the wild cherries that grew in the town was another local speciality. A 'cherry fair' was held in July in the 17th and 18th centuries, and was revived in the 20th century at St Barnabas Church, Ranmore. Aubrey also recorded that an annual fair took place on Ascension Day.\nChalk and sand were quarried in Dorking until the early 20th century. Chalk was dug from a pit on Ranmore Road and heated in kilns to produce quicklime. In the medieval and early modern periods, the lime was used to fertilise local farm fields, but from the 18th century onwards (and especially after the construction of the turnpike to Epsom in 1755), it was transported to London for use in the construction industry. Sand from the Folkestone Beds was quarried from several sites in the town, including at two pits in Vincent Lane.\nCaves and tunnels were also dug in the sandstone under several parts of the town. Many were used as cellars for storing wine bottles, but deeper workings followed seams of silver sand, which was used in glass making. Most of the surviving caves are privately owned and not accessible to the public. A well-known example is the cockpit beneath the former Wheatsheaf Inn in the High Street, in which fighting cocks were set against each other for sport. During the construction of the car park to the south of Sainsbury's supermarket, the builders broke through into a large cavern of unknown date, the walls of which were painted with \"trompe-l'\u0153il\" pillars. Unfortunately, in order to complete the car park, it was necessary to fill in the cave with concrete. Guided tours of the caves in South Street are held on a regular basis and are organised by Dorking Museum.\nBy the start of the 19th century, increasing mechanisation of agriculture was leading to a local surplus of labour. The wages for unskilled farm workers were decreasing, exacerbated by a fall in produce prices following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Like many towns in the south of England, Dorking was affected by civil unrest among its poorest residents. In November 1830 a riot broke out and a mob of 80 attacked the Red Lion Inn in the High Street. A troop of soldiers from the Life Guards regiment was called in to restore order. In 1831 it was noted that the town (population 4711) had one of the highest rates of poor relief in Surrey.\nIn early 1832, the vestry devised a supported scheme to enable young unemployed, unskilled labourers to leave the town to settle in Upper Canada. The cost of the voyage from Portsmouth to Montreal for 61 recipients of poor relief was paid by private donations, however the emigrants also received an allowance for food and clothing from parish funds. Although many were young, single men aged 14\u201320, a few families also joined the group. Most appear to have settled in the Toronto area, but a few are recorded as living in Kingston, Ontario.\nIn 1911, the town was described in the Victoria County History as \"almost entirely residential and agricultural, with some lime works on the chalk, though not so extensive as those in neighbouring parishes, a little brick-making, watermills (corn) at Pixham Mill, and timber and saw-mills.\"\nResidential development.\npx;\"&gt;\npx; overflow:hidden; position:relative; background-color:white;\"&gt;\npx; top:-2075 px; width:5500 px; position:absolute;\"&gt; \nDorking in 1816\nAlthough the turnpike road through Dorking had been constructed in the 1750s, the built-up part of the town had changed little by the start of the 19th century. Most of the local professional class and wealthier tradesmen lived along the three main streets (the High Street, West Street and South Street), whilst the often crowded houses of artisans and labourers tended to be in the narrower lanes and alleys. Poor sanitation was still a major problem for the poorer residents and, in 1832, a cholera outbreak was recorded in Ebenezer Place (north of the High Street), where 46 people were crammed into nine cottages.\nNevertheless, Dorking was beginning to attract more affluent residents, many of whom had accumulated their wealth as businessmen in London. Charles Barclay (a Southwark brewery owner) and the bankers Joseph Denison and Thomas Hope (none of whom had any previous connection with the area) purchased the estates at Bury Hill, Denbies and Deepdene respectively. Higher-status individuals living closer to the town centre included William Crawford, the City of London MP, and Jane Leslie, the Dowager Countess of Rothes. Although the incoming landowners played little part in local commerce, they appear to have been the driving force behind schemes to pave streets and to provide gas lighting (both paid for by public subscription).\nRose Hill, the first planned residential estate in Dorking, was developed by William Newland, a wealthy Guildford surgeon, who also had interests in the Wey and Arun Canal. Newland purchased the \"Great House\" on Butter Hill and the surrounding of land in 1831, which he divided into plots for 24 houses, arranged around a central paddock, known as \"The Oval\". The Great House was divided into two separate dwellings (Butter Hill House and Rose Hill House), adjacent to which a mock-Tudor arch was erected over the main carriageway entrance from South Street. Initially sales were slow, but the proposals for the building of the railway line from Redhill stimulated interest in the development in the late 1840s. Although most of the purchasers were private individuals (the majority of whom had been born outside of the local area), the Dorking Society of Friends bought one of the plots in 1845 for the construction of a meeting house. By 1861 the estate was complete.\nThe arrival of the railway in 1849 catalysed the expansion of the town to the south and west. Between 1850 and 1870, the National Freehold Land Society was responsible for housing developments in Arundel and Howard Roads, as well as around Tower Hill. Poorer quality houses were built along Falkland and Hampstead Roads (many of which were replaced in the 1960s and 1970s). Holloway Farm was sold in 1870 and the first houses in Knoll, Roman and Ridgeway Roads were constructed before 1880. Houses in Cliftonville (named after its promoter, Joseph Clift, a local chemist) were also built around the same time. To the north of the High Street, smaller semi-detached and terraced houses were constructed in the 1890s for artisans in Rothes Road, Ansell Road, Wathen Road, Hart Road and Jubilee Terrace.\nNo significant residential expansion took place in Dorking in the first two decades of the 20th century. In the 1920s and 1930s, the breakup of the Deepdene and Pippbrook estates (and the electrification of the railway line from Leatherhead) stimulated housebuilding to the north and east of the town, including Deepdene Vale and Deepdene Park. The sale of part of Bradley Farm (part of the Denbies estate) in the 1930s, enabled the building of Ashcombe, Keppel and Calvert Roads. The Dorking UDC intended to build housing on the rest of the farm (now Denbies Wine Estate), however their plans were interrupted by the outbreak of war and were ultimately prevented by the creation of the Metropolitan Green Belt.\nThe first council housing was built in Dorking by the UDC in Nower Road in 1920 and similar developments took place in Marlborough and Beresford Roads later the same decade. In 1936, the council obtained a Slum Clearance Order to demolish 81 properties in Church Street, North Street, Cotmandene and the surrounding areas. In total 217 residents were displaced, many of whom were rehoused by the UDC in the Fraser Gardens estate, designed by the architect George Grey Wornum. The Chart Downs estate to the southeast of the town was built between 1948 and 1952.\nControversially, in the late 1950s and 1960s, Dorking UDC constructed the Goodwyns estate on land compulsorily purchased from Howard Martineau, a major local benefactor to the town. The initial designs were by Clifford Culpin and the project was subsequently developed by William Ryder, who was responsible for the erection of the Wenlock Edge and Linden Lea tower blocks. Both the design of the buildings and the layout of the estate were praised in the early 1970s by architectural historians Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner.\nReligion.\nThe first mention of a church at Dorking occurs in Domesday Book of 1086. In around 1140, Isabel de Warenne, the widow of the second Earl of Surrey, granted the church and a tithe of the rents from the manor to Lewes Priory in Sussex. In the 1190s, the tithe was converted to a pension of \u00a36, which was paid annually to the Priory until at least 1291. The Priory also acquired the right to appoint the town's priest.\nIt is unclear where in the town the Domesday church was located. It appears to have been replaced at some point during the 12th century (possibly by Isabel de Warenne) by a large cruciform building with a central tower. A rededication from St Mary to St Martin may have taken place around the same time. In 1334 the church was granted to the Priory of the Holy Cross in Reigate. In the late 14th century a clerestory and two side aisles were added to the nave.\nThe so-called Intermediate Church was constructed in 1835\u20131837. It had a square tower, topped with an octagonal spire, and could seat around 1800 worshippers. Its floor level was approximately higher than that of the church it replaced, allowing the base of the medieval nave to become a crypt. In 1868\u20131877, the Intermediate Church was rebuilt into the present St Martin's Church, designed in the Decorated Gothic style by the architect Henry Woodyer. The spire of the current church was dedicated as a memorial to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce (who had died in 1873) and in 1905\u20131911 the Lady chapel was added.\nIn order to accommodate the growing population in the south of the town, a second Anglican church, St Paul's, was opened in 1857 on land donated by Henry Thomas Hope. Designed by the architect, Benjamin Ferrey, it was built of Bath stone in the Decorated Geometric style. A daughter church to St Martin's, designed by Edwin Lutyens and dedicated to St Mary, was opened at Pixham in 1903.\nIn the two centuries following the passing of the 1558 Act of Uniformity, many inhabitants of Dorking embraced more extreme forms of protestantism and by 1676, the parish (which had a total population of around 1500) contained 200 nonconformists. In 1620, six residents, including Williams Mullins (a cobbler) and his daughter Priscilla, joined the \"Mayflower\" to establish a Separatist colony in the New World. During the Civil War, the townsfolk supported the Parliamentarians, but although some of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers were billeted in Dorking, no fighting took place nearby.\nChristopher Feake, the Fifth Monarchist and independent minister, lived in the town (allegedly under a false identity) following The Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. He may have incited some of the more radical residents to violence. Daniel Defoe, the author of \"Robinson Crusoe\" and a committed Presbyterian throughout his life, was educated in Dorking for five years, c.\u20091669\u201374. He attended a school in Pixham Lane run by Revd James Fisher a non-conformist who had been ejected as Rector of Fetcham. In 1662 Fisher was involved in establishing Dorking Congregational Church, which by the 1690s was meeting in a barn on Butter Hill in South Street. The present United Reformed Church in West Street, designed by the architect William Hopperton, was built for the group by William Shearburn in 1834.\nJohn Wesley visited Dorking a total of nineteen times between 1764 and 1789. He opened a Methodist chapel in the town in 1777. A new church with a spire was built in South Street in 1900, however this building was sold and demolished in 1974. Since 1973, Dorking Methodists have held services at St Martin's.\nAlthough England had become a predominantly Protestant country during the Reformation, the families of the Earls of Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk remained Catholic. The first Catholic church in Dorking was built in the early 1870s on land owned by the fifteenth Duke of Norfolk, Henry Fitzalan-Howard and was rebuilt into the present St Joseph's Church in the mid-1890s, by the architect Frederick Walters.\nA mosque was established in Hart Road in 2006. From 1984 the building had been used as a meeting room for the Plymouth Brethren and was a synagogue for a time, before being acquired by the Dorking Muslim Community Association.\nDorking in the World Wars.\nIn late 1914, Dorking became a garrison town. Empty houses were requisitioned and from January 1915 around 4000 troops were accommodated including those from the London Scottish regiment, the Civil Service Rifles and the Queen's Westminster Rifles. Training took place in the fields to the west and north west of the town. Many local residents were recruited to the Surrey Yeomanry, which (until mid-1915) was stationed at Deepdene House and at the Public Hall in West Street. Although he was aged over 40 at the start of the war, the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps, one unit of which was based in the town.\nOf the many soldiers from Dorking who died during World War I, the youngest was Valentine Strudwick. He was born in Falkland Road on 14 February 1900 and was educated at St Paul's School. He enlisted in 1915 after concealing his true age and joined the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own). A year later, in January 1916 at the age of 15 years 11 months, he was killed in action at Boezinge, near Ypres. He is buried at Essex Farm Cemetery in Belgium.\nEmpty houses in the town also provided billets for soldiers during World War II and over 3000 school children were evacuated to the Dorking area in September 1939. A local refugee committee (led by Vaughan Williams and the novelist E. M. Forster) was established to find accommodation for refugees fleeing Nazi persecution and also to support long-resident German and Czech nationals in applications to Home Office tribunals to remain at liberty in the UK.\nAt the start of the war, the fortified GHQ Line B was constructed directly to the north of Dorking. This defensive line ran along the North Downs from Farnham via Guildford, before following the River Mole to Horley. The banks of the Mole were fortified with anti-tank obstacles, pillboxes and gun emplacements and an anti-tank ditch was dug from west to east across Bradley Farm (now Denbies Wine Estate). The town itself was a Class \"A\" nodal point and from August 1940 the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade (part of the VII Corps) was assigned to its defence. Pippbrook House (the then offices of the Dorking UDC) became a mobilisation centre and housed an ARP post as well as the local branch of the Women's Voluntary Service.\nOver the course of the war, 77 high-explosive bombs and 60 incendiaries were dropped by the \"Luftwaffe\", however only one incident (in October 1940) resulted in fatalities in the town.\nAfter the war, at least two Covenanter tanks were buried at Bradley Farm. The first was excavated and restored in 1977 and is now on display at The Tank Museum at Bovington in Dorset. A second was excavated in 2017 for the archaeology programme \"WW2 Treasure Hunters\", presented by the musician Suggs on the TV channel HISTORY. The tank was displayed at the vineyard for six months, before being removed for restoration.\nNational and local government.\nUK parliament.\nAs of 2024, Dorking is in the Dorking and Horley parliamentary constituency.\nCounty council.\nCouncillors are elected to Surrey County Council every four years. The town is divided between two main wards. The villages to the south east of Dorking are in a third ward:\nDistrict council.\nFive councillors represent the town on Mole Valley District Council (the headquarters of which are in Dorking):\nTown council.\nDorking does not have a Town Council, however stakeholder engagement in local decision making is conducted through a number of bodies, including the Dorking Town Forum.\nTwin towns.\nDorking is twinned with Gouvieux (Oise, France), G\u00fcglingen (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) and Sinalunga (Tuscany, Italy).\nDemography and housing.\nIn the 2011 Census, the combined population of the Dorking North and South wards was 11,158. The larger \"built-up area\" (which includes the Goodwyns estate, North Holmwood, Pixham and Westhumble, in addition to the two town wards) had a population of 17,741.\nDorking North ward excludes Pixham and Westhumble. Dorking South ward excludes North Holmwood and the Goodwyns estate.\nPublic services.\nUtilities.\nUntil the early 18th century, local residents obtained drinking water either directly from the Pipp Brook or from wells. In 1735, a pump was installed to lift water from a spring on the site of Archway Place, which was then distributed via wooden pipes made from bored tree trunks. Local dissatisfaction over the charges levied for the supply prompted the vestry to reopen a well in the town centre and to install a hand pump there in 1780. The Archway Place spring became polluted by sewage in the middle of the 19th century and the works closed.\nThe Dorking Water Company (DWC) was formally established in 1869, following the passing of the Dorking Water Act 1869. The company dug a well on Harrow Road East from where water was transferred by a steam-driven pump to a reservoir on Tower Hill. In 1902, a new pumping station was built on Station Road and, in 1919, the old one was converted to housing. The second pumphouse was replaced by a new works with boreholes on Beech Close in 1939. The DWC was absorbed by East Surrey Water in 1959.\nThe Local Board of Health created the first sewerage system in Dorking and opened the treatment works at Pixham on the River Mole in 1888. Four years later, some 1360 houses (around 92% of the town) had been connected, necessitating an extensive rebuilding of the works in 1893. The sewerage system became the responsibility of the Thames Water Authority under the Water Act 1989.\nThe town gasworks were built in 1834 by the Dorking Gas Light Company to supply gas for street lighting. From 1849, the coal required was delivered by train to Dorking West station and then transferred to the works by horse-drawn vehicle. The company was merged with that of Redhill in 1928 and became part of the East Surrey Gas Company when the industry was nationalised in 1948. After gas production ceased in 1956, the site of the works became part of the Dorking Business Park on Station Road.\nAn electricity generating station was opened in 1903 in Station Road, close to the town gasworks. Initially it was capable of generating 180\u00a0kW of power, but by the time of its closure in 1939, its installed capacity was 1\u00a0MW. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, Dorking was connected to the National Grid, initially to a 33\u00a0kV supply ring, which linked the town to Croydon, Epsom, Leatherhead and Reigate. In 1939, the ring was connected to the Wimbledon-Woking main via a 132\u00a0kV substation at Leatherhead.\nEmergency services and justice.\nA nightly patrol was established in Dorking in 1825 and in 1838 a small police force, initially with just three officers, was established under the Lighting and Watching Act 1833. This force became part of the Surrey Constabulary on its creation in 1851. A combined police station and magistrates' court complex was opened at the east end of the High Street in 1894 and the police station relocated to Moores Road in 1938. Purpose-built magistrates courts were opened adjacent to Pippbrook House in 1979 and closed in 2010.\nA volunteer fire brigade was formed in 1870. Initially based at South Street, it moved to the Public Hall at the west end of West Street in 1881. The brigade became full time in 1912 and, in 1971, it moved to a new fire station adjacent to the newly built ambulance station at North Holmwood. In 2021, the fire authority for Dorking is Surrey County Council and the statutory fire service is Surrey Fire and Rescue Service. Dorking Ambulance Station is run by the South East Coast Ambulance Service.\nHealthcare.\nDorking Cottage Hospital, opened in 1871 in South Terrace, was the first hospital in the town. It was merged in 1948 with the adjacent County Hospital, which had evolved from the Union Workhouse and Poor Law Infirmary, to form Dorking General Hospital. Since 2004, Dorking Hospital has been run as a community hospital by a consortium of local GP groups that provides outpatient services for the local area. The nearest accident &amp; emergency departments are at Epsom Hospital () and East Surrey Hospital (). As of 2020, there are GP practices on Reigate Road and South Street.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nThe A24 London\u2013Worthing and the A25 Guildford\u2013Sevenoaks roads intersect at Deepdene Roundabout on the eastern side of Dorking. The one-way system in the town centre was introduced in 1968.\nRailways.\nThe Epsom-Horsham and Guildford-Reigate railway lines cross to the northeast of Dorking, but there is now no physical connection between the two. The town is served by three railway stations. Dorking station is managed by Southern and is served by trains to London Victoria via , to London Waterloo via Wimbledon and to Horsham. Dorking Deepdene and Dorking West stations are managed by Great Western Railway and are served by trains to Reading via Guildford and to Gatwick Airport via Redhill.\nBuses.\nRoute 32 from Dorking to Guildford via Shere and to Redhill via Earlswood is run by Compass Bus.\nRoute 93 from Dorking to Horsham via Goodwyns and Holmwood Park is run by Metrobus on behalf of Surrey County Council.\nRoute 465 from Dorking to Kingston upon Thames via Leatherhead is run by London United.\nRoutes 21 (Epsom \u2013 Dorking \u2013 Crawley) and 22 (Shere \u2013 Dorking \u2013 Crawley) are run by Metrobus.\nCycle routes.\nNational Cycle Route 22 passes through the town centre and the Surrey Cycleway runs to the east.\nLong distance footpaths.\nThe Greensand Way, a long-distance footpath from Haslemere, Surrey to Hamstreet, Kent, passes through the south of Dorking. The route approaches the town centre from the east, passing over The Nower, then crossing the junction between South Street and Horsham Road. It climbs through the Glory Wood, before crossing Deepdene Terrace. The North Downs Way, between Farnham and Dover, passes approximately to the north of Dorking. Dorking station is the southern terminus of the Mole Gap Trail, which starts at Leatherhead station.\nEducation.\nPrimary schools.\nThere are five primary schools in Dorking, the oldest of which is Powell Corderoy School. It was founded in 1816 as The Dorking British School, and its original premises were in West Street; but twenty years later it moved to North Street. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the school had expanded and the funds for a new building in Norfolk Road were raised by Edith Corderoy and Mr T. Powell. The new site was opened in 1898 and the school adopted its present name in 1906. The school moved to its current location in Longfield Road in 1968.\nSt Martin's Primary School was founded as a National School by the vestry in the 1830s, however there is thought to have been a school located in the transepts of the parish church as early as the 17th century. The National School was moved from the grounds of the church to West Street in 1862. The Middle School relocated to Ranmore Road in 1969 and was joined by the First School in 1985. The Pixham First School was founded in 1880 by Mary Mayo and was built to a design by Gilbert Redgrave. St Paul's Primary School was founded in 1860.\nSt Paul's School was designed by the architect, Thomas Allom, and admitted its first pupils in March 1860. The infants department opened in 1872 and, from that year, the school educated children aged from 5 to 13. Today, St Paul's is a Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School and educates children from the ages of 5 to 11.\nSt Joseph's Catholic Primary School was founded in 1873 by Augusta Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk. The first premises were in Falkland Grove adjacent to St Joseph's Church. The school was run by nuns of the Servite Order from 1887 to 1970, when it moved to its present site in Norfolk Road, which had been vacated by Powell Corderoy School.\nSt John's Primary School was founded in 1955 on the Goodwyns housing estate to the south of the town. It was known as The Redlands Junior School until August 1999.\nNew Lodge School, a private prep school formed in 2002 from the merger of Stanway School and Nower Lodge School, closed in 2007.\nSecondary schools.\nThe Ashcombe School is a coeducational secondary school, north of the town centre. It traces its origins to the Dorking High School for Boys, founded in 1884, and the St Martin's High School for Girls, opened in 1903. In 1931, the two schools were merged to become the Dorking County School and moved to a new site in Ashcombe Road. In 1959 the Mowbray County Secondary Modern for girls was opened on an adjacent site. The two schools were combined to create the Ashcombe School in 1975.\nThe Priory School opened as the County Secondary Modern Mixed School in September 1949. It was initially based at the Dene Street Institute, but moved to its present location in West Bank within a few years. In 1959, the girls were transferred to the Mowbray School in the Ashcombe Road, and Sondes Place continued as a boys-only school. In 1976 it became a mixed comprehensive school and was renamed the Priory School in 1996.\nCulture.\nArt.\nThe Dorking Group of Artists, established in 1947, exhibits locally twice a year, in Betchworth and at Denbies. The Arts Society Dorking promotes local art appreciation and the preservation of the town's artistic heritage.\nLeith Hill Musical Festival.\nThe three-day Leith Hill Musical Festival for local, amateur choral societies, founded in 1905, takes place at the Dorking Halls each year. Ralph Vaughan Williams was the Festival Conductor until 1953, a post currently held by Jonathan Willcocks.\nEach day features a different group (or division) of choirs, which compete against each other in the morning and then combine to give a concert in the evening. Following the tradition established by Vaughan Williams, the \"Messiah\" by Handel and the \"St Matthew\" and \"St John Passions\" by J. S. Bach are frequently performed.\nAfter the death of Vaughan Williams in 1958, the festival committee commissioned David McFall to design a bronze bas relief likeness of the composer: one cast was placed in St Martin's Church and another in the Dorking Halls.\nRecording studios.\nStrawberry Studios South was opened in 1976, in a former cinema in South Street, by Graham Gouldman and Eric Stewart of the band 10cc. They recorded the album, \"Deceptive Bends\" there. Other artists also worked at the Studios, including Paul McCartney, who recorded part of \"Ebony and Ivory\" (a duet with Stevie Wonder) there. The English rock band, The Cure, recorded at Rhino Studios at Pippbrook Mill.\nLiterature.\n\"The Battle of Dorking\", a novella written by Lt. Col. Sir George Tomkyns Chesney in 1871, was set in the town. Describing a fictional invasion and conquest of Britain by a German-speaking country, it triggered an explosion of what came to be known as invasion literature.\nBenjamin Disraeli wrote part of his political novel \"Coningsby\" while staying at Deepdene between 1841 and 1844. The novel was subsequently dedicated to his host, Henry Thomas Hope. The fourth chapter of \"A Fool's Alphabet\" by novelist Sebastian Faulks, published in 1992, is set in the town.\nSport.\nShrove Tuesday football.\nA football game was played annually in Dorking on Shrove Tuesday between two teams representing the eastern and western halves of the town. The match began at 2pm outside the gates to St Martin's Church and lasted until 6pm. After a particularly riotous game in 1897, the local magistrates declared that the tradition was in breach of the Highway Act 1835 and 50 participants were fined. Arrests were also made after local townsfolk attempted to stage the match in 1898, 1899 and 1903. The local newspaper declared the custom extinct in 1907.\nAssociation football.\nDorking F.C. was formed in 1880 and moved to Meadowbank in 1956. The stadium was condemned as unsafe in 2013 and for the next three years, the club shared grounds, first at Horley and then Westhumble. Dorking F.C. closed in 2017.\nDorking Wanderers F.C. was founded in 1999. The team played its home games at Westhumble for ten seasons from 2007, before moving to the refurbished Meadowbank Stadium in July 2018.\nRugby.\nDorking rugby football club was founded in 1921. Initially its home matches were played at Meadowbank, but it moved the following year to Pixham. In 1972 the club relocated to the Big Field at Brockham as tenants of the National Trust, which had acquired the field in 1966. In the 2019\u201320 season, the 1st XV played in the London and South East Premier division. Notable former players include Elliot Daly, George Kruis and Kay Wilson.\nMotor racing.\nRob Walker's privateer racing team was based at Pippbrook Garage in London Road from 1947 to 1970. The team won nine Grands Prix and their drivers included Stirling Moss (1958\u20131961) and Graham Hill (1970). Walker's contribution to motorsport and to Dorking was celebrated on the centenary of his birth in October 2018 with a parade of classic cars through the town centre.\nCycling.\nDorking Cycling Club was founded in 1877 and by the 1890s was organising camps for amateur cyclists from across the south east of England. The club was refounded in 2011 and organises a programme of weekly rides for members. The 2012 Summer Olympic cycling road races passed through Dorking en route to Box Hill.\nRunning.\nDorking and Mole Valley Athletics Club is based at Pixham Sports Ground. They host the annual \"Dorking Ten\" road race starting from Brockham Green.\nThe weekly Mole Valley Parkrun has taken place at Denbies Wine Estate since March 2018. The vineyard also hosts the annual Run Bacchus marathon. The annual UK Wife-Carrying Race takes place at The Nower.\nTourist attractions.\nDenbies Wine Estate.\nDenbies Wine Estate, to the north of Dorking, is one of the largest wine producers in the UK. The vineyard, which covers some , was first planted in 1986 on the site of Bradley Farm, part of the Denbies estate. The winery and visitor centre were opened in 1993.\nDorking Museum.\nDorking Museum was opened in West Street in January 1976. The building had previously been an iron foundry, which had opened in the 1820s and closed after World War II. The museum houses a wide range of historical artefacts, as well as fossils and mineral samples from the Dorking area. Permanent displays explain the history of the town from prehistoric times to the present day, and the building also hosts temporary exhibitions, often connected with significant anniversaries of events such as World War I.\nThe museum was fully refurbished between 2008 and 2012 and was short-listed for the Museums Heritage Awards in 2013.\nSouth Street Caves.\nThe caves in South Street are thought to have been excavated in four distinct phases. Firstly, three wells, the largest of which has the date 1672 inscribed on its wall, were sunk vertically from Butter Hill above. The upper level, a network of four caverns which intersects the wells, was dug in the late 17th or early 18th centuries. These caves are linked by a staircase to the lowest level, a circular chamber which may have been used by religious dissenters, approximately below ground level. In Victorian times, the larger caverns were adapted for use as wine cellars. The current entrance to the caves dates from 1921.\nThe South Street caves were sold to Dorking UDC in 1921 and were leased by the council to various local wine merchants until the 1960s. The Dorking and Leith Hill Preservation Society first opened the caves for public tours in the 1970s. Dorking Museum assumed responsibility for running tours in May 2015. Prince Edward visited the caves in March of the same year.\nOther nearby attractions.\nSeveral National Trust properties are close to Dorking, including Box Hill, Leith Hill, Polesden Lacey and Ranmore Common.\nParks and open spaces.\nCotmandene.\nCotmandene is a area of common land to the east of the town centre (the name is thought to mean \"the heath of the poor cottages\"). During the Middle Ages it was used by commoners to graze pigs. The first almshouses on the north side of Cotmandene were built in 1677 and were given endowments in 1718 and 1831. They were rebuilt in 1848 and again in 1961.\nCricket matches were played on the heath during the 18th century and are recorded in Edward Beavan's 1777 poem \"Box Hill\". A painting entitled \"A Cricket Match on Cotmandene, Dorking\" by the artist James Canter, dating to around 1770, is now held by the Marylebone Cricket Club. In the 19th century, a funfair took place at the same time as the Ascension Day livestock fair in the town centre. In 1897, to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk (who was lord of the manor of Dorking) gave Cotmandene to the Urban District Council (UDC) on the condition that it was \"to remain a perpetual ornament and pleasure to the town\".\nDeepdene Terrace and Gardens.\nDeepdene was a country house to the south-east of Dorking. Its name derives from the narrow natural amphitheatre in the former grounds, most likely formed by erosion of the sandstone hillside by spring water. The gardens were first laid out by Charles Howard in the 1650s and both the diarist, John Evelyn, and John Aubrey recorded visits there in the second half of the 17th century. The grounds include a mausoleum in which owners Thomas Hope and Henry Thomas Hope are buried.\nIn the late 19th century, the property began a period of decline accelerated by the bankruptcy of the owner, Lord Francis Hope, in 1896. Much of the estate was sold for housebuilding in the early 20th century. In 1943, the terrace and garden were purchased by the Dorking and Leith Hill Preservation Society (chaired by Ralph Vaughan Williams) and transferred to the UDC, however the house was demolished in 1969. In the mid-2010s, the garden was restored and was reopened to the public as the \"Deepdene Trail\".\nGlory Wood.\nThe Glory Wood (the highest point in Dorking) is an area of primarily deciduous woodland to the southeast of the town centre. The southern part is known as \"Devil's Den\" and contains mainly oak with an area of coppiced sweet chestnut.\nThe Glory Wood was promised to the town in 1927 by Lord Francis Hope, on the condition that it was not to be built upon. The land was to have been transferred to the UDC in July 1929, however Hope withheld the gift until 1934, in protest at the published route of the Dorking Bypass through the Deepdene estate.\nMeadowbank.\nMeadowbank is a park on the north side of the Pipp Brook. In medieval times, it was part of the lordship lands and later became part of the Denbies estate. By the start of the 20th century, it was the grounds of large private house (also called \"Meadowbank\"). The house and grounds were purchased by Dorking UDC in 1926, with the intention of building 150 council houses, however owing to financial constraints, the Council instead decided to sell the western third for development. The Parkway estate was completed in 1935.\nThe park was landscaped in the decade before World War II and included the Pippbrook Mill mill pond, which was given to the town in 1934. From 1954, Meadowbank became the permanent home of Dorking Football Club until 2014. Dorking Wanderers F.C. moved to the refurbished ground in 2018.\nThe Nower.\nThe Nower is an area of open grassland, which rises above Dorking to the west of the town centre. Together with the adjacent Milton Heath, it forms a nature reserve owned by Mole Valley District Council and is managed by Surrey Wildlife Trust.\nThe Nower was given to the town in 1931 by Charles Barclay, the owner of the Bury Hill estate, although it had been accessible to visitors since Victorian times. Views over Dorking may be enjoyed from \"The Temple\", which dates from the early 19th century.\nNotable buildings and landmarks.\nDorking Cemetery.\nDorking Cemetery was opened in 1855 on farmland that had been purchased from the Deepdene estate. Two chapels were built for funeral services, one for Anglicans (with a rectangular floor plan) and one (with an octagonal floor plan) for non-conformists. Both were designed by Henry Clutton and were constructed from flint with stone dressings. An entrance lodge on Reigate Road was also provided. Originally the area of the cemetery was , but was enlarged to between 1884 and 1923.\nThe English novelist George Meredith and Victoria Cross recipient Charles Graham Robertson are among those buried there. The cemetery also contains 61 Commonwealth war graves of military personnel from the First and Second World Wars.\nDorking Halls.\nThe Art Deco Dorking Halls building, designed by the architect Percy W. Meredith for the Leith Hill Musical Festival (LHMF), was opened in 1931. The Grand Hall was intended to be used for performances of the Passions by J. S. Bach, but two smaller halls (the Masonic and Martineau) were also constructed as part of the same complex. During World War II, the building was used by the Meat Marketing Board and the Army, and it was then sold to Dorking UDC. A major refurbishment was undertaken by Mole Valley District Council between 1994 and 1997. The Martineau Hall houses the Premier Cinema.\nPippbrook House.\nPippbrook House, a Gothic country house to the north east of the town centre, was designed as a private residence for William Henry Forman by George Gilbert Scott in 1856. The house and surrounding were bought by the UDC in December 1930, for use as administrative offices. The UDC's successor, MVDC, opened purpose-built offices in the grounds in 1984, which enabled the local public library to move into the space vacated. The library relocated to St Martin's Walk in the town centre in 2012. In 2020, MVDC announced plans to develop Pippbrook House as a \"community hub and start-up business centre\".\nWhite Horse Hotel.\nThe first building to be recorded on the site of the White Horse Hotel was granted to the Knights Templar by John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, in around 1287. When the Templars were suppressed in 1308 by order of Pope Clement V, the property was confiscated and passed to the Knights of the Order of St John. For much of the late medieval period, it was known as the \"Cross House\" and in the 16th century it was the residence of the parish priest.\nThe property became an inn around 1750 (by which time it was known as \"The White Horse\"), a few years before the opening of the Epsom to Horsham turnpike road. Most of the current hotel was built during the 18th century (including the timber-framed frontage which faces the High Street), however some parts date from the 15th and 16th centuries. Famous guests have included Charles Dickens who wrote his novel The Pickwick Papers, whilst resident in the mid-1830s. Further additions were made to the hotel in the 19th century, which is protected today by a Grade II listing.\nStatues and sculptures.\nThe galvanised metal sculpture of a Dorking cockerel by the artist Peter Parkinson was erected on the Deepdene roundabout in 2007. The statue pays homage to the historical importance of the town's poultry market. The cockerel is a frequent target of yarn bombing and can be seen dressed in hats, scarves and other items of clothing.\nThe two statues outside the Dorking Halls were designed by William Fawke. The statue of architect and master builder Thomas Cubitt was installed in 1995. The statue of Ralph Vaughan Williams was donated by Sir Adrian White and was unveiled in 2001.\nThe sculpture of two cyclists at the Pixham End roundabout was unveiled in July 2012, less than two weeks before the Olympic road race events were routed through Dorking. The installation was designed by the artist Heather Burrell, and just over half of the cost was donated by members of the public, each of whom is represented by an oak leaf on either the cyclists' torsos or the bicycle wheels.\nThere are two sculptures by the artist Lucy Quinnell in the town: the first, a metal arch commemorating the writer and philosopher Grant Allen, was installed at the entrance to Allen Court in 2013; the second, depicting the \"Mayflower\" sailing westwards towards the New World, was commissioned by Mole Valley District Council and was unveiled in West Street in 2021.\nWar memorial.\nThe town war memorial, in South Street, was dedicated in 1921 \"in memory of Dorking men who fell in the Great War\". Designed by the architect Thomas Braddock, it was constructed from dressed Portland stone. The memorial was modified in 1945 to commemorate those who had died in World War II, with the addition of the wings at each side. At the base, a verse from 1 Samuel is inscribed: \"They were a wall unto us both by night and by day.\" The names of 264 people who died in the two conflicts (both military personnel and civilians) are recorded, including seven women. The memorial is protected by a Grade II listing.\nNotable residents.\nThree former residents of Dorking have been awarded the Victoria Cross (VC):\nPeople born in the town include:\nPeople who have lived in the town include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61850", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61850", "title": "Conon", "text": "5th/4th-century BCE Athenian statesman and general\nConon () (before 443 BC \u2013 c.\u2009389 BC) was an Athenian general at the end of the Peloponnesian War, who led the Athenian naval forces when they were defeated by a Peloponnesian fleet in the crucial Battle of Aegospotami; later he contributed significantly to the restoration of Athens' political and military power.\nCommanding the Athenian fleet.\nShortly after the Battle of Notium, Conon took over command of the Athenian fleet from Alcibiades, who had fled to Thrace. When the new Spartan navarch (commander-in-chief of the fleet) Callicratidas took over command from Lysander, he started an aggressive campaign against the Athenians in the Aegean. After taking Methymna in Lesbos, he sent a message to Conon, declaring that he would put an end to Conon's command of the sea. Soon thereafter, Callicratidas caught Conon's fleet of seventy ships at sea and pursued him towards Mytilene Harbor on Lesbos, where in the ensuing battle, Conon lost thirty ships. Conon drew the remaining forty ships up onto the beach, but while blockading him from sea, Callicratidas also surrounded him on land, having transported land forces from Chios and gaining the aid of the Methymnaeans.\nBesieged by land and sea, Conon was unable to break out from the vastly superior forces that surrounded him and only barely slipped a messenger ship out to Athens. After some initial panic, Athens sent a sizable force sent out to raise the siege. Callicraditas met this force at the Battle of Arginusae. His force was soundly defeated, and Callicratidas himself was killed. After his death, Lysander returned from Sparta to take command of Sparta's naval efforts in the Aegean.\nDefeat at Aegospotami.\nConon had been sent out to lead the Athenian forces following the recall of Alcibiades in 406 BC, and in 405 BC pursued the Peloponnesian fleet under Lysander to the Hellespont. Once there, the Peloponnesian took up a strong defensive position at Lampsacus and as they could not lure them out, the Athenians retreated to Aegospotami. Alcibiades came to warn them of the danger of their position, as they were based on an open beach without harbours, and advised them to move to Sestos about two miles away from where they were retrieving supplies. It seems that Alcibiades' advice was ignored and perhaps ridiculed.\nOn the fifth day of the stand-off, Lysander sent out scouts to spy on the Athenians. They signalled the main army once the Athenian crews had disembarked to take their meals. Thus when Lysander attacked almost the entire Athenian navy was caught unprepared and captured without resistance, and all the men taken were put to death. It was generally believed that some kind of treachery was involved, but Conon himself was never implicated. His ship was one of nine which escaped the disaster, boldly rushing to Lampsacus where the Spartans had left their fleet's sails (as was typical before a naval battle) and so preventing any effective means of pursuit. One of the nine Athenian ships to escape, the Paralus, returned to Athens, while Conon, with the other eight ships, fled to Evagoras of Cyprus, fearing the judgement of the Athenian people.\nAftermath and later career.\nAs a result of this victory, Sparta defeated the Athenians and so attempted to carve out her own empire in the Aegean. Her relationship with Persia deteriorated, and she began raiding the satrapies of Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes in Anatolia. By 397 BC, Pharnabazus had persuaded the Persian king Artaxerxes to prosecute the war by sea, and raised a fleet of 300 Phoenician and Cypriot ships. In sheer numbers they would be overwhelming, but they needed an experienced commander, and so they found Conon at Cyprus, who was only too happy for a chance to take revenge upon the Peloponnesians.\nFirst Conon moved up to Caria with a small portion of the fleet, where he was for a time blocked but then rescued by Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes. He then proceeded to Rhodes, where the pro-Spartan oligarchy was replaced by a democracy, and managed to capture food supplies being sent up from Egypt. In response to this, the Spartans decided to send out their navy, but made the mistake of entrusting it to Peisander, who had no experience. The battle took place at Cnidus in 394 BC, and was an easy and overwhelming Persian success. The Aegean cities expelled the Spartan garrisons and accepted Persian rule.\nAfter this success, Conon felt it was safe for him to return to Athens. Pharnabazus allowed him to retain part of the fleet, and supplied money for the fortification of Piraeus and the reconstruction of the long walls joining it to Athens. These actions meant that some of the main results of the Peloponnesian War were undone - Athens regained her position as a major power in Greece, and though she had still lost her empire, Sparta had been prevented from taking it over.\nThe next year the Spartans had opened negotiations with the Persians, and in order to secure their position in Greece offered to hand over all the cities in Anatolia to them. The Athenians sent delegates (including Conon) to announce this as unacceptable, which Tiribazus understood to mean that they still hoped to recover their empire and, outraged by this about-face, threw them in prison, Conon among them. Ancient writers give conflicting accounts of his end: some claim that he was sent into the interior of Asia and put to death; other accounts, probably more likely, record that he retired to Cyprus and died there. His son Timotheus later became another prominent general.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Petty was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year in February 2017 for his contributions to music and for his philanthropy. He also acted; he had a recurring role as the voice of Lucky Kleinschmidt in the animated comedy series \"King of the Hill\" from 2004 to the show's original conclusion in 2009.\nPetty died of an accidental drug overdose in 2017 at the age of 66, one week after the end of the Heartbreakers' 40th Anniversary Tour.\nEarly life and education.\nPetty was born on October 20, 1950, in Gainesville, Florida, the first of two sons of Kitty Petty (n\u00e9e Avery), a local tax office worker, and Earl Petty, a traveling salesman. His brother, Bruce, was seven years younger.\nPetty grew up in the Northeast Gainesville Residential District, known locally as the Duckpond. After his death, a historical marker was placed in the neighborhood and a nearby park was renamed to Tom Petty Park.\nPetty attended Howard Bishop Middle School, where he played Little League baseball and basketball. He then attended Gainesville High School, graduating in 1968.\nCareer.\nPetty's interest in rock and roll music began at age ten when he had an opportunity to meet Elvis Presley. In the summer of 1961, his uncle was working on the set of Presley's film \"Follow That Dream\", in nearby Ocala, and invited Petty to watch the movie's filming.\nPetty instantly became a Presley fan. When he returned that Saturday, he was greeted by his friend Keith Harben, and soon traded his Wham-O slingshot for a collection of Elvis 45s. Of that meeting with Presley, Petty said, \"Elvis glowed.\"\nIn 2006, Petty said he knew he wanted to be in a band the moment he saw the Beatles on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". \"The minute I saw the Beatles on the \"Ed Sullivan Show\"\u2014and it's true of thousands of guys\u2014there was the way out. There was a way to do it. You get your friends and you're a self-contained unit. And you make the music. And it looked like so much fun. It was something I identified with. I had never been hugely into sports.\u00a0... I had been a big fan of Elvis. But I really saw in the Beatles that here's something I could do. I knew I could do it. It wasn't long before there were groups springing up in garages all over the place.\" He later said that the Rolling Stones inspired him by demonstrating that he and musicians like him could make it in rock and roll.\nDon Felder, a fellow Gainesville resident who later joined the Eagles, wrote in his autobiography that he was one of Petty's first guitar teachers although Petty said that Felder taught him to play piano instead.\nAs a young man, Petty worked briefly on the grounds crew of the University of Florida, but never attended as a student. An Ogeechee lime tree that he purportedly planted while employed at the university is now called the Tom Petty tree, though Petty said he did not recall planting any trees. He also worked briefly as a gravedigger.\n1976\u20131987: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\nShortly after embracing his musical aspirations, Petty started a band known as the Epics, which later evolved into Mudcrutch. The band included future Heartbreakers Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench and was popular in Gainesville, but their recordings went unnoticed by a mainstream audience. They recorded at The Church Studio in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Their only single, \"Depot Street\", released in 1975 by Shelter Records, failed to chart.\nAfter Mudcrutch split up, Petty reluctantly agreed to pursue a solo career. Tench decided to form his own group, whose sound Petty appreciated. Eventually, Petty and Campbell collaborated with Tench, Ron Blair and Stan Lynch, forming the first lineup of the Heartbreakers. Their eponymous debut album gained little popularity among American audiences, achieving greater success in Britain. The singles \"American Girl\" and \"Breakdown\" (re-released in 1977) peaked at No.\u202f40 after the band toured in the United Kingdom in support of Nils Lofgren. The debut album was released by Shelter Records, which at that time was distributed by ABC Records.\nTheir second album, \"You're Gonna Get It!\", was the band's first Top 40 album, featuring the singles \"I Need to Know\" and \"Listen to Her Heart\". Their third album, \"Damn the Torpedoes\", quickly went platinum, selling nearly two million copies; it includes their breakthrough singles \"Don't Do Me Like That\", \"Here Comes My Girl\", \"Even the Losers\" and \"Refugee\".\nIn September 1979, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed at a Musicians United for Safe Energy concert at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Their rendition of \"Cry to Me\" was featured on the resulting album, \"No Nukes\".\nTheir fourth album, \"Hard Promises\", released in 1981, became a top-ten hit, going platinum and spawning the hit single \"The Waiting\". The album also featured Petty's first duet, \"Insider\" with Stevie Nicks.\nBass player Ron Blair quit the group and was replaced on the fifth album, \"Long After Dark\" (1982), by Howie Epstein; the resulting lineup lasted until 1994. The album contained the hit \"You Got Lucky\".\nIn 1985, the band participated in Live Aid, playing four songs at John F. Kennedy Stadium, in Philadelphia before a crowd of 89,484 people.\nThe band's album, \"Southern Accents\", was also released in 1985. It included the hit single \"Don't Come Around Here No More\", produced by Dave Stewart. The song's video featured Petty dressed as the Mad Hatter, mocking and chasing Alice from the book \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", then cutting and eating her as if she were a cake. The ensuing tour led to the live album \"\" and an invitation from Bob Dylan to join Dylan on his 60-date True Confessions Tour through Asia, Oceania, and North America.\nIn 1986 and 1987, they played some dates with the Grateful Dead. Also in 1987, the group released \"Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)\" which includes \"Jammin' Me\" which Petty wrote with Dylan.\n1988\u20131991: Traveling Wilburys and solo career.\nIn 1988, Petty, along with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne, was a founding member of the Traveling Wilburys. The band's first song, \"Handle with Care\", was intended as a B-side of one of Harrison's singles, but was judged too good for that purpose and the group decided to record a full album, \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\". A second Wilburys album, mischievously titled \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3\" and recorded without the recently deceased Orbison, followed in 1990. The album was named \"Vol. 3\" as a response to a series of bootlegged studio sessions being sold as \"Travelling Wilburys Vol. 2\". Petty incorporated Traveling Wilburys songs into his live shows, consistently playing \"Handle with Care\" in shows from 2003 to 2006, and for his 2008 tour adding \"surprises\" such as \"End of the Line\" to the set list.\nIn 1989, Petty released \"Full Moon Fever\", which featured hits \"I Won't Back Down\", \"Free Fallin'\" and \"Runnin' Down a Dream\". It was nominally his first solo album, although several Heartbreakers and other well-known musicians participated: Mike Campbell co-produced the album with Petty and Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, and backing musicians included Campbell, Lynne, and fellow Wilburys Roy Orbison and George Harrison (Ringo Starr appears on drums in the video for \"I Won't Back Down\", but they were actually performed by Phil Jones).\nPetty and the Heartbreakers reformed in 1991 and released \"Into the Great Wide Open\", which was co-produced by Lynne and included the hit singles \"Learning To Fly\" and \"Into the Great Wide Open\", the latter featuring Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway in the music video.\nBefore leaving MCA Records, Petty and the Heartbreakers got together to record, live in the studio, two new songs for a \"Greatest Hits\" package: \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\" and Thunderclap Newman's \"Something in the Air\". This was Stan Lynch's last recorded performance with the Heartbreakers. Petty commented \"He left right after the session without really saying goodbye.\" The package went on to sell over ten million copies, therefore receiving diamond certification by the RIAA.\n1991\u20132017: Move to Warner Bros. Records.\nIn 1989, while still under contract to MCA, Petty secretly signed a lucrative deal with Warner Bros. Records, to which the Traveling Wilburys had been signed. His first album on his new label, 1994's \"Wildflowers\", Petty's second of three solo albums, included the highly beloved title track, as well as the singles \"You Don't Know How It Feels\", \"You Wreck Me\", \"It's Good to Be King\", and \"A Higher Place\". The album, produced by Rick Rubin, sold over three million copies in the United States.\nIn 1996, Petty, with the Heartbreakers, released a soundtrack to the movie \"She's the One\" starring Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston (see \"Songs and Music from \"She's the One\"\"). The album's singles were \"Walls (Circus)\" featuring Lindsey Buckingham, \"Climb that Hill\", and a song written by Lucinda Williams, \"Change the Locks\". The album also included a cover of \"Asshole\", a song by Beck. The same year, the band accompanied Johnny Cash on \"Unchained\", provisionally titled \"Petty Cash\", for which Cash won a Grammy for Best Country Album. Cash later covered Petty's \"I Won't Back Down\" on \"\".\nIn 1999, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released their last album with Rubin at the helm, \"Echo\". Two songs were released as singles in the US, \"Room at the Top\" and \"Free Girl Now\". The album reached number 10 on the US album charts.\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers played \"I Won't Back Down\" at the benefit concert for victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The following year, they played \"Taxman\", \"I Need You\" and \"Handle with Care\" (joined for the last by Jeff Lynne, Dhani Harrison, and Jim Keltner) at the \"Concert for George\" in honor of Petty's friend and former bandmate George Harrison.\nPetty's 2002 release, \"The Last DJ\", was an album-length critique of practices within the music industry. The title track, inspired by Los Angeles radio personality Jim Ladd, bemoaned the end of the freedom that radio DJs once had to personally select songs for their station's playlists. The album peaked at number nine on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart in the United States.\nIn 2005, Petty began hosting his own show \"Buried Treasure\" on XM Satellite Radio, on which he shared selections from his personal record collection.\nIn 2006, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers headlined the fifth annual Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival as part of their \"30th Anniversary Tour\". Special guests included Stevie Nicks, Pearl Jam, the Allman Brothers Band, Trey Anastasio, the Derek Trucks Band, and the Black Crowes. Nicks joined Petty and the Heartbreakers on stage for several songs including \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\".\nIn July 2006, Petty released a solo album titled \"Highway Companion\", which included the hit \"Saving Grace\". It debuted at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200, which was Petty's highest chart position since the introduction of the Nielsen SoundScan system for tracking album sales in 1991. \"Highway Companion\" was briefly promoted on the tour with the Heartbreakers in 2006, with performances of \"Saving Grace\", \"Square One\", \"Down South\" and \"Flirting with Time\".\nDuring the summer of 2007, Petty reunited with his old bandmates Tom Leadon and Randall Marsh, along with Heartbreakers Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell, to reform his pre-Heartbreakers band Mudcrutch. The quintet recorded an album of 14 songs that was released on April 29, 2008 (on iTunes, an additional song \"Special Place\" was available if the album was pre-ordered). The band supported the album with a brief tour of California in the spring of 2008.\nIn 2007, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers contributed a cover of \"I'm Walkin'\" to the album \"\". The album's sales helped buy instruments for students in New Orleans public schools and contributed to the building of a community center in the city's Hurricane Katrina-damaged Ninth Ward.\nOn February 3, 2008, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed during the halftime-show of Super Bowl XLII at the University of Phoenix Stadium. They played \"American Girl\", \"I Won't Back Down\", \"Free Fallin\" and \"Runnin' Down a Dream\". That summer, the band toured North America with Steve Winwood as the opening act. Winwood joined Petty and the Heartbreakers on stage at select shows and performed his Spencer Davis Group hit \"Gimme Some Lovin'\", and occasionally he performed his Blind Faith hit \"Can't Find My Way Home\". In November 2009 the boxed set \"The Live Anthology\", a compilation of live recordings from 1978 to 2006, was released.\nThe band's twelfth album \"Mojo\" was released on June 15, 2010, and reached number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart. Petty described the album as \"Blues-based. Some of the tunes are longer, more jam-y kind of music. A couple of tracks really sound like the Allman Brothers\u2014not the songs but the atmosphere of the band.\" To promote the record, the band appeared as the musical guests on \"Saturday Night Live\" on May 17, 2010. The release of \"Mojo\" was followed by a North American summer tour. Prior to the tour, five of the band's guitars, including two owned by Petty, were stolen from their practice space in Culver City, California in April 2010. The items were recovered by Los Angeles police the next week.\nIn 2012, the band went on a world tour that included their first European dates in 20 years and their first ever concerts in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.\nOn July 28, 2014, Reprise Records released Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' thirteenth studio album, \"Hypnotic Eye\". The album debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, becoming the band's first album to top the chart. On November 20, 2015, the Tom Petty Radio channel debuted on SiriusXM.\nIn 2017, the Heartbreakers embarked on a 40th Anniversary Tour of the United States. The tour began on April 20 in Oklahoma City and ended on September 25 with a performance at the Hollywood Bowl in Hollywood, California. The Hollywood Bowl concert, which would ultimately be the Heartbreakers' final show, ended with a performance of \"American Girl\".\nOn September 28, 2018, Reprise Records released \"An American Treasure\", a 60-track career-spanning box set featuring dozens of previously unreleased recordings, alternate versions of classic songs, rarities, historic live performances and deep tracks. The box set was preceded by the first single, \"Keep A Little Soul\", in July 2018. The song is an unreleased outtake originally recorded in 1982 during the \"Long After Dark\" sessions.\nIn July 2024, the Petty estate signed a deal with Warner Chappell Music to distribute Petty's entire catalog.\nActing.\nPetty's first appearance in film took place in 1978, when he had a cameo in \"FM\". He later had a small part in 1987's \"Made in Heaven\" and appeared in several episodes of \"It's Garry Shandling's Show\" between 1987 and 1990, playing himself as one of Garry Shandling's neighbors. Petty was also featured in Shandling's other show, \"The Larry Sanders Show\", as one of the story within a story final guests. In the episode, Petty gets bumped from the show and nearly comes to blows with Greg Kinnear.\nPetty appeared in the 1997 film \"The Postman\", directed by and starring Kevin Costner, as the Bridge City Mayor (from the dialogue it is implied that he is playing a future history version of himself). In 2002, he appeared on \"The Simpsons\" in the episode \"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\", along with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Lenny Kravitz, Elvis Costello, and Brian Setzer. In it, Petty spoofed himself as a tutor to Homer Simpson on the art of lyric writing, composing a brief song about a drunk girl driving down the road while concerned with the state of public schools. Later in the episode, he loses a toe during a riot.\nPetty had a recurring role as the voice of Elroy \"Lucky\" Kleinschmidt in the animated comedy series \"King of the Hill\" from 2004 to 2009. In 2010, Petty made a five-second cameo appearance with comedian Andy Samberg in a musical video titled \"Great Day\" featured on the bonus DVD as part of The Lonely Island's new album \"Turtleneck &amp; Chain\".\nViews on artistic control.\nPetty was known as a staunch guardian of his artistic control and artistic freedom. In 1979, he was involved in a legal dispute when ABC Records was sold to MCA Records. He refused to be transferred to another record label without his consent. In May 1979, he filed for bankruptcy and was signed to the new MCA subsidiary Backstreet Records.\nIn early 1981, the upcoming Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album, which would become \"Hard Promises\", was slated to be the next MCA release with the new list price of $9.98, following Steely Dan's \"Gaucho\" and the Olivia Newton-John/Electric Light Orchestra \"Xanadu\" soundtrack. This so-called \"superstar pricing\" was $1.00 more than the usual list price of $8.98. Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press and the issue became a popular cause among music fans. Non-delivery of the album and naming it \"Eight Ninety-Eight\" were considered, but eventually MCA decided against the price increase.\nIn 1987, Petty sued tire company B.F. Goodrich for $1\u00a0million for using a song very similar to his song \"Mary's New Car\" in a TV commercial. The ad agency that produced the commercial had previously sought permission to use Petty's song but was refused. A judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting further use of the ad and the suit was later settled out of court. Petty also disallowed George W. Bush from using \"I Won't Back Down\" for his 2000 presidential campaign. His family would do the same for Donald Trump in 2020, stating \"Tom Petty would never want a song of his used for a campaign of hate.\"\nSome outlets have claimed that the Red Hot Chili Peppers single \"Dani California\", released in May 2006, bears a close musical similarity to Petty's \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\". Petty told \"Rolling Stone\", \"I seriously doubt that there is any negative intent there. And a lot of rock 'n' roll songs sound alike. Ask Chuck Berry. The Strokes took 'American Girl' for their song 'Last Nite', and I saw an interview with them where they actually admitted it. That made me laugh out loud. I was like, 'OK, good for you' ... If someone took my song note for note and stole it maliciously, then maybe [I'd sue]. But I don't believe in lawsuits much. I think there are enough frivolous lawsuits in this country without people fighting over pop songs.\"\nIn January 2015, it was revealed that Petty and Jeff Lynne would receive royalties from Sam Smith's song \"Stay with Me\" after its writers acknowledged similarities between it and \"I Won't Back Down\". Petty and co-composer Lynne were each awarded 12.5% of the royalties from \"Stay with Me\", and their names were added to the ASCAP song credit. Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him, saying, \"All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by. Sam's people were very understanding of our predicament and we easily came to an agreement\".\nPersonal life.\nPetty overcame a difficult relationship with his father. He said his father found it difficult to accept that Petty was \"a mild-mannered kid who was interested in the arts\" and subjected him to verbal and physical abuse on a regular basis. Petty described his father as a \"wild, gambling drinker guy\". He was close to his mother and his brother, Bruce.\nPetty married Jane Benyo in 1974. They had two daughters: Adria, a director, and Annakim, an artist. Benyo told mutual friend Stevie Nicks that she met Petty at \"the age of seventeen\". Nicks misheard Benyo's North Florida accent, inspiring the title of her song \"Edge of Seventeen\". Petty and Benyo divorced in 1996.\nOn May 17, 1987, an arsonist set fire to Petty's house in Encino, California. Firefighters were able to salvage the basement recording studio and the original tapes stored there, as well as his Gibson Dove acoustic guitar. However, his signature gray top hat was destroyed. The perpetrator was never caught.\nPetty struggled with heroin addiction following his divorce from Benyo. He cited the emotional pain of the divorce as a cause. He got clean after going to rehab in 1999, crediting his then-girlfriend Dana York with saving his life by helping him seek treatment.\nOn June 3, 2001, Petty and York were married in Las Vegas. They married again at their home in Malibu on June 21. Little Richard officiated the wedding, and an all-female mariachi band performed. York had a son from a previous marriage, Dylan.\nPetty spoke in 2014 of the benefits from his practice of Transcendental Meditation.\nDeath.\nOn October 1, 2017, Petty's wife Dana York found him not breathing and in cardiac arrest at their home. He was resuscitated and taken to the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, where he was put on life support. He died at 8:40p.m. PDT on October 2. There had been premature reports of his death throughout the day.\nA memorial service for Petty was held at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, on October 16, 2017.\nOn January 19, 2018, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner announced that Petty's death was due to an \"accidental overdose\" stating \"multisystem organ failure due to resuscitated cardiopulmonary arrest due to mixed drug toxicity\", a combination of fentanyl, oxycodone, acetylfentanyl and despropionyl fentanyl (all opioids); temazepam and alprazolam (both benzodiazepines); and citalopram (an antidepressant). In a statement on his website, Petty's wife and daughter said he had a number of medical problems, including emphysema, knee difficulties \"and most significantly a fractured hip\". He was prescribed pain medication for these problems and informed on the day of his death that his hip injury had worsened. The statement read, \"[it] is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his overuse of medication.[..] We feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident.\"\nOn September 23, 2018, Petty's widow Dana gave an interview to \"Billboard\" saying that Petty put off hip surgery his doctors had recommended for some time. \"He'd had it in mind it was his last tour and he owed it to his long-time crew, from decades some of them, and his fans.\" Dana said that Petty was in a good mood the day before his death: \"He had those three shows in L.A. Never had he been so proud of himself, so happy, so looking forward to the future\u2014and then he's gone.\"\nEquipment.\nPetty owned and used a number of guitars over the years. Petty was known for his usage of Rickenbacker guitars, which he frequently played from 1979 onwards. The Rickenbacker 660/12TP neck was designed by Petty and featured his signature from 1991 to 1997. He also extensively played several Fender Telecasters and a Guild D25 12-string acoustic.\nPetty's later amplifier setup featured two Fender Vibro-King 60-watt combos.\nAwards and honors.\nIn October 1981, and again in September 2006, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers received the keys to the city of Gainesville, Florida, where he and his bandmates either lived or grew up.\nIn 1994, \"You Got Lucky\", a Petty tribute album featuring such bands as Everclear and Silkworm was released.\nIn April 1996, Petty received UCLA's George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement. The next month, Petty won the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers' Golden Note Award.\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999, for their contribution to the recording industry.\nIn December 2001, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which further honored Petty with an exhibit of his items from July 2006 until 2007.\nHe is ranked 91st on \"Rolling Stone's\" list of the Greatest Artists of All Time.\nPetty received the \"Billboard\" Century Award, the organization's highest honor for creative achievement on December 6, 2005.\nPeter Bogdanovich's documentary film on Petty's career titled \"Runnin' Down a Dream\" premiered at the New York Film Festival in October 2007.\nPetty was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year in February 2017 for his contributions to music and for his philanthropy.\nA week after his death in 2017, a tribute to Petty was painted on Gainesville's Southwest 34th Street Wall. It reads \"Love you always, Gainesville No. 1 Son, Thanks, Tommy\".\nStarting on October 7, 2017, five days after Petty's death, \"I\" \"Won't Back Down\" has been played at every Florida Gators football home game at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium following the conclusion of the 3rd Quarter, after \"We Are the Boys from Old Florida\" is played by the band.\nIn October 2018, on what would have been the singer's 68th birthday, the city of Gainesville renamed Northeast Park, where a young Petty had often visited, to Tom Petty Park.\nIn December 2021, the University of Florida board of trustees unanimously voted to posthumously award Petty with an honorary PhD from the school.\nHe has three albums, \"Wildflowers\" (No. 214), \"Damn the Torpedoes\" (No. 231), and \"Full Moon Fever\" (No. 298), on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. He has two songs on the same magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list: \"American Girl\" (No. 169) and \"Free Fallin'\" (No. 219).\nIn October 2022, the University of Florida's \"Pride of the Sunshine\" dedicated their halftime show to Tom Petty's music as part of the university's inaugural Tom Petty Day. The band would continue their tribute performances to Petty during halftime at several other games throughout the 2022\u201323 football season.\nIn December 2023, Petty's song \"Love Is a Long Road\" was used in the first trailer for \"Grand Theft Auto VI\", which is considered one of the most anticipated video games ever made. This trailer gained over 90 million YouTube views within the first 24 hours. Because of this immense bump in popularity, the song itself gained nearly 1 million YouTube views in the same time span, gained a 36,979% increase on Spotify, had almost 250,000 searches on Shazam, and ranked second on the worldwide iTunes chart.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61855", "revid": "49679309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61855", "title": "Muddy Waters", "text": "American blues musician (1913\u20131983)\nMcKinley Morganfield (April 4, 1913\u00a0\u2013 April 30, 1983), better known as Muddy Waters, was an American blues singer-songwriter and musician who was an important figure in the post-World War II blues scene, and is often cited as the \"father of modern Chicago blues\". His style of playing has been described as \"raining down Delta beatitude\".\nMuddy Waters grew up on Stovall Plantation near Clarksdale, Mississippi, and by the age of 17 was playing the guitar and the harmonica, copying local blues artists Son House and Robert Johnson. In 1941, Alan Lomax and Professor John W. Work III of Fisk University recorded him in Mississippi for the Library of Congress. In 1943, he moved to Chicago to become a full-time professional musician. In 1946, he recorded his first records for Columbia Records and then for Aristocrat Records, a newly formed label run by brothers Leonard and Phil Chess.\nIn the early 1950s, Muddy Waters and his band\u2014Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums and Otis Spann on piano\u2014recorded several songs that became blues classics, some with the bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon. These songs included \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" and \"I'm Ready\". In 1958, he traveled to England, laying the foundations of the resurgence of interest in the blues there. His performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1960 was recorded and released as his first live album, \"At Newport 1960\".\nMuddy Waters' music has influenced various American music genres, including rock and roll and subsequently rock.\nEarly life.\nMuddy Waters' place and date of birth are not conclusively known. He stated that he was born in 1915 at Rolling Fork in Sharkey County, Mississippi, but other evidence suggests that he was born in the unincorporated community of Jug's Corner, in neighboring Issaquena County, in 1913. In the 1930s and 1940s, before his rise to fame, the year of his birth was reported as 1913 on his marriage license, recording notes, and musicians' union card. A 1955 interview in the \"Chicago Defender\" is the earliest in which he stated 1915 as the year of his birth, and he continued to state that year in interviews from that point onward. The 1920 census lists him as five years old as of March 6, 1920. The Social Security Death Index, relying on the Social Security card application submitted after his move to Chicago in the mid-1940s, lists him as being born April 4, 1913. His gravestone gives his birth year as 1915.\nHis grandmother, Della Grant, raised him after his mother died shortly after his birth. Grant gave him the nickname \"Muddy\" at an early age because he loved to play in the muddy water of nearby Deer Creek. \"Waters\" was added years later, as he began to play harmonica and perform locally in his early teens. He taught himself to play harmonica. The remains of the cabin on Stovall Plantation where he lived in his youth are now at the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale, Mississippi.\nHe had his first introduction to music in church: \"I used to belong to church. I was a good Baptist, singing in the church. So I got all of my good moaning and trembling going on for me right out of church,\" he recalled. By the time he was 17, he had purchased his first guitar. \"I sold the last horse that we had. Made about fifteen dollars for him, gave my grandmother seven dollars and fifty cents, I kept seven-fifty and paid about two-fifty for that guitar. It was a Stella. The people ordered them from Sears-Roebuck in Chicago.\" He started playing his songs in joints near his hometown, mostly on a plantation owned by Colonel William Howard Stovall.\nCareer.\nEarly career, 1930s\u20131948.\nIn the early 1930s, he accompanied Big Joe Williams on tours of the Delta, playing harmonica. Williams recounted to Blewett Thomas that he eventually dropped Muddy \"because he was takin' away my women [fans]\".\nIn August 1941, Alan Lomax went to Stovall, Mississippi, on behalf of the Library of Congress to record various country blues musicians. \"He brought his stuff down and recorded me right in my house,\" Muddy told \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, \"and when he played back the first song I sounded just like anybody's records. Man, you don't know how I felt that Saturday afternoon when I heard that voice and it was my own voice. Later on he sent me two copies of the pressing and a check for twenty bucks, and I carried that record up to the corner and put it on the jukebox. Just played it and played it and said, 'I can do it, I can do it'.\" Lomax came back in July 1942 to record him again. Both sessions were eventually released by Testament Records as \"Down on Stovall's Plantation\". The complete recordings were reissued by Chess Records on CD as \"Muddy Waters: The Complete Plantation Recordings. The Historic 1941\u201342 Library of Congress Field Recordings\" in 1993 and remastered in 1997.\nIn 1943, he headed to Chicago with the hope of becoming a full-time professional musician. He recalled arriving in Chicago as the single most momentous event in his life. He lived with a relative for a short period while driving a truck and working in a factory by day and performing at night. Big Bill Broonzy, then one of the leading bluesmen in Chicago, had Muddy open his shows in the rowdy clubs where Broonzy played. This gave him the opportunity to play in front of a large audience. In 1944, he bought his first electric guitar and then formed his first electric combo. He felt obliged to electrify his sound in Chicago because, he said, \"When I went into the clubs, the first thing I wanted was an amplifier. Couldn't nobody hear you with an acoustic.\" His sound reflected the optimism of postwar African Americans. Willie Dixon said that \"There was quite a few people around singing the blues but most of them was singing all sad blues. Muddy was giving his blues a little pep.\"\nIn 1946, he recorded some songs for Mayo Williams at Columbia Records, with an old-fashioned combo consisting of clarinet, saxophone and piano; they were released a year later with Ivan Ballen's Philadelphia-based 20th Century label, billed as James \"Sweet Lucy\" Carter and his Orchestra \u2013 Muddy Waters' name was not mentioned on the label. Later that year, he began recording for Aristocrat Records, a newly formed label run by the brothers Leonard and Phil Chess. In 1947, he played guitar with Sunnyland Slim on piano on the cuts \"Gypsy Woman\" and \"Little Anna Mae\". These were also shelved, but in 1948, \"I Can't Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home\" became hits, and his popularity in clubs began to take off. Soon after, Aristocrat changed its name to Chess Records. His signature tune \"Rollin' Stone\" also became a hit that year.\nCommercial success, 1948\u20131957.\nInitially, the Chess brothers would not allow Muddy Waters to use his working band in the recording studio; instead, they provided him with bass backing by Ernest \"Big\" Crawford or by musicians assembled specifically for the recording session, including \"Baby Face\" Leroy Foster and Johnny Jones. Gradually, Chess relented, and by September 1953 he was recording with one of the most acclaimed blues groups in history: Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums, Otis Spann on piano and sometimes, bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon. The band recorded a number of blues songs which have become classics including \"Hoochie Coochie Man\", \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\", and \"I'm Ready\".\nHis band became a proving ground for some of the city's best blues talent, with members of the ensemble going on to successful careers of their own. In 1952, Little Walter left when his single \"Juke\" became a hit, although he continued working with Muddy long after he left the band, appearing on most of the Muddy's classic recordings in the 1950s. In 1954, Howlin' Wolf moved to Chicago with money that he earned through the success of the singles he recorded at Sun Records which Chess released, and the legendary rivalry with Muddy began. The rivalry was, in part, stoked by Willie Dixon providing songs to both artists, with Wolf suspecting that Muddy was getting Dixon's best songs. In 1955, Jimmy Rogers left to work exclusively with his own band which had been a sideline until that time.\nIn the mid-1950s, his singles were frequently on \"Billboard\" magazine's various Rhythm &amp; Blues charts including \"Sugar Sweet\" in 1955 and \"Trouble No More\", \"Forty Days and Forty Nights\", and \"Don't Go No Farther\" in 1956. 1956 also saw the release of one of his best-known numbers, \"Got My Mojo Working\", although it did not appear on the charts. However, by the late 1950s, his singles success had come to an end, with only \"Close to You\" reaching the chart in 1958. Also in 1958, Chess released his first compilation album, \"The Best of Muddy Waters\", which collected twelve of his singles up to 1956.\nPerformances and crossover, 1958\u20131970.\nMuddy toured England with Spann in 1958 where they were backed by local Dixieland-style or \"trad jazz\" musicians, including Chris Barber and members of his band. At the time, English audiences had only been exposed to acoustic folk blues, as performed by artists such as Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, and Big Bill Broonzy. Both the musicians and audiences were unprepared for his performance, which included electric slide guitar playing. He recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They thought I was a Big Bill Broonzy [but] I wasn't. I had my amplifier and Spann and I was going to do a Chicago thing. We opened up in Leeds, England. I was definitely too loud for them. The next morning we were in the headlines of the paper, 'Screaming Guitar and Howling Piano'.\nAlthough his performances alienated the old guard, some younger musicians, including Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies from Barber's band, were inspired to go in the more modern, electric blues direction. Korner and Davies' own groups included musicians who would later form the Rolling Stones (named after Waters's 1950 hit \"Rollin' Stone\"), Cream, and Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac.\nIn the 1960s, his performances continued to introduce a new generation to Chicago blues. At the Newport Jazz Festival, he recorded one of the first live blues albums, \"At Newport 1960\", and his performance of \"Got My Mojo Working\" was nominated for a Grammy Award. In September 1963, in Chess' attempt to connect with folk music audiences, he recorded \"Folk Singer\", which replaced his trademark electric guitar sound with an acoustic band, including a then-unknown Buddy Guy on acoustic guitar. \"Folk Singer\" was not a commercial success, but it was lauded by critic Joe Kane, and in 2003 \"Rolling Stone\" magazine placed it at number 280 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In October 1963, Waters participated in the first of several annual European tours, organized as the American Folk Blues Festival, during which he also performed more acoustic-oriented numbers.\nIn 1967, he re-recorded several blues standards with Bo Diddley, Little Walter, and Howlin' Wolf, which were marketed as \"Super Blues\" and \"The Super Super Blues Band\" albums in Chess' attempt to reach a rock audience. \"The Super Super Blues Band\" united Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, who had a long-standing rivalry. It was, as Ken Chang wrote in his AllMusic review, flooded with \"contentious studio banter [...] more entertaining than the otherwise unmemorable music from this stylistic train wreck\". In 1968, at the insistence of Marshall Chess, he recorded \"Electric Mud\", an album intended to revive his career by backing him with Rotary Connection, a psychedelic soul band that Chess had put together. The album proved controversial; although it reached number 127 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, it was scorned by many critics, and eventually disowned by Muddy himself:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That \"Electric Mud\" record I did, that one was dogshit. But when it first came out, it started selling like wild, and then they started sending them back. They said, \"This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on \u2013 all this wow-wow and fuzztone.\"\nNonetheless, six months later he recorded a follow-up album, \"After the Rain\", which had a similar sound and featured many of the same musicians.\nLater in 1969, he recorded and released the album \"Fathers and Sons\", where he returned to his classic Chicago sound. \"Fathers and Sons\" had an all-star backing band that included Michael Bloomfield and Paul Butterfield, longtime fans whose desire to play with him was the impetus for the album. It was the most successful album of Muddy Waters' career, reaching number 70 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\nResurgence and later career, 1971\u20131982.\nIn 1971, Chess recorded a show at Mister Kelly's, an upscale Chicago nightclub. The album signaled Muddy's return to form and cemented his appeal with white audiences.\nIn 1972, he won his first Grammy Award, for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording for \"They Call Me Muddy Waters\", a 1971 album of old but previously unreleased recordings.\nLater in 1972, he flew to England to record the album \"The London Muddy Waters Sessions\". The album was a follow-up to the previous year's \"The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions\". Both albums were the brainchild of Chess Records producer Norman Dayron, and were intended to showcase Chicago blues musicians playing with the younger British rock musicians whom they had inspired. He brought with him two American musicians, harmonica player Carey Bell and guitarist Sammy Lawhorn. The British and Irish musicians who played on the album included Rory Gallagher, Steve Winwood, Rick Grech, and Mitch Mitchell. Muddy was dissatisfied by the results, due to the British musicians' more rock-oriented sound. \"These boys are top musicians. They can play with me, put the book before 'em and play it, you know,\" he told Guralnick. \"But that ain't what I need to sell my people. It ain't the Muddy Waters sound. An' if you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man.\" He stated, \"My blues look so simple, so easy to do, but it's not. They say my blues is the hardest blues in the world to play.\" Nevertheless, the album won another Grammy, again for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording.\nHe won another Grammy for his last LP on Chess, \"The Muddy Waters Woodstock Album\", recorded in 1975 with a new band, guitarist Bob Margolin; pianist Pinetop Perkins and Paul Butterfield on harmonica with Levon Helm and Garth Hudson of the Band on drums, organ, accordion and saxophone. In November 1976, he appeared as a featured special guest at the Band's Last Waltz farewell concert, and in the subsequent 1978 feature film documentary of the event.\nHe performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1972, 1974 and 1977. An album, CD, and streaming release featuring many of his best known songs from these performances was compiled in 2021 as \"Muddy Waters: The Montreux Years\". In 1974, his backing musicians in Montreux included Buddy Guy, Pinetop Perkins, Junior Wells, and Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman. Wyman and Perkins also performed with him in 1977.\nFrom 1977 to 1981, blues musician Johnny Winter, who idolized Muddy since childhood and who had become a friend, produced four albums for him, all on the Blue Sky Records label: the studio albums \"Hard Again\" (1977), \"I'm Ready\" (1978) and \"King Bee\" (1981), and the live album, \"Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters \u2013 Live\" (1979). The albums were critical and commercial successes, with all but \"King Bee\" winning a Grammy. \"Hard Again\" has been especially praised by critics, who have tended to describe it as his comeback album.\nIn 1981, he was invited to perform at Chicago Fest, the city's top outdoor music festival. He was joined onstage by Johnny Winter and Buddy Miles, and played classics like \"Mannish Boy\", \"Trouble No More\", and \"Mojo Working\" to a new generation of fans. Shout! Factory made the performances available on DVD in 2009. On November 22, he performed live with three members of the Rolling Stones (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood) at the Checkerboard Lounge, a blues club in Bronzeville, on the South Side of Chicago, which Buddy Guy and L.C. Thurman opened in 1972. A DVD of the performance, \"Live at the Checkerboard Lounge, Chicago 1981\", was released in 2012.\nIn 1982, he cut way back on performing due to declining health. His last public performance took place when he sat in with Eric Clapton's band at a concert in Florida in the summer of 1982.\nPersonal life, death and estate.\nMuddy Waters was married to his first wife, Mabel Berry, from 1932 to 1935.\nHis second wife, whom he married in the 1940s, Geneva Wade, died of cancer on March 15, 1973. Gaining custody of three of his children, Joseph, Renee, and Rosalind, Muddy Waters moved them into his home, eventually buying a new house in Westmont, Illinois. In 1977, he met Marva Jean Brooks, whom he nicknamed \"Sunshine\", at a Florida hotel; Eric Clapton served as best man at their wedding in 1979.\nHe had at least six children, including illegitimate children.\nTwo of his sons Larry \"Mud\" Morganfield and Big Bill Morganfield are also blues singers and musicians. In 2017, his youngest son, Joseph \"Mojo\" Morganfield, began publicly performing the blues, and played occasionally with his brothers; he died in 2020 at the age of 56.\nMuddy Waters died in his sleep at his home in Westmont, Illinois, on April 30, 1983, from heart failure and cancer-related complications, aged 70. He was taken from his Westmont home, where he lived for the last decade of his life, to Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove, Illinois, where he was pronounced dead. His funeral was held on May 4, 1983. Throngs of blues musicians and fans attended his funeral at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. He is buried next to his wife, Geneva.\nAfter his death, a decades-long court battle ensued between his heirs and Scott Cameron, his manager at the time. In 2010, his heirs were petitioning the courts to appoint Mercy Morganfield, his daughter, as administrator who would then control the assets of his estate which were mainly copyrights to his music. The petition to reopen the estate was successful. Following Cameron's death, the heirs' lawyers, in May 2018, sought to hold Scott Cameron's wife in contempt for allegedly diverting royalty income. The heirs, however, asked for that citation not to be pursued. The last court date was held on July 10, 2018, and, as of 2023, the disputed arrangement remained unchanged.\nLegacy.\nTwo years after his death, the city of Chicago paid tribute to him by designating the one-block section between 900 and 1000 East 43rd Street near his former home on the south side \"Honorary Muddy Waters Drive\". In 2017, a ten-stories mural commissioned as a part of the Chicago Blues Festival and designed by Brazilian artist Eduardo Kobra was painted on the side of the building at 17 North State Street, at the corner of State and Washington Streets. The Chicago suburb of Westmont, where he lived the last decade of his life, named a section of Cass Avenue near his home \"Honorary Muddy Waters Way\".\nIn 2008, the Mississippi Blues Commission marked the site of his cabin with a marker as part of the Mississippi Blues Trail in Clarksdale, Mississippi. He also received a plaque on the Clarksdale Walk of Fame.\nMuddy Waters' Chicago Home in the Kenwood neighborhood is in the process of being named a Chicago Landmark.\nA crater on Mercury was named in his honor in 2016 by the IAU.\nIn 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him at number 72 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\nInfluence.\nThe British band The Rolling Stones named themselves after Muddy Waters' 1950 song, \"Rollin' Stone\". Jimi Hendrix recalled that \"I first heard him as a little boy and it scared me to death\". Eric Clapton was a big fan of Muddy Waters growing up and his band Cream covered \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\" on their 1966 debut album, \"Fresh Cream\". Canned Heat also covered the song at the Monterey Pop Festival and later Bob Dylan played it on his album \"Modern Times\". Many bands recorded \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" including The Allman Brothers Band, Humble Pie, Steppenwolf, Supertramp and Fear. The Led Zeppelin hit \"Whole Lotta Love has lyrics and a melody heavily influenced by the Muddy Waters hit \"You Need Love\" (written by Willie Dixon). Angus Young has cited Muddy as an influences and the AC/DC song \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" came from lyrics of his song \"You Shook Me\", written by Dixon and J. B. Lenoir.\nIn 1981, ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons went to visit the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale with \"The Blues\" magazine founder, Jim O'Neal. The museum's director, Sid Graves, brought Gibbons to visit Muddy's original house, and encouraged him to pick up a piece of scrap lumber that was originally part of the roof. Gibbons eventually converted the wood into a guitar. Named Muddywood, the instrument is now exhibited at the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale. In 1993, Paul Rodgers released the album \"Muddy Water Blues: A Tribute to Muddy Waters\", on which he covered a number of his songs, including \"Louisiana Blues\", \"Rollin' Stone\", \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"I'm Ready\" in collaboration with guitarists Gary Moore, Brian May and Jeff Beck.\nFollowing Muddy's death, fellow blues musician B.B. King told \"Guitar World\", \"It's going to be years and years before most people realize how greatly he contributed to American music.\" The bluesman John Hammond told \"Guitar World\", \"Muddy was a master of just the right notes. It was profound guitar playing, deep and simple ... more country blues transposed to the electric guitar, the kind of playing that enhanced the lyrics, gave profundity to the words themselves.\"\nIn 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" included \"\" on its list of greatest albums. They ranked him 17th on their list of the greatest artists of all time. Gibbons wrote: It was all supposed to be disposable. Just noise on a shellac disc. And here we are in the 21st century still trying to figure out how such a simple art form could be so complicated and subtle. It's still firing brain synapses around the world. You've got the Japanese Muddy Waters Society corresponding with fans in Sweden and England, and his music can still propel a party in the U.S. He made three chords sound deep, and they are.\nIn film.\nMuddy Waters' songs have been featured in long-time fan Martin Scorsese's movies, including \"The Color of Money\", \"Goodfellas\", and \"Casino\". A 1970s recording of \"Mannish Boy\" was used in \"Goodfellas\", \"Better Off Dead\", \"Risky Business\", and the rockumentary \"The Last Waltz\". In 1988 \"Mannish Boy\" was also used in a Levi's 501 commercial and re-released in Europe as a single with \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" on the flip side.\nWaters is a central character in the 2008 American biographical drama film \n\"Cadillac Records\". The role of Muddy Waters is played by Jeffrey Wright. Wright recorded \"(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man\" for the movie soundtrack.\nAwards and recognition.\nGrammy Awards\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed four songs of Muddy Waters among the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.\nBlues Foundation Awards\nInductions\nU.S. postage stamp\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, at the time when he was conceived, Eudokia was the mistress of Emperor Michael III. Consequently, it is most probable that like his older brother Leo VI the Wise, Stephen was Michael's son.\nCastrated by Basil I, Stephen became a monk and was designated for a career in the church since his childhood. In 886, his brother, the new Emperor Leo VI, dismissed Patriarch Photios I and appointed the 19-year-old Stephen in his stead.\nAs patriarch, Stephen I participated in the ceremonial reburial of Michael III by Leo VI in the imperial mausoleum attached to the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. He acquired a reputation for piety, and died in May 893 at the age of 25. His feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is on 18 May.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is 16 May.\nNicholas was born in the Italian Peninsula and had become a friend of the Patriarch Photius I. He fell into disfavor after Photius I's dismissal in 886 and retired to a monastery. Emperor Leo VI the Wise retrieved him from the monastery and made him \"mystikos\", a dignity designating either the imperial secretary or a judicial official.\nOn 1 March 901, Nicholas was appointed patriarch. However, he fell out with Leo VI over the latter's fourth marriage to his mistress Zoe Karbonopsina. Although he reluctantly baptised the fruit of this relationship, the future Emperor Constantine VII, Nicholas I forbade the emperor from entering the church and may have become involved in the revolt of Andronikos Doukas. He was deposed as patriarch on 1 February 907 and replaced by Euthymius. Exiled to his own monastery, Nicholas I regarded his deposition as unjustified and involved Pope Sergius III in the dispute.\nAbout the time of the accession of Leo VI's brother Alexander to the throne on 11 May 912, Nicholas I was restored to the patriarchate. A protracted struggle with the supporters of Euthymius I followed, which did not end until the new Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos promulgated the \"Tomos of Union\" in 920. In the meantime, Alexander had died in 913 after provoking a war with Bulgaria, and the underage Constantine VII succeeded to the throne. Nicholas Mystikos became the leading member of the seven-man regency for the young emperor, and as such had to face the advance of Simeon I of Bulgaria on Constantinople. Nicholas I negotiated a peaceful settlement, crowned Simeon emperor of the Bulgarians in a makeshift ceremony outside Constantinople, and arranged for the marriage of Simeon's daughter to Constantine VII.\nThis unpopular concession undermined his position, and by March 914, with the support of the \"magistros\" John Eladas, Zoe Karbonopsina overthrew Nicholas I and replaced him as foremost regent. She revoked the agreement with Simeon I, prompting the renewal of hostilities with Bulgaria. With her main supporter Leo Phokas the Elder crushingly defeated by the Bulgarians at the battle of Achelous in 917, Zoe started to lose ground. Embarrassed by further failures, she and her supporters were supplanted in 919 by the admiral Romanos Lekapenos, who married his daughter Helena Lekapene to Constantine VII and finally advanced to the imperial throne in 920. The Patriarch Nicholas I came to be one of the strongest supporters of the new emperor and took the brunt of renewed negotiations with the Bulgarians until his death in 925.\nIn addition to his numerous letters to various notables and foreign rulers (including Simeon I of Bulgaria), Nicholas Mystikos wrote a homily on the sack of Thessalonica by the Arabs in 904. He was a critical thinker who went as far as to question the authority of Old Testament quotations and the notion that the emperor's command was unwritten law.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Romanos I planned to make his son patriarch as soon as Patriarch Nicholas I died in 925, but two minor patriarchates and a two-year vacancy passed before Theophylact was considered old enough to discharge his duties as patriarch (as he was still only sixteen years old). At this time, or before, he was castrated to help his career in the church. Theophylact was the third patriarch of Constantinople to be the son of an emperor and the only one to have become patriarch during the reign of his father. His patriarchate of just over twenty-three years was unusually long, and his father had secured the support of Pope John XI for his elevation to the patriarchate. Apart from the bastard eunuch Basil Lekapenos, who was appointed \"parakoimomenos\", Theophylact was the only son of Romanos I to retain his high office after the family's fall from power in 945.\nTheophylact supported his father's policies and pursued ecclesiastical ecumenicism, keeping in close contact with the Greek patriarchates of Alexandria and Antioch. He sent missionaries to the Magyars, trying to help the efforts of imperial diplomacy in the late 940s. At about the same time, Theophylact advised his nephew-in-law Emperor Peter I of Bulgaria on the new Bogomil heresy. Theophylact introduced theatrical elements to the Byzantine liturgy, something which was not universally supported by the conservative clergy around him.\nTheophylact's detractors describe him as an irreverent man primarily interested in his huge stable of horses, who was ready to abandon the celebration of Divine Liturgy in the Hagia Sophia to be present at the foaling of his favorite mare. Theophylact died after falling from a horse in 956.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1885, he accepted the offer of a commission in the British Royal Engineers and trained in Chatham, England. In 1891 he transferred to the Welsh Regiment.\nEmin Pasha Relief Expedition.\nCaptain Stairs was appointed to the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition led by Henry Morton Stanley, at the time the most celebrated living explorer of Africa. Stairs sailed from London on 20 January 1887 and met Stanley in Suez on 6 February. Their expedition started from Banana at the mouth of the Congo River on 19 March and ended in Bagamoyo, Tanzania on 5 December 1889. Stairs was appointed second-in-command after Captain Barttelot was shot on 19 July 1888.\nDuring the 5000\u00a0km journey across Africa through some of its most difficult country consisting of almost impenetrable rainforest and swamps, Stairs and colleagues suffered frequently from malaria and dysentery. Stairs had endurance, toughness and perseverance. He discovered one source of the Nile, the Semliki River, and became the first non-African to ever climb in the Ruwenzoris, reaching 10,677\u00a0ft before having to turn around. He was seriously wounded in the chest by a poisonous arrow during an attack by natives. Stairs recovered from his wound to continue the journey. In Dublin, Ireland there is a bronze plaque depicting this 13 August 1887 event on the statue of expedition Surgeon Major Thomas Heazle Parke who removed the arrow and sucked the poison from the wound.\nThe expedition was lauded in Europe and North America for exploits seen as heroic. On his return to England Captain Stairs was named a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1890.\nHe described the population as \"unfortunate blacks who, very often, are incapable of managing their own affairs.\"\nThe Stairs Expedition to Katanga.\nIn 1891 on Stanley's recommendation, Stairs was appointed by King Leopold II of Belgium to command a mission to take Katanga also known as Garanganze with or without the consent of its powerful king, Msiri. Leopold had used Stanley's services before and agreed with his use of force and understood Stairs to be in the same mould, and he had a reputation for carrying out orders completely and without hesitation.\nThe Stairs Expedition was a military mission of 400 men under the Congo Free State flag, armed with 200 modern rifles. (Msiri's men had muzzle-loading muskets). Stairs ran a well-organised expedition and won the loyalty of his officers and chiefs (Zanzibari supervisors). It was smaller and lighter than his previous expedition, with only two other military officers. They were in a race against Cecil Rhodes' British South Africa Company expanding from the south, which had already sent two failed expeditions to Msiri. Stairs and Joseph Moloney, the expedition's British medical officer, were aware that they could potentially come into armed conflict with a British expedition, and agreed they would nevertheless discharge their duties to their employer, Leopold.\nThe Stairs Expedition became notorious for the fate of Msiri. After three days of negotiations without progress, Stairs gave Msiri an ultimatum to sign the treaty the next day, 20 December 1891. When Msiri did not appear, he sent his second-in-command, Captain Bodson to arrest Msiri, who stood his ground. Bodson shot him dead, and a fight broke out. The expedition took their wounded and Msiri's body back to their camp where Stairs was waiting, and there they cut off Msiri's head and hoisted it on a pole in plain view as a 'barbaric lesson' to his people. Some of the Garanganze were massacred by the expedition's askaris, and most of the rest fled into the bush.\nStairs handed over Msiri's body to his two brothers and an adopted son, Makanda Bantu, whom Stairs installed as chief to replace Msiri, and who signed the treaty acknowledging Leopold as sovereign. The two brothers refused to do so until Stairs sent Moloney to threaten them with the same fate as Msiri.\nOral histories of the Garanganze people say that the expedition kept Msiri's head \u2013 by some accounts in a can of kerosene \u2013 but it cursed and killed everyone who carried it and eventually, this included Stairs. He was ill with malaria throughout January 1892. After being relieved by another expedition, the Stairs Expedition set out on the long return journey to Zanzibar. Stairs was frequently sick but by May 1892 had recovered. On a steamer down the lower Zambezi he had another attack of malaria which killed him on 9 June 1892. He is buried in the European Cemetery in Chinde, Mozambique at the mouth of the Zambezi River.\nOnly 189 of the 400 men on the expedition made it back to Zanzibar, a year after they had left, most of the rest died and few deserted. Katanga became part of the Congo Free State, which was annexed by Belgium in 1908 after an international outcry over the killings, brutality and slavery by Leopold's regime. In the early 20th century as Katanga's mining industries developed, some British in Northern Rhodesia, representing the losers in the scramble for Katanga, thought of Stairs as a mercenary and traitor to the British Empire.\nCommemoration.\nCaptain Stairs is commemorated with three identical tablets (c. 1902) in the vestibule of Mackenzie Building at Royal Military College of Canada, St. George's Cathedral (Kingston, Ontario) and in Rochester Cathedral near Chatham, England.\nA collection of artefacts from his African expeditions are at Fort Frederick (Kingston) and some his diaries are preserved in the Public Archives of Nova Scotia; others are lost.\nStairs Island, Parry Sound, Ontario was named in his honour.\nBoth Stairs Street and Stairs Place in Halifax, Nova Scotia, bear his name.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe memorial in St. George's Cathedral, Kingston, was destroyed in the fire in 1899, and has not been replaced."}

He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics, and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. He shared the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics with Walther Bothe \"for his fundamental research in quantum mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function.\"\nBorn entered the University of Goettingen in 1904, where he met the three renowned mathematicians Felix Klein, David Hilbert, and Hermann Minkowski. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the subject of the stability of elastic wires and tapes, winning the university's Philosophy Faculty Prize. In 1905, he began researching special relativity with Minkowski, and subsequently wrote his habilitation thesis on the Thomson model of the atom. A chance meeting with Fritz Haber in Berlin in 1918 led to discussion of how an ionic compound is formed when a metal reacts with a halogen, which is now known as the Born\u2013Haber cycle.\nDuring World War I, Born was originally placed as a radio operator, but his specialist knowledge led to his being moved to research duties on sound ranging. In 1921 Born returned to G\u00f6ttingen, where he arranged another chair for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck. Under Born, G\u00f6ttingen became one of the world's foremost centres for physics. In 1925, Born and Werner Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. The following year, he formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for \u03c8*\u03c8 in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. \nHis influence extended far beyond his own research: Max Delbr\u00fcck, Siegfried Fl\u00fcgge, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Maria Goeppert Mayer, Lothar Nordheim, Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf all received their Ph.D. degrees under Born at G\u00f6ttingen, and his assistants included Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, Gerhard Herzberg, Friedrich Hund, Wolfgang Pauli, L\u00e9on Rosenfeld, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner.\nIn January 1933, when the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, Born, who was Jewish, was suspended from his professorship at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he took a job at St. John's College, Cambridge, and wrote a popular science book, \"The Restless Universe\", as well as \"Atomic Physics\", which soon became a standard textbook. In October 1936, he was appointed Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, where, working with German-born assistants E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs, he continued his research into physics. He became a naturalised British subject on 31 August 1939, one day before World War II broke out in Europe. He remained in Edinburgh until 1952, when he retired to Bad Pyrmont, West Germany, and died in a hospital in Goettingen on 5 January 1970.\nEducation.\nMax Born was born on 11 December 1882 in Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland), then located in the Kingdom of Prussia, into a family of Jewish descent. He was one of two children of anatomist and embryologist Gustav Jacob Born, who was Professor of Embryology at the University of Breslau, and Margarethe Gretchen Kauffmann, who came from a Silesian family of industrialists\u2014she died on 29 August 1886, when Max was four years old. He had a sister, K\u00e4the, who was born in 1884, and a half-brother, Wolfgang, from his father's second wife, Bertha Lipstein. Wolfgang later became Professor of Art History at the City College of New York.\nInitially educated at the in Breslau, Born entered the University of Breslau in 1901. The German university system allowed students to move easily from one university to another, so he spent summer semesters at the University of Heidelberg in 1902 and the University of Zurich in 1903. Fellow students at Breslau, Otto Toeplitz and Ernst Hellinger, told him about the University of Goettingen, and he went there in April 1904. At Goettingen he found three renowned mathematicians: Felix Klein, David Hilbert, and Hermann Minkowski. Very soon after his arrival, he formed close ties to the latter two men. From the first class he took with Hilbert, Hilbert identified him as having exceptional abilities and selected him as the lecture scribe, whose function was to write up the class notes for the students' mathematics reading room at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Being class scribe put him into regular, invaluable contact with Hilbert. Hilbert became his mentor after selecting him to be the first to hold the unpaid, semi-official position of assistant. Born's introduction to Minkowski came through his stepmother, Bertha, as she knew Minkowski from dancing classes in Koenigsberg. The introduction netted him invitations to the Minkowski household for Sunday dinners. In addition, while performing his duties as scribe and assistant, he often saw Minkowski at Hilbert's house.\nBorn's relationship with Felix Klein was more problematic. He attended a seminar conducted by Klein, Carl Runge, and Ludwig Prandtl on the subject of elasticity. Although not particularly interested in the subject, he was obliged to present a paper. He presented one in which, taking the simple case of a curved wire with both ends fixed, he used Hilbert's calculus of variations to determine the configuration that would minimise potential energy and therefore be the most stable. Klein was impressed, and invited him to submit a thesis on the subject of \"Stability of Elastica in a Plane and Space\" \u2013 a subject near and dear to Klein \u2013 which Klein had arranged to be the subject for the prestigious annual Philosophy Faculty Prize offered by the university. Entries could also qualify as doctoral dissertations. He responded by turning down the offer, as applied mathematics was not his preferred area of study. Klein was greatly offended.\nFelix Klein had the power to make or break academic careers, so Born felt compelled to atone by submitting an entry for the prize. Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his thesis advisor. Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, he developed the equations for the stability conditions. As he became more interested in the topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the rector announced that he had won the prize. A month later, he passed his oral examination and was awarded his Ph.D. in Mathematics with distinction.\nOn graduation, Born was obliged to perform his military service, which he had deferred while a student. He found himself drafted into the German Army, and posted to the 2nd Guards Dragoons \"Empress Alexandra of Russia\", which was stationed in Berlin. His service was brief, as he was discharged early after an asthma attack in January 1907. He then travelled to England, where he was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and studied physics for six months in the Cavendish Laboratory, under J. J. Thomson, George Searle, and Joseph Larmor. After he returned to Germany, the army reinducted him, and he served with the elite 1st (Silesian) Life Cuirassiers \"Great Elector\" until he was again medically discharged after just six weeks' service. He then returned to Breslau, where he worked under the supervision of Otto Lummer and Ernst Pringsheim, hoping to do his habilitation in physics. A minor accident involving Born's black body experiment, a ruptured cooling water hose, and a flooded laboratory, led to Lummer telling him that he would never become a physicist.\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein published his paper \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\" about special relativity. He was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated to discover that Hermann Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked him to return to G\u00f6ttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped him brush up on his matrix algebra so he could work with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had him speak on their behalf at the funeral.\nA few weeks later, Born attempted to present their results at a meeting of the G\u00f6ttingen Mathematics Society. He did not get far before he was publicly challenged by Felix Klein and Max Abraham, who rejected relativity, forcing him to terminate the lecture. However, David Hilbert and Carl Runge were interested in his work, and, after some discussion with him, they became convinced of the veracity of his results and persuaded him to give the lecture again. This time he was not interrupted, and Woldemar Voigt offered to sponsor his habilitation thesis. He subsequently published his talk as an article titled (The Theory of the Rigid Electron in the Kinematics of the Principle of Relativity), which introduced the concept of Born rigidity. On 23 October, he presented his habilitation lecture on the Thomson model of the atom.\nCareer and research.\nBerlin and Frankfurt.\nBorn settled in as a young academic at the University of Goettingen as a (unsalaried lecturer). In Goettingen, he stayed at a boarding house run by Sister Annie at 17, known as El BoKaReBo. The name was derived from the first letters of the last names of its boarders: \"El\" for Ella Philipson (a medical student), \"Bo\" for Born and Hans Bolza (a physics student), \"Ka\" for Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n (a ), and \"Re\" for Albrecht Renner (another medical student). A frequent visitor to the boarding house was Paul Peter Ewald, a doctoral student of Arnold Sommerfeld, on loan to Hilbert at Goettingen as a special assistant for physics. Richard Courant, a mathematician and , called these people the \"in group.\"\nIn 1912, Born met Hedwig (Hedi) Ehrenberg, the daughter of a Leipzig University law professor, and a friend of Carl Runge's daughter Iris. She was of Jewish background on her father's side, although he had become a practising Lutheran when he got married, as did his sister K\u00e4the. Despite never practising his religion, he refused to convert, and his wedding on 2 August 1913 was a garden ceremony. However, he was baptised as a Lutheran in March 1914 by the same pastor who had performed his wedding ceremony. Born regarded \"religious professions and churches as a matter of no importance.\" His decision to be baptised was made partly in deference to his wife, and partly due to his desire to assimilate into German society. The marriage produced three children: two daughters, Irene, born in 1914, and Margarethe (Gritli), born in 1915, and a son, Gustav, born in 1921. Through marriage, he is related to jurists Victor Ehrenberg, his father-in-law, and Rudolf von Jhering, his wife's maternal grandfather, as well as to philosopher and theologian Hans Ehrenberg, and is a great uncle of British comedian Ben Elton.\nBy the end of 1913, Born had published 27 papers, including important work on relativity and the dynamics of crystal lattices (3 with Theodore von Karman), which became a book. In 1914, he received a letter from Max Planck explaining that a new Chair of Theoretical Physics had been created at the University of Berlin. The chair had been offered to Max von Laue, but he had turned it down. Born accepted. The First World War was now raging. Soon after arriving in Berlin in 1915, he enlisted in an Army signals unit. In October, he joined the , the Army's Berlin-based artillery research and development organisation, under Rudolf Ladenburg, who had established a special unit dedicated to the new technology of sound ranging. In Berlin, he formed a lifelong friendship with Albert Einstein, who became a frequent visitor to Born's home. Within days of the armistice in November 1918, Planck had the Army release Born. A chance meeting with Fritz Haber that month led to discussion of the manner in which an ionic compound is formed when a metal reacts with a halogen, which is today known as the Born\u2013Haber cycle.\nEven before Born had taken up the chair in Berlin, Laue had changed his mind, and decided that he wanted it after all; he arranged with Born and the faculties concerned for them to exchange jobs. In April 1919, he became and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics on the science faculty at the University of Frankfurt am Main. While there, he was approached by the University of Goettingen, which was looking for a replacement for Peter Debye as Director of the Physical Institute. \"Theoretical physics,\" Einstein advised him, \"will flourish wherever \"you\" happen to be; there is no other Born to be found in Germany today.\" In negotiating for the position with the education ministry, Born arranged for another chair, of experimental physics, at Goettingen for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck.\nIn 1919, Elisabeth Bormann joined the Institute for Theoretical Physics as his assistant. She developed the first atomic beams. Working with Born, Bormann was the first to measure the free path of atoms in gases and the size of molecules.\nGoettingen.\nFor the 12 years Born and Franck were at the University of Goettingen (1921\u20131933), Born had a collaborator with shared views on basic scientific concepts\u2014a benefit for teaching and research. His collaborative approach with experimental physicists was similar to that of Arnold Sommerfeld at the University of Munich, who was Ordinarius Professor of Theoretical Physics and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics\u2014also a prime mover in the development of quantum theory. Born and Sommerfeld collaborated with experimental physicists to test and advance their theories. In 1922, when lecturing in the United States at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Sommerfeld sent his student Werner Heisenberg to be Born's assistant. Heisenberg returned to Goettingen in 1923, where he completed his habilitation under Born in 1924, and became a there.\nIn 1919 and 1920, Born became displeased about the large number of objections against Einstein's relativity, and gave speeches in the winter of 1919 in support of Einstein. He received pay for his relativity speeches which helped with expenses through the year of rapid inflation. The speeches in the German language became a book published in 1920 of which Einstein received the proofs before publication. A third edition was published in 1922 and an English translation was published in 1924. He represented light speed as a function of curvature, \"the velocity of light is much greater for some directions of the light ray than its ordinary value c, and other bodies can also attain much greater velocities.\"\nIn 1925, Born and Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper titled (Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations) to review, and submit for publication. In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes corresponding to the initial and final states. When Born read the paper, he recognised the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University.\nUp until this time, matrices were seldom used by physicists; they were considered to belong to the realm of pure mathematics. Gustav Mie had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912, and Born had used them in his work on the lattices theory of crystals in 1921. While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. With the help of his assistant and former student Pascual Jordan, he began immediately to make a transcription and extension, and they submitted their results for publication; the paper was received for publication just 60 days after Heisenberg's paper. A follow-on paper was submitted for publication before the end of the year by all three authors. The result was a surprising formulation:\nformula_1\nwhere \"p\" and \"q\" were matrices for location and momentum, and \"I\" is the identity matrix. The left hand side of the equation is not zero because matrix multiplication is not commutative. This formulation was entirely attributable to Born, who also established that all the elements not on the diagonal of the matrix were zero. Born considered that his paper with Jordan contained \"the most important principles of quantum mechanics including its extension to electrodynamics.\" The paper put Heisenberg's approach on a solid mathematical basis.\nBorn was surprised to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon, Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This had a great deal of appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. He would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for \u03c8*\u03c8 in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which he published in July 1926.\nIn a letter to Born on 4 December 1926, Einstein made his famous remark regarding quantum mechanics: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the 'old one'. I, at any rate, am convinced that \"He\" is not playing at dice.\nThis quotation is often paraphrased as \"God does not play dice\".\nIn 1928, Einstein nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics, but Heisenberg alone won the 1932 Prize \"for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen,\" while Schr\u00f6dinger and Dirac shared the 1933 Prize \"for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory.\" On 25 November 1933, Born received a letter from Heisenberg in which he said he had been delayed in writing due to a \"bad conscience\" that he alone had received the Prize \"for work done in G\u00f6ttingen in collaboration\u2014you, Jordan and I.\" Heisenberg went on to say that Born and Jordan's contribution to quantum mechanics cannot be changed by \"a wrong decision from the outside.\" In 1954, Heisenberg wrote an article honouring Planck for his insight in 1900, in which he credited Born and Jordan for the final mathematical formulation of matrix mechanics and Heisenberg went on to stress how great their contributions were to quantum mechanics, which were not \"adequately acknowledged in the public eye.\"\nThose who received their Ph.D. degrees under Born at Goettingen included Max Delbr\u00fcck, Siegfried Fl\u00fcgge, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim, Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf. Born's assistants at the University of G\u00f6ttingen's Institute for Theoretical Physics included Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, Gerhard Herzberg, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, L\u00e9on Rosenfeld, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner. Walter Heitler became an assistant to Born in 1928, and completed his habilitation under him in 1929. Born not only recognised talent to work with him, but he \"let his superstars stretch past him; to those less gifted, he patiently handed out respectable but doable assignments.\" Delbr\u00fcck, and Goeppert-Mayer went on to be awarded Nobel Prizes.\nLater life.\nIn January 1933, the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. In May, Born became one of six Jewish professors at Goettingen who were suspended with pay; Franck had already resigned. In twelve years, they had built Goettingen into one of the world's foremost centres for physics. Born began looking for a new job, writing to Maria Goeppert Mayer at Johns Hopkins University and Rudi Ladenburg at Princeton University. He accepted an offer from St. John's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he wrote a popular science book, \"The Restless Universe\", and a textbook, \"Atomic Physics\", that soon became a standard text, going through seven editions. His family soon settled into life in England, with his daughters Irene and Gritli becoming engaged to Welshman Brinley (Bryn) Newton-John and Englishman Maurice Pryce respectively. Born's granddaughter Olivia Newton-John was the daughter of Irene.\nBorn's position at Cambridge was only a temporary one, and his tenure at Goettingen was terminated in May 1935. He therefore accepted an offer from C. V. Raman to go to Bangalore in 1935. Born considered taking a permanent position there, but the Indian Institute of Science did not create an additional chair for him. In November 1935, the Born family had their German citizenship revoked, rendering them stateless. A few weeks later Goettingen cancelled Born's doctorate. Born considered an offer from Pyotr Kapitsa in Moscow, and started taking Russian lessons from Rudolf Peierls's Russian-born wife Genia. But then Charles Galton Darwin asked Born if he would consider becoming his successor as Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, an offer that Born promptly accepted, assuming the chair in October 1936.\nIn Edinburgh, Born promoted the teaching of mathematical physics. He had two German assistants, E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs, and one Scottish assistant, Robert Schlapp, and together they continued to investigate the mysterious behaviour of electrons. Born became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1937, and of the Royal Society of London in March 1939. During 1939, he got as many of his remaining friends and relatives still in Germany as he could out of the country, including his sister K\u00e4the, in-laws Kurt and Marga, and the daughters of his friend Heinrich Rausch von Traubenberg. Hedi ran a domestic bureau, placing young Jewish women in jobs. Born received his certificate of naturalisation as a British subject on 31 August 1939, one day before the Second World War broke out in Europe.\nBorn remained at Edinburgh until he reached the retirement age of 70 in 1952. He retired to Bad Pyrmont, in West Germany, in 1954. In October, he received word that he was being awarded the Nobel Prize. His fellow physicists had never stopped nominating him. Franck and Fermi had nominated him in 1947 and 1948 for his work on crystal lattices, and over the years, he had also been nominated for his work on solid state physics, quantum mechanics and other topics. In 1954, he received the prize for \"fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function\"\u2014something that he had worked on alone. In his Nobel lecture he reflected on the philosophical implications of his work:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I believe that ideas such as absolute certitude, absolute exactness, final truth, etc. are figments of the imagination which should not be admissible in any field of science. On the other hand, any assertion of probability is either right or wrong from the standpoint of the theory on which it is based. This loosening of thinking (\"Lockerung des Denkens\") seems to me to be the greatest blessing which modern science has given to us. For the belief in a single truth and in being the possessor thereof is the root cause of all evil in the world.\nIn retirement, he continued scientific work, and produced new editions of his books. In 1955 he became one of signatories to the Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto. He died at age 87 in hospital in G\u00f6ttingen on 5 January 1970, and is buried in the \"Stadtfriedhof\" there, in the same cemetery as Walther Nernst, Wilhelm Weber, Max von Laue, Otto Hahn, Max Planck, and David Hilbert.\nGlobal policy.\nHe was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.\nFamily.\nBorn's wife Hedwig (Hedi) Martha Ehrenberg (1891\u20131972) was a daughter of the jurist Victor Ehrenberg and Elise von Jhering (a daughter of the jurist Rudolf von Jhering). Born was survived by his wife Hedi and their children Irene, Gritli and Gustav. Singer and actress Olivia Newton-John was a daughter of Irene (1914\u20132003), while Gustav is the father of musician and academic Georgina Born and actor Max Born (\"Fellini Satyricon\") who are thus also Max's grandchildren. His great-grandchildren include songwriter Brett Goldsmith, singer Tottie Goldsmith, racing car driver Emerson Newton-John, and singer Chloe Rose Lattanzi. Born helped his nephew, architect, Otto K\u00f6nigsberger (1908\u20131999) obtain commission in the Mysore State.\nBibliography.\nDuring his life, Born wrote several semi-popular and technical books. His volumes on topics like atomic physics and optics were very well received. They are considered classics in their fields, and are still in print. The following is a chronological listing of his major works:\nFor a full list of his published papers, see http:// .

{"id": "61867", "revid": "1870048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61867", "title": "Trombe wall", "text": "Passive solar building\nA Trombe wall is a massive equator-facing wall that is painted a dark color in order to absorb thermal energy from incident sunlight and covered with a glass on the outside with an insulating air-gap between the wall and the glaze. A Trombe wall is a passive solar building design strategy that adopts the concept of indirect-gain, where sunlight first strikes a solar energy collection surface in contact with a thermal mass of air. The sunlight absorbed by the mass is converted to thermal energy (heat) and then transferred into the living space.\nTrombe walls may also be referred to as a mass wall, solar wall, or thermal storage wall. However, due to the extensive work of professor and architect F\u00e9lix Trombe in the design of passively heated and cooled solar structure, they are often called Trombe Walls.\nThis system is similar to the air heater (as a simple glazed box on the south wall with a dark absorber, air space, and two sets of vents at top and bottom) created by professor Edward S. Morse a hundred years ago.\nHistory of passive solar systems and evolution of Trombe walls.\nIn 1920s, the idea of solar heating began in Europe. In Germany, housing projects were designed to take advantage of the sun. The research and accumulated solar design experience was then spread across the Atlantic by architects such as Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Apart from these early examples, heating homes with the sun made slow progress until the 1930s, when several different American architects started to explore the potential of solar heating. The pioneering work of these American architects, the influence of immigrant Europeans, and the memory of wartime fuel shortages made solar heating very popular during the initial housing boom at the end of World War II.\nLater in the 1970s, before and after the international oil crisis of 1973, some European architectural periodicals were critical of standard construction methods and architecture of the time. They described how architects and engineers reacted to the crisis, proposing new techniques and projects in order to intervene innovatively in the built environment, using energy and natural resources more efficiently.\nMoreover, the depletion of natural resources generated interest in renewable energy sources, such as solar energy. \nParallel to global population growth, energy consumption and environmental issues have become a global concern - especially while the building sector is consuming the highest energy in the world and most of the energy is used for heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.\nFor these reasons, today's buildings are expected to achieve both energy efficiency and environmental-friendly design through the use of renewable energy partly or completely instead of fossil energy for heating and cooling. In this direction, the integration of passive solar systems in buildings is one strategy for sustainable development and increasingly encouraged by international regulations.\nToday's low-energy buildings with Trombe walls often improve on an ancient technique that incorporates a thermal storage and delivery system people have already used: thick walls of adobe or stone to trap the sun's heat during the day and release it slowly and evenly at night to heat their building. Today, the Trombe wall continues to serve as an effective strategy of passive solar design.\nThe first well-known example of a Trombe wall system was used in the Trombe house of Odeillo, France in 1967. The black painted wall is constructed of approximately 2 foot thick concrete with an air space and a double glazing on its exterior side. The house is primarily heated by radiation and convection from the inner surface of the concrete wall and the results from studies show that 70% of this building's yearly heating needs are supplied by solar energy. Therefore, the efficiency of the system is comparable to a good active solar heating system. PV, Photovoltaic for electrical production converts 15%-20% radiation to energy. Meaning its energy efficiency is low - 85% of the sun's radiation is lost. Whereas the solar thermal collector, Trombe Wall is able to convert 70%-80% of the suns radiation to heat, meaning, it is far more energy efficient and its heat production is powerful.\nAnother passive collector-distributor Trombe Wall system was built in 1970, in Montmedy, France. The house with living space required 7000 kWh for space heating annually. At Montmedy-between 49\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 North latitude-5400 kWh were supplied by solar heating and the remainder from an auxiliary electrical system. The annual heating cost for electricity was approximately $225 when compared to an estimated $750 for a home entirely heated by electricity in the same area. This yields to a 77% reduction in heating load and a 70% reduction in the cost for winter heating requirements.\nIn 1974, the first example of Trombe wall system was used in the Kelbaugh House in Princeton, New Jersey. The house is located along the northern boundary of the site to maximize the unshaded access to available sunlight. The two-story building has of thermal storage wall which is constructed of concrete and painted with a selective black paint over a masonry sealer. Although the main heating is accomplished by radiation and convection from the inner face of the wall, two vents in the wall also allow daytime heating by the natural convection loop. According to data collected in the winters of 1975-1976 and 1976\u20131977, the Trombe wall system reduced the heating costs respectively by 76% and 84%.\nHow Trombe walls work.\nUnlike an active solar system that employs hardware and mechanical equipment to collect or transport heat, a Trombe wall is a passive solar-heating system where the thermal energy flows in the system by natural means such as radiation, conduction, and natural convection. As a consequence, the wall works by absorbing sunlight on its outer face and then transferring this heat through the wall by conduction. Heat conducted through the wall is then distributed to the living space by radiation, and to some degree by convection, from the wall's inner surface.\nThe greenhouse effect helps this system by trapping the solar radiation between the glazing and the thermal mass. Heat from the sun, in the form of shorter-wavelength radiation, passes through the glazing largely unimpeded. When this radiation strikes the dark colored surface of the thermal mass facing the sun, the energy is absorbed and then re-emitted in the form of longer-wavelength radiation that cannot pass through the glazing as readily. Hence heat becomes trapped and builds up in the air space between the high heat capacity thermal mass and the glazing that faces the sun.\nAnother phenomenon that plays a role in the Trombe wall's operation is the time lag caused by the heat capacity of the materials. Since Trombe walls are quite thick and made of high heat capacity materials, the heat-flow from the warmer outer surface to the cooler inner surface is slower than other materials with less heat capacity. This delayed heat-flow phenomenon is known as time lag and it causes the heat gained during the day to reach the interior surface of the thermal mass later. This property of the mass helps to heat the living space in the evenings as well. So, if there is enough mass, the wall can act as a radiant heater all night long. On the other hand, if the mass is too thick, it takes too long to transmit the thermal energy it collects, thus, the living space does not receive enough heat during the evening hours when it is needed the most. Likewise, if the thermal mass is too thin, it transmits the heat too quickly, resulting in overheating of the living space during the day and little energy left for the evening. Also, Trombe walls using water as a thermal mass collect and distribute heat to a space in the same way, but they transfer the heat through the wall components (tubes, bottles, barrels, drums, etc.) by convection rather than by conduction and the convection performance of the water walls differs according to their different heat capacities. Larger storage volumes provide a greater and longer-term heat storage capacity, while smaller contained volumes provide greater heat exchange surfaces and thus faster distribution.\nDesign and construction.\nTrombe walls are often designed to serve as a load-bearing function as well as to collect and store the sun's energy and to help enclose the building's interior spaces. The requirements of a Trombe Wall are glazing areas faced toward the equator for maximum winter solar gain and a thermal mass, located 4 inches or more directly behind the glass, which serves for heat storage and distribution. Also, there are many factors, such as color, thickness, or additional thermal control devices that have an impact on the design and the effectiveness of Trombe Walls. Equatorial, which is Southward in the Northern Hemisphere and Northward in the Southern Hemisphere, is the best rotation for passive solar strategies because they collect much more sun during the day than they lose during the night, and collect much more sun in the winter than in the summer.\nThe first design strategy to increase the effectiveness of Trombe Walls is painting the outside surface of the wall to black (or a dark color) for the best possible absorption of sunlight. Moreover, a selective coating to a Trombe wall improves its performance by reducing the amount of infrared energy radiated back through the glass. The selective surface consists of a sheet of metal foil glued to the outside surface of the wall and it absorbs almost all the radiation in the visible portion of the solar spectrum and emits very little in the infrared range. High absorbency turns the sunlight into heat at the wall's surface, and low emittance prevents the heat from radiating back towards the glass.\nAlthough the Trombe walls are usually made of solid materials, such as concrete, brick, stone, or adobe, they can also be made of water. The advantage of using water as a thermal mass is that water stores considerably more heat per volume (has a greater heat capacity) than masonry. The developer of this water wall, Steve Baer, names this system \u201cDrum Wall\u201d. He painted the steel containers similar to oil drums and filled them almost full of water, leaving some room for the thermal expansion. Then stacked the containers horizontally behind an equator-facing double glazing with the blackened bottoms facing outside. This water wall involves the same principles as the Trombe walls but employs a different storage material and different methods of containing that material. Like the dark colored thermal mass of the Trombe walls, the containers that store the water are also frequently painted with dark colors to increase their absorptivity, but it is also common to leave them transparent or translucent to allow some daylight to pass through.\nAnother critical part of Trombe wall design is choosing the proper thermal mass material and thickness. The optimum thickness of the thermal mass is dependent on the heat capacity and the thermal conductivity of the material used. There are some rules to follow while sizing the thermal mass.\nThe optimum thickness of a masonry wall increases as the thermal conductivity of the wall material increases. For instance, to compensate for a rapid heat transfer through a highly conductive material, the wall needs to be thicker.\nAccordingly, since the thicker wall absorbs and stores more heat to use at night, the efficiency of the wall increases as the conductivity and thickness of the wall increase.\nThere is an optimum thickness range for the masonry materials.\nThe efficiency of the water wall increases as the thickness of the wall increases. However, it is hard to notice a considerable performance increase as the walls get thicker than 6 inches. Likely, a water wall thinner than 6 inches is also not enough to act as a proper thermal mass that stores the heat during the day.\nIn the early Trombe wall design, there are vents on the walls to distribute the heat by natural convection (thermocirculation) from the exterior face of the wall, but only during the daytime and early evening. Solar radiation passing through the glass is absorbed by the wall heating its surface to temperature as high as . This heat is transferred to the air in the air space between the wall and the glass. Through openings or vents located at the top of the wall, warm air rising in the air space enters the room while simultaneously drawing cool room air through the low vents in the wall. In this way additional heat can be supplied to the living space during periods of sunny weather. However, it is now clear that the vents do not work well in either summer or winter. It becomes more common to design a half Trombe Wall then combine it with a direct gain system. The direct gain part delivers heat early in the day while the Trombe wall stores heat for the nighttime use. Moreover, unlike a full Trombe wall, the direct gain part allows views and the delight of winter sunshine.\nTo minimize the possible drawbacks of the Trombe wall system, there are additional thermal control strategies to employ to the wall design. For instance, the minimum 4-inch distance between the glass and the mass allows cleaning the glazing and the insertion of a roll-down radiant barrier as needed. Adding a radiant barrier or night insulation between the glazing and the thermal mass reduces nighttime heat losses and summer daytime heat gains. However, to prevent overheating in summers, combining this strategy with an outdoor shading device like shutter, a roof overhang, or an interior shading to block excessive solar radiation from heating the Trombe wall would be the best. Another strategy helps to benefit from the solar collection without some of the drawbacks of the Trombe walls is to use exterior mirror-like reflectors. The additional reflected area helps Trombe walls to benefit more from the sunlight with the flexibility of removing or rotating the reflector device if the solar collection is undesired.\nWhen three different Trombe wall facades with single glass, double glass, and an integrated semi-transparent PV module are compared in hot and humid climate, the single glass provides the highest solar radiation gain due to its higher solar heat gain efficiency. However, it is recommended to use the single glass with a shutter for the evening and night times, to offset its heat losses. High transmission glazing maximizes solar gains of the Trombe wall while allowing to recognize the dark brick, natural stones, water containers, or another attractive thermal mass system behind the glazing as well. However, from an aesthetics perspective, sometimes it is not desirable to distinguish the black thermal mass. As an architectural detail, patterned glass can be used to limit the exterior visibility of the dark wall without sacrificing transmissivity.\nThe largest Trombe wall in the Northeastern United States is located in NJIT\u2019s Mechanical Engineering Building, at 200 Central Avenue, Newark, NJ.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nMitigating design variations.\nThe Kachadorian floor overcomes the disadvantages of the Trombe wall by orienting it horizontally instead of vertically. The Barra system combines actual Trombe walls with a ventilated slab like the Kachadorian floor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The genus name \"Thiomargarita\" means \"sulfur pearl.\" This refers to the cells' appearance as they contain microscopic elemental sulfur granules just below the cell wall that refract light creating a pearly iridescent luster. The cells are each covered in a mucus sheath aligned in a chain, resembling loose strings of pearls. The species name \"namibiensis\" means \"of Namibia\". \nIt is the second largest bacterium ever discovered, at in diameter on average, but can attain up to , making it large enough to be visible to the naked eye. \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" is nonpathogenic. \n\"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" is categorized as a mesophile because it prefers moderate temperatures, which typically range between 20-45 degrees Celsius. The organism shows neutrophilic characteristics by favoring environments with neutral pH levels like 6.5-7.5.\nDiscovery.\nThe species \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" was collected in 1997 and discovered in 1999 by Heide N. Schulz and her colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology. It was discovered in coastal sediments on the Namibian coast of West Africa. Schulz and her colleagues were off the coast of Namibia in search of \"Beggiatoa\" and \"Thioploca\", two microbes which had previously been discovered off the South American Pacific coast in 1842 and 1906, respectively. They chose to conduct further research off the Namibian coast due to the similar hydrography of these coasts; both have strong and deep ocean currents which can stir-up various nutrients for the deep sea organisms to feast. Schulz's team found small quantities of \"Beggiatoa\" and \"Thioploca\" in sediment samples, but large quantities of the previously undiscovered \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\". Researchers suggested the species be named \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\", which means \"sulfur pearl of Namibia\", which was fitting as the bacteria appeared a blue-green, white color, as well as spheres strung together. The previously largest known bacterium was \"Epulopiscium fishelsoni\", at 0.5 mm long. The current largest known bacterium is \"Thiomargarita magnifica,\" described in 2022, at an average length of 10\u00a0mm.\nIn 2002 a strain exhibiting 99% identity with \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" was found in sediment cores taken from the Gulf of Mexico during a research expedition. This similar strain either occurs in single cells or clusters of 2, 4, and 8 cells, as opposed to the Namibian strain which occurs in single chains of cells separated by a thin mucus sheath.\nOccurrence.\n\"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" was found in the continental shelf off the coast of Namibia, an area with high plankton productivity and low oxygen concentrations between 0-3 \u03bcM, and nitrate concentrations of 5-28 \u03bcM. \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" is most prevalent in the Walvis Bay area at 300 feet deep, but they are distributed along the coast of Namibia from Palgrave Point to L\u00fcderitzbucht. \"T. namibiensis\" is not found across the entire shelf, it is only found within a specific sediment type, diatomaceous mud, which is composed mainly of dead diatoms. Diatomaceous mud has high sulfate reduction rates and high levels of organic material. The most bacteria were obtained from the upper 3cm of sediment in the sample, with concentrations decreasing exponentially past this point. Here, \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" is easily suspended in moving ocean currents due to the sheath around the cells, which makes it easy for the bacteria to passively float. In this section of sediment, there were sulfide concentrations of 100-800 \u03bcM.\nAlthough previously undiscovered, \"T. namibiensis\" is not uncommon in its environment. It is by far the most common benthos bacterium of the Namibian shelf, comprising almost 0.8% of the sediment volume. About 8% of the shelf with diatomaceous mud has free gases are present in shallow depths. When the gas is released from the sediment, sulfide is released into the water column. \"T. namibiensis\" is more prevalent in areas with free gas, suggesting that the presence of suspended sulfide is beneficial to the bacteria. \"T. namibiensis\" will oxidize the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from the sediment into sulfur and sulfide, thus allowing less sulfide into the water column and detoxifying the water. However, the supply of sulfide produced by the underlying sediment can be too much for the cell to oxidize all of it, and sulfide still enters the water column. The Namibian coastal environmental experiences strong upwelling, resulting in low oxygen levels with large amounts of plankton. The lower waters lack oxygen due to the multitude of microorganisms releasing carbon dioxide while they perform heterotrophic respiration to generate energy.\nSince the \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" are immobile, they are unable to seek a more ideal environment when sulfide and nitrate levels are low in this environment. They simply remain in position and wait for levels to increase once again so that they can undergo respiration and other processes. This is possible because \"T. namibiensis\" have the ability to store large supplies of sulfur and nitrate. The organism also has a direct impact on its environment. Apatite, a mineral high in phosphorite, is correlated with the abundance of \"T. namibiensis\" through phosphogenesis. Internal polyphosphate and nitrate are used as external electron acceptors in the presence of acetate, releasing enough phosphate to cause precipitation. While the amount directly created by \"T. namibiensis\" cannot be calculated, it is a significant contribution to the large amounts of hydroxyapatite in solid-phase shelf sediment. The Mexican strain was primarily found in the top centimeter of sediment sampled from cold seeps in the Gulf of Mexico. The top 3cm of sediment from the Gulf of Mexico locations contained sulfide concentrations of 200-1900 \u03bcM.\nPhysiology.\nMorphology.\nAlthough \"Thiomargarita\" are closely related to \"Thioploca\" and \"Beggiatoa\" in function, their structures are different. \"Thioploca\" and \"Beggiatoa\" cells are much smaller and grow tightly stacked on each other in long filaments. Their shape is necessary for them to shuttle down into the ocean sediments to find more sulfide and nitrate. In contrast, \"Thiomargarita\" grow in rows of separate single spherical cells, so they lack the range of motility that \"Thioploca\" and \"Beggiota\" have. \"Thiomargarita\" can also grow in barrel-like shapes. The cocci shaped \"Thiomargarita\" can join together to create chains of 4-20 cells, while the bacillus shaped \"Thiomargarita\" can form chains of more than 50 cells. These chains are not linked together by filaments, but connected by a mucus sheath. Each cell appears reflective and white as a result of their sulfur content.\nScientists did not previously believe these large bacteria could exist because bacteria rely on chemiosmosis and cellular transport processes across their membranes to make ATP. As the cell size increases, they make proportionately less ATP, thus energy production limits their size. \"Thiomargarita\" are an exception to this size constraint, as their cytoplasm forms along the periphery of the cell, while the nitrate-storing vacuoles occupy the center of the cell. These vacuoles make up most of the cell. As these vacuoles swell, the cell grows considerably which is the primary factor contributing to the record sizes of \"Thiomargarita\" cells. \"T.\" \"namibiensis\" holds the record for the world's second largest bacterium, with a volume three million times more than that of average bacteria.\nMotility.\nWith their lack of movement, \"Thiomargarita\" have adapted by evolving the very large nitrate-storing bubbles vacuoles, allowing them to survive long periods of nitrate and sulfide starvation. Studies have shown that although there are no present motility features, the individual spherical cells can move slightly in a \"slow jerky rolling motion,\" but this does not give them the range of motion traditional motility features would. Other large sulfur bacteria found in the same sediment samples as \"T. namibiensis\" with different structures, such as \"Thioploca\" and \"Beggiota,\" have gliding motility. However, \"Thiomargarita\" cells do not have gliding motility due to their shape. The vacuoles give \"T. namibiensis\" cells the ability to stay immobile, waiting for nitrate-rich waters to sweep over them once again. These vacuoles are what account for the size that scientists had previously thought impossible, and account for roughly 98% of the cell volume. Because of the vast size of the liquid central vacuole, the cytoplasm separating the vacuole and the cell membrane is a very thin layer reported to be around 0.5-2 micrometers thick. This cytoplasm, however, is non-homogenous. The cytoplasm contains small bubbles of sulfur, polyphosphate, and glycogen. These bubbles give the cytoplasm a \"sponge-like\" resemblance.\nAs areas of nitrate and hydrogen sulfide do not mix together and \"T. namibiensis\" cells are immobile, the storage vacuoles in the cell provide a solution to this problem. Because of these storage vacuoles, cells are able to stay viable without growing (or dividing), with low relative amounts of cellular protein, and large amounts of nitrogen in the vacuoles. The storage vacuoles provide a novel solution which allows cells to wait for changing conditions while staying alive. These vacuoles are packed with sulfur granules that can be used for energy and contribute to their chemolithotrophic metabolism. The vacuoles of \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" contribute to their gigantism, allowing them to store nutrients for asexual reproduction of their complex genome.\nSize Adaption.\nBacteria, on average, are significantly smaller in size than \"Thiomargarita namibiensis.\" The smaller the size of a cell, the quicker it can reproduce and diffuse nutrients, and the higher the likelihood the biomolecule will almost immediately reach its site of activity. Despite the large size of \"T. namibiensis,\" its primary mechanism for nutrient uptake is still through normal diffusion. \"T. namibiensis\" can perform normal diffusion due to the reduced amount of cytoplasm as a result of its large vacuoles. These large central vacuoles, which act as reserves, are the source of the large size of \"T. namibiensis\". Because of its reserves, \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" can survive in its environment where nutrients are infrequently available. The reserves allow \"T. namibiensis\" to store the required nutrients to sustain the cell for extended periods of nutrient deficiency in its environment. Another adaptation advanced by the large size of \"T. namibiensis\" is its ability to survive without growing. Collected and stored sediment samples were found to have surviving \"T. namibiensis\" cells after over two years. The cells had no access to any added sulfide or nitrate during this time. In the surviving cells, there was a notable size decrease. To survive without growing the cells depended on the nutrient stores of the central vacuoles. The consistent reliance on the nutrient stores without replenishment caused the cells to lose size; however, the cells were able to continue surviving. The displayed durability of these cells reveals the impressive functionality of the large vacuoles in \"T. namibiensis\" cells. The storage capacity of these vacuoles can allow \"T. namibiensis\" cells to survive for prolonged lengths of time without access to nutrients.\nMetabolism.\n\"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" is chemolithotrophic and is capable of using nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. Chemo refers to the way the microbe obtains its energy, which is done by using oxidation-reduction reactions of compounds. Litho defines an organism's way of getting energy, which is done by using inorganic molecules as a source of electrons. This would be useful in an environment deficient in nutrients, such as soil or in an area with lots of sulfur. The final part of this metabolism characterization is how the bacterium obtains carbon, which in this case is done so in an autotrophic way. This means the organism uses carbon dioxide (CO2) from its environment as a carbon source and then synthesizes organic compounds from it. \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" uses what is known as the reverse or reductive TCA cycle to convert CO2 into usable energy. This adaptation shows how the bacterium has learned to survive in specific environments where usual metabolic pathways might not work well enough. There is still much unknown about the metabolism and phylogeny of the sulfur bacteria.\nThe bacterium is facultatively anaerobic rather than obligately anaerobic, and thus capable of respiring with oxygen if it is plentiful and without oxygen when it is minimal or absent. While not much is known about the exact metabolism the bacterium performs, it is known to exist in environments of high sulfur and little to no oxygen present. This bacterium often uses anaerobic respiration due to its environment not supplying ample oxygen. \nSulfur oxidation is the main energy source for \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\". Sulfide is the electron donor for this bacterium. \"T. namibiensis\" will oxidize hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into elemental sulfur (S). This is deposited as granules in its periplasm. Nitrate is the electron acceptor in this oxidation-reduction reaction. Large amounts of nitrogen must be stored as a terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. The large vacuole mainly stores nitrate for sulfur oxidation. Because of this and the organism's size, large amounts of sulfur are required which are stored as cyclooctasulfur. Both sulfide and nitrate are essential to the function of energy production in this bacterium.\nStudies show that in some cases \"T. namibiensis\" can use oxygen as the electron acceptor in the oxidation of sulfur. However, this bacterium is predominantly located in environments of very minimal to no oxygen availability; therefore, nitrate will be the standard electron acceptor for the oxidation-reduction reaction. However, when oxygen is available in its environment \"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" is able to utilize it as the electron acceptor in place of nitrate.\nWhile sulfide is available in the surrounding sediment, produced by other bacteria from dead microalgae that sank down to the sea bottom, the nitrate comes from the above seawater. Since the bacterium is sessile, and the concentration of available nitrate fluctuates considerably over time, it stores nitrate at high concentration (up to 0.8 molar) in a large vacuole, which is responsible for about 80% of its size. When nitrate concentrations in the environment are low, \"T. namibiensis\" uses the contents of its vacuole for respiration. \"T. namibiensis\" cells possess elevated nitrate concentrations giving them the capacity to absorb oxygen both when nitrate is present and when it is not. Thus, the presence of a central vacuole in its cells enables a prolonged survival in sulfidic sediments and nitrate starvation. This allows the bacteria cells to safely wait for shifts in environmental conditions. The non-motility of \"Thiomargarita\" cells is compensated by its large cellular size. This immobility suggests that they rely on shifting chemical conditions.\nCyclooctasulfur is stored in the globules of sulfur in the vacuoles of \"T. namibiensis\", aiding in their metabolism. After the oxidation of sulfide, \"T. namibiensis\" stores sulfur as cyclooctasulfur, the most thermodynamically stable form of sulfur at standard temperature and pressure. With these sulfur globules in the cell, the organism uses it as storage of elemental sulfur in usually anoxic conditions to reduce the toxicity of various sulfur compounds (can also survive in atmospheric oxygen conditions as it is not toxic). The sulfur globules are stored in the thin outer layer of the cytoplasm, presumably after their use as a source of electrons in the electron transport chain through oxidation of sulfide. The ability to oxidize hydrogen sulfide provides nutrients to other organisms living near it.\nReproduction.\n\"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" has an ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments due to stored nitrate and sulfur, which enables the cells to stay alive without reproducing. When the cells are unable to reproduce, most cells shorten to cocci or diplococcus arrangement. \"T. namibiensis\" reproduces mainly through binary fission. Reproduction of \"T. namibiensis\" occurs on a single plane; the cocci (a spherical bacterial cell) divide into a diplococcus or streptococcus arrangement. A diplococcus is a pair of cocci cells that can form chains, and streptococcus is a grape-like cluster of cells. In the case of \"T. namibiensis\", a diplococci structure is observed. Despite this, its cells remain connected, forming chains within a common mucus matrix. In addition to helping with essential functions including food exchange and cell-to-cell communication, this matrix can give the bacteria protection and structural support. During the process of binary fission, a single bacterial cell divides into two identical daughter cells, representing a comparatively basic form of asexual reproduction. The cells that make up the filamentous chain may then separate into smaller segments, and each of those segments may go on to produce a new filament. In a laboratory setting, the number of cells doubled over a period of 1 to 2 weeks when both nitrate and sulfide were available.\nGenome.\n\"Thiomargarita namibiensis\" has a distinct genetic architecture because of its remarkable cell size and environmental niche. The DNA of \"T. namibiensis\" is dispersed over nucleoid areas situated under the cell membrane, in contrast to normal bacteria, which have a concentrated nucleoid. This peripheral design provides efficient cellular activities by lowering the distance over which chemical signals and metabolites must travel despite the huge cell volume. A whole genome sequence of \"T. namibiensis\" is unavailable because it is difficult to culture and extract sufficient DNA. However, \"T. namibiensis\" is polyploid, which means many copies of the genome are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. This genetic redundancy helped its metabolic requirements and improved its capacity to repair damaged DNA by environmental stresses. \"T. namibiensis's\" genomic architecture is like that of other big bacteria, such as Epulopiscium fishelsoni. Both species have DNA distributed around the cell periphery to promote localized gene expression and effective cellular responses in big cells. This structure helps to overcome the constraints based on their size, allowing them to adapt quickly to environmental changes. The \"T. namibiensis\" genome is important because it is involved in biogeochemical cycles including sulfur and nitrogen cycling. \"T. namibiensis\" is found in sulfide-rich, oxygen-poor marine sediments because of its gene involved in sulfur oxidation and nitrate reduction. Single-cell genomic investigations revealed that it has identified genes that might provide adaptability to dynamic redox circumstances.\nSignificance.\n\"T. namibiensis\" plays a vital role in the sulfur and nitrogen cycles. In their sulfur rich environment, oxygen is scarcely available and cannot be used as an electron acceptor. In turn, \"T. namibiensis\" uses nitrate as the electron acceptor, which they consume at the sediment surface and condense in a vacuole. From this, they can oxidize the toxic hydrogen sulfide that inhabits the sediment into sulfide. Therefore, \"T. nambiensis\" acts as a detoxifier that removes poisonous gas from the water. This keeps the environment affable for fish and other marine living beings as well as providing sulfide, a crucial nutrient for marine organisms. These bacteria also play an essential role in the phosphorus cycle of the sediment. \"T. namibiensis\" can release phosphate in anoxic sediments at high rates which contribute to the spontaneous precipitation of phosphorus-containing material. This plays an important role in the removal of phosphorus in the biosphere.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Wood wrote and starred in dozens of sketches, plays, musicals, films and sitcoms over several decades, and her live comedy act was interspersed with her own compositions which she performed at the piano. Much of her humour was grounded in everyday life and included references to activities, attitudes and products that are considered to exemplify Britain. She was noted for her skills in observational comedy and in satirising aspects of social class.\nWood started her career in 1974 by appearing on, and winning, the ATV talent show \"New Faces\". She established herself as a comedy star in the 1980s, winning a BAFTA TV Award in 1986 for the sketch series \"\" (1985\u201387), and became one of Britain's most popular stand-up comics, winning a second BAFTA for \"An Audience with Victoria Wood\" (1988). In the 1990s, she wrote and co-starred in the television film \"Pat and Margaret\" (1994), and the sitcom \"dinnerladies\" (1998\u20132000), which she also produced. She won two more BAFTA TV Awards, including Best Actress, for her 2006 ITV1 television film, \"Housewife, 49\". Her frequent long-term collaborators included Julie Walters, Celia Imrie, Duncan Preston, and Anne Reid. In 2006, Wood came tenth in ITV's poll of the British public's 50 Greatest TV Stars.\nEarly life.\nVictoria Wood was the youngest child of Stanley and Ellen \"Nellie\" Wood (\"n\u00e9e\" Mape). Stanley worked as an insurance salesman, who also wrote songs for his company's Christmas parties, was the author of the musical play \"Clogs\" (based in a Lancashire village in 1887) and wrote part-time for \"Coronation Street\" and others. She had three siblings: a brother, Chris, and two sisters, Penny and Rosalind.\nWood was born in Prestwich and brought up in nearby Bury. She was educated at Fairfield County Primary School and Bury Grammar School for Girls, where she immediately found herself out of her depth.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; I was always top of the class, and when I went to grammar school I could not deal with everyone being as clever... I went under. I was a mess, a bit of a misfit. I didn't have any friends, let alone try to be funny...I didn't do any work, didn't have clean clothes and didn't wash. If I didn't have any money I'd steal from people, and if I hadn't done my homework I'd steal someone else's. I was envious of all the groups: the horsey group, the girls who went out with boys, the clever ones. Looking back, I feel really sorry for that little girl.\nWood developed eating disorders, but in 1968, her father gave her a piano for her 15th birthday. She later said of this unhappy time \"The good thing about being isolated is you get a good look at what goes on. I was reading, writing and working at the piano all the time. I was doing a lot of other things that helped me to perform.\" Later that year, she joined the Rochdale Youth Theatre Workshop, where she felt she was \"in the right place and knew what I was doing\" and she made an impression with her comic skill and skill in writing. She went on to study in the Department of Drama and Theatre Arts at the University of Birmingham.\nCareer.\n1970s.\nWood began her show business career while an undergraduate, appearing on the TV talent show \"New Faces\" in 1974. It led to an appearance in a sketch show featuring the series' winners \"The Summer Show\". A further break came as a novelty act on the BBC's consumer affairs programme \"That's Life!\" in 1976. She had met long-term collaborator Julie Walters in 1971, when Wood applied to the Manchester School of Theatre, then part of Manchester Polytechnic. Coincidentally the pair met again when they appeared in the same theatre revue \"In at the Death\" in 1978 (for which Wood wrote a brief sketch). Its success led to the commissioning of Wood's first play \"Talent\" (in 1978), starring Hazel Clyne (in a role originally written for Walters), for which Wood won an award for the Most Promising New Writer. Peter Eckersley, the head of drama at Granada Television, saw \"Talent\" and invited Wood to create a television adaptation. This time, Julie Walters took the lead role, while Wood reprised her stage role.\n1980\u20131988.\nThe success of the television version of \"Talent\" led to Wood writing the follow-up \"Nearly a Happy Ending\". Shortly afterwards she wrote a third play for Granada, \"Happy Since I Met You\", again with Walters alongside Duncan Preston as the male lead. In 1980 she wrote and starred in the stage play \"Good Fun\".\nRecognising her talent, Eckersley offered Wood a sketch show, although Wood was unsure of the project: she agreed to go ahead only if Walters received equal billing. Eckersley came up with an obvious title \u2013 \"Wood and Walters\", and the pilot episode was recorded. It led to a full series, featuring Duncan Preston and a supporting cast. In the period between the completion of the pilot and the shooting of the series, Eckersley died. Wood credited him with giving her her first big break, and felt that \"Wood and Walters\" suffered due to his death. She was not impressed by Brian Armstrong, his fill-in, and was of the opinion that he hired unsuitable supporting actors.\nWood appeared alongside \nPeter Llewellyn-Jones as an actor/presenter in Yorkshire Television's 1984 schools television programme for hearing-impaired children, \"Insight\" - a remake of the series originally presented by Derek Griffiths. In 1982 and 1983 she appeared as a panellist on BBC Radio 4's \"Just a Minute\".\nIn October 1983 Wood performed her first solo stand-up show, \"Lucky Bag\", in a five-week run at the King's Head Theatre in Islington. The show transferred to the Ambassadors Theatre for a 12-night run in February 1984. \"Lucky Bag\" went on a short UK tour in November and December 1984 and was also released as a live album recorded at the Edinburgh Festival in 1983.\nWood left Granada in 1984 for the BBC, which promised her more creative control over projects. Later that year her sketch show \"\" went into production. Wood chose the actors: her friend Julie Walters once again starred, as did Duncan Preston. Wood's friends Celia Imrie, Susie Blake and Patricia Routledge were in the cast. \"As Seen on TV\" featured the \"Acorn Antiques\" series of sketches, parodying the low-budget soap opera \"Crossroads\", and rumoured to be named after an antiques shop in her birthplace. \"Acorn Antiques\" is remembered for characters such as \"Mrs Overall\" (played by Walters), the deliberately bad camera angles and wobbling sets, and Celia Imrie's sarcastic tone as \"Miss Babs\". One of Wood's most popular comic songs, \"The Ballad of Barry and Freda (Let's Do It)\", originated on this show. It tells the story of Freda (a woman eager for sex) and Barry (an introverted man terrified of intimate relations), and makes clever use of allusions to a multitude of risqu\u00e9 activities while avoiding all taboo words.\nFollowing the success of the first series of \"\", Wood went on tour again with \"Lucky Bag\" in March 1985. \"Scene\", a documentary for BBC2 later that year, showed footage of Wood preparing for the tour and clips of her performing the show at Derby Assembly Rooms. \nA second series of \"\" was made in 1986. Before filming began in the summer, Wood went on a 22-date tour of England and Scotland during March and April. A final 'Special' 40-minute episode of \"As Seen on TV\" was made in 1987 and broadcast later that year.\nDuring autumn 1987 Wood went on the road with what was to be her largest tour yet. The tour included a sell-out two-week run at the London Palladium, and had a second leg in the spring of 1988.\nIn 1988 she appeared in the BAFTA-winning \"An Audience with Victoria Wood\" for ITV. At the time of recording the show she was six months pregnant. The end of 1988 saw the release of her second live album \"Victoria Wood Live\", recorded at the Brighton Dome.\n1989\u20131999.\nDuring this period Wood moved away from the sketch show format and into more self-contained works, often with a bittersweet flavour. \"Victoria Wood\" (six parts, 1989) featured Wood in several individual stories such as \"We'd Quite Like To Apologise\", set in an airport departure lounge, and \"Over to Pam\", set around a fictional talk show.\nIn May 1990, Wood began a large sell-out tour of the United Kingdom, which was followed by a ten-week run at the Strand Theatre in London titled \"Victoria Wood Up West\". Wood took the show on the road again during March and April 1991, where it was recorded at the Mayflower Theatre in Southampton, and later released as \"Victoria Wood Sold Out\" in 1991.\nIn 1991, she appeared on the Comic Relief single performing \"The Smile Song\", the flipside to \"The Stonk\" (a record by ITV comedians\nGareth Hale and Norman Pace with charity supergroup The Stonkers). \nA UK number-one single for one week on 23 March 1991, the record was the UK's 22nd-best-selling single of the year. However, even though it was a joint-single (with \"The Smile Song\" credited on the front of the single cover and listed as track 2 on the seven-inch and CD single rather than being a B-side), the UK singles chart compilers (now the Official Charts Company) did not credit her with having number one hit, in a situation similar to the fate of BAD II's \"Rush\", the AA-side of the preceding number one, \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\" by The Clash.\nShe briefly returned to sketches for the 1992 Christmas Day special \"Victoria Wood's All Day Breakfast\", and also branched out into children's animation, voicing all the characters for the CBBC series \"Puppydog Tales\".\nIn April 1993, Wood began a seven-month tour of the UK. The 104-date tour broke box office records, including 15 sell out shows at London's Royal Albert Hall, and played to residencies in Sheffield, Birmingham, Plymouth, Bristol, Nottingham, Manchester, Leicester, Liverpool, Bournemouth, Oxford, Southampton, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leeds and Hull.\nThe television film \"Pat and Margaret\" (1994), starring Wood and Julie Walters as long-lost sisters with very different lifestyles, continued her return to stand-alone plays with a poignant undercurrent to the comedy.\nOn Christmas Day 1994, Wood starred in the one-off BBC 50-minute programme based on her 1993/94 stage show \"Victoria Wood: Live in Your Own Home\". The special featured stand-up routines, character monologues and songs. An extended 80 minute version was released on VHS.\nWood went on a 68-date sell-out tour of the UK between May - October 1996, which played at venues in Leicester, Sheffield, Ipswich, Blackpool, Wolverhampton, Bradford, Newcastle, Bournemouth, Brighton, Nottingham, Oxford, Southend, Manchester and Cambridge. The tour culminated with another 15 sell-out shows at London's Royal Albert Hall in the autumn. The tour recommenced in April 1997 in Liverpool, also taking in Reading, Birmingham, Bristol, Halifax, Glasgow, Portsmouth, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Wood then took the show to Australia and New Zealand during July and August. It was later released as \"Victoria Wood Live 1997\" filmed at the High Wycombe Swan Theatre during the tours final shows in September.\nIn October 1997, Wood released a compilation of 14 of her songs titled \"Victoria Wood, Real Life The Songs\".\nHer first sitcom \"dinnerladies\" (1998), continued her now established milieu of mostly female, mostly middle-aged characters depicted vividly and amusingly, but with a counterpoint of sadder themes.\n2000\u20132005.\nDecember 2000 saw the Christmas sketch show special \"Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings\", featuring her regular troupe of actors as well as a string of special guest stars including Hugh Laurie, Angela Rippon, Bob Monkhouse, Bill Paterson, Delia Smith and Roger Moore.\n2001 saw Wood embark on her final stand-up tour, \"Victoria Wood at It Again\" but was postponed slightly by Wood having to have an emergency hysterectomy shortly before the tour was due to begin. She re-wrote the entire first half of the show and incorporated the operation into her act. The 85-date tour included another residency at the Royal Albert Hall and finished in April 2002.\nDuring this period, Wood tended to move away from comedy to concentrate on drama. She continued to produce one-off specials including \"Victoria Wood's Sketch Show Story\" (2002) and \"Victoria Wood's Big Fat Documentary\" (2005).\nWood wrote her first musical, \"\", which opened in 2005 at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, London, for a limited period, directed by Trevor Nunn. It starred several of the original cast, with Sally Ann Triplett playing Miss Berta (played in the series by Wood). Wood played Julie Walters' lead role of \"Mrs Overall\" for Monday and Wednesday matinee performances.\n2006\u20132010.\nWood wrote the one-off ITV serious drama \"Housewife, 49\" (2006), an adaptation of the diaries of Nella Last, and played the eponymous role of an introverted middle-aged character who discovers new confidence and friendships in Lancashire during the Second World War. \"Housewife, 49\" was critically acclaimed, and Wood won BAFTAs for both her acting and writing for this drama; a rare double. The film also starred Stephanie Cole and David Threlfall as well as, in a small role, Sue Wallace with whom Wood had worked before and studied alongside at Birmingham.\nIn November 2006, Wood directed a revival production of \"Acorn Antiques: The Musical!\" with a new cast. The musical opened at the Lowry in Salford in December and toured the United Kingdom from January to July 2007.\nIn January 2007, she appeared as herself in a series of advertisements featuring famous people working for the supermarket chain Asda. They featured Wood working in the bakery and introduced a catchphrase\u00a0\u2013 \"there's no place like ASDA\". Wood was the subject of an episode of \"The South Bank Show\" in March 2007, and is the only woman to be the subject of two \"South Bank\" programmes (the previous occasion was in September 1996).\nWood appeared in a three-part travel documentary on BBC One called \"Victoria's Empire\", in which she travelled around the world in search of the history, cultural impact and customs the British Empire placed on the parts of the world it ruled. She departed Victoria Station, London, for Calcutta, Hong Kong and Borneo in the first programme. In programme two she visited Ghana, Jamaica and Newfoundland and in the final programme, New Zealand, Australia and Zambia, finishing at the Victoria Falls.\nIn a tribute to Wood, the British television station UKTV Gold celebrated her work with a weekend marathon of programmes between 3 and 4 November 2007, featuring programmes such as \"Victoria Wood Live\" and \"dinnerladies\" and \"Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV\"\u00a0\u2013 its first screening on British television since 1995.\nWood returned to stand-up comedy, with a special performance for the celebratory show \"Happy Birthday BAFTA\" on 28 October 2007, alongside other household names. The programme was transmitted on ITV1 on Wednesday 7 November 2007. On Boxing Day 2007 she appeared as \"Nana\" in the Granada dramatisation of Noel Streatfeild's novel \"Ballet Shoes\".\nIn December 2007, when a guest on the radio programme \"Desert Island Discs\", Wood said she was about to make her first foray into film, writing a script described as a contemporary comedy about a middle-aged person. On Thursday, 12 June 2008, Wood was a member of the celebrity guest panel on the series \"\" on BBC Two. In June 2009, she appeared as a panellist on the first two episodes of a series of \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\".\nIn 2009, Wood provided the voice of God for \"Liberace, Live From Heaven\" by Julian Woolford at London's Leicester Square Theatre. Wood returned to television comedy for a one-off Christmas sketch-show special, her first for nine years, \"Victoria Wood's Mid Life Christmas\", transmitted on BBC One at 21:00 on Christmas Eve 2009. It reunited Wood with Julie Walters in \"Lark Pies to Cranchesterford\", a spoof of BBC period dramas \"Lark Rise to Candleford\", \"Little Dorrit\" and \"Cranford\"; a spoof documentary, \"Beyond the Marigolds\", following \"Acorn Antiques\" star Bo Beaumont (Walters); highlights from the \"Mid Life Olympics 2009\" with Wood as the commentator; parodies of personal injury advertisements; and a reprise of Wood's most famous song \"The Ballad of Barry and Freda\" (\"Let's Do It\"), performed as a musical number with tap-dancers and a band. \"Victoria Wood: Seen On TV\", a 90-minute documentary looking back on her career, was broadcast on BBC Two on 21 December, whilst a behind-the-scenes special programme about \"Midlife Christmas\", \"Victoria Wood: What Larks!\", was broadcast on BBC One on 30 December.\n2011\u20132016.\nOn New Year's Day 2011, Wood appeared in a BBC drama \"Eric and Ernie\" as Eric Morecambe's mother, Sadie Bartholomew.\nFor the 2011 Manchester International Festival, Wood wrote, composed and directed \"That Day We Sang\", a musical set in 1969 with flashbacks to 1929. It tells the story of a middle-aged couple who find love after meeting on a TV programme about a choir they both sang in 40 years previously. Although the characters are imaginary, the choir sang with the Hall\u00e9 Youth Orchestra in Manchester's Free Trade Hall on a record that sold more than a million copies. Apart from the pieces on the 1929 recording (Purcell's \"Nymphs and Shepherds\" and the Evening Benediction from \"Hansel and Gretel\") the score for the musical was written by Wood. She also narrated the 2012 miniseries \"The Talent Show Story\".\nOn 22 December 2012, Wood was a guest on BBC Radio 2's Saturday morning \"Graham Norton Show\".

The majority of its territory lies within the historical region of Banat, with a few northeastern villages considered part of Transylvania. The county seat is Re\u0219i\u021ba. The Cara\u0219-Severin county is part of the Danube\u2013Cri\u0219\u2013Mure\u0219\u2013Tisa Euroregion.\nName.\nIn Serbo-Croatian, it is known as \"Kara\u0161 Severin\"/\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d or \"Kara\u0161-Severinska \u017eupanija\", in Hungarian as \"Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny megye\", in German as \"Kreis Karasch-Severin\", and in Bulgarian as \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448-\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d (translit. \"Karash-Severin\").\nGeography.\nWith 8,514\u00a0km2, it is the third largest county in Romania, after Timi\u0219 and Suceava counties. It is also the county through which the river Danube enters Romania.\nThe mountains make up 67% of the county's surface, including the Southern Carpathians range, with Banat Mountains, \u021aarcu-Godeanu Mountains and Cernei Mountains and elevations between 600 and 2100 meters. Transition hills between mountains and the Banat Plain lie in the western side of the county.\nThe Danube enters Romania in the vicinity of Bazia\u0219, bordering Serbia. Timi\u0219, Cerna, Cara\u0219 and Nera cross the county, some of them through spectacular valleys and gorges.\nHistory and economy.\nIn 1718 the county was part of the Habsburg monarchy, part of the province of Banat. In 1771 the county seat, Reschitz (Re\u0219i\u021ba) became a modern industrial center under Austrian rule. The area received considerable attention due to its mining industry. In 1855, the entire Banat area, with its supplies of mineral deposits and timber, was transferred from the Austrian Treasury to a joint Austrian-French mining and railroad company named StEG. StEG built the Oravi\u021ba-Bazia\u0219 line, Romania's oldest railroad track.\nAfter World War I, StEG, Banat and most Austro-Hungarian property were taken over by a company named UDR. During the last years of World War II, when Romania was an ally of Nazi Germany, a partisan group, led by \u0218tefan Plav\u0103\u021b, was active in the mountainous area of the county. The arrival of the communist regime in Romania after World War II and that regime's campaign of nationalization of the mining industry brought tremendous social upheaval in the area.\nTourism.\nArchaeological findings show the area has been populated since Paleolithic times. There is a County Museum of History in Re\u0219i\u021ba, displaying archeological artifacts, and, in the town of Ocna de Fier, the Constantin Gruiescu Mineralogical Collection. The county hosts the regional daffodil and lilac festivals in the Spring.\nSites worth visiting:\nDemographics.\nAccording to the 2021 census, the county had a population of 246,588 and the population density was .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPolitics.\nThe Cara\u0219-Severin County Council, renewed at the 2020 local elections, consists of 30 counsellors, with the following party composition:\nAdministrative divisions.\nCara\u0219-Severin County has 2 municipalities, 6 towns, and 69 communes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistoric county.\nThe territory of the county was transferred to the Romania from the Kingdom of Hungary in 1920 under the Treaty of Trianon. The county was located in the southwestern part of Greater Romania, in the south and east region of the Banat. The county seat was Lugoj. Its territory consisted entirely of the current territory of the county, but also parts of the current counties of Timi\u0219, Arad, and Mehedin\u021bi. It bordered on the west with Timi\u0219-Torontal County and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, to the south with Yugoslavia, to the east with the counties Mehedin\u021bi and Hunedoara, and to the north by Arad County. The county had a total area over , making it the largest county geographically of interwar Romania. Its territory corresponded to the former Hungarian division of Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny County. The county existed for seven years, being divided in 1926 into Cara\u0219 County and Severin County.\nAdministration.\nThe county was divided administratively into fourteen districts (\"pl\u0103\u0219i\"). There were five urban municipalities (cities): Lugoj (capital), Caransebe\u0219, Re\u0219i\u021ba, Oravi\u021ba and Or\u0219ova.\nPopulation.\nAccording to the census data of 1920, the total population of the county was 424,254 inhabitants.

It is located in the Banat region. The city had a population of 58,393 in 2021. It administers six villages: C\u00e2lnic (\"K\u00f6ln\u00f6k\"), Cuptoare (\"Kuptore\"), Doman (\"Dom\u00e1ny\"), Moniom (\"Mony\u00f3\"), Secu (\"Sz\u00e9kul\"; \"Sekul\"), and \u021aerova (\"Krass\u00f3cser\").\nEtymology.\nThe name of \"Re\u0219i\u021ba\" might come from the Latin \"recitia\", meaning \"cold spring\", as the historian Nicolae Iorga once suggested, presuming that the Romans gave this name to Re\u0219i\u021ba, from a water spring on the Doman valley. A much more plausible version, according to Iorgu Iordan, would be that the name is actually coming from a Slavic word: people living in the neighbouring village of Cara\u0219ova away, referring to this place, that in those days was a similar village to theirs, as being \"u re\u010dice\" (at the creek). It can also be noted that almost all Slavic countries have places with the name of Re\u010dice (pronounced Reci\u021be in Romanian).&lt;ref name=\"\u00cenceputurile Re\u0219i\u021bei/Beginnings of Resita\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nHistory.\nHistorically, the town has its origins in the 15th century under the name of \"Rechyoka\" and \"Rechycha\". Archaeological research found traces of habitation going back to the Neolithic, Dacian, and Roman eras. In the Middle Ages, the area was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Following the death of the Jagiellon King of Hungary Louis II at the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, the Hungarian crown would be inherited by the Habsburg monarchy, but this was contested by much of the Hungarian nobility, resulting in the formation of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, encompassing much of Transylvania and the Banat. In 1553, the area was incorporated into Teme\u015fvar Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire. The town is mentioned in 1673 under the name of \"Reszinitza\", whose citizens paid taxes to the Ottoman bey (governor) in Timi\u0219oara (Turkish: \"Teme\u015fvar\"; Hungarian: \"Temesv\u00e1r\"). \nFollowing the Battle of Vienna in 1683, Ottoman influence north of the Danube would contract. and the Habsburg and by the years 1690\u20131700, it was mentioned as being part of the District of Boc\u0219a together with other towns in the B\u00e2rzava Valley. In the Habsburg-Ottoman War of 1716-1718, Prince Eugene of Savoy would conquer the region for the Habsburgs. The Habsburgs established the Banat of Temeswar and began fortifying the region as a military frontier. The town was referenced in the conscription acts of 1717 under the name of \"Retziza\". Under Empress Maria Theresa, in 1751 Re\u0219i\u021ba and much of the northern Banat was detached from the Banat Military Frontier and transferred from military to civil administration. On 3 July 1771, it became an important metal-manufacturing center in the region. The foundation of the industrial Re\u0219i\u021ba was laid with the establishment of factories near the villages of \"Re\u0219i\u021ba Rom\u00e2n\u0103\" (\"Reschiza Kameral\u0103\" or \"Ol\u00e1h Resitza\") and \"Re\u0219i\u021ba Montan\u0103\" (\"Eisenwerk Reschitza\", \"N\u00e9met(h) Reschitza\" or \"Resiczb\u00e1nya\"). Re\u0219i\u021ba Montan\u0103 was at first inhabited by Romanians.. \nEven before Hungary fell under Habsburg Rule, the old kings of Hungary had encouraged Germans to settle in Transylvania and the Banat. In 1224, King Andrew II of Hungary issued the \"Diploma Andreanum,\" granting provisional autonomy to the Transylvania Saxons and their fortified towns in Northeastern and Southeastern Transylvania (German: \"Siebenb\u00fcrgen\"). For much of the Early Modern Period the Banat had become a dangerous border region caught between two waring Empires and would experience periods of devastation and depopulation. However, in the 18th century, the expansion of Habsburg authority, its efforts to fortify the region, and the movement of the frontier southward greatly increased regional security, making the Banat once again suitable for civilian settlement. Besides the installation of a civil administration, the Theresian period (1740-1780) would see large-scale efforts to recruit settlers and repopulate the region, resulting in a large influx of German settlers, especially from Swabia. In 1776, 70 German families settled Re\u0219i\u021ba (German: \"Reschitz\"). In 1880, Germans represented the majority of the city's population.\nFollowing the First World War, the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1918 and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon in 1920 would result in Re\u0219i\u021ba much of the Banat being annexed by the Kingdom of Romania. However, in the Interwar Period, Germans would continue to constitute the majority of the population. In 1941, Re\u0219i\u021ba had 12,096 Germans residents, 9,453 Romanian residents, and 1,861 Hungarian residents. Between 1910 and 1925, Re\u0219i\u021ba had the status of a rural area, and in 1925, it was declared a town thanks to its development into a powerful industrial location in modern Romania. In 1968, it became a municipality.\nAfter the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Re\u0219i\u021ba lost most of its importance and its economy faced a recession, along with the Romanian economy. The population also declined, dropping from 110,000 in 1989 to 86,000 in 2006. After the fall of communism, the Re\u0219i\u021ba Steelworks (\"Combinatul Siderurgic Re\u0219i\u021ba\", CSR) was bought by an American investor who brought the factory just one step away from bankruptcy. Today the steelworks are run by TMK Europe GmbH, a German subsidiary of OAO TMK, Moscow, which has projects of modernization for the CSR.\nIn 2022 it was inducted into UNESCO's Global Network of Learning Cities (GNLC).\nThe city.\nThe city is situated along the B\u00e2rzava River, which meets the Doman River in the centre of town. Most of the urban area is concentrated along the B\u00e2rzava, with some development\u2014mostly residential\u2014in the surrounding hills.\nIt is made of three main areas, two former villages that were very close: Romanian Re\u0219i\u021ba ( or Olah Resitza) and Highland Re\u0219i\u021ba (, Eisenwerk Reschitza or Nemet Reschitza); a new area, recently built, made of tower blocks on a wide opened meadow, called B\u00e2rzava's Meadow.\nThe Civic centre of the city has been partially renovated in 2006. An important point of attraction located in the City Centre is the impressive kinetic fountain designed by Constantin Lucaci, built in the communist era.\nThere are also important cultural points in Re\u0219i\u021ba that have been renewed in 2006, including the Concrete School (\u0218coala de Beton), Downtown, and the Polyvalent Hall (Sala Polivalent\u0103).\nThe Re\u0219i\u021ba Steam Locomotive Museum features Romania's first locomotive built in Romania at Re\u0219i\u021ba in 1872, and is located in the open-air museum in the () neighborhood.\nAn important iron and steel center, Re\u0219i\u021ba is the site of blast furnaces, iron foundries, and plants producing electrical appliances, chemicals and machinery (\"see Re\u0219i\u021ba works\").\nThe city is a hub for leisure locations all around. Locations near Re\u0219i\u021ba include the ski resort at Semenic, Lake Gozna, Lake Secu, the Trei Ape Lake (Three Rivers Lake), G\u0103r\u00e2na, Brebu, and V\u0103liug.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt the 2021 census, the city had a population of 58,393. At the 2011 census, there were 65,509 people living within the city of Re\u0219i\u021ba, making it the 29th largest city in Romania. The ethnic makeup is as follows:\nReligion.\nAccording to the 1880 Austro-Hungarian census, the residents were:\nToday there are many of the old churches in service and new ones:\nClimate.\nRe\u0219i\u021ba has a humid continental climate (\"Cfb\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification).\nEconomy.\nRe\u0219i\u021ba has long been considered as the second-largest industrial center of Romania. It is an important center in manufacturing steel and vehicle manufacturing. C.S.R. (Combinatul Siderurgic Re\u0219i\u021ba) and U.C.M.R., the first Romanian factory (Uzina Constructoare de Ma\u0219ini Re\u0219i\u021ba). The two are called as Re\u0219i\u021ba works and are the factories which sustained the city's life for more than 300 years. The first factories were built in 1771, during the reign of Maria Theresa. During the 19th century, the steelworks were known as StEG. After the end of World War I, when Banat became part of Romania, they changed their name again, this time to Uzinele \u0219i Domeniile Re\u0219i\u021ba or UDR (Re\u0219i\u021ba Works and Domains). Only later, under the Communist regime, did the UDR split into CSR and UCMR.\nThe economy of Re\u0219i\u021ba has faced a drawback since 1989, but began recovering as a result of increasing foreign and domestic investment, largely in industry.\nShopping.\nRe\u0219i\u021ba currently has 9 supermarkets of which three Carrefour supermarkets, two in the Gov\u00e2ndari district (one of them was previously a Billa supermarket) and one in the Nera Shopping Center, three Lidl supermarkets, two Kaufland supermarkets, one near the road entrance from Boc\u0219a and one in Lunca B\u00e2rz\u0103vii and a Penny establishment also situated in Lunca B\u00e2rz\u0103vii. The Shopping Center of Re\u0219i\u021ba is called Nera Shopping Center located in the Civic Centre. There are a variety of companies operating in Re\u0219i\u021ba, offering almost everything a normal consumer would need. There are some other shopping centres currently under development such as Re\u0219i\u021ba Shopping City located on the site of the old thermal plant, or the mall of the Mociur area.\nTransport.\nPublic transport.\nRe\u0219i\u021ba's public transport relies on 6 bus lines and was operated by the now defunct Prescom company. It is now operated by Transport Urban Re\u0219i\u021ba (TUR).\nBuses.\nRe\u0219i\u021ba's bus fleet consists of about 25 buses running on 6 lines:\nRe\u0219i\u021ba's bus fleet was to be upgraded sometime during 2009, and after in 2017 when the Resita municipality took over the management of public transport.\nTrams.\nA tram system, consisting of two lines, operated between 1988 and 2011 and then needed to be restored. The 2 tram lines were the Renk\u2013Muncitoresc line (0), and the Renk\u2013Stavila line (DP) which was basically an expansion of the Renk-Muncitoresc line, but there were only 3 trams on this line. The tram fleet consisted of about 28 trams. The last trams were GT8 and N models imported from Germany (Dortmund and Frankfurt), and completely replaced the former pre-89 trams in 2002. In 2008, the new mayor announced his intention to decommission all trams and replace them with modern buses complying with EU standards.\nReintroduction of trams was announced in 2016 and the modernization and expansion of the tram system began in 2019. In 2017 it was announced that a new company, called http://, was created to manage the public transport in Re\u0219i\u021ba. In spring 2021, reopening was planned for December 2022, but was subsequently delayed. On December 20, 2024, tram services resumed in Re\u0219i\u021ba after a 13-year pause. The project, funded by the European Union, aimed to modernize public transport and improve urban mobility through a new tram line and updated infrastructure.\nThe revamped tram service operates along a 9 km route from Kaufland in the north to Re\u0219i\u021ba-Montana in the southeast. Although some sections of the original line remain closed, the new route offers a 30-minute end-to-end journey with trams running every 8 minutes during rush hours.\nThe infrastructure upgrade features modern tracks and energy-efficient power systems, improving the reliability of tram operations. Pedestrian and cycling paths built alongside the line support multimodal transport and reflect current urban mobility priorities.\nRoad transport.\nRe\u0219i\u021ba features a main 4 lane road that connects the neighbourhood Stavila to the neighbourhood of C\u00e2lnic. This main road passes through almost all important neighbourhoods in Re\u0219i\u021ba. The rest of the neighbourhoods in Re\u0219i\u021ba are accessible via 2 lane secondary roads or single-lane roads. Roads of Re\u0219i\u021ba are usually well maintained, especially the main road, but there are occasional pot-holes on secondary roads. The road signs are usually well placed and well maintained, and traffic is usually friendly and traffic jams are a myth. Accidents are very rare and almost never lethal. Externally Re\u0219i\u021ba is connected by national roads to Caransebe\u0219 (continued to Bucharest) and to Timi\u0219oara. There are also 3 county roads connecting Re\u0219i\u021ba to Oravi\u021ba, Naid\u0103\u0219, and Anina.\nSport.\nAssociation football\nHandball\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nRe\u0219i\u021ba is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61880", "revid": "1750837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61880", "title": "Euphorbia", "text": "Genus of flowering plants in the spurge family Euphorbiaceae\nEuphorbia is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, commonly called spurge, in the family Euphorbiaceae.\nEuphorbias range from tiny annual plants to large and long-lived trees, with perhaps the tallest being \"Euphorbia ampliphylla\" at or more. The genus has roughly 2,000 members, making it one of the largest genera of flowering plants. It also has one of the largest ranges of chromosome counts, along with \"Rumex\" and \"Senecio\". \"Euphorbia antiquorum\" is the type species for the genus \"Euphorbia\". It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in \"Species Plantarum\".\nSome euphorbias are widely available commercially, such as poinsettias at Christmas. Some are commonly cultivated as ornamentals, or collected and highly valued for the aesthetic appearance of their unique floral structures, such as the crown of thorns plant (\"Euphorbia milii\"). Succulent euphorbias from the deserts of Southern Africa and Madagascar have evolved physical characteristics and forms similar to cacti of North and South America, so they are often incorrectly referred to as cacti. Some are used as ornamentals in landscaping, because of beautiful or striking overall forms, and drought and heat tolerance.\nEuphorbia all share the feature of having a poisonous, latex-like sap and unique floral structures. When viewed as a whole, the head of flowers looks like a single flower (a pseudanthium). It has a unique kind of pseudanthium, called a cyathium, where each flower in the head is reduced to its barest essential part needed for sexual reproduction. The individual flowers are either male or female, with the male flowers reduced to only the stamen, and the females to the pistil. These flowers have no sepals, petals, or other parts that are typical of flowers in other kinds of plants. Structures supporting the flower head and other structures underneath have evolved to attract pollinators with nectar, and with shapes and colors that function in a way petals and other flower parts do in other flowers. It is the only genus of plants that has all three kinds of photosynthesis, CAM, C3 and C4.\nEtymology.\nThe common name \"spurge\" derives from the Middle English/Old French \"espurge\" (\"to purge\"), due to the use of the plant's sap as a purgative. The botanical name \"Euphorbia\" derives from Euphorbos, the Greek physician of King Juba II of Numidia and Mauretania (52\u201350\u00a0BC \u2013 23\u00a0AD), who married the daughter of Anthony and Cleopatra. Juba was a prolific writer on various subjects, including natural history. Euphorbos wrote that one of the cactus-like euphorbias (now called \"Euphorbia obtusifolia\" ssp. \"regis-jubae\") was used as a powerful laxative. In 12\u00a0BC, Juba named this plant after his physician Euphorbos, as Augustus Caesar had dedicated a statue to the brother of Euphorbos, Antonius Musa, who was the personal physician of Augustus. In 1753, botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus assigned the name \"Euphorbia\" to the entire genus in the physician's honor.\nDescription.\nThe plants are annual, biennial or perennial herbs, woody shrubs, or trees with a caustic, poisonous milky latex. The roots are fine or thick and fleshy or tuberous. Many species are more or less succulent, thorny, or unarmed. The main stem and mostly also the side arms of the succulent species are thick and fleshy, and often winged, tall. The succulent trees and large shrubs are mostly confined to southern and eastern Africa, but others are found elsewhere. For example, \"Euphorbia neutra\" is native to the Caatinga of Brazil and \"Euphorbia royleana\" is found in the Himalayan foothills. The deciduous leaves may be opposite, alternate, or in whorls. In succulent species, the leaves are mostly small and short-lived. The stipules are mostly small, partly transformed into spines or glands, or missing.\nInflorescence and fruit.\nLike all members of the family Euphorbiaceae, spurges have unisexual flowers.\nIn \"Euphorbia\", flowers occur in a head, called the cyathium (plural cyathia). Each male or female flower in the cyathium head has only its essential sexual part, in males the stamen, and in females the pistil. The flowers do not have sepals, petals, or nectar to attract pollinators, although other nonflower parts of the plant have an appearance and nectar glands with similar roles. Euphorbias are the only plants known to have this kind of flower head.\nNectar glands and nectar that attract pollinators are held in the involucre, a cup-like part below and supporting the cyathium head. The \"involucre\" in the genus \"Euphorbia\" is not to be confused with the \"involucre\" in family Asteraceae members, which is a collection of bracts called phyllaries, which surround and encase the unopened flower head, then support the receptacle under it after the flower head opens.\nThe involucre is above and supported by bract-like modified leaf structures (usually in pairs) called cyathophylls', or cyathial leaves. The cyathophyll often has a superficial appearance of being petals of a flower.\n\"Euphorbia\" flowers are tiny, and the variation attracting different pollinators, with different forms and colors occurs, in the cyathium, involucre, cyathophyll, or additional parts such as glands that attached to these.\nThe collection of many flowers may be shaped and arranged to appear collectively as a single individual flower, sometimes called a pseudanthium in the Asteraceae, and also in \"Euphorbia\".\nThe majority of species are monoecious (bearing male and female flowers on the same plant), although some are dioecious with male and female flowers occurring on different plants. It is not unusual for the central cyathia of a cyme to be purely male, and for lateral cyathia to carry both sexes. Sometimes, young plants or those growing under unfavorable conditions are male only, and only produce female flowers in the cyathia with maturity or as growing conditions improve.\nThe female flowers reduced to a single pistil usually split into three parts, often with two stigmas at each tip. Male flowers often have anthers in twos. Nectar glands usually occur in fives, may be as few as one, and may be fused into a \"U\" shape. The cyathophylls often occur in twos, are leaf-like, and may be showy and brightly coloured and attractive to pollinators, or be reduced to barely visible tiny scales.\nThe fruits are three- or rarely two-compartment capsules, sometimes fleshy, but almost always ripening to a woody container that then splits open, sometimes explosively. The seeds are four-angled, oval, or spherical, and some species have a caruncle.\nXerophytes and succulents.\nIn the genus \"Euphorbia\", succulence in the species has often evolved divergently and to differing degrees. Sometimes, it is difficult to decide, and is a question of interpretation, whether or not a species is really succulent or \"only\" xerophytic. In some cases, especially with geophytes, plants closely related to the succulents are normal herbs. About 850 species are succulent in the strictest sense. If one includes slightly succulent and xerophytic species, this figure rises to about 1000, representing about 45% of all \"Euphorbia\" species.\nIrritants.\nThe milky sap of spurges (called \"latex\") evolved as a deterrent to herbivores. It is white, and transparent when dry, except in \"E. abdelkuri\", where it is yellow. The pressurized sap seeps from the slightest wound and congeals after a few minutes in air. The skin-irritating and caustic effects are largely caused by varying amounts of diterpenes. Triterpenes such as betulin and corresponding esters are other major components of the latex. In contact with mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth), the latex can produce extremely painful inflammation. The sap has also been known to cause mild to extreme Keratouveitis, which affects vision. Therefore, spurges should be handled with caution and kept away from children and pets. Wearing eye protection while working in close contact with \"Euphorbia\" is advised. Latex on skin should be washed off immediately and thoroughly. Congealed latex is insoluble in water, but can be removed with an emulsifier such as milk or soap. A physician should be consulted if inflammation occurs, as severe eye damage including permanent blindness may result from exposure to the sap.\nThe poisonous qualities were well known: in the Ethiopian \"Kebra Nagast\", the serpent king Arwe is killed with juice from the \"Euphorbia\".\nUses.\nSeveral spurges are grown as garden plants, among them poinsettia (\"E. pulcherrima\") and the succulent \"E. trigona\". \"E. pekinensis\" () is used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is regarded as one of the 50 fundamental herbs. Several \"Euphorbia\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), like the spurge hawkmoths (\"Hyles euphorbiae\" and \"Hyles tithymali\"), as well as the giant leopard moth.\nIngenol mebutate, a drug used to treat actinic keratosis, is a diterpenoid found in \"Euphorbia peplus\".\nEuphorbias are often used as hedging plants in many parts of Africa.\nMisidentification as cacti.\nAmong laypeople, \"Euphorbia\" species are among the plant taxa most commonly confused with cacti, especially the stem succulents. Euphorbias secrete a sticky, milky-white fluid with latex, but cacti do not. Individual flowers of euphorbias are usually tiny and nondescript (although structures around the individual flowers may not be), without petals and sepals, unlike cacti, which often have fantastically showy flowers.\nSystematics and taxonomy.\nThe present taxon \"Euphorbia\" corresponds to its own former subtribe, the Euphorbiinae. It has over 2000 species. Morphological description using the presence of a cyathium (see section above) is consistent with nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequence data in testing of about 10% of its members. This testing supports inclusion of formerly other genera as being best placed in this single genus, including \"Chamaesyce, Monadenium, Pedilanthus\", and poinsettia (\"E. pulcherrima\").\nGenetic tests have shown that similar flower head structures or forms within the genus, might not mean close ancestry within the genus. The genetic data show that within the genus, convergent evolution of inflorescence structures may be from ancestral subunits that are not related. So using morphology within the genus becomes problematic for further subgeneric grouping. As stated on the Euphorbia Planetary Biodiversity Inventory project webpage:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Previous morphologically based delimitations of subgenera or sections within the genus should not be taken at face value. The genus is in fact rife with striking examples of morphological convergence in cyathial and vegetative features, which justifies a global approach to studying the genus to obtain a proper phylogenetic understanding of the whole group... The bottom line is that a number of clades have been placed inside or outside of Euphorbia at different times... few of the subgeneric circumscriptions hold up under DNA sequence analysis.\nAccording to a 2002 publication on studies of DNA sequence data, most of the smaller \"satellite genera\" around the huge genus \"Euphorbia\" nest deep within the latter. Consequently, these taxa, namely the never generally accepted genus \"Chamaesyce\", as well as the smaller genera \"Cubanthus\", \"Elaeophorbia\", \"Endadenium\", \"Monadenium\", \"Synadenium\",\nand \"Pedilanthus\" were transferred to \"Euphorbia\". The entire subtribe Euphorbiinae now consists solely of the genus \"Euphorbia\".\nSelected species.\nSee List of \"Euphorbia\" species for complete list.\nHybrids.\n\"Euphorbia\" has been extensively hybridised for garden use, with many cultivars available commercially. Moreover, some hybrid plants have been found growing in the wild, for instance \"E.\" \u00d7 \"martini\" Rouy, a cross of \"E. amygdaloides\" \u00d7 \"E. characias\" subsp. \"characias\", found in southern France.\nSubgenera.\nThe genus \"Euphorbia\" is one of the largest and most complex genera of flowering plants, and several botanists have made unsuccessful attempts to subdivide the genus into numerous smaller genera. According to the recent phylogenetic studies, \"Euphorbia\" can be divided into four subgenera, each containing several sections and groups. Of these, subgenus \"Esula\" is the most basal. The subgenera \"Chamaesyce\" and \"Euphorbia\" are probably sister taxa, but very closely related to subgenus \"Rhizanthium\". Extensive xeromorph adaptations in all probability evolved several times; it is not known if the common ancestor of the cactus-like \"Rhizanthium\" and \"Euphorbia\" lineages had been xeromorphic\u2014in which case a more normal morphology would have re-evolved namely in \"Chamaesyce\"\u2014or whether extensive xeromorphism is entirely polyphyletic even to the level of the subgenera.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His older brother, Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France, died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the French Revolution. At his brother's death he became the new Dauphin (heir apparent to the throne), a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the title of Prince Royal.\nWhen his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle period of the French Revolution, he automatically succeeded as King of France, Louis XVII, in the eyes of the royalists. France was by then a republic, and since Louis-Charles was imprisoned and died in captivity in June 1795, he never actually ruled. Nevertheless, in 1814 after the Bourbon Restoration, his uncle acceded to the throne and was proclaimed Louis XVIII.\nBiography.\nLouis-Charles de France was born at the Palace of Versailles, the second son and third child of his parents, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. He was named after his father and his mother's favourite sister Maria Carolina, Queen of Naples and Sicily, who was known as Charlotte in the family, Charles being the masculine version of her name. His younger sister, Sophie, was born a little over a year later. He became the Dauphin on the death of his elder brother, Louis Joseph, on 4 June 1789.\nAs customary in royal families, Louis-Charles was cared for by multiple people. Queen Marie Antoinette appointed governesses to look after all three of her children. Louis-Charles' original governess was Yolande de Polastron, Duchess of Polignac, who left France on the night of 16\u201317 July 1789, at the outbreak of the Revolution, at the urging of Louis XVI. She was replaced by the marquise Louise \u00c9lisabeth de Tourzel. Additionally, the queen selected Agathe de Rambaud to be the official nurse of Louis-Charles. Alain Decaux wrote: \"Madame de Rambaud was officially in charge of the care of the prince from the day of his birth until 10 August 1792; in other words, for seven years. During these seven years, she never left him, she cradled him, took care of him, dressed him, comforted him, and scolded him. Many times, more than Marie Antoinette, she was a true mother for him\".\nSome have suggested that Axel von Fersen, who was romantically linked with Marie Antoinette, was the father of her son. The fact that Louis Charles was born exactly nine months after he returned to court was noted, as well as the fact that Louis wrote of the birth in his diary \"as easy as when my son was born\", suggesting Louis Charles was, in fact, \"not \" his son, but it has also been interpreted as Louis being used to adress the dauphin as \"my son\". This theory of paternity was debunked by most scholars, who reject it, observing that the time of his conception corresponded to a time that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had spent a lot of time together. Marie Antoinette reportedly retained her charisma after her pregnancies, cutting an imposing figure in her court. She was said to have many admirers, but remained a faithful, strong-willed wife and a stern but ultimately loving mother.\nOn 6 October 1789, the royal family was forced by a Parisian mob mostly composed of women to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where they spent the next three years as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the National Guards who did not spare any humiliation to the family; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, even in her bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children.\nThe family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the children to see if any letters were smuggled to the prisoner. In 1790, the queen adopted a foster sibling for him, \"Zo\u00eb\" Jeanne Louise Victoire, as a playmate. On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in what is known as the Flight to Varennes, but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on 10 August 1792, the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.\nOn 13 August, the royal family was imprisoned in the tower of the Temple. At first, their conditions were not extremely harsh, but they were prisoners and were re-styled as the \"Capets\" by the newborn Republic. On 11 December, at the beginning of his trial, Louis XVI was separated from his family.\nNaming.\nAt his birth, Louis-Charles, a \"Fils de France\" (\"Son of France\"), was given the title of Duke of Normandy, and, on 4 June 1789, when Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France, his elder brother, died, the four-year-old became Dauphin of France, a title he held until September 1791, when France became a constitutional monarchy. Under the new constitution, the heir-apparent to the throne of France, formerly referred to as the \"Dauphin\", was restyled the \"Prince Royal\". Louis-Charles held that title until the fall of the monarchy on 21 September 1792. At the death of his father on 21 January 1793, royalists and foreign powers intent on restoring the monarchy held him to be the new king of France, with the title of Louis XVII. From his exile in Hamm, in today's North Rhine-Westphalia, his uncle, the Count of Provence and future Louis XVIII, who had emigrated on 21 June 1791, appointed himself Regent for the young imprisoned king.\nPrison and rumours of escape.\n1793: In the care of Antoine Simon.\nImmediately following Louis XVI's execution, plots were hatched for the escape of the prisoners from the Temple, the chief of these plots were engineered by the Chevalier de Jarjayes, the Baron de Batz, and Lady Atkyns. Others said to be involved in his escape(s) are Paul Barras and Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais.\nOn 3 July, Louis-Charles was separated from his mother and put in the care of Antoine Simon, a cobbler who had been named his guardian by the Committee of Public Safety. The tales told by royalist writers of the cruelty inflicted by Simon and his wife on the child have not been proved. Louis Charles' sister, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, wrote in her memoires about the \"monster Simon\", as did Alcide Beauchesne. Antoine Simon's wife Marie-Jeanne, in fact, took great care of the child's person. Stories survive narrating how he was encouraged to eat and drink to excess and learned the language of the gutter. The foreign secretaries of Britain and Spain also heard accounts from their spies that the boy was raped by prostitutes in order to infect him with venereal diseases to supply the Commune with manufactured \"evidence\" against the Queen. However, the scenes related by Alcide de Beauchesne of the physical torment of the child are not supported by any testimony, though he was at this time seen by a great number of people.\nOn 6 October, Pache, Chaumette, Jacques H\u00e9bert and others visited the boy and secured his signature to charges of sexual molestation against his mother and his aunt. The next day he met his elder sister Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Charlotte for the last time.\n1794: Illness.\nOn 19 January 1794, the Simons left the Temple, after securing a receipt for the safe transfer of their ward, who was declared to be in good health. A large part of the Temple records from that time onward disappeared under the Bourbon Restoration, making ascertaining of the facts impossible. Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to have been put in a dark room that was barricaded like the cage of a wild animal. The story recounts that food was passed through the bars to the boy, who survived despite the accumulated filth of his surroundings.\nMaximilien Robespierre visited Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se on 11 May, but no one, according to the legend, entered the boy's room for six months until Paul Barras visited the prison after the 9th Thermidor (27 July 1794). Barras's account of the visit describes the child as suffering from extreme neglect, but conveys no idea of the alleged walling-in. The boy made no complaint to Barras of any ill treatment. He was then cleaned and re-clothed. His room was cleaned, and during the day he was visited by his new attendant, Jean Jacques Christophe Laurent (1770\u20131807), a creole from Martinique. From 8 November onward, Laurent had assistance from a man named Gomin.\nLouis-Charles was then taken out for fresh air and walks on the roof of the Tower. From about the time of Gomin's arrival, he was inspected, not by delegates of the Commune, but by representatives of the civil committee of the 48 sections of Paris. From the end of October onward, the child maintained silence, explained by Laurent as a determination taken on the day he made his deposition against his mother. On 19 December 1794, he was visited by three commissioners from the Committee of Public Safety\u00a0\u2014 Jean-Baptiste Harmand, Jean-Baptiste Charles Matthieu and Jacques Reverchon\u00a0\u2014 but they failed to get the boy to say anything at all.\n1795: Death.\nOn 31 March 1795, \u00c9tienne Lasne was appointed to be the child's guardian in place of Laurent. In May that year the boy was seriously ill, and a doctor, P. J. Desault, who had visited him seven months earlier, was summoned. However, on 1 June, Desault himself died suddenly, not without suspicion of poison, and it was some days before doctors Philippe-Jean Pelletan and Jean-Baptiste Dumangin were called.\nLouis-Charles died on 8 June 1795. The next day an autopsy was conducted by Pelletan. In the report it was stated that a child apparently about 10 years of age, \"which the commissioners told us was the late Louis Capet's son\", had died of a scrofulous infection of long standing. \"Scrofula\" as it was previously known, is nowadays called \"tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis\" referring to a lymphadenitis (chronic lymph node swelling or infection) of the neck (cervical lymph nodes) associated with tuberculosis. During the autopsy, the physician Dr. Pelletan was shocked to see the countless scars which covered the boy's body, evidently the result of the physical mistreatment which the child had suffered while imprisoned in the Temple.\nLouis-Charles was buried on 10 June in the Sainte Marguerite cemetery, but no stone was erected to mark the spot. A skull was found there in 1846 and identified as his, though later re-examination in 1893 showed it to be from a teenager and therefore unlikely to be his.\nHeart of Louis-Charles.\nFollowing a tradition of preserving royal hearts, Louis-Charles's heart was removed and smuggled out during the autopsy by the overseeing physician, Philippe-Jean Pelletan. Thus, Louis-Charles' heart was not interred with the rest of the body. Dr. Pelletan stored the smuggled heart in distilled wine in order to preserve it. However, after 8 to 10 years the distilled wine had evaporated, and the heart was from that time kept dry.\nAfter the Restoration in 1815, Dr. Pelletan attempted to give the heart to Louis-Charles's uncle, Louis XVIII; the latter refused because he could not bring himself to believe that it was the heart of his nephew. Dr. Pelletan then donated the heart to the Archbishop of Paris, Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu\u00e9len. Following the Revolution of 1830, and the plundering of the Archbishop's Palace of Paris, Pelletan's son Philippe-Gabriel found the relic among the ruins and placed it in the crystal urn in which it is still kept today. After the younger Pelletan's death in 1879, it passed to \u00c9douard Dumont.\nIt was later offered to Carlos, Duke of Madrid in 1895, a pretender to the throne of France and Spain, nephew (both biological and in-law) of the Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este. The offer was accepted and the relic was held near Vienna at Schloss Frohsdorf. In 1909, Carlos's son, Jaime, Duke of Madrid, inherited the heart, and gave it to his sister, Beatriz de Borb\u00f3n (1874\u20131961), wife of Prince Fabrizio Massimo (1868\u20131944), and in 1938, to their daughter Maria della Neve, wife of Charles Piercy.\nFinally Maria della Neve offered the heart to Jacques de Bauffremont, president of the Memorial of the Basilica of St Denis in Paris. He in turn put the heart and its crystal urn in the basilica's necropolis of the Kings of France, the burial place of Louis-Charles's parents and other members of the French royal family.\nThere it rested undisturbed until December 1999, when public notaries witnessed the removal of a section of the muscle of the heart's aorta and its transfer into a sealed envelope, and subsequently the opening of the same sealed envelope in the laboratory for it to be tested.\nIt was in 2000 that the historian Philippe Delorme arranged for DNA testing of the heart as well as bone samples from one of the many historical claimants to Louis-Charles's identity, namely Karl Wilhelm Naundorff, a German clockmaker. Ernst Brinkmann of M\u00fcnster University and Belgian genetics professor Jean-Jacques Cassiman of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, conducted mitochondrial DNA tests using a strand of the hair of the boy's mother, Marie Antoinette, and other samples from her sisters Maria Johanna Gabriela and Maria Josepha, their mother, Empress Maria Theresa, and two living direct descendants in the strict maternal line of Maria Theresa, namely Queen Anne of Romania and her brother, Prince Andr\u00e9 of Bourbon-Parma, maternal relatives of Louis XVII. The tests proved both that Naundorff was not the dauphin, and the heart was that of Louis-Charles.\nOf these results, historian Jean Tulard wrote: \"This [mummified] heart is ... almost certainly that of Louis XVII. We can never be 100 per cent sure but this is about as sure as it gets\".\nIn the light of this conclusion, French Legitimists organized the heart's solemn burial in the Basilica of St Denis on 8 June 2004. The burial took place in connection with a mass and during the ceremony 12-year-old Prince Amaury of Bourbon-Parma carried the heart and placed it in a niche beside the tombs of Louis-Charles' parents, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.\nIt was the first time in over a century that a royal ceremony had taken place in France, complete with the fleur-de-lis standard and a royal crown.\nLost Dauphin claimants.\nAs rumors quickly spread that the body buried was not that of Louis-Charles and that he had been spirited away alive by sympathizers, the legend of the \"Lost Dauphin\" was born. When the Bourbon monarchy was restored in 1814, some one hundred claimants came forward. Would-be royal heirs continued to appear across Europe for decades afterward.\nNaundorff.\nKarl Wilhelm Naundorff was a German clockmaker whose story rested on a series of complicated intrigues. According to him, Paul Barras determined to save the Dauphin in order to please Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, the future empress, having conceived the idea of using the Dauphin's existence as a means of dominating the comte de Provence in the event of a restoration. The Dauphin was concealed in the fourth storey of the Tower, a wooden figure being substituted for him. Laurent, to protect himself from the consequences of the substitution, replaced the wooden figure with a deaf mute, who was presently exchanged for the scrofulous child of the death certificate. The deaf mute was also concealed in the Temple. It was not the dead child, but the Dauphin who left the prison in the coffin, to be retrieved by friends before it reached the cemetery.\nNaundorff arrived in Berlin in 1810, with papers giving the name Karl Wilhelm Naundorff. He said he was escaping persecution and settled at Spandau in 1812 as a clockmaker, marrying Johanna Einert in 1818. In 1822 he removed to Brandenburg an der Havel, and in 1828 to Crossen, near Frankfurt (Oder). He was imprisoned from 1825 to 1828 for coining, though apparently on insufficient evidence, and in 1833 came to push his claims in Paris, where he was recognized as the Dauphin by many persons formerly connected with the court of Louis XVI. Expelled from France in 1836, the day after bringing a suit against Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Duchess of Angoul\u00eame for the restitution of the Dauphin's private property, he lived in exile until his death at Delft on 10 August 1845, and his tomb was inscribed \"Louis XVII., roi de France et de Navarre (Charles Louis, duc de Normandie)\". The Dutch authorities who had inscribed on his death certificate the name of Charles Louis de Bourbon, duc de Normandie (Louis XVII) permitted his son to bear the name de Bourbon, and when the family appealed in 1850\u201351, and again in 1874, for the restitution of their civil rights as heirs of Louis XVI, no less an advocate than Jules Favre pled their cause.\nHowever, DNA testing conducted in 1993 proved that Naundorff was not the Dauphin.\nRichemont.\nBaron de Richemont's tale that Jeanne Simon, who was genuinely attached to him, smuggled him out in a basket, is simple and more credible, and does not necessarily invalidate the story of the subsequent operations with the deaf mute and the scrofulous patient, Laurent in that case being deceived from the beginning, but it renders them extremely unlikely. Richemont, alias \"Henri \u00c9thelbert-Louis-Hector H\u00e9bert\", began to put forward his claims in Paris in 1828. He died in 1853.\nWilliams.\nReverend Eleazer Williams was a Protestant missionary from Wisconsin of Mohawk Native American descent. While at the house Francis Vinton, William began shaking and trembling upon seeing a portrait of Antoine Simon, a member of the sans-culottes, saying of the portrait that it had \"haunted me, day, and night, as long as I can remember.\" Simon was rumored to have physically abused the Dauphin while he was imprisoned at the Temple. Francis Vinton was convinced by Eleazar William's reaction that Williams was Louis-Charles. Williams claimed he had no recollection of how he escaped his imprisonment at the Temple, or of his early years in France.\nWilliams was a missionary to Native Americans when, according to him, the prince de Joinville, son of Louis-Philippe, met him, and after some conversation asked him to sign a document abdicating his rights in favor of Louis-Philippe, in return for which he, the Dauphin (alias Eleazar Williams), was to receive the private inheritance which was his. This Eleazar Williams refused. Williams's story is generally regarded as false. However, other elements published in 1897 provide some grounds for doubt.\nReevaluations by modern historians.\nThe death of Louis XVII, officially attributed to scrofulous tuberculosis on 8 June 1795, remains one of the most tragic and contested events of the French Revolution. While the official records present a sanitized version of his demise, numerous contemporaneous accounts and modern investigations suggest that the boy endured prolonged psychological and physical torment tantamount to martyrdom.\nFollowing the execution of his father Louis XVI in January 1793 and his mother Marie Antoinette in October of the same year, the young prince was declared by royalists as Louis XVII.\nIn July 1793, he was forcibly separated from his family and placed in the care of Antoine Simon, a cobbler appointed by the Committee of Public Safety. There, Louis-Charles was subjected to forced intoxication, coercion, and alleged physical abuse designed to extract false testimony against his mother. \nAfter Simon\u2019s departure in January 1794, the child was left in complete isolation in a sealed cell of the Temple Tower, often in darkness, with no education, no hygiene, and only the most basic sustenance.\nMultiple witnesses, including guards who later testified, reported that the child was left for months without clean clothes or any meaningful human contact. Vermin infested his cell, and his own excrement accumulated in corners of the room. He was no longer able to walk due to joint contractures and festering sores, and he reportedly spoke rarely, having suffered severe psychological deterioration. Eyewitnesses described him as ghostlike, covered in scabs, ulcers, and filth, with one guard calling him \u201ca corpse who breathed.\u201d\nOn 8 June 1795, after two years of increasing physical decay, Louis XVII died in his cell at the age of 10. His autopsy was performed the following day by four physicians, including Philippe-Jean Pelletan. The report cited tuberculosis and gastric inflammation as causes of death, but notably lacked a full description of his physical condition. No formal identification of the body was made. Pelletan removed and preserved the heart, later identified in the 2000s by mitochondrial DNA analysis as being consistent with the maternal lineage of Marie Antoinette. This analysis, comparing the DNA of the heart with authenticated samples from Marie Antoinette\u2019s family, confirmed that the boy who died in the Temple Tower was indeed her biological son, Louis-Charles.\nHowever, the rest of the body was buried without ceremony in a mass grave. When remains believed to be his were exhumed in 1846 from the Sainte-Marguerite cemetery, forensic analysis revealed they belonged to a person aged 18\u201320 years \u2014 not a child. Later studies showed the skeleton included bones from multiple individuals. Thus, while the heart\u2019s provenance has been confirmed, the boy\u2019s full remains have likely been lost.\nThe absence of formal recognition, the vague autopsy, and the rapid burial have fueled widespread criticism that the revolutionary authorities sought to obscure the true extent of his suffering and avoid accountability. Modern scholars such as Deborah Cadbury and Jean Tulard have described his treatment as institutionalized child abuse, with some characterizing him as a political child martyr.\nLouis XVII's story continues to resonate in French historical memory \nas a symbol of innocence caught in ideological conflict. \nAlthough no monument marks his true grave, \nhis fate is often cited in scholarly and cultural discussions \nas an example of the human cost of political fanaticism \nand the silent tragedies that can be obscured \nduring periods of radical change. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nPrimary sources\nOther material"}

Her father is a psychoanalyst, and her mother a child therapist. Her parents separated when she was eight years old. Her father is Jewish; his parents were Holocaust survivors from Poland and Russia who changed their surname from Goldreich. After being discovered for her first role at the age of 14, Godr\u00e8che left school and moved away from her parents to begin her acting career. In 1987, at the age of 14, she was in a relationship with director Beno\u00eet Jacquot, 25 years her senior, who first directed her in the film \"Les mendiants\" and later made \"The Disenchanted\" with her. In later years, Godr\u00e8che would accuse Jacquot of grooming and sexually abusing her.\nCareer.\nHer early work included commercial modeling for a Japanese chocolate maker, as well as a teen magazine. Her first film appearance was as Claudia Cardinale's daughter in \"L'\u00e9t\u00e9 prochain\". At 14, she obtained her first major role, in Jacquot's \"Les mendiants,\" with Dominique Sanda.\nIn 1989, Godr\u00e8che starred in Jacques Doillon's \"The 15 Year Old Girl\" with Melvil Poupaud, which brought her fame. The following year, she turned to a full-time career in film. In 1990, she was nominated for the C\u00e9sar Award for Most Promising Actress for her performance in Jacquot's \"La d\u00e9senchant\u00e9e\".\nIn 1991, she was a member of the jury at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival.\nIn 1994, her novel \"Point de c\u00f4t\u00e9\" was published in France by Broch\u00e9 Publishers to good reviews.\nGodr\u00e8che was not well known to American audiences until Patrice Leconte's \"Ridicule\" was released in 1996. The film introduced her to Americans in the role of Mathilde de Bellegarde. In 1998 she starred with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jeremy Irons in \"The Man in the Iron Mask\".\nGodr\u00e8che was nominated for a 2002 C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the surprise European hit, \"L'Auberge espagnole\".\nHer first record inspired from the film \"Toutes les filles pleurent\" was released by Because Music.\nIn 2012, she began playing the continuing character of Claudette Von Jurgens in season 3 of \"Royal Pains\".\nGodr\u00e8che's performance as Charlotte in the film \"The Overnight\" has led to her being called a \"breakout\" star of 2015. She is also starring in an upcoming HBO comedy about a French actress who moves to Los Angeles.\nPersonal life.\nGodr\u00e8che had a long-term relationship since 1987 with Beno\u00eet Jacquot who was 25 years her senior. She was briefly married to Philippe Michel, an architect, in 1996. She was later married to comedian Dany Boon from 1998 to 2002. Together they have a son, No\u00e9, born 4 September 1999. In 2004, she began a relationship with actor and director Maurice Barth\u00e9lemy, who is the father of her daughter, Tess, born 19 April 2005. The couple split in 2014.\nGodr\u00e8che has considered formally converting to Judaism as an adult, which she attributed to her close relationship with her paternal grandparents.\nSexual violence charges against Beno\u00eet Jacquot and Jacques Doillon.\nIn February 2024, Godr\u00e8che filed police charges against Jacques Doillon and Beno\u00eet Jacquot for sexual assault committed in the 1980s when she was a minor. At the 49th C\u00e9sar Awards on 23 February 2024, Godr\u00e8che gave a speech on sexual violence and addressed France's omert\u00e0 around #MeToo. In May 2024, Godr\u00e8che was added to the Official Selection at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, where she presented her short film (Me Too). The film highlights the stories of victims of sexual violence. It was created after Godr\u00e8che made a public appeal through her Instagram account, after which around 6,000 people replied. It was screened during the opening ceremony of the festival's \"Un Certain Regard\" section and free to the public on 15 May as part of the \"Cin\u00e9ma de la Plage\" program. \nOn 1 July 2024, Jacquot and Doillon were each questioned over Godr\u00e8che's rape and sexual assault claim. The two directors would also be taken into custody by the Juvenile Protection Brigade. On 3 July 2024, Jacquot was criminally charged with raping two other actresses.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The use of either term is allowed under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.\nThe main divisions of land plants are the Marchantiophyta (liverworts), Anthocerotophyta (hornworts), Bryophyta (mosses), Filicophyta (ferns), Sphenophyta (horsetails), Cycadophyta (cycads), Ginkgophyta (ginkgo)s, Pinophyta (conifers), Gnetophyta (gnetophytes), and the Magnoliophyta (Angiosperms, flowering plants). The Magnoliophyta now dominate terrestrial ecosystems, comprising 80% of vascular plant species.\nIn zoology, the term \"division\" is applied to an optional rank subordinate to the infraclass and superordinate to the legion and cohort. A widely used classification (e.g. Carroll 1988) recognises teleost fishes as a Division Teleostei within Class Actinopterygii (the ray-finned fishes). Less commonly (as in Milner 1988), living tetrapods are ranked as Divisions Amphibia and Amniota within the clade of vertebrates with fleshy limbs (Sarcopterygii).\nProposals for standardisation.\nIn 1978, a group of botanists including Harold Charles Bold, Arthur Cronquist and Lynn Margulis proposed replacing the term \"division\" with \"phylum\" in botanical nomenclature, arguing that maintaining different terms for the same taxonomic rank across biological kingdoms created unnecessary confusion. This was particularly problematic for unicellular eukaryotes, where heterotrophic organisms were classified under zoological nomenclature (using \"phylum\") while autotrophic organisms fell under botanical nomenclature (using \"division\"). They proposed updating the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature to use \"phylum\" and \"subphylum\" throughout, while maintaining that names originally published as divisions would be treated as if they had been published as phyla.\nMolecular phylogenetic classification.\nThe use of molecular methods, particularly 16S ribosomal RNA analysis, helped establish major bacterial divisions in the 1980s. In 1985, Carl Woese and colleagues identified ten major groups of eubacteria through oligonucleotide signature analysis, noting that these groupings were \"appropriately termed eubacterial Phyla or Divisions.\" This work provided early molecular evidence for the equivalence of bacterial divisions with phyla and helped establish a phylogenetic basis for high-level bacterial classification.\nViruses and prokaryotes.\nIn 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) formalised a 15-rank hierarchical classification system, ranging from the highest rank \"realm\" (rather than domain) down through the lower ranks, notably using \"phylum\" rather than \"division\". Under this system, the first viral realm established was \"Riboviria\", encompassing all RNA viruses that encode an RNA-directed RNA polymerase.\nIn 2021, the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) formally included the rank of phylum for the first time, adopting the suffix \"-ota\" for phylum names. This led to the publication of names for 46 prokaryotic phyla with cultured representatives, replacing some established names with neologisms \u2013 for example, \"Proteobacteria\" became \"Pseudomonadota\" and \"Firmicutes\" became \"Bacillota\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Intuitively, the genus is the number of \"holes\" of a surface. A sphere has genus 0, while a torus has genus 1.\nTopology.\nOrientable surfaces.\nThe genus of a connected, orientable surface is an integer representing the maximum number of cuttings along non-intersecting closed simple curves without rendering the resultant manifold disconnected. It is equal to the number of handles on it. Alternatively, it can be defined in terms of the Euler characteristic formula_1, via the relationship formula_2 for closed surfaces, where formula_3 is the genus. For surfaces with formula_4 boundary components, the equation reads formula_5.\nIn layman's terms, the genus is the number of \"holes\" an object has (\"holes\" interpreted in the sense of doughnut holes; a hollow sphere would be considered as having zero holes in this sense). A torus has 1 such hole, while a sphere has 0. The green surface pictured above has 2 holes of the relevant sort.\nFor instance:\nExplicit construction of surfaces of the genus \"g\" is given in the article on the fundamental polygon.\nNon-orientable surfaces.\nThe non-orientable genus, demigenus, or Euler genus of a connected, non-orientable closed surface is a positive integer representing the number of cross-caps attached to a sphere. Alternatively, it can be defined for a closed surface in terms of the Euler characteristic \u03c7, via the relationship \u03c7 = 2 \u2212 \"k\", where \"k\" is the non-orientable genus.\nFor instance:\nKnot.\nThe genus of a knot \"K\" is defined as the minimal genus of all Seifert surfaces for \"K\". A Seifert surface of a knot is however a manifold with boundary, the boundary being the knot, i.e.\nhomeomorphic to the unit circle. The genus of such a surface is defined to be the genus of the two-manifold, which is obtained by gluing the unit disk along the boundary.\nHandlebody.\nThe genus of a 3-dimensional handlebody is an integer representing the maximum number of cuttings along embedded disks without rendering the resultant manifold disconnected. It is equal to the number of handles on it.\nFor instance:\nGraph theory.\nThe genus of a graph is the minimal integer \"n\" such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with \"n\" handles (i.e. an oriented surface of the genus \"n\"). Thus, a planar graph has genus 0, because it can be drawn on a sphere without self-crossing.\nThe non-orientable genus of a graph is the minimal integer \"n\" such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with \"n\" cross-caps (i.e. a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus \"n\"). (This number is also called the demigenus.)\nThe Euler genus is the minimal integer \"n\" such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with \"n\" cross-caps or on a sphere with \"n/2\" handles.\nIn topological graph theory there are several definitions of the genus of a group. Arthur T. White introduced the following concept. The genus of a group \"G\" is the minimum genus of a (connected, undirected) Cayley graph for \"G\".\nThe graph genus problem is NP-complete.\nAlgebraic geometry.\nThere are two related definitions of genus of any projective algebraic scheme formula_7: the arithmetic genus and the geometric genus. When formula_7 is an algebraic curve with field of definition the complex numbers, and if formula_7 has no singular points, then these definitions agree and coincide with the topological definition applied to the Riemann surface of formula_7 (its manifold of complex points). For example, the definition of elliptic curve from algebraic geometry is \"connected non-singular projective curve of genus 1 with a given rational point on it\".\nBy the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem, an irreducible plane curve of degree formula_11 given by the vanishing locus of a section formula_12 has geometric genus\nformula_13\nwhere formula_14 is the number of singularities when properly counted.\nDifferential geometry.\nIn differential geometry, a genus of an oriented manifold formula_15 may be defined as a complex number formula_16 subject to the conditions\nIn other words, formula_22 is a ring homomorphism formula_23, where formula_24 is Thom's oriented cobordism ring.\nThe genus formula_22 is multiplicative for all bundles on spinor manifolds with a connected compact structure if formula_26 is an elliptic integral such as formula_27 for some formula_28 This genus is called an elliptic genus. \nThe Euler characteristic formula_29 is not a genus in this sense since it is not invariant concerning cobordisms.\nBiology.\nGenus can be also calculated for the graph spanned by the net of chemical interactions in nucleic acids or proteins. In particular, one may study the growth of the genus along the chain. Such a function (called the genus trace) shows the topological complexity and domain structure of biomolecules.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Dmbox/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIndex of articles associated with the same name\nThis includes a list of related items that share the same name (or similar names). &lt;br&gt; If an [ internal link] incorrectly led you here, you may wish to change the link to point directly to the intended article."}

This transport process is called translocation. In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Ancient Greek word (\"phloi\u00f3s\"), meaning \"bark\". The term was introduced by Carl N\u00e4geli in 1858. Different types of phloem can be distinguished. The early phloem formed in the growth apices is called protophloem. Protophloem eventually becomes obliterated once it connects to the durable phloem in mature organs, the metaphloem. Further, secondary phloem is formed during the thickening of stem structures.\nStructure.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nCross section of some phloem cells \nPhloem tissue consists of conducting cells, generally called sieve elements, parenchyma cells, including both specialized companion cells or albuminous cells and unspecialized cells and supportive cells, such as fibres and sclereids.\nConducting cells (sieve elements).\nSieve tube elements are the type of cell that are responsible for transporting sugars throughout the plant. At maturity they lack a nucleus and have very few organelles, so they rely on companion cells or albuminous cells for most of their metabolic needs. Sieve tube cells do contain vacuoles and other organelles, such as ribosomes, before they mature, but these generally migrate to the cell wall and dissolve at maturity; this ensures there is little to impede the movement of fluids. One of the few organelles they do contain at maturity is the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which can be found at the plasma membrane, often nearby the plasmodesmata that connect them to their companion or albuminous cells. All sieve cells have groups of pores at their ends that grow from modified and enlarged plasmodesmata, called \"sieve areas\". The pores are reinforced by platelets of a polysaccharide called callose.\nParenchyma cells.\nOther parenchyma cells within the phloem are generally undifferentiated and used for food storage.\nCompanion cells.\nThe metabolic functioning of sieve-tube members depends on a close association with the \"companion cells\", a specialized form of parenchyma cell. All of the cellular functions of a sieve-tube element are carried out by the (much smaller) companion cell, a typical nucleate plant cell except the companion cell usually has a larger number of ribosomes and mitochondria. The dense cytoplasm of a companion cell is connected to the sieve-tube element by plasmodesmata. The common sidewall shared by a sieve tube element and a companion cell has large numbers of plasmodesmata.\nThere are three types of companion cells.\nAlbuminous cells.\nAlbuminous cells have a similar role to companion cells, but are associated with sieve cells only and are hence found only in seedless vascular plants and gymnosperms.\nSupportive cells.\nAlthough its primary function is transport of sugars, phloem may also contain cells that have a mechanical support function. These are sclerenchyma cells which generally fall into two categories: fibres and sclereids. Both cell types have a secondary cell wall and are dead at maturity. The secondary cell wall increases their rigidity and tensile strength, especially because they contain lignin.\nFibres.\nBast fibres are the long, narrow supportive cells that provide tension strength without limiting flexibility. They are also found in xylem, and are the main component of many textiles such as paper, linen, and cotton.\nSclereids.\nSclereids are irregularly shaped cells that add compression strength but may reduce flexibility to some extent. They also serve as anti-herbivory structures, as their irregular shape and hardness will increase wear on teeth as the herbivores chew. For example, they are responsible for the gritty texture in pears, and in winter pears.\nFunction.\nUnlike xylem (which is composed primarily of dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap. The sap is a water-based solution, but rich in sugars made by photosynthesis. These sugars are transported to non-photosynthetic parts of the plant, such as the roots, or into storage structures, such as tubers or bulbs.\nDuring the plant's growth period, usually during the spring, storage organs such as the roots are sugar sources, and the plant's many growing areas are sugar sinks. The movement in phloem is multidirectional, whereas, in xylem cells, it is unidirectional (upward).\nAfter the growth period, when the meristems are dormant, the leaves are sources, and storage organs are sinks. Developing seed-bearing organs (such as fruit) are always sinks. Because of this multi-directional flow, coupled with the fact that sap cannot move with ease between adjacent sieve-tubes, it is not unusual for sap in adjacent sieve-tubes to be flowing in opposite directions.\nWhile movement of water and minerals through the xylem is driven by negative pressures (tension) most of the time, movement through the phloem is driven by positive hydrostatic pressures. This process is termed \"translocation\", and is accomplished by a process called phloem loading and \"unloading\".\nPhloem sap is also thought to play a role in sending informational signals throughout vascular plants. \"Loading and unloading patterns are largely determined by the conductivity and number of plasmodesmata and the position-dependent function of solute-specific, plasma membrane transport proteins. Recent evidence indicates that mobile proteins and RNA are part of the plant's long-distance communication signaling system. Evidence also exists for the directed transport and sorting of macromolecules as they pass through plasmodesmata.\"\nOrganic molecules such as sugars, amino acids, certain phytohormones, and even messenger RNAs are transported in the phloem through sieve tube elements.\nPhloem is also used as a popular site for oviposition and breeding of insects belonging to the order Diptera, including the fruit fly \"Drosophila montana\".\nGirdling.\nBecause phloem tubes are located outside the xylem in most plants, a tree or other plant can be killed by stripping away the bark in a ring on the trunk or stem. With the phloem destroyed, nutrients cannot reach the roots, and the tree/plant will die. Trees located in areas with animals such as beavers are vulnerable since beavers chew off the bark at a fairly precise height. This process is known as girdling, or ring-barking, and can be used for agricultural purposes. For example, enormous fruits and vegetables seen at fairs and carnivals are produced via girdling. A farmer would place a girdle at the base of a large branch, and remove all but one fruit/vegetable from that branch. Thus, all the sugars manufactured by leaves on that branch have no sinks to go to but the one fruit/vegetable, which thus expands to many times its normal size.\nOrigin.\nWhen the plant is an embryo, vascular tissue emerges from procambium tissue, which is at the center of the embryo. Protophloem itself appears in the mid-vein extending into the cotyledonary node, which constitutes the first appearance of a leaf in angiosperms, where it forms continuous strands. The hormone auxin, transported by the protein PIN1 is responsible for the growth of those protophloem strands, signaling the final identity of those tissues. SHORTROOT (SHR), and microRNA165/166 also participate in that process, while Callose Synthase\u00a03 inhibits the locations where SHR, and microRNA165 can go. Additionally, the expression of NAC45/86 genes during phloem differentiation functions to enucleate specific cells in the plants to produce the sieve elements.\nIn the embryo, root phloem develops independently in the upper hypocotyl, which lies between the embryonic root, and the cotyledon.\nIn an adult, the phloem originates, and grows outwards from, meristematic cells in the vascular cambium. Phloem is produced in phases. Primary phloem is laid down by the apical meristem and develops from the procambium. \"Secondary\" phloem is laid down by the vascular cambium to the inside of the established layer(s) of phloem. The molecular control of phloem development from stem cell to mature sieve element is best understood for the primary root of the model plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\".\nIn some eudicot families (Apocynaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, Thymelaeaceae), phloem also develops on the inner side of the vascular cambium; in this case, a distinction between \"external\" and \"internal\" or \"intraxylary\" phloem is made. Internal phloem is mostly primary, and begins differentiation later than the external phloem and protoxylem, though it is not without exceptions. In some other families (Amaranthaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Salvadoraceae), the cambium also periodically forms inward strands or layers of phloem, embedded in the xylem: Such phloem strands are called \"included\" or \"interxylary\" phloem.\nTransportation:\nThey can be taken up through two processes, either an active process or a passive process of absorption, the water is that the absorption of the movement of water without a lot of energy, and do not require any energy within the process, but in active transporting the water and mineral are only taken up by the use of ATP energy, through a more active process.\nNutritional use.\nPhloem of pine trees has been used in Finland and Scandinavia as a substitute food in times of famine and even in good years in the northeast. Supplies of phloem from previous years helped stave off starvation in the great famine of the 1860s which hit both Finland and Sweden. Phloem is dried and milled to flour (\"pettu\" in Finnish) and mixed with rye to form a hard dark bread, bark bread. The least appreciated was \"silkko\", a bread made only from buttermilk and \"pettu\" without any real rye or cereal flour. Recently, \"pettu\" has again become available as a curiosity, and some have made claims of health benefits.\nPhloem from silver birch has been also used to make flour in the past.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He popularized several early Delta blues songs, such as \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\", \"Walkin' Blues\", and \"Baby, Please Don't Go\", and recorded songs that went on to become blues standards, including \"Hoochie Coochie Man\", \"Mannish Boy\", and \"Got My Mojo Working\". During his recording career from 1941 to 1981, he recorded primarily for two record companies, Aristocrat/Chess and Blue Sky; they issued 62 singles and 13 studio albums (as with most postwar blues musicians, his recordings were released as two-song singles until the 1960s, when the focus shifted to long-playing albums).\nWhile he was living in Mississippi, Waters was recorded by Alan Lomax in 1941 for a U.S. Library of Congress folk music project. Two songs were released on a 78 rpm record, \"Country Blues\" and \"I Be's Troubled\". After moving to Chicago, he recorded for Leonard Chess and Aristocrat issued Waters's first single in 1947. In 1950, Chess bought out his label partners and formed Chess Records. From 1950 to 1958, Chess issued 15 singles that reached the top 10 of \"Billboard\" magazine's R&amp;B chart. Among the many albums the label released are the influential early compilation \"The Best of Muddy Waters\" (1958) and the live \"At Newport 1960\".\nAfter Chess went out of business in 1975, Waters recorded several successful albums for Blue Sky. Produced by blues rock singer and guitarist Johnny Winter, \"Hard Again\" (1977), \"I'm Ready\" (1978), and \"Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters \u2013 Live\" (1978) won Grammy Awards for \"Best Ethnic or Traditional Recordings\". As a sideman, Waters also contributed to recordings by Little Walter, Junior Wells, Otis Spann, and others. After Waters's death in 1983, a large number of compilation and live albums have been issued by various record companies, often with significant overlap and duplication. The double disc \"\" (2001) is ranked at number 483 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's 2020 list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".\nFor an in depth, illustrated discography, see https://www.wirz.de/music/waters.htm\nSelected live albums.\nSince Waters's death in 1983, a large number of live albums have been released by a variety of record companies. According to biographer Robert Gordon, \"much of it comes from the latter years and the recordings tend to blend.\" However, some were well-received and appeared on \"Billboard's\" Blues albums chart.\nSelected compilation albums.\nMuddy Waters's original two-song singles recorded for Chess were later released on various \"Best of\" and anthology albums. Over the years, many were repackaged with new titles and re-sequenced, with the earlier versions going out-of-print. In the 1990s, Chess's successor, MCA Records, began releasing compilations, sometimes focusing on different periods during Waters's career as well as broader overviews. Around the same time, Charly Records also released a number of albums of Chess recordings, including the nine CD set \"The Complete Muddy Waters 1947\u20131967\" (1992). After years of litigation, MCA was able to stop Charly from using Chess material without authorization.\nSingles.\nMuddy Waters's first 78 rpm record in 1941 listed him using his birth name, McKinley Morganfield. The late 1940s\u2013mid-1950s record releases by Aristocrat Records and Chess Records sometimes used \"Muddy Waters and His Guitar\" as well as Muddy Waters. From the late 1950s on, he is identified as Muddy Waters.\nNotes.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences"}

It serves as an example of sexually deceptive pollination and floral mimicry, a highly selective and highly evolved plant\u2013pollinator relationship.\nDescription.\n\"Ophrys apifera\" grows to a height of . This hardy orchid develops small rosettes of leaves in autumn that continue to grow slowly during winter. Basal leaves are ovate or oblong-lanceolate, and upper leaves and bracts are ovate-lanceolate and sheathing. Leaves exhibit parallel venation. \nThe plant blooms from mid-April in continental Europe, but in the United Kingdom it flowers June to July. A flower spike is produced, composed from one to twelve flowers. Three large, purple sepals surround the base of the flower, which can easily be mistaken for petals. The true petals lie just above the sepals as two short, pubescent green structures protruding laterally from a central column. A third, modified petal, the labellum, sits at the bottom of the column as a landing pad for pollinators. The labellum is trilobed, with two pronounced humps on the hairy lateral lobes and a hairy median lobe having a pattern that mimics the abdomen of a bee. The pattern of labellum colouration is quite variable.\nThe central column is an adaptation unique to orchids, in which the stamens and pistil fused together to form one central rib. The anther cap can be found at the top, dorsal side of the column, while the stigma is hidden below on the ventral side. Two pollinia hang from the column over the labellum.\nDistribution.\n\"Ophrys apifera\" is widespread across central and southern Europe, as well as North Africa and the Middle East. Its range stretches from Portugal, Ireland and Denmark east to Iran and the Caucasus. It is quite common in the Mediterranean region eastwards to the Black Sea, (Codes) but is less common in its northern range being uncommon or local in Germany and Ireland.\nIn the United Kingdom, it has a distinct southeastern preference, being more common in England. Recently it has been found in the southwest of England in Butleigh near Glastonbury in Somerset and Dorchester, Dorset; whereas it is only to be found in coastal regions of Wales as well as the Hodbarrow Nature Reserve in Millom, Cumbria, and some parts of Northern Ireland. It is relatively common in the northeast of England and in recent years large numbers have appeared in the grass verges surrounding the Metro Centre in Gateshead. In Scotland, it was thought to be extinct, but was rediscovered in Ayrshire in 2003. In some countries the plants have protected status. They are unusual in that in some years they appear in great numbers, then sometimes only reappear after an absence of many years.\nThe genus \"Ophrys\" is the most species-rich (i.e. diverse) genus of orchids in Europe and the Mediterranean with over 200 species, according to \"Orchids of Britain and Europe\" by Pierre Delforge.\nHabitat and ecology.\n\"Ophrys apifera\" generally grows on semi-dry turf, in grassland, on limestone, calcareous dunes or in open areas in woodland. It prefers well-drained calcareous soils, low in nutrients, in bright light or dim light. It is a major colonizer of sites disturbed by human activity, such as old quarries, roadside verges and airfields. \"O.\u00a0apifera\" is one of the most likely European orchid species to establish itself within towns and cities.\nIn order to extract sufficient nutrients from the substrata it grows in, \"Ophrys apifera\" relies upon a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi in the genus \"Tulasnella\", and possibly other genera.\nBee orchids are threatened by mowing during flowering, or before the seed has been released. However, they often also disappear from sites that become overgrown with shrubs and/or trees, as the orchids fail to compete with these large plants for light. For these reasons, bee orchids are often found on the edge of mown areas, beside paths or within areas that are mown very infrequently. The Sussex Wildlife Trust recommends mowing at the end of July and removing the cuttings to benefit bee orchids. In prehistory, the species presumably relied upon seasonal grazing pressure, or was limited to early succession habitats and permanent grassland.\nReproduction.\n\"Ophrys apifera\" has been considered to preferentially practice self-pollination. The flowers are almost exclusively self-pollinating in the northern ranges of the plant's distribution, however pollination by the solitary bee \"Eucera longicornis\" occurs in the Mediterranean region, where \"Ophrys apifera\" is more common. \"E.\u00a0longicornis\" males have been observed attempting to copulate with the flowers, which emit allomones that mimic the scent of the female bee. These allomones are also known to attract bee species \"Tetralonia cressa\" and \"Eucera pulveraceae\". In addition to chemosensory mimicry, the labellum of the flower acts as a visual decoy that the male bee confuses for a female. It is believed that male bees preferentially select orchids with the most bee-like labellum and attempt copulation, at which point the pollinia stick to the bee during the pseudocopulation. This achieves pollen transfer and, potentially, pollination.\n\"Ophrys\" like other orchids are dependent on symbiotic fungi at some point during their life cycle, but especially for germination, which may take months or even years underground. Orchid roots contain orchid mycorrhiza, coils of fungal hyphae inside orchid root cells.\nPhytochemistry.\nFloral parts display the presence of quercetin and kaempferol glycosides, which are supposed to be acylated, as well as cinnamic acid derivatives. The pink outer tepals show the presence of anthocyanins.\nCulture.\nThe name \"Ophrys\" derives from the Greek word ', meaning \"eyebrow.\" It is believed that women in ancient Rome used to darken their eyebrows with the orchid plant, thus giving it its name. The Latin specific epithet ' means \"bee-bearing\" or \"bee-bringing\" and refers to the bee-shaped labellum of the orchid.\nIts root tubers were ground into a powder called salep in the Ottoman Empire, which was believed to have nutritional, medicinal, and aphrodisiac values. The product's popularity spread to England in the 17th and 18th century and then to a few other European countries. Salep is still used today in medicines and traditional dishes in Turkey, which was formerly the region of the Ottoman Empire, and throughout the Middle East. It is also a popular import in the Netherlands, Cyprus, and Germany for its supposed medicinal properties.\n\"Ophrys apifera\" is the county flower of Bedfordshire.\nThis species has appeared on postage stamps in many countries including Belgium, Cambodia, Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Slovenia, the United Kingdom and the USSR. In 2009 the bee orchid appeared in a series of stamps printed in the United Kingdom to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin's \"Origin of Species\".\nConservation.\nEcological concerns.\nThere are local extinctions of \"Ophrys spp\". and potentially \"O.\u00a0apifera\" in Turkey and Iran due to the excessive harvesting of wild orchids to produce salep products.\nSince \"O.\u00a0apifera\" relies heavily on its symbiotic relationship with \"Tulasnella\" fungi for survival, it is vulnerable to any chemicals, particularly fungicides, and threats which might reduce the fungi's prevalence.\nSpecies status.\nProtected species status in Northern Ireland.\nEndangered (EN) species status in Turkey, Ukraine, and Carpathian Mountains.\nCritically Endangered (CR) species status in Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nLaws/regulations.\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) named \"O.\u00a0apifera\" an endangered species that is potentially an object of trade, setting strict regulations on trade of salep products. Turkey, Iran, Germany, the Netherlands, and Cyprus are all Parties to CITES and, in theory, must follow those regulations.\nTurkey has banned the export of true salep (salep made from an orchid root).\nTaxonomy.\nThe specific evolutionary relationships between members of this genus are still poorly understood, and the best method for classifying orchid species and their variants is highly debated. Some researchers propose classifying species based on their pollination tactics, while others propose classifying them based on the type of chemical emitted from the flower. A widely used and generally accepted method of classification distinguishes orchid species based on flower morphology. The taxonomy of \"O.\u00a0apifera\" based on this classification scheme is as follows:\nKingdom Plantae, Phylum Tracheophyta, Subphylum Angiospermae, Class Liliopsida, Order Asparagales, Family Orchidaceae, Subfamily Orchidoideae, Genus \"Ophyrus\", Species \"O.\u00a0apifera\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61909", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61909", "title": "Ken Starr", "text": "American lawyer (1946\u20132022)\nKenneth Winston Starr (July 21, 1946 \u2013 September 13, 2022) was an American lawyer and judge who as independent counsel authored the Starr Report, which served as the basis of the impeachment of Bill Clinton. He headed an investigation of members of the Clinton administration, known as the Whitewater controversy, from 1994 to 1998. Starr previously served as a federal appellate judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1983 to 1989 and as the U.S. solicitor general from 1989 to 1993 during the presidency of George H. W. Bush.\nStarr received the most public attention for his tenure as independent counsel while Bill Clinton was U.S. president. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater real estate investments of Clinton. The three-judge panel charged with administering the Ethics in Government Act later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including suspected perjury about Clinton's sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. After more than four years of investigation, Starr filed the Starr Report, which alleged that Clinton lied about the existence of the affair during a sworn deposition. The allegation led to the impeachment of Clinton and the five-year suspension of Clinton's Arkansas law license.\nStarr served as the dean of the Pepperdine University School of Law. He was later both the president and the chancellor of Baylor University in Waco, Texas, from June 2010 until May and June 2016, respectively, and at the same time the Louise L. Morrison chair of constitutional law at Baylor Law School. On May 26, 2016, following an investigation into the mishandling by Starr of several sexual assaults at the school, Baylor University's board of regents announced that Starr's tenure as university president would end on May 31. The board said he would continue as chancellor, but on June 1, Starr resigned that position with immediate effect. On August 19, 2016, Starr announced he would also resign from his tenured professor position at Baylor Law School, completely severing his ties with the university in a \"mutually agreed separation\", following accusations that he ignored allegations of sexual assault on campus. On January 17, 2020, Starr joined President Donald Trump's legal team during his first impeachment trial.\nEarly life and education.\nStarr was born near Vernon, Texas, the son of Vannie Maude (Trimble) and Willie D. Starr, and was raised in Centerville, Texas. His father was a minister in the Churches of Christ who also worked as a barber. Starr attended Sam Houston High School in San Antonio and was a popular, straight\u2011A student. His classmates voted him most likely to succeed. In 1970, Starr married Alice Mendell, who was raised Jewish but converted to Christianity. They had three children.\nStarr attended the Churches of Christ\u2013affiliated Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas, where he was an honor student, a member of the Young Democrats, and a vocal supporter of Vietnam protesters. He later transferred to George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., where he received a Bachelor of Arts in history, in 1968. While there, he became a member of Delta Phi Epsilon.\nStarr was not drafted for military service during the Vietnam War, as he was classified 4\u2011F, because he had psoriasis. He worked in the Southwestern Advantage entrepreneurial program and later attended Brown University, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in 1969. Starr then attended the Duke University School of Law, where he was an editor of the \"Duke Law Journal\" and graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1973.\nLegal career.\nAfter he graduated from law school, Starr was a law clerk to judge David W. Dyer of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit from 1973 to 1974. From 1975 to 1977, he clerked for chief justice Warren E. Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court.\nIn 1977, Starr joined the Washington, D.C., office of the Los Angeles\u2013based law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher (now Gibson Dunn). In 1981 he was appointed counselor to U.S.\u00a0attorney general William French Smith.\nStarr was a member of the Federalist Society.\nFederal judge and solicitor general.\nOn September 13, 1983, he was nominated by Ronald Reagan to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated by George MacKinnon. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 20, 1983, and received his commission on September 20, 1983. He resigned on May 26, 1989.\nStarr was the United States solicitor general, from 1989 to 1993, under George H. W. Bush.\nEarly 1990s.\nWhen the United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics needed someone to review Republican senator Bob Packwood's diaries, the committee chose Starr. In 1990, Starr was the leading candidate for the U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court nomination after William Brennan's retirement. He encountered strong resistance from the Department of Justice leadership, which feared Starr might not be reliably conservative as a Supreme Court justice. George H. W. Bush nominated David Souter instead of Starr.\nStarr also considered running for the United States Senate, from Virginia in 1994, against incumbent Chuck Robb, but opted against opposing Oliver North for the Republican nomination.\nIndependent counsel.\nAppointment.\nIn August 1994, pursuant to the newly reauthorized Ethics in Government Act (\u00a0https://), Starr was appointed by a special three-judge division of the D.C. Circuit to continue the Whitewater investigation. He replaced Robert B. Fiske, a moderate Republican who had been appointed by attorney general Janet Reno.\nStarr took the position part-time and remained active with his law firm, Kirkland &amp; Ellis, as this was permitted by statute and was also the norm with previous independent counsel investigations. As time went on, he was increasingly criticized for alleged conflicts of interest stemming from his continuing association with Kirkland &amp; Ellis. Kirkland, like several other major law firms, was representing clients in litigation with the government, including tobacco companies and auto manufacturers. The firm itself was being sued by the Resolution Trust Corporation, a government agency involved in the Whitewater matter. Additionally, Starr's own actions were challenged because Starr had, on one occasion, talked with lawyers for Paula Jones, who was suing Bill Clinton over an alleged sexual harassment. Starr had explained to them why he believed that sitting U.S.\u00a0Presidents are not immune to civil suit. When this constitutional question ultimately reached the Supreme Court, the justices unanimously agreed.\nInvestigation of the death of Vince Foster.\nOn October 10, 1997, Starr's report on the death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster, drafted largely by Starr's deputy Brett Kavanaugh, was released to the public by the Special Division. The complete report is 137 pages long and includes an appendix added to the Report by the Special Division over Starr's objection. The report agrees with the findings of previous independent counsel Robert B. Fiske that Foster committed suicide at Fort Marcy Park, in Virginia, and that his suicide was caused primarily by undiagnosed and untreated depression. As CNN explained on February 28, 1997, \"The [Starr] report refutes claims by conservative political organizations that Foster was the victim of a murder plot and coverup,\" but \"despite those findings, right-wing political groups have continued to allege that there was more to the death and that the president and first lady tried to cover it up.\" CNN also noted that organizations pushing the murder theory included the \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\", owned by billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, and Accuracy in Media, supported in part by Scaife's foundation. Scaife's reporter on the Whitewater matter, Christopher Ruddy, was a frequent critic of Starr's handling of the case.\nExpansion of the investigation.\nThe law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and the other independent counsels named to investigate the administration, including the right to subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House Travel Office personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBI\u00a0files, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, Paula Jones lawsuit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.\nClinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal, Paula Jones lawsuit.\nIn his deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having \"sexual relations\" with Monica Lewinsky. On the basis of the evidence provided by Monica Lewinsky, a blue dress stained with Clinton's semen, Ken Starr concluded that this sworn testimony was false and perjurious.\nDuring the deposition in the Jones case, Clinton was asked, \"Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit\u00a01, as modified by the Court?\" The definition included contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of a person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of that person, any contact of the genitals or anus of another person, or contact of one's genitals or anus and any part of another person's body either directly or through clothing. The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the agreed definition. Clinton flatly denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Later, at the Starr grand jury, Clinton stated that he believed the definition of \"sexual relations\" agreed upon for the Jones deposition excluded his receiving oral sex.\nStarr's investigation eventually led to the impeachment of President Clinton, with whom Starr shared \"Time\"'s Man of the Year designation for 1998. Following his impeachment, the president was acquitted in the subsequent trial before the United States Senate as all 45\u00a0Democrats and 10 Republicans voted to acquit.\nSecond thoughts on DOJ request.\nIn 2004, Starr expressed regret for ever having asked the Department of Justice to assign him to oversee the Lewinsky investigation personally, saying, \"the most fundamental thing that could have been done differently\" would have been for somebody else to have investigated the matter.\nCriticism and political satire.\nAs with many controversial figures, Kenneth Starr was the subject of political satire. For example, the book, \"And the Horse He Rode in On\" by James Carville attempted to portray Mr. Starr's time as special prosecutor in comically negative light.\nPost-independent counsel activities.\nAfter five years as independent counsel, Starr resigned and returned to private practice as an appellate lawyer and a visiting professor at New York University, the Chapman University School of Law, and the George Mason University School of Law. Starr worked as a partner at Kirkland &amp; Ellis, specializing in litigation. He was one of the lead attorneys in a class-action lawsuit filed by a coalition of liberal and conservative groups (including the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association of America) against the regulations created by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, known informally as McCain-Feingold Act.\nOn April 6, 2004, he was appointed dean of the Pepperdine University School of Law. He originally accepted a position at Pepperdine as the first dean of the newly created School of Public Policy in 1996. He withdrew from the appointment in 1998, several months after the Lewinsky controversy erupted. Critics charged that there was a conflict of interest due to substantial donations to Pepperdine from billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, a Clinton critic who funded many media outlets attacking the president. In 2004, some five years after President Clinton's impeachment, Starr was again offered a Pepperdine position at the School of Law and this time accepted it.\nDeath penalty cases.\nIn 2005, Starr worked to overturn the death sentence of Robin Lovitt, who was on Virginia's death row for murdering a man during a robbery in 1998. Starr provided his services to Lovitt pro bono. On October 3, 2005, the Supreme Court denied certiorari.\nOn January 26, 2006, the defense team of convicted murderer Michael Morales (which included Starr) sent letters to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger requesting clemency for Morales. Letters purporting to be from the jurors who determined Morales's death sentence were included in the package sent to Schwarzenegger. Prosecutors alleged that the documents were forgeries, and accused investigator and anti-death penalty activist Kathleen Culhane of falsifying the documents. Lead defense attorney David Senior and his team soon withdrew the documents. Ultimately, clemency was denied, but the falsified documents were not used in the rationale. Eventually, Culhane was criminally charged with forging the documents and, under a plea agreement, was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\"Morse v. Frederick\".\nOn May 4, 2006, Starr announced that he would represent the school board of Juneau, Alaska, in its appeal to the United States Supreme Court in a case brought by a former student, Joseph Frederick. A high school student at that time, Joseph Frederick unfurled a banner at a school-sponsored event saying \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" as the Olympic torch was passing through Juneau, before arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah, for the 2002 Winter Olympics. The board decided to suspend the student. The student then sued and won at the U.S.\u00a0Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which stated that the board violated the student's first amendment right to free speech. On August 28, 2006, Starr filed a writ of certiorari for a hearing with the Supreme Court. On June 21, 2007, in an opinion authored by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, the court ruled in favor of Starr's client, finding that \"a principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use.\"\n\"Blackwater Security Consulting v. Nordan\" (No. 06-857).\nStarr represented Blackwater in a case involving the deaths of four unarmed civilians killed by Blackwater contractors in Fallujah, Iraq, in March 2004.\nCalifornia Proposition 8 post-election lawsuits.\nOn December 19, 2008, Proposition\u00a08 supporters named Starr to represent them in post-election lawsuits to be heard by the Supreme Court of California. Opponents of the measure sought to overturn it as a violation of fundamental rights, while supporters sought to invalidate the 18,000 same-sex marriages performed in the state before Proposition\u00a08 passed. Oral arguments took place on March 5, 2009, in San Francisco.\nStarr argued that \"Prop.\u00a08 was a modest measure that left the rights of same-sex couples undisturbed under California's domestic-partner laws and other statutes banning discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" to the agreement of most of the judges. The main issue that arose during the oral argument included the meaning of the word \"inalienable,\" and to which extent this word goes when used in Article\u00a0I of the Californian Constitution. Christopher Krueger of the attorney general's office said that inalienable rights may not be stripped away by the initiative process. Starr countered that \"rights are important, but they don't go to structure ... rights are ultimately defined by the people.\"\nThe court ultimately held that the measure was valid and effective, but would not be applied retroactively to marriages performed prior to its enactment.\nStarr was an advisory board member for the legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom.\nDefense of Jeffrey Epstein.\nIn 2007, Starr joined the legal team defending Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of the statutory rape of numerous underage high school students. Epstein would later plea bargain to plead guilty to several charges of soliciting and trafficking of underage girls, serve 13\u00a0months on work release in a private wing of the Palm Beach jail, and register as a sex offender. Starr said he was \"in the room\" when then-US attorney Alex Acosta made the deal that yielded the plea bargain for Epstein and later described Acosta as \"a person of complete integrity,\" adding that \"everyone was satisfied\" with the agreement.\nDonald Trump impeachment trial.\nOn January 16, 2020, Starr was announced as a member of then-President Donald Trump's legal team for his Senate impeachment trial. He argued before the Senate on Trump's behalf on January 27, 2020. Slate journalist Jeremy Stahl pointed out that as he was urging the Senate not to remove Trump as president, Starr contradicted various arguments he used in 1998 to justify Clinton's impeachment. In defending Trump, Starr also claimed he was wrong to have called for impeachment against Clinton for abuse of executive privilege and efforts to obstruct Congress and also stated that the House Judiciary Committee was right in 1998 to have rejected one of the planks for impeachment he had advocated for. He also invoked a 1999 \"Hofstra Law Review\" article by Yale law professor Akhil Amar, who argued that the Clinton impeachment proved just how impeachment and removal causes \"grave disruption\" to a national election.\nStarr was called as a witness by Sen. Ron Johnson on a senate hearing concerning electoral fraud amidst Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. When Trump was impeached for a second time in 2021, Starr condemned the impeachment as \"dangerous\" and \"unconstitutional\".\nBaylor University.\nStarr was the Duane and Kelly Roberts Dean and Professor of Law at Pepperdine University, when on February 15, 2010, Baylor University announced that it would introduce Starr as its newest president. Starr became Baylor's 14th president, replacing John Lilley who was ousted in mid\u20112008. Starr was introduced as the new president on June 1, 2010.\nHis inauguration was held on September 17, 2010, where Stephen L. Carter was the keynote speaker. Within his first two weeks in office, Starr was \"leading the charge\" to keep the university in the Big 12 Conference for athletics. Starr was additionally named chancellor of Baylor in November 2013, a post that had been vacant since 2005. He became the first person to hold the positions of president and chancellor at Baylor at the same time.\nIn September 2015, Baylor's Board of Regents initiated an external review of the university's response to reports of sexual violence to be conducted by the Pepper Hamilton law firm. Baylor had been accused of failing to respond to reports of rape and sexual assault filed by at least six female students from 2009 to 2016. Former football player Tevin Elliot was convicted of rape. Elliot is currently serving a 20-year sentence after his conviction in January 2014. Another student, Sam Ukwuachu, was convicted but has since had that conviction overturned and was retried, only to see it reinstated by the Texas Court of Appeals in 2018. Pepper Hamilton reported their findings to the regents on May 13, 2016, and on May 26, the regents announced Starr's removal as university president, effective May 31.\nThe May 26, 2016, announcement of personnel changes by the Board of Regents said Starr was to have continued as Chancellor and also as a faculty member at Baylor Law School. Starr announced his resignation as Chancellor on June 1, effective immediately. He told an interviewer that he took that action \"as a matter of conscience.\" He said he \"willingly accepted responsibility\" and \"The captain goes down with the ship.\" He resigned his position as the Louise L. Morrison Chair of Constitutional Law in Baylor Law School on August 19, 2016.\nDeath.\nIn May 2022, Starr was admitted to Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, due to an unspecified illness. He died there from complications from surgery on September 13, 2022, at the age of 76.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When people marry or divorce, the legal aspects of changing names may be simplified or included, so that the new name is established as part of the legal process of marrying or divorcing. Traditionally, in the Anglophone West, women are far more likely to change their surnames upon marriage than men, but in some instances men may change their last names upon marriage as well, including same-sex couples.\nIn this article, \"birth name\", \"family name\", \"surname\", \"married name\" and \"maiden name\" refer to patrilineal surnames unless explicitly described as referring to matrilineal surnames.\nName changes upon marriage.\nWomen changing their own last name after marriage encounter little difficulty in doing so when the opportunity is included in the legal process of marrying. Unless the statutes where the marriage occurred specify that a name change may occur at marriage (in which case the marriage certificate indicates the new name), courts following common law officially recognize it as the right of a person (man, woman, and sometimes child) to change their name. However, men encounter more difficulties in changing their last names.\nUse husband's family name.\nIn the past, a woman in England usually assumed her new husband's family name (or surname) after marriage; often she was compelled to do so under coverture laws. Assuming the husband's surname remains common practice today in the United Kingdom (although there is no law that states the name must be changed) and in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Gibraltar, Falkland Islands, India, Philippines, Canada (excluding Quebec), and the United States. Often there are variations of name adoption, including family name adoption. Usually, the children of these marriages are given their father's surname.\nSome families (mainly in the US) have a custom of using the mother's maiden name as a middle name for one of the children\u2014Franklin Delano Roosevelt received his middle name in this way, as did Isambard Kingdom Brunel in Britain. Some even use the mother's maiden name as a first name, such as Spessard Holland, a former governor of Florida and former senator, whose mother's maiden name was Virginia Spessard.\nRetain the birth name.\nWomen who keep their own surname after marriage may do so for a number of reasons:\nFeminism.\nThe feminist Lucy Stone (1818\u20131893) made a national issue of a married woman's right to keep her own surname (as she herself did upon marriage) as part of her efforts for women's rights in the U.S. Because of her, women who choose not to use their husbands' surnames have been called \"Lucy Stoners\". The feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton took her husband's surname as part of her own, signing herself Elizabeth Cady Stanton or E. Cady Stanton, but she refused to be addressed as Mrs. Henry B. Stanton. She wrote in 1847 that \"the custom of calling women Mrs. John This and Mrs. Tom That and colored men Sambo and Zip Coon, is founded on the principle that white men are lords of all.\" Later, when addressing the judiciary committee of the state legislature of New York in 1860 in a speech called \"A Slave's Appeal\", she stated in part, \"The negro [slave] has no name. He is Cuffy Douglas or Cuffy Brooks, just whose Cuffy he may chance to be. The woman has no name. She is Mrs. Richard Roe or Mrs. John Doe, just whose Mrs. she may chance to be.\" \nThe feminist Jane Grant, co-founder of \"The New Yorker\", wrote in 1943 of her efforts to keep her name despite her marriage, as well as other women's experiences with their maiden names regarding military service, passports, voting, and business. More recently, the feminist Jill Filipovic's opposition to name change for women who marry was published in \"The Guardian\" in 2013 as \"Why should married women change their names? Let men change theirs\", and cited as recommended reading on the theory of social construction of gender in \"Critical Encounters in Secondary English: Teaching Literacy Theory to Adolescents\" by Deborah Appleman (2014). When Filipovic married in 2018, she kept her last name.\nJoin both names (hyphenation).\nIt is less common for women, especially in the United States and Canada, to add their spouse's name and their own birth name. There are examples of this, however, in U.S. senator Cindy Hyde-Smith and U.S. sitting congresswomen Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, as well as U.S. former congresswomen Lucille Roybal-Allard, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. Former U.S. president Barack Obama's only maternal half-sibling is Maya Soetoro-Ng, formerly Maya Soetoro. Farrah Fawcett was known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors during her marriage to Lee Majors until their separation in 1979. Activist Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson was known as Ruby Doris Smith prior to her marriage.\nName blending.\nAlthough less common than name joining, a growing trend is the blending of two surnames upon marriage. This means adding \"parts\" of the two names. An example is Dawn O'Porter (from \"Porter\" and \"O'Dowd\").\nBirth name as middle name.\nExamples include Amy Coney Barrett, Maryanne Trump Barry, Maud Gage Baum, Shirley Temple Black, Vera Cahalan Bushfield, Marguerite Stitt Church, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Cindy Parlow Cone, Hillary Rodham Clinton (dropped maiden name in 2007), Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Katherine Gudger Langley, Ruth Hanna McCormick, Nelle Wilson Reagan, Edith Nourse Rogers, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Margaret Chase Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith. During their respective marriages, Kim Kardashian and Robin Wright were known as Kim Kardashian West (from Kanye West) and Robin Wright Penn (from Sean Penn). Politician Nikki Haley is sometimes referred to as Nikki R. Haley; the \"R\" stands for Randhawa, her birth surname.\nSpouse's surname as middle name.\nExamples include Brooklyn Peltz Beckham and John Ono Lennon (wife's name) and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (husband's name). When British author Neil Gaiman married American musician Amanda Palmer, he added his wife's middle name to his, becoming Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman.\nNew name.\nSome couples will create an entirely new surname for themselves upon marriage, with no ties to either's original surname. This practice is less common than name blending.\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nIn most of Canada, either partner may informally assume the spouse's surname after marriage, so long as it is not for the purposes of fraud. The same is true for people in common-law relationships, in some provinces. This is not considered a legal name change in most provinces, excluding British Columbia. For federal purposes, such as a Canadian passport, Canadians may also assume their partner's surname if they are in a common-law relationship. In the province of British Columbia, people have to undergo a legal name change if they want to use a combined surname after marriage. Their marriage certificate is considered proof of their new name.\nThe custom in Qu\u00e9bec was similar to the one in France until 1981. Women would traditionally go by their husband's surname in daily life, but their maiden name remained their legal name. Since the passage of a 1981 provincial law intended to promote gender equality, as outlined in the Qu\u00e9bec Charter of Rights, no change may be made to a person's name without the authorization of the registrar of civil status or the authorization of the court. Married individuals who wish to change their names upon marriage must therefore go through the same procedure as those changing their names for other reasons. The registrar of civil status may authorize a name change if:\nMarriage by itself is not considered to be an acceptable reason for a legal name change and a person may be required to show documentation that keeping their maiden name would cause psychological harm. This law has been criticized as taking away a woman's choice in choosing her name. Women married outside of Quebec are also expected to use their birth name as their legal name if they reside in the province.\nUnited States.\nThere were some early cases in the United States that held that under common law, a woman was required to take her husband's name, but newer cases overturned that (see \"Retain the birth name\" above). Currently, American women do not have to change their names by law. \"Lindon v. First National Bank\", 10 F. 894 (W.D. Pa. 1882), is one of the very earliest precedent-setting US federal court cases involving common law name change. A woman who had changed her last name to one that was not her husband's original surname was trying to claim control over her inheritance. The court ruled in her favor. This set forth many things. By common law, one may lawfully change their name and be \"known and recognized\" by that new name. Also, one may enter into any kinds of contracts in their new adopted name. Contracts include employment (see \"Coppage v. Kansas\" 236 U.S. 1), and one can be recognized legally in court in their new name. In 1967 in \"Erie Exchange v. Lane\", 246 Md. 55 (1967) the Maryland Court of Appeals held that a married woman can lawfully adopt an assumed name, even if it is not her birth name or the name of her lawful husband, without legal proceedings. In the United States, only eight states provide for an official name change for a man as part of their marriage process, and in others a man may petition a court or\u2014where not prohibited\u2014change his name without a legal procedure (though government agencies sometimes do not recognize this procedure). The practice remains popular in the 21st century. According to a Pew Research Center survey published in September 2023, nearly 4 out of every 5 women in heterosexual marriages in the United States changed their last names to those of their husbands. On the other hand, 92% of all men in these marriages kept their last names.\nIn 2007, Michael Buday and Diana Bijon enlisted the American Civil Liberties Union and filed a discrimination lawsuit against the state of California. According to the ACLU, the obstacles facing a husband who wishes to adopt his wife's last name violated the equal protection clause provided by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. At the time of the lawsuit, only the states of Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York and North Dakota explicitly allowed a man to change his name through marriage with the same ease as a woman. As a result of the lawsuit, the \"Name Equality Act of 2007\" was passed to allow either spouse to change their name, using their marriage license as the means of the change; the law took effect in 2009.\nIn the United States, some states or areas have laws that restrict what surname a child may have. For example, Tennessee allows a child to be given a surname that does not include that of the father only upon \"the concurrent submission of a sworn application to that effect signed by both parents.\"\nIn Massachusetts, a Harvard study in 2004 found that about 87% of college-educated women take their husbands' name on marriage, down from a peak before 1975 of over 90%, but up from about 80% in 1990. The same study found women with a college degree were \"two to four times (depending on age) more likely to retain their surname\" than those without a college degree.\nMexico.\nFollowing Latin American tradition, children are typically given a surname that combines the paternal surnames of their parents. In 2017, a child took their parents maternal surnames and was the first person to be legally allowed to do so.\nEurope.\nAustria.\nIn Austria, since 1 April 2013, marriage does not automatically change a woman's name; therefore a name change can only take place upon legal application. Before that date, the default was for a married woman's name to be changed to that of her husband, unless she legally applied to opt out of this.\nFrance.\nIn France, by executive decision since 2011 and by law since 2013, any married person may officially use their spouse's name as a common name by substituting or compounding it to their own. Before this it was common for married women to use their husband's name in everyday life, but this had no legal recognition.\nA common name does not replace a person's family name as written on their birth certificate.\nFrom 4 March 2002 to 4 December 2009, children given both parents' names had to have them separated by a double dash (ex: Dupont--Clairemont). On 4 December 2009, the Conseil d'\u00c9tat ruled that a space can be used instead of the double dash. As a result, forms asking for the choice of family name for a child (\"nom de famille\") do so on two lines (\"\"1\u00e8re partie\": ... \", \"\"2e partie\": ...\")\nGermany.\nIn Germany, since 1977, a woman may adopt her husband's surname or a man may adopt his wife's surname. As an alternative, one of them may adopt a name combined from both surnames; the remaining unchanged surname is the \"family name\" (\"Ehename\"), which will be the surname of the children. If a man and woman both decide to keep and use their birth names after the wedding (no combined name), they shall declare one of those names the \"family name\". A combined name is not possible as a family name, but, since 2005, it has been possible to have a double name as a family name if one already had a double name, and the partner adopts that name. Double names then must be hyphenated. All family members must use that double name.\nIn 2025 true double names became legal for spouses as well as the possibility to have children bearing a double name whereas parents retain their birth names\nGreece.\nSince 1983, when Greece adopted a new marriage law which guaranteed gender equality between the spouses, women in Greece are required to \"keep\" their birth names for their whole lives.\nIceland.\nIn Iceland, women retain their birth surnames, which are typically patronymic or occasionally matronymic: they indicate the woman's father (or mother) and not a historic family lineage. Iceland shares a common cultural heritage with the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Unlike these countries, Icelanders have continued to use their traditional name system, which was formerly used in most of Northern Europe. The Icelandic system is thus not based on family names (although some people do have family names and might use both systems). Generally, a woamn's last name indicates the first name of her father (patronymic) or in some cases mother (matronymic) in the genitive, followed by -d\u00f3ttir (\"daughter\"). Icelanders, male and female, are not addressed using surnames, but first names. For example, the Icelandic prime minister \nKristr\u00fan Mj\u00f6ll Frostad\u00f3ttir, though married, is referred to as Kristr\u00fan.\nItaly.\nSpouses keep their original surnames. According to the Italian Civil Code (article 143 bis), a woman who marries keeps her surname and has the option of adding her husband's surname after hers. Non-Italian citizens getting married in Italy will not have their surname changed in Italy. However, brides or grooms can request their surname change in their home country.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, persons who have been married in the Netherlands or entered into a registered partnership will remain registered under their birth name. They are, however, permitted to use their partner's last name for social purposes or join both names. Upon marriage or registered partnership, one may also indicate how one would like to be addressed by registering one's choice at the Municipal Basis Administration (Basisregistratie Personen), although their birth name does not change. One may choose to be called by one's own name, one's partner's name, one's own name followed by one's partner's name (hyphenated), or one's partner's name followed by their own name (hyphenated; this was the prevailing convention up to very recently. In this case the maiden name following the hyphen only uses a capital if it is a noun; if it is an affix like \"van\" or \"de\" the affix remains uncapitalized; this is an exception to the general rule for surnames that are capitalized when standing alone). Both men and women may make this choice upon registering to get married or entering into a registered partnership. If the marriage or registered partnership ends, one may continue to use the ex-partner's last surname unless the ex-partner disagrees and requests the court to forbid the use of the ex-partner's surname.\nBefore the birth or adoption of a first child, married parents or parents in a registered partnership may choose the child's surname. This can be either the father's name, the mother's name or both. There is a maximum of two last names, so children of people with double last names AB and CD have to choose between either of those names (AB or CD), or a combination of these names (AC, CA, AD, DA, BC, CB, BD, DB), but not only one part (A, B, C or D) or reverse of current names (BA or DC). If no choice is made, the child automatically bears (only) the father's surname. Any further children will also go by this name. If the parents are not married, the children will automatically have their mother's name unless otherwise indicated.\nPortugal.\nWives usually append the family name of their spouse to their legal name, although there is a recent trend of women keeping their maiden names. Following Portuguese naming customs, a person's name consists of a given name (simple or composite) followed by two family names (surnames), the mother's and the father's. Any children whom a couple have together, take both second-surnames.\nRussia.\nThere is a widespread, though not universal, custom for a newly married wife to adopt the husband's family name. However, as Russia is not a common law country, any name change requires a formal procedure including an official application to the civil acts registrar. As the same registrar also records marriages, for the convenience sake it is often done during the marriage proceedings, as governed by the Federal Law #143-FZ \"On Civil State Acts\", and the couple's marriage certificate has an option of having one common family name, or both spouses going by their original surname. However, the law is entirely gender neutral, and the couple may adopt either of their surnames (a husband adopting his wife's family name is an uncommon but by no means unheard-of practice, which is generally accepted and carries little to no social stigma), or even a completely different one. The law also recognizes the couple's right to use the combined family name, and for the either of the spouses to reclaim their original surname in the case the marriage is dissolved.\nScotland.\nIn the lowlands of Scotland in the 16th century, married women did not change their surnames, but today it is common practice to do so.\nSpain.\nSpouses have always kept their original surnames. Following Spanish naming customs, a person's name consists of a given name (simple or composite) followed by two family names (surnames), the father's and the mother's. Any children whom a couple have together take both first-surnames, so if \"Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Hevia\" and \"Mar\u00eda Reyes Garc\u00eda\" had a child named \"Andr\u00e9s\", the resulting name would be \"Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Reyes\".\nLaw 11/1981 in Spain, enacted in 1981, declared among other things that children, on turning 18, now had a legal option to choose whether their father's or mother's surname came first. If a family did not exercise an option to change the order of the names in their surname, the law defaulted to the father's surname as the first.\nAlso in Spain, a 1995 reform in the law allows the parents to choose whether the father's or the mother's surname goes first, although this order must be the same for all their children. For instance, the name of the son of the couple in the example above could be \"Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Reyes\" or \"Andr\u00e9s Reyes G\u00f3mez\".\nIn some Spanish-American countries it is customary for women to unofficially add the husband's first surname after her own, for social purposes such as invitation letters or event announcements. The couple above may introduce themselves as Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Hevia and Mar\u00eda Reyes de G\u00f3mez. It is also common to name, in formal settings, the wife of a man as \"se\u00f1ora de\", followed by her husband's first surname.\nTurkey.\nSince 2014, women in Turkey are allowed to keep their birth names alone for their whole life instead of using their husbands' names. Previously, the Turkish Code of Civil Law, Article 187, required a married woman to use her husband's surname; or else to use her birth name in front of her husband's name by giving a written application to the marriage officer or the civil registry office. In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that prohibiting married women from retaining only maiden names is a violation of their rights.\nAsia.\nChina.\nTraditionally, unlike in Anglophone Western countries, a married woman keeps her name unchanged, without adopting her husband's surname. In mainland China a child inherits their father's surname as a norm, though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent's surname. It is also common for two children born to the same parents to take different surnames, one after the father and the other after the mother. It is also possible, though far less common, for a child to combine both parents' surnames. Amongst the Chinese diaspora overseas, especially in Southeast Asia, women rarely legally adopt their spouse's surname.\nHong Kong.\nDue to British influence, some people in Hong Kong have also adopted the tradition of women changing their English last name, or prepending their husband's Chinese surname to their own in official occasions or business cards but rarely on resident identification or travel documents. An example is former chief executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who prepended her husband Lam Siu-por's surname to hers.\nIran.\nIt became mandatory in 1918 to use surnames in Iran, and only in this time, the heads of families had the right to choose their family members' (including the wife) surname. It is stated in the article four of the law on Civil Registration in 1925, that \"Everybody should choose his/her own name. The wife... maintains her family name that was called by.\" The same thing has been restated in the article three of the law on Civil Registration in 1928. There is not much difference in the article 38 of the law on Civil Registration in 1940, but there is another article (43) that says \"If the couple separate legally, maintaining husband's surname is allowed if the husband allows, and if the husband has taken wife's family name, maintaining wife's surname is allowed if the wife allows.\" In the last related article (the article 42 of the law on Civil Registration in 1976) the same thing is said about wife's surname change, but it is silent about husband's surname change.\nCurrently, it is very unusual that either spouse change his/her surname after marriage in Iran.\nJapan.\nJapanese law does not recognize married couples who have different surnames as lawful husband and wife. According to 2019 data, 95.5% of women took their husband's surname upon marriage. The constitutionality of this law has been challenged in court.\nIn a 2015 ruling, and again in a 2021 ruling, the plaintiffs argued that forcing couples to share a surname violates the constitution, specifically the principles of individual dignity and gender equality, as the burden of changing a name disproportionately falls on women, causing a loss of identity.\nHowever, the Supreme Court of Japan has twice upheld the law, ruling it constitutional. In both the 2015 and 2021 decisions, the Court stated that the single-surname system is well-established in Japanese society and is a rational way to identify family members. The Court also noted that any disadvantages from a name change are mitigated by the widespread informal use of maiden names, and concluded that the issue of allowing separate spousal names is a matter for the Diet (Japan's parliament) to decide, not the judiciary.\nLegal challenges continued in 2024. In March, on International Women's Day, a total of twelve plaintiffs (six couples) filed lawsuits against the government in both the Tokyo and Sapporo district courts. The plaintiffs are seeking damages, arguing that \"the current situation, where one party must abandon their surname to marry, harms individual dignity.\"\nThe issue has also drawn international scrutiny. In November 2024, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) urged the Japanese government to revise the Civil Code to allow married couples to choose separate surnames. The committee expressed deep concern that the current system is discriminatory and disproportionately impacts women, recommending that Japan \"ensure that women and men can choose their family name upon marriage without any constraints or discrimination.\"\nNorth Korea and South Korea.\nTraditionally, Korean women keep their family names after their marriage, while their children usually take the father's surname. Korea used to be relatively gender equal as of inheritance and familial duties up until at least the late 17th century. Often, family genealogy books would keep track of the daughters and their spouses and offspring too. As such, it was the norm for women to keep their maiden name and they were considered to be part of the family even after marriage. Before modern times, people were very conscious of familial values and their own family identities. It is therefore traditional for Korean women keep their surnames after marriage, based on traditional reasoning that it is what they inherited from their parents and ancestors. Colloquially, Koreans consider the name of an individual as a singular entity, and changing the family name syllable would make the name sound strange with the other syllables of the given name.\nNowadays, women still keep their names after marriage. Children can have either parent's surname, but it is customary to use the father's surname.\nPhilippines.\nArticle 370 of the Civil Code states:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A married woman may use:(1) Her maiden first name and surname and add her husband\u2019s surname, or(2) Her maiden first name and her husband\u2019s surname, or(3) Her husband\u2019s full name, but prefixing a word indicating that she is his wife, such as \u201cMrs.\u201d\nThe usage of the word \u201cmay\u201d implies that a woman can retain her maiden name without adding her husband's, and Articles 371 and 372 explicitly state that a woman may resume using her original name upon legal separation or exercise the option to continue using the husband's name unless either the court decrees otherwise or either spouse remarries. The Supreme Court ruling \"Yasin v. Sharia Court\" reiterated this, noting Arturo Tolentino's commentary that usage of \u201cmay\u201d indicates a permissive action. Nevertheless, this caused confusion among some people, leading them to believe that the Civil Code required women to change their surnames, when it wasn't actually the case. On 21 March 2023, the House of Representatives passed a bill to revise the Civil Code to explicitly declare that a woman can keep her surname.\nMarried women in professional circles (e.g. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Korina Sanchez-Roxas, Vilma Santos-Recto) typically join their maiden and married surnames in both professional and legal use. This allows them to be identified as married, and keep track of their professional achievements without being confused for any similarly named individuals. An older scheme based on Spanish naming customs add the particle \"de\" (\"of\") between the maiden and married surnames. This tradition is no longer common.\nTaiwan.\nTaiwanese women generally keep their surnames after marriage, while their children may inherit either the father's or the mother's. It is, however, legal to take the spouse's surname. Some older women have the husband's surname tagged on to theirs, as was common in the early to mid-20th century.\nThailand.\nA Thai wife who adopted her husband's surname due to the old law requiring it, can also change back to her original surname.\nVietnam.\nIn Vietnamese culture, women keep their family names once they marry, whilst the children produced by the couple tend to keep the father's family name.\nUse as security question.\nOne's mother's maiden name has been a common security question in banking since at least the 1980s. It is a security question which can be easily circumvented by hackers.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61914", "revid": "47403759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61914", "title": "Ch\u00e2teau", "text": "French term for a manor house or palace\nA ch\u00e2teau (plural ch\u00e2teaux, both pronounced ) is a manor house, or palace, or residence of the lord of the manor, or a fine country house of nobility or gentry, with or without fortifications, originally, and still most frequently, in French-speaking regions.\nNowadays, a \"ch\u00e2teau\" may be any stately residence built in a French style; the term is additionally often used for a winegrower's estate, especially in the Bordeaux region of France.\nDefinition.\nThe word \"ch\u00e2teau\" is a French word that has entered the English language, where its meaning is more specific than it is in French. The French word \"ch\u00e2teau\" denotes buildings as diverse as a medieval fortress, a Renaissance palace and a fine 19th-century country house. Care should therefore be taken when translating the French word \"ch\u00e2teau\" into English, noting the nature of the building in question. Most French ch\u00e2teaux are \"palaces\" or fine \"country houses\" rather than \"castles\", and for these, the word \"ch\u00e2teau\" is appropriate in English. Sometimes the word \"palace\" is more appropriate. To give an outstanding example, the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, also called in French \"le palais de Versailles\", is so-called because it was located in the countryside when it was built, but it does not bear any resemblance to a castle, so it is usually known in English as the Palace of Versailles. When clarification is needed in French, the term \"ch\u00e2teau fort\" is used to describe a fortified castle, such as the Ch\u00e2teau fort de Roquetaillade.\nThe urban counterpart of a ch\u00e2teau is a \"palais\" in French, which is usually applied only to very grand residences in a city. This usage is again different from that of the term \"palace\" in English, where there is no requirement that a palace must be in a city, but the word \"palais\" is rarely used for buildings other than the grandest royal residences. The term \"h\u00f4tel particulier\" is used in French for an urban \"private house\" of a grand sort.\nConcept.\nA ch\u00e2teau is a \"power house\", as Sir John Summerson dubbed the British and Irish \"stately homes\" that are the British Isles' architectural counterparts to French ch\u00e2teaux. It is the personal (and usually hereditary) badge of a \"family\" that, with some official rank, locally represents the royal authority; thus, the word ch\u00e2teau often refers to the dwelling of a member of either the French nobility or royalty. However, some fine ch\u00e2teaux, such as Vaux-le-Vicomte, were built by the essentially high-bourgeois\u2014people but recently ennobled: tax-farmers and ministers of Louis XIII and his royal successors. The quality of the residences could vary considerably, from grand ch\u00e2teaux owned by royalty and the wealthy elite near larger towns to run-down ch\u00e2teaux vacated by poor nobility and officials in the countryside, isolated and vulnerable.\nA ch\u00e2teau was historically supported by its \"terres\" (lands), composing a demesne that rendered the society of the ch\u00e2teau largely self-sufficient, in the manner of the historic Roman and early medieval villa system (cf. manorialism, hacienda). The open villas of Rome in the times of Pliny the Elder, Maecenas, and Emperor Tiberius began to be walled-in, and then fortified in the 3rd century AD, thus evolving to \"castellar\" \"ch\u00e2teaux\". In modern usage, a ch\u00e2teau retains some enclosures that are distant descendants of these fortifying outworks: a fenced, gated, closeable forecourt, perhaps a gatehouse or a keeper's lodge, and supporting outbuildings (stables, kitchens, breweries, bakeries, manservant quarters in the \"gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re\"). Besides the \"cour d'honneur\" (court of honour) entrance, the ch\u00e2teau might have an inner \"cour\" (\"court\"), and inside, in the private residence, the ch\u00e2teau faces a simply and discreetly enclosed park.\nIn the city of Paris, the Louvre (fortified) and the Luxembourg Palace (the latter originally suburban) were originally referred to as ch\u00e2teaux, but became \"palaces\" when the city enclosed them. In other French-speaking European regions, such as Wallonia (Belgium), the word \"ch\u00e2teau\" is used with the same definition as in France. In Belgium, a strong French architectural influence is evident in the seventeenth-century Ch\u00e2teau des Comtes de Marchin and the eighteenth-century Ch\u00e2teau de Seneffe.\nIn the United States, the word \"ch\u00e2teau\" took root selectively \u2013 in the Gilded Age resort town of Newport, Rhode Island, large manor homes were called \"cottages\", but north of Wilmington, Delaware, in the rich, rural \"Ch\u00e2teau Country\" centred upon the powerful Du Pont family, the word ch\u00e2teau is used with its original definition. In Canada, especially in English, ch\u00e2teau usually denotes a hotel, not a house, and applies only to the country's most elaborate railway hotels, built during the Canadian railroad golden age, such as the Ch\u00e2teau Lake Louise in Lake Louise, Alberta, the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier in Ottawa, the Ch\u00e2teau Montebello in Montebello, Quebec, and the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac in Quebec City.\nFrench ch\u00e2teaux\u2014particular regions.\nBordeaux region.\nThere are many estates with true ch\u00e2teaux on them in the Bordeaux wine regions, but it is customary for any wine-producing estate since the 19th century, no matter how humble, to prefix its name with \"Ch\u00e2teau\". This term became the default way of designating an estate in Bordeaux, in the same way that \"Domaine\" did in Burgundy. Both \"Ch\u00e2teau\" and \"Domaine\" are aristocratic in implication, but Bordeaux had a better claim to the association: nobles had owned Bordeaux's best vineyards for centuries. Most of Burgundy's best vineyards, in contrast, had been owned by the Church. The term \"Ch\u00e2teau\" became a permanent verbal fixture in Bordeaux, and it was emulated in other French regions and outside France.\nThe winery denomination \"Ch\u00e2teau\" is now protected by French law, and confirmed in 1981 by European Union law, as \"traditional appellation\". The term Ch\u00e2teau may be used only if two conditions are fulfilled:\nLoire Valley.\nThe Loire Valley (Vall\u00e9e de la Loire) is home to more than 300 ch\u00e2teaux. They were built between the 10th and 20th centuries, firstly by the French kings followed soon thereafter by the nobility; hence, the Valley is termed \"\"The Valley of the Kings\". Alternatively, due to its moderate climate, wine-growing soils and rich agricultural land, the Loire Valley is referred to as \"The Garden of France\"\". The ch\u00e2teaux range from the very large (often now in public hands) to more 'human-scale' ch\u00e2teaux such as the Ch\u00e2teau de Beaulieu in Saumur or the medieval Ch\u00e2teau du Rivau close to Chinon which were built of the local tuffeau stone.\nFrench ch\u00e2teaux\u2014selected examples.\nCh\u00e2teau de Chenonceau.\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau is a French ch\u00e2teau spanning the river Cher, near the small village of Chenonceaux in the Indre-et-Loire department of the Loire Valley in France. It is one of the best-known ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley. The estate of Chenonceau is first mentioned in writing in the 11th century. The current ch\u00e2teau was built in 1514\u20131522 on the foundations of an old mill and was later extended to span the river. The bridge over the river was built from 1556 to 1559 to designs by the French Renaissance architect Philibert de l'Orme, and the gallery on the bridge, built from 1570 to 1576 to designs by Jean Bullant.\nCh\u00e2teau de Dampierre-en-Yvelines.\nBuilt by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, 1675\u20131683 for the duc de Chevreuse, Colbert's son-in-law, the Ch\u00e2teau de Dampierre is a French Baroque ch\u00e2teau of manageable size. Protected behind fine wrought iron double gates, the main block and its outbuildings (\"corps de logis\"), linked by balustrades, are ranged symmetrically around a dry paved and gravelled \"cour d'honneur\". Behind, the central axis is extended between the former parterres, now mown hay. The park with formally shaped water was laid out by Andr\u00e9 Le Notre.\nCh\u00e2teau de Montsoreau.\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau is the only Ch\u00e2teau of the Loire Valley to have been built directly in the Loire riverbed. It is also one of the first example of a renaissance architecture in France. Montsoreau was built in 1453 by Jean II de Chambes (first counsellor of Charles VII of France and ambassador of France to Venice and to Turkey) by order of the king soon after the end of the Hundred years war. The French dramatist Alexandre Dumas made the ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau world famous with his trilogy on the French Wars of Religion of which \"the lady of Monsoreau\" is the second volume.\nCh\u00e2teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte.\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte is a baroque French ch\u00e2teau located in Maincy, near Melun, 55\u00a0km southeast of Paris in the Seine-et-Marne d\u00e9partement of France. It was built by Louis Le Vau from 1658 to 1661 for Nicolas Fouquet, Marquis de Belle-Isle (Belle-\u00cele-en-Mer), Viscount of Melun and Vaux, the superintendent of finances of Louis XIV. The interior was lavishly decorated by painter Charles Le Brun. Louis Le Vau as well as Charles Le Brun were later called by Louis XIV to work at Versailles.\nCh\u00e2teau de Versailles.\nThe Palace of Versailles, or in French \"Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles\", is a royal ch\u00e2teau in Versailles, in the \u00cele-de-France region of France. When the ch\u00e2teau was built, Versailles was a country village; today, however, it is a wealthy suburb of Paris, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) southwest of the French capital. The court of Versailles was the centre of political power in France from 1682, when Louis XIV moved from Paris, until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in October 1789 after the beginning of the French Revolution. Versailles is therefore famous not only as a building but as a symbol of the system of absolute monarchy of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1912, the family moved to Caldy, on another part of the Wirral peninsula. Their home was a mock Tudor estate on two acres with a tennis court, small golf course and a maid, a cook and a nanny. Lowry was said to have felt neglected by his mother, and was closest to his brother. He began drinking alcohol at the age of 14.\nIn his teens Lowry was a boarder at The Leys School in Cambridge, the school made famous by the novel \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\". At age 15, he won the junior golf championship at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake. His father expected him to go to Cambridge and enter the family business, but Malcolm wanted to experience the world and convinced his father to let him work as a deckhand on a tramp steamer to the Far East. In May 1927, his parents drove him to the Liverpool waterfront and, while the local press watched, waved goodbye as he set sail on the freighter S.S. \"Pyrrhus\". The five months at sea gave him stories to incorporate into his first novel, \"Ultramarine\".\nAfter returning to Britain Lowry enrolled at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, in autumn 1929, in an attempt to placate his parents. He spent little time at the university, however, and his penchant for drink was already apparent; Hugh Sykes Davies, one of Lowry's academic supervisors and later a friend, found that the only place in which it was possible to teach him was in a pub. Nonetheless, he excelled in writing, graduating in 1932 with a third-class honours degree in English upon submitting several extracts of his first draft of \"Ultramarine\" for examination. During his first term, his roommate, Paul Fitte, killed himself. Fitte had wanted a homosexual relationship, which Lowry refused. Lowry felt responsible for his death and was haunted by it for the rest of his life. Lowry was already well travelled; besides his sailing experience, between terms he made visits to America, to befriend his literary idol, Conrad Aiken, and to Norway and Germany.\nAfter Cambridge, Lowry lived briefly in London, existing on the fringes of the vibrant Thirties literary scene and meeting Dylan Thomas. He met his first wife, Jan Gabrial, in Spain. They were married in France in 1934. Theirs was a turbulent union, especially due to his drinking, and because she resented homosexuals attracted to her husband.\nUnited States, Mexico, Canada.\nAfter an estrangement, Lowry followed Jan to New York City where, almost incoherent after an alcohol-induced breakdown, he checked into Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital in 1936 \u2013 experiences which later became the basis of his novella \"Lunar Caustic\". When the authorities began to take notice of him, he fled to avoid deportation and then went to Hollywood, where he tried screenwriting. At about that time he began writing \"Under the Volcano\". Lowry and Jan moved to Mexico, arriving in the city of Cuernavaca on 2 November 1936, the Day of the Dead, in a final attempt to salvage their marriage. Lowry continued to drink heavily, though he also devoted more energy to his writing.\nThe effort to save their marriage failed. Jan saw that he wanted a mother figure, and she did not want to mother him. She then ran off with another man in late 1937. Alone in Oaxaca, Lowry entered into another period of dark alcoholic excess, culminating in his deportation from Mexico in the summer of 1938. His family put him up at the Hotel Normandie in Los Angeles where he continued working on his novel and met his second wife, the actress and writer Margerie Bonner. His father sent his rent checks directly to the Normandie's hotel manager.\nIn August Lowry moved to Vancouver, leaving his manuscript behind. Later, Margerie moved up to Vancouver, bringing his manuscript, and the following year they married. At first, they lived in an attic apartment in the city. When World War II broke out, Lowry tried to enlist but was rejected. Correspondence between Lowry and Governor-General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir (better known as the writer John Buchan) during this time resulted in Lowry's writing several articles for the Vancouver newspaper \"The Province\". The couple lived and wrote in a squatter's shack on the beach near the community of Dollarton, north of Vancouver. In 1944, the beach shack was destroyed by a fire, and Lowry was injured in his efforts to save manuscripts. \nMargerie was a positive influence, editing Lowry's work skillfully and making sure that he ate as well as drank (she drank, too). The couple traveled to Europe, America and the Caribbean, and while Lowry continued to drink heavily, this seems to have been a relatively peaceful and productive period. It lasted until 1954, when a final nomadic period ensued, embracing New York, London and other places. During their travels to Europe, Lowry twice attempted to strangle Margerie.\nHe lived in Canada for much of his active writing career and is thus also considered a significant figure in Canadian literature. He won the Governor General's Award for English-language fiction in 1961 for his posthumous collection \"Hear Us O Lord from Heaven Thy Dwelling Place\".\nDeath.\nLowry died in June 1957, in a rented cottage in the village of Ripe, Sussex, where he was living with wife Margerie after having returned to England in 1955, ill and impoverished. The coroner's verdict was death by misadventure, and the causes of death given as inhalation of stomach contents, barbiturate poisoning, and excessive consumption of alcohol.\nIt has been suggested that his death was a suicide. Inconsistencies in the accounts given by his wife at various times about what happened on the night of his death have also given rise to suspicions of murder.\nLowry is buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist in Ripe. Lowry wrote in his 1940 poem \"Epitaph\": \"Here lies Malcolm Lowry, late of the Bowery, whose prose was flowery, and often glowery. He lived nightly, and drank daily, and died playing the ukulele,\" but the epitaph does not appear on his gravestone.\nPapers.\nMargerie Lowry deposited the Malcolm Lowry papers in her possession with the University of British Columbia in 1961. This initial deposit has been continuously augmented by material deposited by friends and family of the Lowrys, Lowry scholars and collectors, or purchased at auction. In 2017 the British Library acquired the Malcolm Lowry papers that had been in the possession of his first wife, Jan Gabrial. These had been entrusted to Gabrial's mother, Emily Vanderheim, in 1936 and passed to Gabrial on her mother's death. The library later acquired further items from Margerie Lowry's sister, Priscilla Bonner.\nWritings.\nLowry published little during his lifetime, in comparison with the extensive collection of unfinished manuscripts he left. Of the two novels that he himself finished and saw through publication, \"Under the Volcano\" (1947) is now widely accepted as his masterpiece and one of the great works of the 20th century (number 11 on the Modern Library's 100 Best Novels of the 20th century).\n\"Ultramarine\" (1933), written while Lowry was still an undergraduate, follows a young man's first sea voyage and his determination to gain the crew's acceptance.\nA collection of short stories, \"Hear Us, O Lord from Heaven Thy Dwelling Place\" (1961), was published after Lowry's death. The scholar and poet Earle Birney edited \"Selected Poems of Malcolm Lowry\" (1962). Birney also collaborated with Lowry's widow, Margerie Bonner Lowry, conflating several earlier pieces concerned with Lowry's experience at Bellevue Hospital into the novella \"Lunar Caustic\", first published in \"The Paris Review\" in 1963, in book form in a French translation the same year (Julliard), and finally in book form in English in 1968 (Jonathan Cape). Using Lowry's manuscripts, Bonner Lowry also completed and edited the novels \"Dark as the Grave Wherein my Friend Is Laid\" (1968), assisted by Douglas Day, who later became Lowry's first biographer, and \"October Ferry to Gabriola\" (1970). \nThe \"Selected Letters of Malcolm Lowry\", edited by Bonner Lowry and Harvey Breit, was released in 1965, followed in 1995\u201396 by the two-volume \"Sursum Corda! The Collected Letters of Malcolm Lowry\", edited by Sherrill E. Grace. Scholarly editions of Lowry's final work in progress, \"La Mordida\" (\"The Bribe\"), and his screen adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"Tender Is the Night\" have also been published.\n\"\" (1976) is an Oscar-nominated National Film Board of Canada documentary directed by Donald Brittain and John Kramer. It opens with the inquest into Lowry's \"death by misadventure\", and then moves back in time to trace the writer's life. Selections from Lowry's novel are read by Richard Burton amid images shot in Mexico, the United States, Canada and England.\nIn 2001, Lowry's first wife Jan Gabrial revealed in her memoir that she had an early draft of Lowry's novel \"In Ballast to the White Sea,\" which was thought to have been lost. According to Professor Dean Irvine at Dalhousie University, Lowry had given an early copy of the novel to Gabrial's mother before the couple went to Mexico in 1936. Lowry's working copy of the manuscript was then lost in a fire. In October 2014 it was published for the first time by University of Ottawa Press and a launch was held at the Bluecoat Arts Centre in Liverpool.\n\"The Voyage That Never Ends\".\nLowry envisioned \"The Voyage That Never Ends\" as his magnum opus: an epic cycle encompassing his existing novels and stories as well as projected works, with \"Under the Volcano\" as its centrepiece. He spent much of his writing life crafting his body of work into a greater, thematically cohesive whole, which he called \"The Voyage That Never Ends\". It was to rival the epics of other great modernists, and he referred to it in several personal annotations and letters as the concept evolved over many years and works-in-progress. An early typescript has the sequence's contents listed as:\nLowry labelled \"Under the Volcano\" as \"The Centre\" while marking \"Dark as the Grave Wherein My Friend is Laid\", \"Eridanus\", and \"La Mordida\" as \"Trilogy\". In addition, \"Eridanus\" (the name Lowry gave his West Coast surroundings, referring \"to both the stellar constellation and mythical river to which Faeton was cast down by gods\") seems to consist of the story collection \"Hear Us Oh Lord From Heaven Thy Dwelling Place\", the poems of \"The Lighthouse Invites the Storm\", and \"other tales, poems, a play, etc.\" As well, \"The Ordeal of Sigbj\u00f8rn Wilderness\" was a novel he planned after spending time in a hospital after breaking his leg in 1949: \"His experiences there due to a mixture of alcohol withdrawal and drugs were as traumatic as his time in Bellevue in 1936. As ever Malc turned these experiences into literature which he initially entitled the 'Atomic Rhythm' which eventually became \"The Ordeal of Sigbj\u00f8rn Wilderness\", which was never developed beyond a rough sketch and remains unpublished.\" His plans for \"The Voyage That Never Ends\" ultimately grew into a 34-page outline that he gave to the editor Albert Erskine, with whom he was friends.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt's hellish near impossible to make a pr\u00e9cis of my plan...but I've tried to give you an idea, a frame. I myself can hear \u2013 almost \u2013 the whole thing; that is to say I can already project myself into a given section, no matter how remote, and feel, hear, sense more or less how it must be. (November 23, 1951)\nIt was this letter and outline that secured for Lowry a long-term contract with Random House. Lowry's alcoholism and early death, however, prevented him from finishing his grand project. Several of the works intended as part of the sequence were rewritten many times over many years\u2014he worked on \"Lunar Caustic\", for instance, from the 1930s until his death, first titled \"The Last Address\", then \"Swinging the Maelstrom\", and finally \"Lunar Caustic\". The posthumous publications of his unfinished manuscripts have brought several more parts of \"The Voyage That Never Ends\" to light, though these vary in completeness and Lowry's final intentions with these works can only be speculated on. The published version of \"Lunar Caustic\", for instance, was compiled by his widow Margerie Lowry and poet Earle Birney from \"two distinctly different manuscripts. One bore the first title and was last worked on in 1942\u201344, while the other had the second name and was last edited by the (at the time living) dead author in 1951\u201352.\" \nIn the intervening years, the story had undergone vast changes in style and thematic emphasis. A scholarly edition was eventually published in 2013 that includes the three major versions with annotation on the history of the text's composition. When the novel \"In Ballast to the White Sea\" was finally published in 2014\u2014after being thought lost for decades\u2014it represented only an early draft of the 1000 page manuscript that had been destroyed in the same shack fire that nearly destroyed \"Under the Volcano\", and as such does not represent the more complete text Lowry had been working on for nine years. \"La Mordida\" was inspired by Lowry's deportation from Mexico in the mid-1940s. \"The central narrative of \"La Mordida\" involves a descent into the abyss of self, culminating in the protagonist's symbolic rebirth at the book's end. Lowry planned to use this basic narrative pattern as the springboard for innumerable questions about such concerns as art, identity, the nature of existence, political issues, and alcoholism. Above all, \"La Mordida\" was to have been a metafictional work about an author who sees no point in living events if he cannot write about them and who is not only unable to write but suspects that he is just a character in a novel.\" It was published in 1996 as notes, sketches, outlines, and rough chapters\u2014it was to feature the autobiographical character Sigbj\u00f8rn Wilderness. \"Dark as the Grave Wherein My Friend is Laid\" was published only twelve years after Lowry's death, and also featured Sigbj\u00f8rn Wilderness. It was \"collated from a huge volume of notes ... almost every chapter exist[ing] in three or four different forms.\"\nBecause so much of \"The Voyage That Never Ends\" was left incomplete (much of it hardly begun, barely going beyond his initial conceptual framework) what exists only hints at the final form Lowry intended for his magnum opus.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the 2000 presidential elections, the party symbolically nominated Li Ao as its candidate, but both Li and the party encouraged party members to support former Kuomintang member James Soong. It won one seat in the 2001 legislative elections, and saw significant support in the 2005\u201306 municipal elections, though its influence has waned since then.\nThe New Party is considered to be on the right-wing or the far-right of the political spectrum. It strongly supports unification with China under the \"one country, two systems\" formula and opposes Taiwanese independence. The New Party's \"one country, two systems\" plan proposes to establish a unified Chinese nation between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China. The Party's proposal also includes that after reunification, Taiwan would reduce the size of its military, stop purchasing U.S. equipment, and criminalize Taiwanese independence.\nHistory.\nThe New Party was formed on 22 August 1993 out of a split from the then-ruling Kuomintang (KMT) by members of the New Kuomintang Alliance. Members of the Alliance had accused KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui of autocratic tendencies and moving the party away from Chinese unification. Co-founders of the New Party included Chen Kuei-miao. Originally, the party wanted to keep the name of the faction, but was prevented from doing so due to the similarity of names. The name \"New Party\" was seemingly inspired by the contemporary electoral success of the Japan New Party.\nAt this time, the party favored direct presidential elections, the ideals of Sun Yat-sen, voluntary service instead of military service, and \"equal protection of human rights.\" The party also called for direct flights between Taiwan and the mainland, speaking of a \"Great Chinese Common Market.\"\nIn the mid-1990s, the New Party attracted support from the KMT old guard as well as young urban professionals. The New Party was aided by former Finance Minister Wang Chien-shien and former Environmental Protection Administration Director Jaw Shaw-kong, who had charismatic and clean images.\nIn the 2000 presidential election, the party nominated writer and dissident Li Ao, who ran a spirited but token campaign. In the election, most members of the party supported former provincial governor James Soong, who ran as an independent candidate after losing the KMT nomination and subsequently being expelled from the KMT, and in fact both Li Ao and the New Party leader Lee Ching-hua encouraged people to support him. In the 2001 Legislative Yuan election, the party won a single seat, Wu Cherng-dean's, in Kinmen.\nIn the 2005\u201306 municipal elections, the New Party made significant gains, seating over a dozen members into public office. The New Party also gained four seats in the Taipei Mayor's private offices.\nSince the 2008 Legislative Yuan elections, the New Party has not won any seats, while the party supported most of the KMT candidates.\nIdeology and policies.\nThe New Party considered to be to be a right-wing or far-right political party. It strongly opposes Taiwanese independence and supports Chinese unification. Since 1997, the NP has switched to the Chinese ultranationalist position, also considered pro-Beijing.\nIn August 2019, New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming announced a proposal to unify China under the \"one country, two systems\" principle. Under the party's plan, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China would be united as one country, and the country's name and flag would be determined by common consultations; Yok suggested \"China\" as the common name. The proposal includes post-unification goals such as maintaining a multi-party political system, a legal ban on the Taiwanese independence movement, reducing the size of Taiwan's armed forces, inclusion of Taiwanese representatives in China's delegation to the United Nations, and integration of Taiwanese business in the Belt and Road Initiative.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61921", "revid": "50842009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61921", "title": "Giller Prize", "text": "Canadian literary award\nThe Giller Prize (known as the Scotiabank Giller Prize from 2005 to 2023) is a literary award given to a Canadian author of a novel or short story collection published in English (including translation) the previous year, after an annual juried competition between publishers who submit entries. The prize was established in 1994 by Toronto businessman Jack Rabinovitch in honour of his late wife Doris Giller, a former literary editor at the \"Toronto Star\", and is awarded in November of each year along with a cash reward (then CAN$25,000) with the winner being presented by the previous year's winning author.\nSince its inception, the Giller Prize has been awarded to emerging and established authors from both small independent and large publishing houses in Canada.\nHistory.\nFrom 1994 to 2004, the prize included a bronze figure created by artist Yehouda Chaki. The current prize includes a trophy designed by Soheil Mosun.\nOn September 22, 2005, the Giller Prize established an endorsement deal with Canadian bank Scotiabank. The total prize package for the award was increased to $50,000, with $40,000 presented to the winning author and $2,500 each for the other four shortlisted nominees. The award's official name was also changed at that time to the Scotiabank Giller Prize.\nIn 2006, the prize instituted a longlist for the first time, comprising no fewer than 10 and no more than 15 titles. In 2008, the prize fund was increased to $50,000 for the winning author and $5,000 for each of the authors on the shortlist. In 2014, the prize package was expanded further, to $100,000 for the winning author and $10,000 for each of the shortlisted authors. If a translated work wins the award, however, then the prize money is split, with 70 per cent going to the original author and 30 per cent going to the translator.\nIn 2015, the jury was expanded from three to five people.\nOver the years, the Giller Prize has run different promotions to extend its recognition and support of Canadian literary talent to highlight all Canadian fiction eligible for the prize in a given publishing year. For example, the Craving CanLit feature (previously called Crazy for CanLit), which highlights the initial list of all titles that are under consideration for the award's longlist and shortlist nominations, seeks to publicize Canadian literature by engaging readers and writers through social media tools. Another online initiative started in 2021, the Giller Book Club, featuring virtual author readings and interviews, got off to a bumpy start when the inaugural offering was the victim of zoombombing.\nSince Rabinovitch's death in 2017, the Giller Prize Foundation is now overseen by his daughter Elana Rabinovitch.\nCultural debate.\nFollowing Vincent Lam's win of the Giller Prize in 2006, \"Geist\" columnist Stephen Henighan criticized the Giller Prize for its apparent dependency for its shortlists and winners on books published by Bertelsmann AG-affiliated Canadian publishing houses, all of which are based in Toronto.\nArguing that the trend towards centralization of Canadian publishing in Toronto has led to a monopolistic control of the Giller Prize by Bertelsmann and its authors, Henighan wrote, \"Year after year the vast majority of the books shortlisted for the Giller came from the triumvirate of publishers owned by the Bertelsmann Group: Knopf Canada, Doubleday Canada and Random House Canada. Like the three musketeers, this trio is in fact a quartet: Bertelsmann also owns 25 percent of McClelland &amp; Stewart, and now manages M&amp;S\u2019s marketing.\" Henighan added that all of the Giller Prize winners from 1994 to 2004, with the exception of Mordecai Richler, lived within a two-hour drive of downtown Toronto.\nThe article raised debate within the media and in the wider public over the credibility of the Giller Prize. Henighan revisited that article in 2015.\nIn 2010, there was much talk about how small presses dominated that year\u2019s shortlist. Montrealer Johanna Skibsrud won the Giller Prize that year for her novel \"The Sentimentalists\", published by independent Gaspereau Press. The company produces books using a 1960s offset printing press and hand-bindery equipment. As a result, while there was great demand for the book in the marketplace, the publisher had trouble keeping up with production. In the end, they turned to Douglas &amp; McIntyre, a large West-coast publisher, to print copies of the book.\nThe Gaspereau situation prompted an examination within the cultural community about what makes a book and the nature of publishing and marketing books. The book also became the top-selling title for Kobo eReaders, outselling even George W. Bush's memoir \"Decision Points\".\nIn November 2023, a month after the October 7th escalation of the Gaza War, pro-Palestinian protestors interrupted the Giller ceremony to object to Scotiabank's sponsorship of the prize, given the bank's reported $500m investment in Israel-based arms manufacturer Elbit Systems. In response to their arrests, an open letter was circulated in solidarity with the protestors, which was signed by more than 2,000 people, including past winners, finalists, and jurors of the prize. By March 2024, Scotiabank had divested nearly half of its stake in Elbit Systems.\nIn July 2024, 19 authors presented a letter withdrawing their books from consideration for that year's prize and demanding the foundation pressure Scotiabank's full divestment from Elbit Systems, as well as ending the sponsorships by the Azrieli Foundation, Indigo, and Audible over their ties to Israel. The letter was also signed by two previous winners of the prize. Dinaw Mengestu\u2013who was originally set to serve on the jury that year\u2013resigned in response; the following week, the other international juror, Megha Majumdar, did as well. In the first quarter of 2024, Scotiabank further divested from Elbit Systems by more than $100-million; this makes for a total divestment over the previous year of more than three quarters of its total stake.\nCovering the controversy, Marsha Lederman of \"The Globe and Mail\" noted that several other Canadian literary awards, including the Amazon.ca First Novel Award and the Carol Shields Prize for Fiction, were not being targeted despite also being sponsored by companies with financial ties to Israel, and suggested that the primary reason for focusing solely on the Giller was that founder Jack Rabinovitch had been Jewish.\nThe 2024 ceremony followed a different format than previous years, being taped for later rebroadcast rather than being aired live, although organizers and the CBC attributed this to increasingly common practice for awards ceremonies (such as the Canadian Screen Awards, which have also been broadcast in recent years as tape-delayed one-hour \"highlights\" specials rather than full live ceremonies) rather than the protests. Despite this, protestors still picketed the hotel where the ceremony was taking place.\nScotiabank's sponsorship of the prize ended in February 2025. In July 2025, the Giller Foundation announced that the award was in danger of having to shut down at the end of 2025 if other sponsorships and/or public government support could not be secured.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Successive governors general have followed suit, establishing an award for whichever endeavour they personally found important. Only Adrienne Clarkson created three Governor General's Awards: the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts, the Governor General's Northern Medal, and the Governor General's Medal in Architecture (though this was effectively a continuation of the Massey Medal, first established in 1950).\nGovernor General's Literary Awards.\nInaugurated in 1937 for 1936 publications in two categories, the Governor General's Literary Awards have become one of Canada's most prestigious prizes. Since 1987, there are fourteen awards: nonfiction (English and French), fiction (English and French), poetry (English and French), drama (English and French), young people's literature\u00a0\u2013 text (English and French), young people's literature\u00a0\u2013 illustration (English and French), and translation (English-to-French and French-to-English). The program was created by the Lord Tweedsmuir, author of \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\". Initially there were only awards for fiction and non-fiction books, and until 1959 the program honoured only English-language works (although the awards were occasionally won by English translations of works originally published in French). The Stephen Leacock Award for humour literature, while administered separately from the Governor General's Awards and presented to the winners at a separate ceremony, made its initial announcements of award winners as part of the Governor General's Awards announcements in this era.\nIn 1957, the awards were put under the administration of the Canada Council for the Arts and a cash prize began to be granted to the winner. By 1980, the council began to announce the finalists for the awards a month before they were presented, in order to attract more media attention, and, in 2007, the cash prize was increased to $25,000.\nPrior to Adrienne Clarkson's time as governor general, the collection of Governor General's Literary Award-winning books at Rideau Hall was lacking more than 25 per cent of the full collection. Clarkson made an effort to obtain from fairs and second hand shops the missing copies for the governor general's study and, when she left the viceregal office in 2005, the complete collection of winning books to date had been amassed. It reached 552 books by late 2006 and was moved to Rideau Hall's library. Today it forms the only complete collection of Governor General's Literary Award winners in existence.\nCategories.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernor General's Medals in Architecture.\nThe Governor General's Medals in Architecture have been presented since 1982, continuing the tradition of the Massey Medals for Architecture, which had been awarded between 1950 and 1970. Up to twelve medals are awarded every two years, with no distinction among the medals awarded. The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada administers the competition.\nGovernor General's Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case.\nThe Governor General's Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case have been presented since their creation by Governor General Edward Schreyer in 1979, and honour the promotion of equality for girls and women in Canada. Five awards are given annually to candidates chosen from across the country, in addition to one award to a Canadian youth. The awards are administered by Status of Women Canada and may be presented to persons of any gender; in 2008, Ben Barry became the first man to win the award.\nGovernor General's Performing Arts Awards.\nThe Governor General's Performing Arts Awards are the foremost honours presented for excellence in the performing arts, in the categories of dance, classical music, popular music, film, broadcasting, and theatre. They were initiated in 1992 by Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn and the first recipients were William Hutt, Gweneth Lloyd, Dominique Michel, Mercedes Palomino, Oscar Peterson, L\u00e9opold Simoneau, Norman Jewison, and Gilles Maheu and CARBONE 14. Initially, the award came with a $15,000 prize from the Canada Council; today's winners receive $25,000 and a medallion struck by the Royal Canadian Mint. In addition, two complementary awards are given: The Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Performing Arts, recognizing the voluntary services to the performing arts by an individual or group, and the National Arts Centre Award, which recognizes an individual artist's or company's work during the past performance year. There is also a mentorship program that connects award recipients with artists in their early to mid-career. Since 2008, the National Film Board of Canada has produced short films about each of the laureates, which are screened at the awards ceremony and streamed online.\nGovernor General's History Awards.\nGovernor General Rom\u00e9o LeBlanc and Canada's National History Society created the Governor General's History Awards in 1996 to honour excellence in the teaching of Canadian history. The society then, working with other Canadian history organizations (including the Begbie Society, Canadian Historical Association, Canadian Museums Association, and Historica-Dominion Institute), expanded the scope of the awards beyond simply school teachers to include others who taught history in other ways and venues. There are now five specific awards within the Governor General's History Awards: the Governor General's History Awards for Excellence in Teaching, the Governor General's History Award for Scholarly Research (Sir John A. Macdonald Prize), the Governor General's History Award for Popular Media (Pierre Berton Award), the Governor General's History Award for Excellence in Museums, and the Governor General's History Awards for Excellence in Community Programming.\nGovernor General's Awards in Visual and Media Arts.\nThe Governor General's Awards in Visual Arts and Media Arts were first presented in 2000. The Canada Council for the Arts funds and administers the awards.\nSix prizes are awarded annually to visual and media artists for distinguished career achievement in fine arts (painting, drawing, photography, print-making and sculpture, including installation and other three-dimensional work), applied arts (architecture and fine crafts), independent film and video, or audio and new media. One prize is awarded annually for outstanding contributions to the visual or media arts in a volunteer or professional capacity. The value of each award is $15,000. An independent peer jury of senior visual and media arts professionals selects the winners.\nGovernor General's Award in Celebration of the Nation's Table.\nConceived in 2006 by Jean-Daniel Lafond, husband of Governor General Micha\u00eblle Jean, the Governor General's Award in Celebration of the Nation's Table was created to recognize Canadians\u2014as individuals or in groups\u2014who improved the \"quality, variety and sustainability of all elements and ingredients of our nation's table\". Jean and Lafond consulted with many across Canada involved in the production of food products, as well as chefs, organizers of culinary festivals, sommeliers, and more.\nThe award has six categories: Creativity and Innovation, recognizing those who contributed original, forward-thinking ideas, products, or techniques related to food or drink; Education and Awareness, recognizing those who helped give a broader profile to the \"nation's table\"; Leadership, recognizing those who led others to form stronger communities connected to the food and beverage industries; Mentorship and Inspiration, recognizing role models in the food and beverage industries; Stewardship and Sustainability, recognizing those who were at the forefront of developing and/or practicing safeguards around the environment, food security, and health; and Youth, recognizing young Canadians who have demonstrated a potential to improve the quality, variety, awareness, and sustainability of the food and beverage industries.\nAn advisory committee of food and beverage experts reviews nominations. Recipients receive a lapel pin and a framed certificate bearing the heraldic shield of the Governor General's Award in Celebration of the Nation's Table.\nGovernor General's Innovation Awards.\nGovernor General David Johnston created the Governor General's Innovation Awards in 2016 for Canadians who have created \"exceptional and transformational Canadian innovations, which are creating a positive impact in Canada and beyond\". These can have been developed in the public, private, or non-profit realms, but applicants must demonstrate the impact of their innovations; imapacts cannot be theoretical. The awards are also not intended for lifetime achievement. Administered by the Rideau Hall Foundation (also established by Johnston), six awards are given annually; winners are selected on merit by a two-stage process.\nThe Governor General's Innovation Awards receive both public and private financial support and are partnered with various organizations across Canada. The founding partners were the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General, the Rideau Hall Foundation, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, and the Canada Science and Technology Museums Corporation. \"The Globe and Mail\" is the outreach partner to the awards and Facebook is the digital partner.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Serbian royal titles used include Knyaz (Prince), Grand \u017dupan (Grand Prince), King, Tsar (Emperor), and Despot.\nEarly medieval Serbian states (7th century\u20131166).\nVlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty (7th century\u2013960).\nThe Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty was the first royal dynasty of the Serb people. Byzantine emperor Constantine VII \"Porphyrogenitus\" (r. 913\u2013959) mentions that the Serbian throne is inherited by \"the son\", i.e. the first-born, though in his enumeration of Serbian monarchs, on one occasion there was a triumvirate. The Serbs established several polities by the 10th century: \"Serbia\" or \"Zagorje\" (\"hinterlands\") which consisted of Serbia and small land of Bosnia; and \"Pomorje\" (\"maritime\") which consisted of Dioclea, Zachlumia, Pagania, Travunia (including Kanalitai). The Serbian ruler was titled \"knyaz\" or \"archon\" by the Byzantines, \"prince\".\nThe history of the dynasty starts with the eponymous founder Vlastimir. This era is marked by the Christianization of Serbs, the many internal and external wars (Bulgars, Magyars), and the power struggle between the First Bulgarian Empire and the Byzantine Empire in which Serbia found itself in the middle. The history of this dynasty ends with the annexation of Serbia in 969.\nVojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty (1018\u20131186).\nWith the partial annexation of Serbia, the county around the city of Doclea emerges into a Principality, where the leaders adopt the title \"archon of Serbs\", signifying supreme leadership among Serbs, alongside their given offices under Byzantine overlordship. The first office-holder was Peter of Diokleia, of which we only have a seal found in the 19th century. The next known is Jovan Vladimir, who became a Bulgarian vassal. Stefan Vojislav succeeds in giving the realm independence, he is the eponymous founder of the Vojislavljevi\u0107i that ruled Duklja from the early 11th century up to the 1180s.\nVukanovi\u0107 dynasty (1091\u20131166).\nIn the mid-11th century, Mihailo I had liberated Serbia from Byzantine rule, and appointed his son Petrislav to rule as Prince, independently. In 1083, Constantine Bodin appoints brothers Vukan and Marko, sons of Petrislav, as rulers of Serbia. In 1089, the Byzantines capture Bodin, and Vukan retains independence, founding the Vukanovi\u0107 dynasty. The Vukanovi\u0107i quickly claim the following Serbian domains in the following decades, and by 1148, the maritime possessions are united with the inland. The Byzantine Empire at times intervened in the political scene, and at times Serbia had Hungary as its main ally. The dynasty ruled until 1166, when a dynastic branch is instated by the Byzantines.\nAfter Desa's revolt, in 1165 the Byzantium divided the Serb lands between the four sons of Zavida: Tihomir in Ra\u0161ka, Stracimir in Duklja, Miroslav in Zahumlje and Travunia, and Stefan Nemanja in Toplica (in today's central Serbia). Stefan Nemanja rebelled against his eldest brother Tihomir in 1166, who fled with his brothers Stracimir and Miroslav to Byzantium to seek help. But later on, Stefan Nemanja defeated his Greek army of mercenaries in the same year near the town of Pantino on Kosovo in which poor Tihomir drowned in the River of Sitnica. Nemanja captured his other brothers and made peace with them by giving them rule in their former parts of the land to recognise him as the only ruler of Rashka or Serbia. The Nemanji\u0107 dynasty was named after Stefan Nemanja and ruled over Serbia until 1371.\nLate medieval Serbian state (1166\u20131371).\nNemanji\u0107 dynasty (1166\u20131373).\nThe Nemanji\u0107 dynasty ruled the Serb lands between ca. 1166 up to 1371.\nFall of the medieval Serbian state (1371\u20131496).\nMagnate provinces.\nThe crumbling Serbian Empire under Stefan Uro\u0161 V (called \"the Weak\") was to be of little resistance to the powerful Ottoman Empire. In light of conflicts and decentralization of the realm, the Ottomans defeated the Serbs at the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, making vassals of the southern governors, soon thereafter, the Emperor died. As Uro\u0161 was childless and the nobility could not agree on the rightful heir, the Empire was ruled by semi-independent provincial lords, who often were in feuds with each other. The most powerful of these, Tsar Lazar, a Duke of present-day central Serbia (which had not yet come under the Ottoman yoke), stood against the Ottomans at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. The result was indecisive, but it resulted in the subsequent fall of Serbia.\nThe administration was divided in the following:\nDistrict of Brankovi\u0107 / Serbian Despotate.\nThe Brankovi\u0107 family descends from the Nemanji\u0107i and the Lazarevi\u0107i via female line. The family rises to prominence during the time of disintegration of the Serbian Empire under the last Nemanji\u0107. The original family domains were centred around Kosovo region, one of the heartlands of medieval Serbian state. Later members of the house extended their rule over all remaining independent regions of Serbia making them the last suzerain rulers of medieval Serbia. The dynasty ruled the Serbian Despotate from 1427 to 1459.\nKingdom of Yugoslavia (1918\u20131941).\nKara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty (1918\u20131945).\nIn 1918, Serbia became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Later that state changed name to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (i.e. Kingdom of South Slavs) in 1929. During that interwar period the country was a parliamentary monarchy (except during the period of royal dictatorship 1929\u20131931), ruled by the house of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107.\nAfter World War II and the civil war Yugoslavia became a communist state known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, ruled by Josip Broz Tito and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. After Tito's death in 1980, the federation started a process of dissolution which finished in a series of civil wars in the early 1990s. Through the 1990s, constituent republics Serbia and Montenegro comprised the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was restructured in 2003 into a confederation called Serbia and Montenegro. The state union ended with Montenegro's independence following the 2006 independence referendum. Currently Serbia is a parliamentary republic. There was no referendum of restoration of parliamentary monarchy, although political organizations and a certain public in favor of it do exist.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It also forms the base for various other sauces, such as tartar sauce, fry sauce, remoulade, salsa golf, ranch dressing, and rouille.\nMayonnaise is an emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and an acid, either vinegar or lemon juice; there are many variants using additional flavorings. The color varies from near-white to pale yellow, and its texture from a light cream to a thick gel.\nCommercial eggless versions are made for those who avoid chicken eggs because of egg allergies, to limit dietary cholesterol, or because they adhere to a vegetarian or vegan diet.\nHistory.\n\"Mayonnaise\" is a French cuisine appellation that seems to have appeared for the first time in 1806. The hypotheses invoked over time as to the origin(s) of mayonnaise have been numerous and contradictory. Most hypotheses do however agree on the geographical origin of the sauce, Mah\u00f3n, in Menorca, Spain during the occupation by French troops in the Seven Years' War. Other theories have been dismissed by some authors as being somewhat a retrospective invention aiming to credit the sauce as an invention of south-western France, when most likely, its origin can be found in the port city of Menorca.\nMayonnaise sauce may have its origins in the ancient remoulade. Another hypothesis is that mayonnaise is derived from aioli. Finally, the process of emulsifying egg yolk was known for a long time to pharmacists, who used it to prepare ointments and salves. Some have pointed out that it would make sense that mayonnaise originated in Spain given its requirement of olive oil, a liquid produced and consumed mostly there at the time. This hypothesis is similar to another that places the origins of French fries in Spain using the same rationale.\nIn 1750, Francesc Roger Gomila, a Valencian friar, published a recipe for a sauce similar to mayonnaise in \"Art de la Cuina\" ('The Art of Cooking'). He calls the sauce \"aioli bo\". If he does not describe precisely the recipe\u2014suggesting that it was known by everyone on the island\u2014the way it is used, the preparations for which it is used as a base and the dishes with which it is associated are most often inconceivable with an aioli. Earlier recipes of similar emulsified sauces, usually containing garlic, appear in a number of Spanish recipe books dating back to the 14th-century \"Llibre de Sent Sov\u00ed\", where it is called \"all-i-oli\", literally 'garlic and oil' in Catalan. This sauce had clearly spread throughout the Crown of Aragon, for Juan de Altamiras gives a recipe for it in his celebrated 1745 recipe book \"Nuevo Arte de Cocina\" ('New Art of Cooking').\nOn April 18, 1756, the Duke of Richelieu invaded Menorca and took the port of Mahon. A theory states that the \"aioli bo\" sauce was thereafter adopted by the cook of the Duke of Richelieu, who upon his return to France made the sauce famous in the French court. which would have been known as \"mahonnaise\". A number of legends arose relating how the Duke of Richelieu first tried the sauce, including his discovery of the sauce in a local inn of Mahon where he would have allegedly asked the innkeeper to make him some dinner during the siege of Mahon, and even that he invented it himself as a quick garnish.\nAnother version is Grimod de La Reyni\u00e8re's 1808 \"bayonnaise\" sauce which is a sort of aspic: \"But if one wants to make from this cold chicken, a dish of distinction, one composes a bayonnaise, whose green jelly, of a good consistency, forms the most worthy ornament of poultry and fish salads.\" \nIn 1806, Andr\u00e9 Viard, in Le Cuisinier imp\u00e9rial, transformed this recipe for remoulade by replacing the roux with egg yolk. In another recipe, an \"Indian remoulade\", without mustard, he specifies that the binding is facilitated by incorporating the oil little by little. This is the first modern mention of a stable cold emulsified sauce.\nIt is only in 1815 that Antonin Car\u00eame mentions a cold \"magnonaise\" emulsified with egg yolk. The word \"mayonnaise\" is attested in English in 1815. Auguste Escoffier wrote that mayonnaise was a French mother sauce of cold sauces.\nEtymology.\nA common theory is that it is named for Port Mahon ( in Catalan), itself named after its founder Mago Barca, in Menorca, in honor of the 3rd Duke of Richelieu's victory over the British in 1756, and in fact the name \"mahonnaise\" is used by some authors. But the name is only attested several decades after that event. One version of this theory says that it was originally known as in Spanish, but that spelling too is only attested later.\nAlexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reyni\u00e8re, a lawyer by qualification who acquired fame during the reign of Napoleon for his sensual and public gastronomic lifestyle, rejected the name \"mayonnaise\" because the word \"is not French\". He also rejected the name \"mahonnaise\" because Port Mahon \"is not known for good food\", and thus he preferred \"bayonnaise\", after the city of Bayonne, which \"has many innovative gourmands and... produces the best hams in Europe.\" Indeed, the city of Bayonne (sauce ) could also have given its name to this type of sauce, by spelling deformation. This form would seem to be confirmed by the fact that there is no written record of the sauce before the beginning of the 19th century, long after the capture of the city of Mah\u00f3n.\nAnother hypothesis is based, according to Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, a famous contemporary French chef, on a derivative of (from the verb , or ) or, according to Prosper Montagn\u00e9, of (or ), based on (or ) which means 'egg yolk', in Old French. It has also been suggested that the word be linked to the old verb , meaning 'to beat'.\nJoseph Favre, for his part, states in his memoirs that mayonnaise is an alteration of the word , derived from (Lot-et-Garonne), and that a cook from Magnon would have popularized it first in the South of France; he notes that this sauce has been variously named \"mahonnaise\", \"bayonnaise\" and \"mayonnaise\".\nPreparation.\nRecipes for mayonnaise date to the early nineteenth century. In 1815, Louis Eustache Ude wrote:\nNo 58.\u2014Mayonnaise. Take three spoonfuls of Allemande, six ditto of aspic, and two of oil. Add a little tarragon vinegar, that has not boiled, some pepper and salt, and minced ravigotte, or merely some parsley. Then put in the members of fowl, or fillets of soles, &amp;c. Your mayonnaise must be put to ice; neither are you to put the members into your sauce till it begins to freeze. Next dish your meat or fish, mask with the sauce before it be quite frozen, and garnish your dish with whatever you think proper, as beet root, jelly, nasturtiums, &amp;c.\nIn an 1820 work, Viard describes something like the more familiar emulsified version:\nThis sauce is made to \"take\" in many ways: with raw egg yolks, with gelatine, with veal or veal brain glaze. The most common method is to take a raw egg yolk in a small terrine, with a little salt and lemon juice: take a wooden spoon, turn it while letting a trickle of oil fall and stirring constantly; as your sauce thickens, add a little vinegar; put in too a pound of good oil: serve your sauce with good salt: serve it white or green, adding green of ravigote or green of spinach. This sauce is used for cold fish entrees, or salad of vegetables cooked in salt water.In February 1856, the Huddersfield https:// and West Yorkshire Advertiser published a recipe for homemade mayonnaise in a segment entitled \"The Housewife's Corner.\" This recipe included six egg yolks, half a bottle of olive oil (volume not otherwise defined) and one-half teaspoon of vinegar. The serving suggestion was to pour this over roast chicken or turkey, with garnish of lettuce and hard eggs.\nModern mayonnaise can be made by hand with a whisk, a fork, or with the aid of an electric mixer or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.\nFor large-scale preparation of mayonnaise where mixing equipment is being employed, the process typically begins with the dispersal of eggs, either powdered or liquid, into water. Once emulsified, the remaining ingredients are then added and vigorously mixed until completely hydrated and evenly dispersed. Oil is then added as rapidly as it can be absorbed. Though only a small part of the total, ingredients other than the oil are critical to proper formulation. These must be totally hydrated and dispersed within a small liquid volume, which can cause difficulties including emulsion breakdown during the oil-adding phase. Often, a long agitation process is required to achieve proper dispersal/emulsification, presenting one of the trickiest phases of the production process. As food technology advances processing has been shortened drastically, allowing about 1000 liters to be produced in 10 minutes.\nImitations.\nMiracle Whip was developed as a less expensive imitation of mayonnaise. Lacking sufficient oil, it does not meet the legal definition of mayonnaise, and so is marketed as salad dressing.\nEgg-free imitations of mayonnaise are available for vegans and others who avoid eggs or cholesterol, or who have egg allergies. In the U.S., these imitations cannot be labelled as \"mayonnaise\" because the definition of mayonnaise requires egg. Egg-free imitations generally contain soya or pea protein as the emulsifying agent to stabilize oil droplets in water. Well-known brands include Nasoya's Nayonaise, Vegenaise and Just Mayo in North America, and Plamil Egg Free in the United Kingdom.\nUses.\nMayonnaise is used commonly around the world, and is also a base for many other chilled sauces and salad dressings. For example, \"sauce r\u00e9moulade\", in classic French cuisine, is a mix of mayonnaise and mustard, gherkins, capers, parsley, chervil, tarragon, and possibly anchovy essence.\nChile is the world's third major per capita consumer of mayonnaise and first in Latin America. Commercial mayonnaise became widely accessible in the 1980s.\nGuidelines issued in September 1991 by Europe's Federation of the Condiment Sauce Industries recommend that mayonnaise should contain at least 70% oil and 5% liquid egg yolk. The Netherlands incorporated this guideline in 1998 into the law \"Warenwetbesluit Gereserveerde aanduidingen\" in article 4. Most available brands easily exceed these targets. In countries influenced by French culture, mustard is also a common ingredient that acts as an additional emulsifier.\nJapanese mayonnaise is typically made with rice vinegar, which gives it a flavor different from mayonnaise made from distilled vinegar. Apart from salads, it is popular with dishes such as \"okonomiyaki, takoyaki\" and \"yakisoba\" and may also accompany \"katsu\" and \"karaage\". It is most often sold in soft plastic squeeze bottles. Its texture is thicker than most Western commercial mayonnaise. Kewpie (Q.P.) is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise, advertised with a Kewpie doll logo. The vinegar is a proprietary blend containing apple and malt vinegars. The Kewpie company was started in 1925 by Tochiro Nakashima, whose goal was to create a condiment that made eating vegetables more enjoyable.\nMayonnaise is very popular in Russia, where it is made with sunflower oil and soybean oil. A 2004 study showed that Russia is the only market in Europe where more mayonnaise than ketchup is sold. It is used as a sauce in the most popular salads in Russia, such as Olivier salad (also known as Russian salad), dressed herring, and many others. Leading brands are Calv\u00e9 (marketed by Unilever) and Sloboda (marketed by Efko).\nCommercial mayonnaise marketed in jars originated in Philadelphia in 1907 when Amelia Schlorer began marketing a mayonnaise recipe originally used in salads sold in her family's grocery store. Mrs. Schlorer's mayonnaise was an instant success with local customers and eventually grew into the Schlorer Delicatessen Company. Around the same time in New York City, a family from Vetschau, Germany, at Richard Hellmann's delicatessen on Columbus Avenue, featured his wife's homemade recipe in salads sold in their delicatessen. The condiment quickly became so popular that Hellmann began selling it in \"wooden boats\" that were used for weighing butter. In 1912, Mrs. Hellmann's mayonnaise was mass-marketed and was trademarked in 1926 as Hellmann's Blue Ribbon Mayonnaise. After numerous corporate iterations, it is sold as Hellmann's in the Eastern United States and as Best Foods Mayonnaise in the Western United States. Mayonnaise sales are about US$1.3 billion per year in the U.S.\nNutritional information.\nA typical formulation for commercially made mayonnaise (not low fat) can contain as much as 80% vegetable oil, typically soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, or corn oil, depending on region of production, but, in specialty products, sometimes olive or avocado oil. Water makes up about 7% to 8% and egg yolks about 6%. Some formulas use whole eggs instead of just yolks. The remaining ingredients include vinegar (4%), salt (1%), and sugar (1%). Low-fat formulas will typically decrease oil content to just 50% and increase water content to about 35%. Egg content is reduced to 4% and vinegar to 3%. Sugar is increased to 1.5% and salt lowered to 0.7%. Gums or thickeners (4%) are added to increase viscosity, improve texture, and ensure a stable emulsion. Mayonnaise is prepared using several methods, but on average it contains around per 100 grams, or 94 kilocalories (Cal) per tablespoon. This makes mayonnaise a calorically dense food.\nMayonnaise, both commercially processed and home-made, has been associated with illnesses from \"Salmonella\" globally. The source of the \"Salmonella\" has been confirmed to be raw eggs. Several outbreaks with fatal cases have been recorded, with a few major incidents. In a 1955 outbreak in Denmark, 10,000 people were affected by \"Salmonella\" from contaminated mayonnaise made by a large kitchen. The pH of the mayonnaise was found to be 5.1, with \"Salmonella\" counts of 180,000 CFU/g. The second outbreak, also in Denmark, caused 41 infections with two fatalities. The pH of the contaminated mayonnaise was 6.0, with \"Salmonella\" counts of 6 million CFU/g. In 1976 there were serious salmonellosis outbreaks on four flights to and from Spain which caused 500 cases and six fatalities. In 1984 in the US, 404 people became ill and nine died in a New York City hospital due to hospital-prepared mayonnaise. In all salmonellosis cases, the major reason was inadequate acidification of the mayonnaise, with a pH higher than the recommended upper limit of 4.1, with acetic acid as the main acidifying agent. Some brands use pasteurized eggs which would reduce this risk factor.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She lived and wrote at an unknown court, but she and her work were almost certainly known at the royal court of King Henry II of England. Virtually nothing is known of her life; both her given name and its geographical specification come from manuscripts containing her works. However, one written description of her work and popularity from her own era still exists. She is considered by scholars to be the first woman known to write francophone verse.\nMarie de France wrote in Old French, possibly the Anglo-Norman variety. She was proficient in Latin, as were most authors and scholars of that era, as well as Middle English and possibly Breton. She is the author of the \"Lais of Marie de France\". She translated Aesop's Fables from Middle English into Anglo-Norman French and wrote \"Espurgatoire seint Partiz\", \"Legend of the Purgatory of St. Patrick\", based upon a Latin text. Recently, she has been (tentatively) identified as the author of a saint's life, \"The Life of Saint Audrey\". Her \"Lais\" were and still are widely read and influenced the subsequent development of the romance/heroic literature genre.\nLife and works.\nThe actual name of the author now known as Marie de France is unknown; she has acquired this nom de plume from a line in one of her published works: \"Marie ai num, si sui de France,\" which translates as \"My name is Marie, and I am from France.\" Some of the most commonly proposed suggestions for the identity of this 12th-century poet are Marie of France, Countess of Champagne; Marie, Abbess of Shaftesbury and half-sister to Henry II, King of England; Marie, Abbess of Reading; Marie I of Boulogne; Marie, Abbess of Barking; and Marie de Meulan, wife of Hugh Talbot and daughter of Waleran de Meulan. Based on evidence from her writings, it is clear that, despite being born in France, she spent much of her life living in England.\nFour works, or collections of works, have been attributed to Marie de France. She is principally known for her authorship of \"The Lais of Marie de France\", a collection of twelve narrative poems, mostly of a few hundred lines each. She claims in the preambles to most of these Breton lais that she has heard the stories they contain from Breton minstrels, and it is in the opening lines of the poem \"Guigemar\" that she first reveals her name to be Marie.\n102 \"Ysopet\" fables have also been attributed to her besides a retelling of the \"Legend of the Purgatory of St. Patrick\" and, recently, a saint's life called \"La Vie seinte Audree\" about Saint Audrey of Ely, although this last attribution is not accepted by all critics.\nScholars have dated Marie's works to between about 1160 and 1215, the earliest and latest possible dates respectively. It is probable that the \"Lais\" were written in the late 12th century; they are dedicated to a \"noble king\", usually assumed to be Henry II of England or possibly his eldest son, Henry the Young King. Another of her works, the \"Fables\", is dedicated to a \"Count William\", who may have been either William of Mandeville or William Marshall. However, it has also been suggested that Count William may refer to William Longsword. Longsword was a recognized illegitimate son of Henry II. If Marie was actually Henry II's half-sister, a dedication to his son (who would be her nephew), might be understandable. \nProvenance and language.\nIt is likely that Marie de France was known at the court of King Henry II and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. A contemporary of Marie, the English poet Denis Piramus, mentions in his \"Life of Saint Edmund the King\", written in around 1180, the lais of a Marie, which were popular in aristocratic circles. Her origins could have been in the parts of \u00cele-de-France close to Normandy, or alternatively in an area in between such as Brittany or the Vexin. But the Anglo-Norman influence may be due to her living in England during her adult life, which is also suggested by the fact that so many of her texts were found in England. In addition, \"si sui de France\" is ambiguous and equivocal, and may refer to a region less specific than the \u00cele-de-France \u2013 for example, an area not in the Angevin Empire.\nIt is clear from her writing that Marie de France was highly educated and multilingual; this level of education was not available to the common or poor at this time, so we can infer that Marie de France was of aristocratic birth and/ or belonged to a religious house (cf. Hrotsvitha, H\u00e9lo\u00efse, Bridget of Sweden, and Hildegard of Bingen). The precise language or dialect she wrote in is a matter of some discussion. Her language is one of the many versions of Old French with Anglo-Norman elements; R. Howard Bloch notes that identifying her particular language may be a fruitless exercise given that there was no standardized spelling and that the many varieties of Old French identified by (nineteenth-century) scholars are to some extent their own invention, and the linguistic question is connected to the matter of her provenance. June Hall McCash, summarizing scholarship in 2011, said:Pontfarcy [editor of the \"L\u2019Espurgatoire Seint Patriz\"] believes, as did H. Suchier, that the work's late 12th-century language, a mixture of Norman, Anglo-Norman, and Francien, indicates an author from \"une region fronti\u00e8re de la Normandie, qui par la suite, se serait install\u00e9 en Angleterre\". \u00d6sten S\u00f6derg\u00e5rd [\u2026] comes to a similar, though less specific, conclusion about the author of the Audree. [\u2026] his linguistic analysis reveals language traits that also suggest a mixture of Norman, Anglo-Norman, and Francien dialects.\nThe amount and importance of Francien in her language is assessed variously. According to Liam Lewis, \"her works are written in the Francien dialect with Anglo-Norman influences.\" McCash and Barban are less convinced of such a single designation: \"The language of Marie's other works has been studied by a number of earlier editors, from Warnke and Jenkins to Brucker and Pontfarcy, all of whom have concluded that she wrote in a form of continental French, though they have debated precisely what dialect of continental French she may have used. While there are elements of Francien and Norman, there are also a few Picard characteristics in the various texts.\"\nShe was first called \"Marie de France\" by the French scholar Claude Fauchet in 1581, in his \"Recueil de l'origine de la langue et poesie fran\u00e7oise\", and this name has been used ever since: Fauchet names her that and then cites the description of herself quoted above ('Marie ai nun, si sui de France').\nBreton lais.\nBreton lais were certainly in existence before Marie de France chose to recast the themes that she heard from Breton minstrels into poetic narratives in Anglo-Norman verse, but she may have been the first to present a \"new genre of the lai in narrative form.\" Her lays are a collection of 12 short narrative poems written in eight-syllable verse that were based on Breton or Celtic legends, which were part of the oral literature of the Bretons. The lais of Marie de France had a huge impact on the literary world. They were considered a new type of literary technique derived from classical rhetoric and imbued with such detail that they became a new form of art. Marie may have filled her detailed poems with imagery so that her audience would easily remember them. Her lais range in length from 118 (\"Chevrefoil\") to 1,184 lines (\"Eliduc\"), frequently describe courtly love entangled in love triangles involving loss and adventure, and \"often take up aspects of the \"merveilleux\" [marvellous], and at times intrusions from the fairy world.\"\nOne may have a better sense of Marie de France from her very first lay, or rather, the \"Prologue\" she uses to prepare her readers for what is to come. The first line dictates \u201cWhoever has received knowledge/ and eloquence in speech from God/ should not be silent or secretive/ but demonstrate it willingly\u201d Marie de France, in so many words, credits her literary skills to God and is therefore allowed to write the lays without her patron\u2019s permission (her patron likely being Henry II of England). She wants people to read what she has produced, along with her ideas, and as such urges readers to search between the lines, for her writing will be subtle. In this \"Prologue\" alone, Marie de France has deviated from common poets of her time by adding subtle, delicate, and weighted writing to her repertoire. Marie de France took her opportunity as a writer to make her words be heard, and she took them during a time where the production of books and codexes was a long, arduous, and expensive process, where just copying the Bible took fifteen months until the text\u2019s completion.\nUnlike the heroes of medieval romances, the characters in Marie\u2019s stories do not seek out adventure. Instead, adventures happen to them. While the settings are true to life, the lais often contain elements of folklore or of the supernatural, such as Bisclavret. While the setting is described in realistic detail, the subject is a werewolf, sympathetically portrayed. Marie moves back and forth between the real and the supernatural, skillfully expressing delicate shades of emotion. \"Lanval\" features a fairy woman who pursues the titular character and eventually brings her new lover to Avalon with her at the end of the lai. The setting for Marie's lais is the Celtic world, embracing England, Wales, Ireland, Brittany and Normandy.\nOnly five manuscripts containing some or all of Marie\u2019s lais exist now, and the only one to include the general prologue and all twelve lais is British Library MS Harley 978. That may be contrasted with the 25 manuscripts with Marie's \"Fables\" and perhaps reflects their relative popularity in the late Middle Ages. In these \"Fables\", she reveals a generally aristocratic point of view with a concern for justice, a sense of outrage against the mistreatment of the poor, and a respect for the social hierarchy. Nevertheless, Marie's lais have received much more critical attention in recent times.\nFables.\nAlong with her lais, Marie de France also published a large collection of fables. Many of the fables she wrote were translations of Aesop\u2019s fables into English and others can be traced to more regional sources, fables to which Marie would have been exposed at a young age. Among her 102 fables, there are no concrete guidelines for morality; and men, women, and animals receive varying treatments and punishments.\nMarie de France introduces her fables in the form of a prologue, where she explains the importance of moral instruction in society. In the first section of the prologue, she discusses the medieval ideal of \"clergie\". Clergie is the notion that people have a duty to understand, learn, and preserve works of the past for future peoples. Here, in the prologue, she is referencing the duty of scholars to preserve moral philosophy and proverbs. The rest of Marie de France\u2019s prologue outlines how Aesop took up this duty for his society and how she must now preserve his fables and others for her present culture.\nStructurally, each of the fables begins with the recounting of a tale, and at the end Marie de France includes a short moral. Some of these morals, like those translated from Aesop\u2019s fables, are expected and socially congruous. For instance, the fable of \"The Wolf and the Lamb\", also known as Fable 2 in Marie\u2019s collection, follows a well-known and established storyline. Just as in Aesop\u2019s original fable, Marie de France\u2019s translation describes a lamb and a wolf drinking from the same stream, the wolf unjustly condemning the lamb to death for drinking inoffensively downstream from him. Marie de France repeats the established moral at the end, \"But these are things rich nobles do\u2026destroy folk with false evidence\".\nHowever, in the new fables, featuring human female characters, Marie de France asserts female power and cunning, disparaging men who are ignorant or behave foolishly. One character, a peasant woman, makes multiple appearances in the fables and is praised for her shrewd and sly ways. Fables 44, \"The Woman Who Tricked Her Husband\" and 45, \"A Second Time, a Woman Tricks Her Husband\", both recount tales of the same peasant woman successfully carrying out an affair despite her husband having caught her with her lover both times. In the first fable, the peasant woman convinces her husband that her lover was merely a trick of the eye and in the second, persuades her husband that he has had a vision of her and a man, foreshadowing her death. Marie lauds the woman for her crafty ways and faults the peasant husband with idiocy. The morality, or lack thereof, in these two female-centered fables is interesting and takes root in the tradition of \"wife tricking her husband\" stories, such as \"The Merchant\u2019s Tale\" and Scots-Irish tradition.\nFable 51, \"Del cok e del gupil\" (\"Concerning the Cock and the Fox\"), is considered an early version of the Reynard the Fox tales, and was an inspiration for Geoffrey Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Tale.\nAccording to the epilogue of the \"Fables\", they are translated from an English version by Alfred the Great.\nLove.\nIn most of Marie de France\u2019s \"Lais\", love is associated with suffering, and over half of them involve an adulterous relationship. In \"Bisclavret\" and \"Equitan\", the adulterous lovers are severely condemned, but there is evidence that Marie approved of extramarital affairs under certain circumstances: \"When the deceived partner has been cruel and merits deception and when the lovers are loyal to one another.\" In Marie's \"Lais\", \"love always involves suffering and frequently ends in grief, even when the love itself is approved.\"\nMarie's lovers are usually isolated and relatively unconcerned with anything outside the immediate cause of their distress, whether a jealous husband or an envious society. However, \"the means of overcoming this suffering is beautifully and subtly illustrated.\" \"Marie concentrates on the individuality of her characters and is not very concerned with their integration into society. If society does not appreciate the lovers, then the lovers die or abandon society, and society is the poorer for it.\"\nDefying church traditions.\nMarie de France's lais not only portray a gloomy outlook on love but also defied the traditions of love within the church at the time. She wrote about adulterous affairs, women of high stature who seduce other men, and women seeking escape from a loveless marriage, often to an older man, which gave the idea that women can have sexual freedom. She wrote lais, many of which seemed to endorse sentiments that were contrary to the traditions of the church, especially the idea of virginal love and marriage.\nThe lais also exhibit the idea of a stronger female role and power. In this, she may have inherited ideas and norms from the troubadour love songs that were common at the Angevin courts of England, Aquitaine, Anjou and Brittany; songs in which the heroine \"is a contradictory symbol of power and inarticulacy; she is at once acutely vulnerable and emotionally overwhelming, irrelevant and central.\" Marie's heroines are often the instigators of events, but events that often end in suffering.\nThe heroines in Marie's \"Lais\" are often imprisoned. This imprisonment may take the form of actual incarceration by elderly husbands, as in \"Yonec\", and in \"Guigemar\", where the lady who becomes Guigemar's lover is kept behind the walls of a castle which faces the sea, or \"merely of close surveillance, as in \"Laustic\", where the husband, who keeps a close watch on his wife when he is present, has her watched equally closely when he is away from home.\" Perhaps it reflects some experience within her own life. The willingness to endorse such thoughts as adultery in the 12th century is perhaps remarkable. \"It certainly reminds us that people in the Middle Ages were aware of social injustices and did not just accept oppressive conditions as inevitable by the will of God.\"\nIn addition to her defying the construct of love exhibited by the contemporary church, Marie also influenced a genre that continued to be popular for another 300 years, the medieval romance. By the time Marie was writing her lais, France already had a deep-rooted tradition of the love-lyric, specifically in Provence. Marie's \"Lais\" represent, in many ways, a transitional genre between Proven\u00e7al love lyrics from an earlier time and the romance tradition that developed these themes.\nInfluence on literature.\nHer stories exhibit a form of lyrical poetry that influenced the way that narrative poetry was subsequently composed, adding another dimension to the narration through her prologues and the epilogues, for example. She also developed three parts to a narrative lai: aventure (the ancient Breton deed or story); lai (Breton melodies); conte (recounting the story narrated by the lai). Additionally, Marie de France brought to the fore a new genre known as chivalric literature.\nIn the late 14th century, at broadly the same time that Geoffrey Chaucer included \"The Franklin's Tale\", itself a Breton lai, in his \"Canterbury Tales\", a poet named Thomas Chestre composed a Middle English romance based directly upon Marie de France's \"Lanval\", which, perhaps predictably, spanned much more now than a few weeks of the hero's life, a knight named \"Sir Launfal\". In 1816, the English poet Matilda Betham wrote a long poem about Marie de France in octosyllabic couplets, \"The Lay of Marie\". A fictionalised Marie is the subject of Lauren Groff's novel \"Matrix\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most sauces are not normally consumed by themselves; they add flavour, texture, and visual appeal to a dish. \"Sauce\" is a French word probably from the post-classical Latin \"salsa\", derived from the classical \"salsus\" 'salted'. Possibly the oldest recorded European sauce is garum, the fish sauce used by the Ancient Romans, while doubanjiang, the Chinese soy bean paste, is mentioned in \"Rites of Zhou\" 20.\nSauces need a liquid component. Sauces are an essential element in cuisines all over the world.\nSauces may be used for sweet or savory dishes. They may be prepared and served cold, like mayonnaise, prepared cold but served lukewarm like pesto, cooked and served warm like bechamel or cooked and served cold, like apple sauce. They may be freshly prepared by the cook, especially in restaurants, but today many sauces are sold premade and packaged like Worcestershire sauce, HP Sauce, soy sauce or ketchup. Sauces for salad are called salad dressing. Sauces in Pakistani and Indian cuisine are made for curries.\nA chef who specializes in making sauces is called a saucier.\nFunction.\nSauces are used as accompaniments to improve the flavor of a dish. They may do this by deepening the flavor already present in ingredients or by providing pleasing complementary or contrasting flavors. Cultures around the world employ other accompaniments to the same effect, for instance relishes and stews, the latter seen in the Ethiopian wat accompanying injera flatbreads.\nCooking and then serving a sauce with a dish (a composed sauce) is predominantly a Western, particularly French, concept. With the exception of pasta, sauces in western cooking generally accompany meats and other proteins that have been subject to a simple cooking process such as frying. In Asia, sauces are integrated into the dish, seen in curries, or are used as a condiment, as in fish sauce.\nHistory.\nThe Latin (salted) is the root etymology of sauce.\nComposed sauces.\nComposed sauces are made in the kitchen, and are particularly important in classical French cuisine. Such sauces may be uncooked mixtures, for instance pesto and skordalia, or cooked, seen in Hollandaise and white sauces. They always contain basic seasonings, and in more intricate preparations include condiments and an intensified element of the ingredient being accompanied (for example, a sauce accompanying a steak incorporating meat juices released during cooking). A sauce made from the last is known as an integral sauce. Several basic cooked preparations, such as stocks, demi-glace and espagnole sauce may be preprepared and included in cooked sauces; these often are attempts to resemble a sauce made from an intensified element of the accompanied ingredient.\nSweet sauces.\nSauces are served hot and cold in several desserts. As with savory sauces, sweet sauces are used to intensify the flavors they accompany, but they also are used to generate various contrasting elements: a tart lemon sauce is frequently paired with a sweet white chocolate mousse, smooth sauces often provide textual contrast with crunchy pastry, and in hot fudge sundaes, a warm sauce functions as a counterpoint to the chilled ice cream.\nCuisines.\nAmerican.\nAmerican sauces include prepared cold condiments like ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, various hot (spicy) sauces, and a variety of salad dressings, often used for dishes other than salad. Barbecue sauce is used both as a condiment and as an ingredient in some varieties of barbecue. \nHot sauces include gravy, and tomato sauce, often served with pasta. White (b\u00e9chamel) sauce is widely used as an ingredient.\nDessert sauces include fudge sauce, butterscotch sauce, hard sauce (which is not liquid), and many others.\nBritish.\nIn traditional British cuisine, gravy is a sauce used on roast dinner. The sole survivor of the medieval bread-thickened sauces, bread sauce is one of the oldest sauces in British cooking. Apple sauce, mint sauce and horseradish sauce are used on meat (usually on pork, lamb and beef respectively). Redcurrant jelly, mint jelly, and white sauce may also be used. Salad cream is sometimes used on salads. Tomato ketchup and brown sauce are used on fast-food-type dishes. Mushroom ketchup and strong English mustard are also used on various foods, as is Worcestershire sauce. Custard is a popular dessert sauce. Other popular sauces include Marie Rose sauce (as used in a prawn cocktail), whisky sauce (for serving with haggis), Albert sauce (horseradish sauce to enhance flavour of braised beef) and cheddar sauce (as used in cauliflower or macaroni and cheese). In contemporary British cuisine, owing to the wide diversity of British society today, there are also many sauces that are of British origin but based upon the cuisine of other countries, particularly former colonies such as India.\nChinese.\nThere are many varied cuisines in China, but many of them compose dishes from sauces including different kinds of soy sauce, fermented bean paste including doubanjiang, chili sauces, oyster sauce, and also many oils and vinegar preparations. These ingredients are used to build up a range of different sauces and condiments used before, during, or after cooking the main ingredients for a dish:\nIn some Chinese cuisines, such as Cantonese, dishes are often thickened with a slurry of cornstarch or potato starch and water.\nFilipino.\nFilipino cuisine typically uses \"toyomansi\" (soy sauce with kalamansi lime) as well as different varieties of suka, patis, bagoong and banana ketchup, among others.\nFrench.\nSauces in French cuisine date back to the Middle Ages. There were many hundreds of sauces in the culinary repertoire. In \"cuisine classique\" (roughly from the end of the 19th century until the advent of \"nouvelle cuisine\" in the 1980s), sauces were a major defining characteristic of French cuisine.\nIn the early 19th century, the chef Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame created an extensive list of sauces, many of which were original recipes. It is unknown how many sauces Car\u00eame is responsible for, but it is estimated to be in the hundreds. Many are included in his \"Art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au XIXe si\u00e8cle\".\nCar\u00eame considered the four \"grandes sauces\" to be espagnole, velout\u00e9, allemande, and b\u00e9chamel, from which a large variety of petites sauces could be composed.\nIn the early 20th century, the chef Auguste Escoffier refined Car\u00eame's list of basic sauces in his classic \"Guide culinaire\". Its 4th and last edition listed the foundation or basic sauces as espagnole, velout\u00e9, b\u00e9chamel, and tomate. Sauce allemande, which is a variant of velout\u00e9 made with egg yolks, is replaced by sauce tomate. Another basic sauce mentioned in the \"Guide culinaire\" is sauce mayonnaise, which Escoffier wrote was a mother sauce akin to the espagnole and velout\u00e9 due to its many derivative sauces.48\nIn \"A Guide to Modern Cookery\", an English abridged translation of Escoffier's 1903 edition of \"Le guide culinaire\", hollandaise was included in the list of basic sauces, which made for a list that is identical to the list of five fundamental \"French mother sauces\" that is acknowledged by a variety of sources:\nA sauce which is derived from one of the mother sauces by augmenting with additional ingredients is sometimes called a \"daughter sauce\" or \"secondary sauce\". Most sauces commonly used in classical cuisine are daughter sauces. For example, b\u00e9chamel can be made into Mornay by the addition of grated cheese, and espagnole becomes bordelaise with the addition of reduction of red wine, shallots, and poached beef marrow.\nA specialized implement, the French sauce spoon, was introduced in the mid-20th century to aid in eating sauce in French cuisine, is enjoying increasing popularity at high-end restaurants.\nIndian.\nIndian cuisines use sauces such as tomato-based sauces with varying spice combinations such as tamarind sauce, coconut milk-/paste-based sauces, and chutneys. There are substantial regional variations in Indian cuisine, but many sauces use a seasoned mix of onion, ginger and garlic paste as the base of various gravies and sauces. Various cooking oils, ghee and/or cream are also regular ingredients in Indian sauces.\nIndonesian.\nIndonesian cuisine uses typical sauces such as \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce), \"bumbu kacang\" (peanut sauce) and tauco, while popular hot and spicy sauces are sambal, colo-colo, dabu-dabu and rica-rica. Sambal is an umbrella term; there are many, many kinds of sambal. \nItalian.\nItalian sauces reflect the rich variety of the Italian cuisine and can be divided in several categories including:\nSavory.\nFor meats, fish and vegetables.\nExamples are:\nFor pasta.\nThere are thousands of such sauces, and many towns have traditional sauces. Among the internationally well-known are:\nJapanese.\nSauces used in traditional Japanese cuisine are usually based on \"sh\u014dyu\" (soy sauce), \"miso\" or \"dashi\". \"Ponzu\", citrus-flavoured soy sauce, and \"yakitori no tare\", sweetened rich soy sauce, are examples of sh\u014dyu-based sauces. Miso-based sauces include \"gomamiso\", miso with ground sesame, and \"amamiso\", sweetened miso. In modern Japanese cuisine, the word \"sauce\" often refers to Worcestershire sauce, introduced in the 19th century and modified to suit Japanese tastes. Tonkatsu, okonomiyaki, and yakisoba sauces are based on this sauce.\nKorean.\nKorean cuisine uses sauces such as doenjang, gochujang, samjang, aekjeot, and soy sauce.\nLatin and Spanish American.\nSalsas (\"sauces\" in Spanish) such as pico de gallo (tomato, onion and chili chopped with lemon juice), salsa cocida, salsa verde, chile, and salsa roja are an important part of many Latin and Spanish-American cuisines in the Americas. Typical ingredients include chili, tomato, onion, and spices; thicker sauces often contain avocado.\nMexican cuisine includes sauces which may contain chocolate, seeds, and chiles collectively known by the Nahua name mole (compare guacamole).\nIn Argentinian and Uruguayan cuisine, chimichurri is an uncooked sauce used in cooking and as a table condiment for grilled meat.\nPeruvian cuisine uses sauces based mostly in different varieties of \"aj\u00ed\" combined with several ingredients, most notably salsa huanca\u00edna based on fresh cheese and salsa de ocopa based on peanuts or nuts.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61941", "revid": "50646457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61941", "title": "Stephenson's Rocket", "text": "Steam locomotive by Robert Stephenson in 1829\nStephenson's \"Rocket\" is an early steam locomotive of 0-2-2 wheel arrangement. It was built for and won the Rainhill Trials of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&amp;MR), held in October 1829 to show that improved locomotives would be more efficient than stationary steam engines.\n\"Rocket\" was designed and built by Robert Stephenson in 1829, and built at the Forth Street Works of his company in Newcastle upon Tyne.\nThough \"Rocket\" was not the first steam locomotive, it was the first to bring together several innovations that produced the most advanced locomotive of its day. It is the most famous example of an evolving design of locomotives by Stephenson, and became the template for most steam engines in the following 150 years.\nThe locomotive was displayed in the Science Museum in London until 2018, after which it was briefly exhibited at sites around the UK, ultimately at National Railway Museum in York. Since 2023, it has been based at the Locomotion Museum in Shildon in County Durham.\nHistory.\nPrior developments.\n\"Rocket\" was built at a time of rapid development of steam engine technology. It was based on experience gained from earlier designs by George and Robert Stephenson, including the Killingworth locomotive \"Bl\u00fccher\" (1814) \"Locomotion\" (1825), and \"Lancashire Witch\" (1828).\nConception.\nThere have been differences in opinion on who should be given the credit for designing \"Rocket\". George Stephenson had designed several locomotives before but none as advanced as \"Rocket\". At the time that \"Rocket\" was being designed and built at the Forth Banks Works, he was living in Liverpool overseeing the building of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. His son Robert had recently returned from a stint working in South America and resumed as managing director of Robert Stephenson and Company. He was in daily charge of designing and constructing the new locomotive. Although he was in frequent contact with his father in Liverpool and probably received advice from him, it is difficult not to give the majority of the credit for the design to Robert. A third person who may deserve a significant amount of credit is Henry Booth, the treasurer of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. He is believed to have suggested to Robert Stephenson that a multi-tube boiler should be used.\nStephenson designed \"Rocket\" for the Rainhill trials, and the specific rules of that contest. As the first railway intended for passengers more than freight, the rules emphasised speed and would require reliability, but the weight of the locomotive was also tightly restricted. Six-wheeled locomotives were limited to six tons, four-wheeled locomotives to four and a half tons. In particular, the weight of the train expected to be hauled was to be no more than three times the actual weight of the locomotive. Stephenson realised that whatever the size of previously successful locomotives, this new contest would favour a fast, light locomotive of only moderate hauling power.\nRainhill trials.\nOn 20 April 1829, the board of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway project passed a resolution for a competition to be held to prove their railway could be reliably operated by steam locomotives, there being advice from eminent engineers of the age that stationary engines would be required. A prize of \u00a3500 was offered as an incentive to the winner, with strict conditions a locomotive would need to meet to enter the trial. Robert Stephenson was able to report to Henry Booth on 5 September 1829 that \"Rocket\" had performed initial manufacturer tests with flying colours at Killingworth. \"Rocket\" was dismantled at Newcastle and began the long trip to Rainhill: by horse wagon to Carlisle; lighter to Port Carlisle then by the \"Cumberland\" steamer to Liverpool for re-assembly on 18 September 1829. \"Rocket\" passed the trial requirement of achieving an average speed of over by over 40 percent. Demonstrations also saw \"Rocket\" consistently and easily haul a carriage with over 20 persons up the Whiston Incline at over , and light engine running of around . No other locomotive at the trials could match anything like \"Rocket\"'s performance reliably, with partners Booth and Stephensons sharing the \u00a3500 winnings and showing that stationary engines were unnecessary, with sceptics such as Rastrick being convinced.\nOperation.\nThe opening ceremony of the L&amp;MR on 15 September 1830 was a considerable event, drawing luminaries from the government and industry, including the Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington. The day started with a procession of eight trains setting out from Liverpool for Manchester. The parade was led by \"Northumbrian\" driven by George Stephenson, and included \"Phoenix\" driven by his son Robert, \"North Star\" driven by his brother Robert Sr. and \"Rocket\" driven by assistant engineer Joseph Locke. The day was marred by the death of William Huskisson, the Member of Parliament for Liverpool, who was struck and killed by \"Rocket\" at Parkside.\nBuilt as a prototype to win a speed trial, the engine was soon superseded by improved designs, such as Stephenson's \"Northumbrian\" and \"Planet\" designs, both of 1830. Within a few years, the \"Rocket\" itself had been much modified to be similar to the \"Northumbrian\" class. The cylinders were altered to a near-horizontal position, compared to the angled arrangement as new; the firebox capacity was enlarged and the shape simplified; and the locomotive was given a drum smokebox. It was in this form that the engine was preserved, which were seen as so different from the original that \"The Engineer\" magazine, circa 1884, concluded that \"it seems to us indisputable that the \"Rocket\" of 1829 and 1830 were totally different engines\".\nHistory between 1830 and 1840 is only vaguely documented. From 1830 to 1834, \"Rocket\" served on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. After service on the L&amp;MR, \"Rocket\" was used between 1836 and 1840 on Lord Carlisle's Railway near Brampton, in Cumberland (now Cumbria), England. \nIn 1834, the engine was selected for further (unsuccessful) modifications to test a newly developed rotary steam engine designed by Admiral Thomas Cochrane, The 10th Earl of Dundonald. At a cost of nearly \u00a380, \"Rocket\"'s cylinders and driving rods were removed and two of the engines were installed directly on its driving axle with a feedwater pump in between. On 22 October, of that year, an operational trial was held with disappointing results; one witness observing, that \"the engine could not be made to draw a train of empty carriages\". Due to inherent flaws and engineering difficulties associated with their design, Lord Dundonald's engines were simply too underpowered for the task.\nIn April 1837, \"Rocket\" was sold for \u00a3300 and began service on the Brampton Railway, a mineral railway in Cumberland that had recently converted to Stephenson gauge. In August that year it was used to bring back the results of an election from Midgeholme to Kirkhouse \"Rocket\" was used on mineral trains, but was too light and was laid aside in 1840. Whilst it was stored several parts were removed, including the copper plate around the firebox and the rear wheels.\nRobert Stephenson wanted to take \"Rocket\" to the Great Exhibition in 1851, however James Thompson died before this could be realised. \"Rocket\" was taken to the Stephensons' yard in Newcastle until 1862 and its subsequent donation to the Patent Office Museum, London.\nPreservation.\nIn 1862, \"Rocket\" was donated to the Patent Office Museum in London (now the Science Museum) by the Thompsons of Milton Hall, near Brampton.\nThe locomotive still exists, though it has not been operated since becoming a museum exhibit. It was displayed at the Science Museum for 150 years, although in a much modified form from its state at the Rainhill Trials. In 2018, it was displayed in Newcastle and then in Manchester at the Science and Industry Museum. From 2019, it was displayed at the National Railway Museum, York, and has been exhibited at the Locomotion Museum in Shildon, County Durham, since 2023.\nDesign.\nThe locomotive had a smokestack chimney at the front, a cylindrical boiler in the middle, and a separate firebox at the rear.\nThe large front pair of wooden wheels was driven by two external cylinders set at an angle of 38\u00b0. The smaller rear wheels were not coupled to the driving wheels, giving an 0-2-2 wheel arrangement. One of the cylinders drove a small diameter feedwater pump which pumped water from the tender to the boiler, a valve could be adjusted to control the amount of water needed.\nDriving wheels.\nStephenson's most visible decision was to use a single pair of driving wheels, with a small carrying axle behind. This was the first 0-2-2 and first single driver locomotive. The use of single drivers gave several advantages. The weight of coupling rods was avoided and the second axle could be smaller and lightweight, as it only carried a small portion of the weight. \"Rocket\" placed just over &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442\u00a0tons of its &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4+1\u20442\u00a0ton total weight onto its driving wheels, a higher axle load than \"Sans Pareil\", even though the 0-4-0 was heavier overall at 5\u00a0ton, and officially disqualified by being over the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4+1\u20442\u00a0ton limit. Early locomotive designers had been concerned that the adhesion of a locomotive's driving wheels would be inadequate, but Stephenson's past experience convinced him that this would not be a problem, particularly with the light trains of the trials contest.\nBoiler.\n\"Rocket\" uses a multi-tubular boiler design. Previous locomotive boilers consisted of a single pipe surrounded by water (though the \"Lancashire Witch\" did have twin flues). \"Rocket\" had 25 copper fire-tubes that carried the hot exhaust gas from the firebox, through the wet boiler to the blast pipe and chimney. This arrangement resulted in a greatly increased surface contact area of hot pipe with boiler water when compared to a single large flue. Additionally, radiant heating from the enlarged separate firebox helped deliver a further increase in steaming and hence boiler efficiency.\nThe original innovator of multiple fire-tubes is unclear, between Stephenson and Marc Seguin. It is known that Seguin visited Stephenson to observe \"Locomotion\" and that he also built two multi-tubular locomotives of his own design for the Saint-\u00c9tienne\u2013Lyon railway before \"Rocket\". \"Rocket\"'s boiler was of the more highly developed form, with the separate firebox and a blastpipe for draught, rather than Seguin's cumbersome fans, but \"Rocket\" was not the first multi-tubular boiler, although it remains unclear just whose invention it was.\nThe benefits of increasing the fire-tube area had also been attempted with Ericsson and Braithwaite's \"Novelty\" at Rainhill. Their design though used a single fire-tube, folded in three. This offered an increased surface area, but only at the cost of a proportionately increased length and so poor draught on the fire. Its arrangement also made tube cleaning impractical.\nThe advantages of the multiple-tube boiler were quickly recognised, even for heavy, slow freight locomotives. By 1830, Stephenson's past employee Timothy Hackworth had re-designed his return-flued \"Royal George\" as the return-tubed \"Wilberforce\" class.\nBlastpipe.\n\"Rocket\" also used a blastpipe, feeding the exhaust steam from the cylinders into the base of the chimney so as to induce a partial vacuum and pull air through the fire. Credit for the invention of the blastpipe is disputed, though Stephenson used it as early as 1814. The blastpipe worked well on the multi-tube boiler of \"Rocket\" but on earlier designs with a single flue through the boiler it had created so much suction that it tended to rip the top off the fire and throw burning cinders out of the chimney, vastly increasing the fuel consumption.\nCylinders and pistons.\nLike the \"Lancashire Witch\", \"Rocket\" had two cylinders set at angle from the horizontal, with the pistons driving a pair of diameter wheels. Most previous designs had the cylinders positioned vertically, which gave the engines an uneven swaying motion as they progressed along the track. Subsequently, \"Rocket\" was modified so that the cylinders were set close to horizontal, a layout that influenced nearly all designs that followed.\nAgain like the \"Lancashire Witch\", the pistons were connected directly to the driving wheels, an arrangement which is found in subsequent steam locomotives.\nFirebox.\nThe firebox was separate from the boiler and was double walled, with a water jacket between them. Stephenson recognised that the hottest part of the boiler, and thus the most effective for evaporating water, was that surrounding the fire itself. This firebox was heated by radiant heat from the glowing coke, not just convection from the hot exhaust gas.\nLocomotives of \"Rocket\"'s era were fired by coke rather than coal. Local landowners were already familiar with the dark clouds of smoke from coal-fired stationary engines and had imposed regulations on most new railways that locomotives would 'consume their own smoke'. The smoke from a burning coke fire was much cleaner than that from coal. It was not until 30 years later and the development of the long firebox and brick arch that locomotives would be effectively able to burn coal directly.\n\"Rocket\"'s first firebox was of copper sheet and of a somewhat rectangular shape from the side. The throatplate was of firebrick, possibly the backhead too. When rebuilt around 1831, this was replaced by a wrought iron backhead and throatplate, with a drum wrapper (now missing), presumed to be of copper, between them. This gave a larger internal volume and encouraged better combustion within the firebox, rather than inside the tubes. These early fireboxes formed a separate water space from the boiler drum and were connected by prominent external copper pipes.\nOther \"Rocket\"-type locomotives.\n\"Rocket\" was followed by a number of other engines of similar 0-2-2 layout with rear-mounted cylinders built for the L&amp;MR before it opened on 15 September 1830, culminating in the \"Northumbrian\" (1830), by which time the cylinders were horizontal. Other engines of the \"Rocket\" design which were delivered to the Liverpool and Manchester railway included \"Arrow\", \"Comet\", \"Dart\" and \"Meteor\", all being delivered to the railway during 1830.\nSubsequent designs.\nAt around the same time, Stephenson experimented with front-mounted cylinders. The unsuccessful 0-4-0 \"Invicta\", built in 1829 immediately after \"Rocket\", still had them at an angle. The successful 2-2-0 locomotive \"Planet\" (1830) had internal front-mounted cylinders set to the horizontal.\nEngines built to the \"Planet\" design and the subsequent 2-2-2 \"Patentee\" design of 1833 made the design of \"Rocket\" obsolete.\nReplicas.\nIn 1923, Buster Keaton had a functioning replica built for the film \"Our Hospitality\". Two years later, the replica was used again in the Al St. John film, \"The Iron Mule\", directed by Keaton's mentor, Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle. The subsequent whereabouts of the replica are unknown. There are, however, at least two other replicas of \"Rocket\" in the US, both built by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns in 1929; one is at the Henry Ford Museum in the Metro Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Michigan, the other at the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago.\nThe earliest full-size replica of \"Rocket\" seems to have been one depicted on a London and North Western Railway postcard (therefore pre-1923).\nA cut-away static replica was built in 1935 and displayed for many years next to the original at London's Science Museum.\nIn 1979, a further, working replica \"Rocket\" was built by Locomotion Enterprises in the Springwell workshops at the Bowes Railway for the 150th anniversary celebrations. It first worked in public on a short length of track in front of the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens from 25 August to 2 September 1979, before going to Newcastle on 9 September, York on 16 October and running the measured mile, between Lea Green and Rainhill, on the last two days at the Rocket 150 celebrations from 24 to 26 May 1980. It has a shorter chimney than the original to clear the bridge at Rainhill: successive additions of ballast and heavier rail have raised the track, leaving less headroom than in the 19th century. As of 2022, both of these replicas were based at the National Railway Museum, York, with the original \"Rocket\".\nModels.\nIn 1963, Tri-ang Railways released a 00 Gauge model of \"Rocket\" containing three coaches and crew members. It was produced until 1969 by Tri-ang Hornby.\nIt was re-introduced to the Hornby range in 1982 until 1983 in Hornby Railways packaging. However this 1982 re-introduced model was un-catalogued, and it was only available through exclusive retailers and from Hornby directly.\nIn 1980, as part of the Rocket 150 anniversary, Hornby launched a gauge live steam \"Rocket\" locomotive, with additional track and coaches available separately.\nIn 2020, Hornby announced a newly tooled 00 Gauge model of Stephenson's \"Rocket\" with three coaches and crew members as part of their Centenary range. It was available as a standard model and a limited edition with commemorative certificate of authentication in retro 1963 Hornby Centenary Tri-ang Railways packaging.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61943", "revid": "43611961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61943", "title": "Lake Malawi", "text": "Lake in Africa\nLake Malawi, also known as Lake Nyasa in Tanzania and Lago Niassa in Mozambique, () is an African Great Lake and the southernmost lake in the East African Rift system, located between Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania.\nIt is the fourth largest freshwater lake in the world by volume, the ninth largest lake in the world by area and the third largest and second deepest lake in Africa. Lake Malawi is home to more species of fish than any other lake in the world, including at least 700 species of cichlids. The Mozambique portion of the lake was officially declared a reserve by the Government of Mozambique on June 10, 2011, while in Malawi a portion of the lake is included in Lake Malawi National Park.\nLake Malawi is a meromictic lake, meaning that its water layers do not mix. The permanent stratification of Lake Malawi's water and the oxic-anoxic boundary are maintained by moderately small chemical and thermal gradients.\nGeography.\nLake Malawi is between and long, and about wide at its widest point. The lake has a total surface area of about . The lake is at its deepest point, located in a major depression in the north-central part. Another smaller depression in the far north reaches a depth of . The southern half of the lake is shallower; less than in the south-central part and less than in the far south.\nThe lake has shorelines on western Mozambique, eastern Malawi, and southern Tanzania. The largest river flowing into it is the Ruhuhu River, and there is an outlet at its southern end, the Shire River, a tributary that flows into the Zambezi River in Mozambique. Evaporation accounts for more than 80% of the water loss from the lake, considerably more than the outflowing Shire River. The outflows from Lake Malawi into the Shire River are vital for the economy as the water resources support hydropower, irrigation and downstream biodiversity.\nConcerns have been raised over the future climate change impacts of Lake Malawi due to the recent decline in lake levels and the overall drying trend. The climate in the lake region is already experiencing changes, with the temperatures predicted to increase throughout the country.\nThe lake is about southeast of Lake Tanganyika, another of the great lakes of the East African Rift.\nThe Lake Malawi National Park is located at the southern end of the lake.\nGeological history.\nMalawi is one of the major Rift Valley lakes and an ancient lake. The lake lies in a valley formed by the opening of the East African Rift, where the African tectonic plate is being split into two pieces. This is called a divergent plate tectonics boundary. Malawi has typically been estimated to be 1\u20132 million years old (mya), but more recent evidence points to a considerably older lake with a basin that started to form about 8.6 mya and deep-water condition first appeared 4.5 mya.\nThe water levels have varied dramatically over time, ranging from almost below current level to above. During periods the lake dried out almost completely, leaving only one or two relatively small, highly alkaline and saline lakes in what currently are Malawi's deepest parts. A water chemistry resembling the current conditions only appeared about 60,000 years ago. Major low-water periods are estimated to have occurred about 1.6 to 1.0\u20130.57 million years ago (where it might have dried out completely), 420,000 to 250,000\u2013110,000 years ago, about 25,000 years ago and 18,000\u201310,700 years ago. During the peak of the low-water period between 1390 and 1860 AD, it may have been below current water levels.\nWater characteristics.\nThe lake's water is alkaline (pH 7.7\u20138.6) and warm with a typical surface temperature between , while deep sections typically are about . The thermocline is located at a depth of . The oxygen limit is at a depth of approximately , effectively restricting fish and other aerobic organisms to the upper part. The water is very clear for a lake and the visibility can be up to , but slightly less than half this figure is more common and it is below in muddy bays. However, during the rainy season months of January to March, the waters are more muddy due to muddy river inflows.\nEuropean colonisation.\nThe Portuguese trader Candido Jos\u00e9 da Costa Cardoso was the first European to visit the lake in 1846. David Livingstone reached the lake in 1859, and named it Lake Nyasa. He also referred to it by a pair of nicknames: Lake of Stars and Lake of Storms. The Lake of Stars nickname came after Livingstone observed lights from the lanterns of the fishermen in Malawi on their boats, that resemble, from a distance, stars in the sky. Later, after experiencing the unpredictable and extremely violent gales that sweep through the area, he also referred to it as the Lake of Storms.\nOn 16 August 1914, Lake Malawi was the scene of a brief naval battle during World War I. The British gunboat , commanded by a Captain Rhoades, received orders from the British Empire's high command to \"sink, burn, or destroy\" the German Empire's only gunboat on the lake, the , commanded by Captain Berndt. Rhoades's crew found the \"Hermann von Wissmann\" in a bay near Sphinxhaven, in German East African territorial waters. \"Gwendolen\" disabled the German boat with a single cannon shot from a range of about . This brief conflict was hailed by \"The Times\" in England as the British Empire's first naval victory of World War I.\nBorders.\nTanzania\u2013Malawi dispute.\nThe partition of the lake's surface area between Malawi and Tanzania is under dispute. Tanzania claims that the international border runs through the middle of the lake. On the other hand, Malawi claims the whole of the surface of this lake that is not in Mozambique, including the waters that are next to the shoreline of Tanzania. Malawi currently administers these waters. Both sides cite the Heligoland Treaty of 1890 between the United Kingdom and Germany concerning the border. The wrangle in this dispute occurred when the British colonial government, just after they had captured Tanganyika from Germany, placed all of the waters of the lake under a single jurisdiction, that of the territory of Nyasaland, without a separate administration for the Tanganyikan portion of the surface. Later in colonial times, two jurisdictions were established.\nThe dispute came to a head in 1967 when Tanzania officially protested to Malawi; however nothing was settled. Occasional flare-ups of conflict occurred during the 1990s and in the 21st century. In 2012, Malawi's oil exploration initiative brought the issue to the fore, with Tanzania demanding that exploration cease until the dispute was settled.\nMalawi\u2013Mozambique border.\nIn 1954, an agreement was signed between the British and the Portuguese making the middle of the lake their boundary with the exception of Chizumulu Island and Likoma Island, which were kept by the British and are now part of Malawi.\nTransport.\n began service on the lake in 1901 as the SS \"Chauncy Maples\": a floating clinic and church for the Universities' Mission to Central Africa. She later served as a ferry and is currently being renovated into a mobile clinic at Monkey Bay. The renovation was expected to be complete during the first half of 2014, but was halted in 2017. entered service in 1935. The ferry entered service in 1951. In recent years she has often been out of service, but when operational she runs between Monkey Bay at the southern end of the lake to Karonga on the northern end, and occasionally to the Iringa Region of Tanzania. The ferry entered service in 1980. By 1982 she was carrying 100,000 passengers each year., but as of 2014 she was out of service. She normally serves the southern part of the lake but if \"Ilala\" was out of service she operated the route to Karonga. The Tanzanian ferry was built in 1988. Her operator was the Tanzania Railway Corporation Marine Division until 1997, when it became the Marine Services Company Limited. \"Songea\" plies weekly between Liuli and Nkhata Bay via Itungi and Mbamba Bay. The worst Lake disaster was the sinking of the in 1946, which resulted in 145 deaths.\nWildlife.\nWildlife found in and around Lake Malawi or Nyasa includes Nile crocodiles, hippopotamus, monkeys, and a significant population of African fish eagles that feed off fish from the lake.\nFish.\nFishing.\nLake Malawi has for millennia provided a major food source to the residents of its shores since its waters are rich in fish. Among the most popular are the four species of chambo, consisting of any one of four species in the subgenus \"Nyasalapia\" (\"Oreochromis karongae\", \"O. lidole\", \"O. saka\" and \"O. squamipinnis\"), as well as the closely related \"O. shiranus\". Other species that support important fisheries include the Lake Malawi sardine (\"Engraulicypris sardella\") and the large kampango catfish (\"Bagrus meridionalis\"). Most fishing provides food for the increasing human population near the lake, but some are exported from Malawi. The wild population of fish is increasingly threatened by overfishing and water pollution. A drop in the lake's water level represents another threat, and is believed to be driven by water extraction by the increasing human population, climate change and deforestation. The chambo and kampango have been particularly overfished (the kampango declined by about 90% from 2006 to 2016, \"O. karongae\" and \"O. squamipinnis\" by about 94%, and \"O. lidole\" might already be extinct) and they are now seriously threatened. The IUCN recognises 117 species of Malawi cichlids as threatened; some of these have tiny ranges and may be restricted to rocky coastlines only a few hundred metres long.\nCichlids.\nLake Malawi is noted for being the site of evolutionary radiations among several groups of animals, most notably cichlid fish. There are at least 700 cichlid species in Lake Malawi, with some estimating that the actual figure is as high as 1,000 species. The actual number is labelled with some uncertainty because of the many undescribed species and the extreme variation among some species, making the task of delimiting them very complex. Except for four species (\"Astatotilapia calliptera\", \"Coptodon rendalli\", \"Oreochromis shiranus\" and \"Serranochromis robustus\"), all cichlids in the lake are endemic to the Malawi system, which also includes nearby smaller Lake Malombe and the upper Shire River. Many of these have become popular among aquarium owners due to their bright colors. Recreating a Lake Malawi biotope to host cichlids became quite popular in the aquarium hobby. Most Malawi cichlids are found in relatively shallow coastal waters, but \"Diplotaxodon\" has been recorded down to depths of and several (especially \"Diplotaxodon\", \"Rhamphochromis\" and \"Copadichromis quadrimaculatus\") are known from pelagic waters.\nThe cichlids of the lake are divided into two groups and the vast majority of the species are haplochromines. The sister species to the Malawi haplochromines is \"Astatotilapia\" sp. Ruaha (a currently undescribed species from Great Ruaha River), and these two separated between 2.13 and 6.76 million years ago (mya). The earliest divergence within the Malawi haplochromines occurred between 1.20 and 4.06 mya, but most radiations in this group are far younger; in extreme cases species may have diverged only a few hundred years ago. The Malawi haplochromines are mouthbrooders, but otherwise vary extensively in general behaviour and ecology. Within the Malawi haplochromines there are two main groups, the haps and the mbuna. The haps (they were formerly included in \"Haplochromis\") can be further subdivided into three subgroups: The relatively large, often more than long, and aggressive piscivores that roam various habitats in pursuit of prey, the open-water (although often not far from sand or rocks) utaka that feed in schools on zooplankton and typically are of medium size, and finally a subgroup of \"aberrant\" species that essentially are defined by them not fitting clearly into the other subgroups. Adult male haps generally display bright colors, while juveniles of both sexes and adult females typically show a silvery or grey coloration with sometimes irregular black bars or other markings. The second main haplochromine group are the mbuna, a name used both locally and popularly, which means \"rockfish\" in Tonga. They are found at rocky outcrops, territorially aggressive (although commonly found in high densities) and often specialised aufwuchs feeders. The mbuna species tend to be relatively small, mostly less than long, and often both sexes are brightly colored with males having egg-shaped yellow spots on their anal fin (a feature particularly prevalent in the mbuna, but not exclusive to this group).\nThe second group, the tilapia, comprises only six species in two genera in Lake Malawi: The redbreast tilapia (\"Coptodon rendalli\"), a widespread African species, is the only substrate-spawning cichlid in the lake. This large cichlid mainly feeds on macrophytes. The remaining are five mouthbrooding species of \"Oreochromis\"; four chambo in the subgenus \"Nyasalapia\" (\"O. karongae\", \"O. lidole\", \"O. saka\" and \"O. squamipinnis\") that are endemic to the Lake Malawi system, as well as the closely related \"O. shiranus\", which also is found in Lake Chilwa. The Malawi \"Oreochromis\" mainly feed on phytoplankton, reach lengths up to depending on the exact species, and are mostly black or silvery-gray with relatively indistinct dark bars. Male chambo have unique genital tassels when breeding, which aid in egg fertilisation in a manner comparable to the egg-spots on the anal fin of haplochromines.\nNon-cichlids.\nThe vast majority of the fish species in the lake are cichlids. Among the non-cichlid native fish are several species of cyprinids (in genera \"Barbus\", \"Labeo\" and \"Opsaridium\", and the Lake Malawi sardine \"Engraulicypris sardella\"), airbreathing catfish (\"Bathyclarias\" and \"Clarias\", and the kampango \"Bagrus meridionalis\"), mochokid catfish (\"Chiloglanis\" and Malawi squeaker \"Synodontis njassae\"), \"Mastacembelus\" spiny eel, mormyrids (\"Marcusenius\", \"Mormyrops\" and \"Petrocephalus\"), the African tetra \"Brycinus imberi\", the poeciliid \"Aplocheilichthys johnstoni\", the spotted killifish (\"Nothobranchius orthonotus\"), and the mottled eel (\"Anguilla nebulosa\").\nAt a genus level, most of these are widespread in Africa, but \"Bathyclarias\" is entirely restricted to the lake.\nInvertebrates.\nMolluscs.\nLake Malawi is home to 28 species of freshwater snails (including 16 endemics) and 9 bivalves (2 endemics, \"Aspatharia subreniformis\" and the unionid \"Nyassunio nyassaensis\"). The endemic freshwater snails are all members of the genera \"Bellamya\", \"Bulinus\", \"Gabbiella\", \"Lanistes\" and \"Melanoides\".\nLake Malawi is home to a total of four snail species in the genus \"Bulinus\", which is a known intermediate host of bilharzia. A survey in Monkey Bay in 1964 found two endemic species of snails of the genus (\"B. nyassanus\" and \"B. succinoides\") in the lake, and two non-endemic species (\"B. globosus\" and \"B. forskalli\") in lagoons separated from it. The latter species are known intermediate hosts of bilharzia, and larvae of the parasite were detected in water containing these, but in experiments C. Wright of the British Museum of Natural History was unable to infect the two species endemic to the lake with the parasites. The field workers, who spent many hours on and in the lake, did not find either \"B. globosus\" or \"B. forskalli\" in the lake itself. More recently, the disease has become a problem in the lake itself as the endemic \"B. nyassanus\" has become an intermediate host. This change, first noticed in the mid-1980s, is possibly related to a decline in snail-eating cichlids (for example, \"Trematocranus placodon\") due to overfishing and/or a new strain of the bilharzia parasite.\nCrustaceans.\nUnlike Lake Tanganyika with its many endemic freshwater crabs and shrimp, there are few such species in Lake Malawi. The Malawi blue crab, \"Potamonautes lirrangensis\" (syn. \"P. orbitospinus\"), is the only crab in the lake and it is not endemic. The atyid shrimp \"Caridina malawensis\" is endemic to the lake, but it is poorly known and has historically been confused with \"C. nilotica\", which is not found in the lake. Pelagic zooplanktonic species include two cladocerans (\"Diaphanosoma excisum\" and \"Bosmina longirostris\"), three copepods (\"Tropodiaptomus cunningtoni\", \"Thermocyclops neglectus\" and \"Mesocyclops aequatorialis\"), and several ostracods (including both described and undescribed species).\nLake flies.\nLake Malawi is famous for the huge swarms of tiny, harmless lake flies, \"Chaoborus edulis\". These swarms, typically appearing far out over water, can be mistaken for plumes of smoke and were also noticed by David Livingstone when he visited the lake. The aquatic larvae feed on zooplankton, spending the day at the bottom and the night in the upper water levels. When they pupate they float to the surface and transform into adult flies. The adults are very short-lived and the swarms, which can be several hundred metres tall and often have a spiraling shape, are part of their mating behaviour. They lay their eggs at the water's surface and the adults die. The larvae are an important food source for fish, and the adult flies are important both to birds and local people, who collect them to make \"kungu\" cakes/burgers, a local delicacy with a very high protein content.\n2015 mine leak.\nIn January 2015, a sediment control tank collapsed at the Paladin Energy-owned uranium mine in Northern Malawi after a high intensity rain storm hit the area. It was revealed that approximately 50 litres of non radioactive material leaked into a local creek. Despite reports in local media of radioactive contamination the government conducted independent scientific tests on the local river system and found that there was no effect on the environment.\nSwimming.\nThe 25\u00a0km solo swim across Lake Malawi between Cape Ngomba and Senga Bay has been accomplished on 5 occasions by 16 swimmers\n1992: Lewis Pugh 9hrs 52 minutes (UK/South Africa) and Otto Thanning (South Africa) 10hrs 5 minutes\n2010: Abigail Brown (UK) 9hrs 45 minutes\n2013: Milko van Gool (Netherlands) 8hrs 46 minutes and Kaitlin Harthoorn (US) 9hrs 17 minutes\n2016: (current record) Jean Craven (South Africa), Robert Dunford (Kenya), Michiel Le Roux (South Africa), Samantha Whelpton (South Africa), Greig Bannatyne (South Africa), Haydn Von Maltitz (South Africa), Douglas Livingstone-Blevins (South Africa) 7hrs 53 mins \n2019: Chris Stapley (Eswatini) and Jay Azran (South Africa) 8hrs 40 minutes, Andrew Stevens (Australia) 10hrs 50 minutes, and Ruth Azran (South Africa) 11hrs 8 minutes. That same year, Martin Hobbs (South Africa), became the first person to swim the full length of Lake Malawi (54 days), as well as setting the world record for longest solo swim in a lake\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In common restaurant service a single serving has a raw mass ranging from . Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled. The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole. Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized (as with, for example, cube steak).\nRegional variations.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, beef steak is referred to as just \"steak\" and can be purchased uncooked in supermarkets, butchers, and some smallgood shops. It is sold cooked as a meal in almost every pub, bistro, or restaurant specialising in modern Australian food, and is ranked based on the quality and the cut. Most venues usually have three to seven different cuts of steak on their menu and serve it from blue to well-done according to preference. A steak is normally accompanied by a choice of sauces and a choice of either french fries (known as steak frites from French influence; see below) or mashed potato. A complementary choice of side salad or steamed vegetables is also commonly offered.\nFrance.\nIn France, steak, locally called , is usually served with fried potatoes ( in French). The combination is known as steak frites. Vegetables are not normally served with steak in this manner, but a green salad may follow or (more commonly) be served at the same time. Steaks are often served with classic French sauces.\nIndonesia.\nIn Indonesia, bistik jawa is a beefsteak dish that is influenced by Dutch cuisine. Another Indonesian beefsteak is selat solo with Dutch-influence, a specialty of Surakarta, Central Java.\nItaly.\nIn Italy, steak was not widely eaten until after World War\u00a0II because the relatively rugged countryside does not readily accommodate the space and resource demands of large herds of cattle. Some areas of Piedmont, Lombardy, and Tuscany, however, were renowned for the quality of their beef. is a well-known specialty of Florence; it is typically served with just a salad. From the 1960s onward, economic gains allowed more Italians to afford a red-meat diet.\nMexico.\nIn Mexico, as well as in Spain and other former Spanish colonies, (a Spanish loanword from English \"beefsteak\") refers to dishes of salted and peppered beef sirloin strips. One form of Mexican is usually flattened with a meat tenderizing tool. The dish is often served in tortillas as a taco.\nSpain.\nSpain and its former colonies have variations of (beefsteak with onions). It can be found across Latin America.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, in steak restaurants the beef is aged for several weeks, seasoned with sea salt and pepper and seared on a grill. It is then served with chips or potatoes, vegetables and a wedge salad with dressings. Sauces are usually served on the side such as peppercorn, Diane, bordelaise, mushroom or a B\u00e9arnaise sauce. In more casual restaurants and pubs steak is often served with medium-thick fried potatoes (chips), fried onions, mushrooms, onion rings and tomatoes.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, a restaurant that specializes in beef steaks is a steakhouse. The more expensive steakhouses serve the highest grades of beef and often dry-age it for many weeks. The well-aged beef cooked on high-heat grills and broilers produces a steak difficult to emulate in a home kitchen. A typical steak dinner consists of a steak, optionally topped with saut\u00e9ed onions or mushrooms, with a starchy side dish; usually baked or mashed potatoes, or thick-cut fried potatoes known as steak fries. Chili, rice, pasta, or beans are also common sides. A side salad or a small serving of cooked vegetables often accompanies the meat and side, with corn on the cob, green beans, creamed spinach, asparagus, tomatoes, mushrooms, peas, and onion rings being popular. Bread is generally served, usually a dinner roll.\nSteak is sometimes served with shrimp or lobster tail, giving \"surf and turf\" or \"reef and beef\".\nPrepared condiments known as steak sauces are generally on the table in steakhouses. Tenderized round or sirloin steaks, breaded, and pan-fried or deep-fried, are called \"chicken fried\" or \"country fried\" steaks, respectively. An iconic specialty of Philadelphia is the Philly cheesesteak, composed of thinly sliced ribeye or other tender cuts, cooked on a hot griddle and shredded slightly, and served on Italian-style rolls with one of a few types of cheese (American, mild Provolone or \"Cheez Whiz\" sauce).\nDegree of cooking.\nThe amount of time a steak is cooked is based upon personal preference; shorter cooking times retain more juice, whereas longer steak cooking times result in drier, tougher meat, but reduce concerns about disease. A vocabulary has evolved to describe the degree to which a steak is cooked. The following terms are in order from least cooked to most cooked:\nA style exists in some parts of North America called \"Chicago\". A Chicago-style steak is cooked to the desired level and then quickly charred. The diner orders it by asking for the style followed by the doneness (e.g. \"Chicago-style rare\"). A steak ordered \"Pittsburgh rare\" is rare or very rare on the inside and charred on the outside. In Pittsburgh, this style is referred to as \"black and blue\" (black or \"sooty\" on the outside, and blue rare on the inside).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Modern steakhouses may also carry other cuts of meat including poultry, roast prime rib, and veal, as well as fish and other seafood.\nHistory.\nChophouses started in London in the 1690s and served individual portions of meat, known as chops. The traditional nature of the food served was zealously maintained through the later 19th century despite the new cooking styles from the Continent, which were becoming fashionable. The houses were normally open only for men. Until closing in 2022, the oldest chophouse in London, Simpson's Tavern was regarded as an institution, and retained its 19th century decor. \nThe steakhouse started in the United States in the mid-19th century as a development from traditional inns and bars. Steakhouses can be casual or formal fine-dining restaurants.\nThe oldest continuously operating steakhouse in the United States is the Old Homestead Steakhouse in New York City, established in 1868. Prior to that, there were chophouses in New York City such as Cobweb Hall, owned by David Pattullo, which was known for its mutton chops and offered additional menu options such as beefsteaks, lamb kidneys, bacon, and potatoes.\nToday, steakhouses are found throughout the USA.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Salad bars are commonly found in restaurants, food markets, and cafeterias. Salad bars are a popular dining option in many countries around the world, but they are applied in different ways depending on the local culture and cuisine.\nHistory.\nThe origins of the salad bar are unclear, but it is thought that the idea may have been sparked by the Swedish that was featured at the 1938 World's Fair in New York. By the early 1940s, many U.S. newspapers' homemaking columnists had suggested the idea for family or guests (\"why not serve the ingredients separately and allow each member to assemble their own?\") and by 1956, at least one U.S. restaurant was advertising the concept (\"Have fun at our salad board. You select and make your own salad from large choice of ingredients.

{"id": "61949", "revid": "36895411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61949", "title": "The Oprah Winfrey Show", "text": "American television talk show\nThe Oprah Winfrey Show is an American daytime talk show that was hosted by Oprah Winfrey. The show ran in syndication for twenty-five seasons from September 8, 1986, to May 25, 2011, in which it broadcast 4,561 episodes. The show was taped in Chicago and produced by Winfrey. It remains the highest-rated daytime talk show in American television history.\nThe show was highly influential to many young stars, and many of its themes have penetrated into the American pop-cultural consciousness. Winfrey used the show as an educational platform, featuring book clubs, interviews, self-improvement segments, and philanthropic forays into world events. The show did not attempt to profit off the products it endorsed; it had no licensing agreement with retailers when products were promoted, nor did the show make any money from endorsing books for its book club.\n\"Oprah\" was one of the longest-running daytime talk shows in history. The show received 47 Daytime Emmy Awards before Winfrey chose to stop submitting it for consideration in 2000. In 2002, \"TV Guide\" ranked it at No. 49 on \"TV Guide\"'s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2013, they ranked it as the 19th greatest TV show of all time. In 2023, \"Variety\" ranked \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" #17 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.\nEarly history.\n\"Oprah\" had its roots in \"A.M. Chicago\", a half-hour morning talk show airing on WLS-TV, an ABC owned-and-operated station in Chicago. In 1983, Dennis Swanson, the new general manager of WLS-TV, hired Winfrey to replace Robb Weller, that program's former host. Winfrey took over as host on January 2, 1984, and, within a month, took it from last place to first place in local Chicago ratings. By 1985, the local \"A.M. Chicago\" program was renamed to \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". Following Winfrey's success in performing in the role of Sofia in the film \"The Color Purple\" (for which she earned Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations), on September 8, 1986, the talk show was relaunched under its current title and picked up nationally. For the premiere, the show's producers tried rigorously to book \"Miami Vice\"'s Don Johnson as the first guest, even trying to bribe him with Dom P\u00e9rignon and a pair of rhinestone sunglasses. All attempts to book Johnson failed and Winfrey decided to \"do what we do best, and that is a show about and with everyday people\". The theme for the premiere show was \"How to Marry the Man or Woman of Your Choice\".\nInterviews.\nWinfrey interviewed a plethora of public figures and everyday people during the show's 25-year history. When celebrities and newsmakers were ready to share their most intimate secrets their first stop was Winfrey's couch and when a serious story hit, the \"Oprah\" show focused on putting a human face on the headlines.\nCelebrities.\nWinfrey claims her worst interviewing experience was with Elizabeth Taylor in the show's second season. Just before the interview, Taylor asked Winfrey not to ask any questions about her relationships. Winfrey found this to be a challenge considering Taylor had been married seven times.\nOn February 10, 1993, Winfrey sat down in a prime-time special broadcast with Michael Jackson, who had performed ten days earlier in the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show, for what would become the most-watched interview in television history. Jackson, an intensely private entertainer, had not given an interview in 14 years. The event was broadcast live from Jackson's Neverland Ranch and was watched by 90 million people worldwide and, as a result, his then 14-month-old studio album \"Dangerous\" returned to the top-ten on the album charts. Jackson discussed missing out on a normal childhood and his strained relationship with his father, Joe Jackson. During the interview, Jackson attempted to dispel many of the rumors surrounding him and told Winfrey he suffered from the skin-pigment disorder known as vitiligo when asked about the change in the color of his skin. While admitting to getting a nose job, he denied all other plastic surgery rumors. Later in the interview, Jackson was joined by his close friend Elizabeth Taylor, her third appearance on the show.\nWinfrey's interview with Tom Cruise, which was broadcast on May 23, 2005, also gained notoriety. Cruise \"jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell rapturously to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his then-girlfriend, Katie Holmes.\" This scene quickly became part of American pop-cultural discourse and was heavily parodied in media.\nCeline Dion appeared on the show 28 times, the most of any celebrity, besides Gayle King, Winfrey's best friend, who appeared 141 times.\nWinfrey also interviewed Chicago's \"Guardian Angels\" and Raymond Lear in 1988.\nNotable guests.\nWinfrey interviewed Kathy Bray three weeks after her 10-year-old son, Scott, was accidentally killed by a friend who had found his father's gun. Viewers later commented that the interview changed their feelings about having guns in their homes.\nIn the 1989\u201390 season, Truddi Chase\u2014a woman who was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, having 92 distinct personalities\u2014appeared on the show. Chase had been violently and sexually abused beginning at the age of two and said her old self ceased to exist after that. After introducing Chase, who was there to promote her book \"When Rabbit Howls\", Winfrey unexpectedly broke down in tears while reading the teleprompter, relating her own childhood molestation to that of the guest. Unable to control herself, Winfrey repeatedly asked producers to stop filming.\nErin Kramp, a mother dying of breast cancer, appeared on the show in 1998. After realizing that her six-year-old daughter, Peyton, would have to grow up without her, Kramp began recording videotapes filled with motherly advice on everything from makeup tips to finding a husband. She also wrote letters and bought gifts for Peyton to open every Christmas and birthday she was gone. Kramp died on October 31, 1998. She had recorded over a hundred videos and audiotapes for her daughter.\nJo Ann Compton's daughter Laurie Ann was stabbed to death in 1988\u2014and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. \"I hope they're in the same hell I'm in.\" she said of her daughter's murderers on a 1998 show. Oprah brought in Dr. Phil McGraw to help Jo Ann. He asked her if she thought her daughter would want her to be in so much pain\u2014and Compton said no. \"Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life.\" Phil continued. \"She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died.\" After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: \"I never thought of it that way.\" Later, she sobbed while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: \"She continues to stay alive every time I do something positive.\" Compton's surviving daughter, Cindy, said \"She went from existing to living. It was an amazing transformation.\"\nIn 2001, Winfrey met 11-year-old Mattie Stepanek, who was born with dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy and wrote inspirational poetry he titled \"Heartsongs\". On the show, Stepanek stated, \"A heartsong doesn't have to be a song in your heart. It doesn't have to be talking about love and peace. \u2026 It's your message, what you feel like you need to do.\" In October 2008, Winfrey spoke at the posthumous dedication of Mattie J.T Stepanek Park in Maryland.\nRegular segments and campaigns.\nOprah's Book Club.\nOriginally featured a monthly book highlight, including author interviews. Its popularity caused featured books to shoot to the top of bestseller lists, often increasing sales by as many as a million copies at its peak. It was suspended in 2002 and returned in 2003, featuring more classic works of literature, with reduced selections per season. The original format was reintroduced in September 2005, but Winfrey's selection of James Frey's \"A Million Little Pieces\" became controversial due to accusations of falsification. January 2006 saw Elie Wiesel's \"Night\" selected; Winfrey even traveled to Auschwitz with Wiesel. In 2008, Eckhart Tolle's \"A New Earth\" was selected. Modernizing the book club's platform, Winfrey and Tolle began a series of live webcast classes that were streamed on Oprah.com to discuss elements of the book with a worldwide audience.\nOprah's Favorite Things.\nItems personally favored by Winfrey were featured on the show and given away to audience members. Since its launch in 1996, the \"Favorite Things\" episode quickly became the hottest ticket in television. When a product was featured, its sales skyrocketed. Select groups were sometimes chosen to receive the items. In 2004, the audience was made up of educators from across the country. Hurricane Katrina volunteer workers were invited to the 2009 show. Winfrey has said that the iPad, given away to her 2010 audience, was her all-time favorite \"Favorite Thing\". During a \"Season 25: Oprah Behind the Scenes\" episode documenting the production of the giveaway, Winfrey talked about why the event resonates with viewers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The \"things\" of \"Favorite Things\" is the least of the experience. It's sharing that moment with 300 other people, acknowledging that surprise and fantastical, sensational, wonderful, happy things can still occur in your life.\nOprah &amp; Gayle's Big Adventures.\nWinfrey and Gayle King are friends. In 1976, Winfrey was working as a news anchor in Baltimore when she met King, a production assistant. The two bonded during a snowstorm when Winfrey told King she could stay at her home to wait it out. Their friendship was often showcased on the show when the best friends decided to take a trip together.\nIn 2004, they traveled back in time, participating in the PBS series \"Colonial House\". The series intended to recreate daily life in Plymouth Colony in 1628. Their 24-hour Puritan adventure included wood-chopping, cooking over an open fire, battling with mice, and using leaves as toilet paper.\nWinfrey and King joined 60 other women for a spa getaway in 2006. They spent five days at Miraval Life in Balance Resort and Spa taking part in self-improvement exercises. For an exercise called A Swing and a Prayer, the women were hoisted 40 feet in the air and told to let go. Once in the air, King\u2014who is afraid of heights\u2014would not let herself fall. Winfrey could not help but laugh as King remained in the air, but eventually persuaded her to let go.\nIn the summer of 2006, Winfrey and King decided to go on an 11-day, 3,600-mile road trip across America \u2013 from California to New York. They were excited to meet people from small towns and see how America really lives. However, the initial excitement quickly wore off. The friends had minor meltdowns and fought for control over the radio; King likes to have music constantly playing while driving, while Winfrey prefers silence. Despite the challenges of the road trip, they got to see the beauty of Sedona, meet the people of Navajo Nation, crash a couple of weddings, take a dip in the healing waters of Pagosa Springs, and learn about Amish culture. Winfrey's many driving anxieties and King's tone-deaf singing made the trip a huge hit with viewers.\nThe friends visited the State Fair of Texas in 2010. They played traditional state fair games such as Flip-the-Chick and the water gun race. They tried many of the fried foods offered at the fair and judged a best \"Best of Show\" food contest.\nFor the farewell season, the best friends hit the road again for an overnight camping trip at Yosemite National Park. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park to see some of its famous sites including Mariposa Grove and the Tunnel View, from which El Capitan is visible in the distance. On the way to the campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some Moscow Mules to pass out to their camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature \"Oprah\" cocktail. The next day, they took a lesson in fly fishing and wrapped up their stay with a mule ride.\nRemembering Your Spirit.\nA segment at the end of the show that featured spiritual counselors, ordinary people who had been involved in extraordinary situations. They would come on the show and share their stories of overcoming adversity with the audience, inspiring viewers to do the same in their own lives.\nChange Your Life TV.\nIyanla Vanzant.\nIyanla Vanzant is a former attorney, spiritual teacher and self-help expert who was a regular on the show in the late 1990s. She started the show in its 12th season and became known for her no-nonsense, hard-hitting, and often humorous advice. Vanzant's take on everything from cheating spouses to financial struggles connected with viewers and, at times, Winfrey sat in the audience while Vanzant led the show. Her books \"In the Meantime\" and \"One Day My Soul Just Opened Up\" became \"New York Times\" bestsellers.\nDr. Phil.\nWinfrey met Phil McGraw when he worked as a consultant for her legal team during her 1998 beef trial in Amarillo, Texas. Starting in April of that year, he became a fixture on the show and a viewer favorite. McGraw gave guests tough, tell-it-like-it-is advice and did not allow excuses or rationalizations for their bad habits, bad marriages, or bad attitudes. His popular Tuesday appearances on the show led to his own talk show, \"Dr. Phil\", in 2002.\nSuze Orman.\nFinancial expert Suze Orman became a viewer favorite, offering money tips, spending interventions, and her famous \"Suze smackdowns\". She encouraged people to be honest with themselves about what they could afford and gave advice on getting rid of credit card debt. Her motivational approach to fixing finances has led to her own financial advice empire.\nWhat's the Buzz?\nWinfrey introduced up-and-coming public figures who generated industry buzz but not otherwise widely known. In what several media commentators have labelled \"The Oprah Effect\", people appearing on this segment such as Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx and singer James Blunt benefited from the extra publicity the show garnered. Blunt, in particular, saw album sales increase dramatically and landed a Top Two spot on the \"Billboard\" 200.\nWildest Dreams.\nA show feature called \"Wildest Dreams\" fulfilled the dreams of people reported to Winfrey by the producers \u2013 mostly viewers who wrote into the show \u2013 be the dreams of a new house, an encounter with a favorite performer, or a guest role on a popular TV show. It was named after the Tina Turner song \"In Your Wildest Dreams\", and Turner was one of the celebrities featured on the segment.\nTuesdays with Dr. Oz.\nMehmet Oz, the head of cardiac surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in NYC and better known to millions of Winfrey's viewers as \"Dr. Oz\", regularly appeared on Tuesdays during the 2008\u20132009 season. In 2009, Dr. Oz debuted \"The Dr. Oz Show\" in first-run syndication. The series is co-produced by Harpo Productions and Sony Pictures Television.\nFridays Live.\nA weekly live episode premiered in the show's 23rd season with a panel consisting of Winfrey, Gayle King, Mark Consuelos, and Ali Wentworth. The panel discussed the week's news and highlighted events in the media and on the show.\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, Winfrey hosted this segment on her own. Fridays Live did not return for the show's 25th season.\nNo Phone Zone.\nIn March 2010, Winfrey began a campaign to stop drivers from talking or texting on their cell phone in their vehicles while driving. This campaign was regularly noted near the beginning or at the end of episodes.\nNotable moments.\nOn November 10, 1986, during a show about sexual abuse, Winfrey revealed that she was raped by a relative when she was nine years old. Since this episode, Winfrey has used the show as a platform to help catch child predators, raise awareness, and give victims a voice.\nLiberace appeared in the first season of the show on December 25, 1986. He performed a Christmas medley; Winfrey said it was \"the most beautiful I've ever heard\". Six weeks later, he died of cardiac arrest due to congestive heart failure brought on by subacute encephalopathy. The episode was Liberace's final televised appearance.\nThe show had only been on the air for just six months when, in 1987, Winfrey traveled to Forsyth County, Georgia, a community in which, for 75 years, no black person had lived. Winfrey brought attention to racial tensions in the area, which had just experienced several protests. The show was set up as a town hall meeting where residents expressed their divisive opinions on the matter. The meeting was becoming heated when one woman stood up and said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I just hate to think that someone is going to get hurt before the people get some sense about them and talk about this and get it like it's supposed to be...black and white together in Forsyth County. There's no other way.\nThe \"Diet Dreams Come True\" episode from November 15, 1988, has become one of the most talked-about moments in the history of the show. After years of struggling to lose weight, Winfrey had finally succeeded in doing so. In July of that year, she had started the Optifast diet while weighing 212 pounds. By Fall, she weighed 145 pounds. To commemorate achieving her weight loss goals, Winfrey wheeled out a wagon full of fat to represent the 67 pounds she had lost on the diet. She showed off her slim figure in a pair of size 10 Calvin Klein jeans. However, after returning to real food she quickly gained back much of the weight she had lost. Winfrey now refers to that moment as her \"ego in a pom pom salute.\"\nWhile doing a show centered on women drug users in 1995, Winfrey opened up about her personal history with drug abuse:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I relate to your story so much. In my twenties, I have done this drug cocaine. I know exactly what you're talking about. It is my life's great big secret. It is such a secret because I realize that the public person that I have become, if the story were ever revealed, the tabloids would exploit it and what a big issue it would be. But I was involved with a man in my twenties who introduced me to cocaine. I always felt that the drug itself was not the problem, but that I was addicted to the man. I've often said over the years in my attempt to come out and say it, I have said many times, I did things in my twenties I was ashamed of, I've done things I've felt guilty about. And that is my life's great secret that's been held over my head. I understand the shame and I understand the guilt, I understand the secrecy, I understand all that.\nIn 1996, Winfrey spoke with seven of the Little Rock Nine and three white former classmates who tormented the group on their first day of high school in 1957 as well as a student who had befriended them. Winfrey was grateful to have the remaining members of the Little Rock Nine on her show because she credits her success to those who have contributed to the Civil Rights movement which paved the way for people like herself.\nComedian Ellen DeGeneres came out publicly as a lesbian during her appearance on the show in 1997 after appearing on a \"Time\" magazine cover next to the headline \"Yep, I'm gay.\" At the time, DeGeneres was the star of her own sitcom, ABC's \"Ellen\". The episode brought Winfrey the most hate mail she had ever received.\nClemantine Wamariya and her sister Claire appeared on the show in 2006 when Wamariya was selected as one of the winners of an essay contest held by Winfrey. It was revealed that the siblings had not seen their parents in 12 years after fleeing Rwanda during the 1994 genocide. Winfrey surprised the sisters by flying their family to Chicago for one of the most emotional reunions on the show.\nIn 2007, the Marines of the Second Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion Alpha Company and their naval corpsman, made the show their first stop after a seven-month tour on the front lines in Iraq. Winfrey welcomed the Marines with a big homecoming celebration where they were reunited with their loved ones on the show.\nOn November 11, 2009, Charla Nash, who was mauled by her friend and employer Sandra Herold's pet chimpanzee Travis, came to the show to speak out for the first time about the terrifying attack that took place just nine months prior. Nash wears a veil daily because the attack left devastating injuries to her face and she \"doesn't want to scare people.\" During the show, she agreed to lift her veil for the first time in public.\nWhile taping the show's 24th-season premiere on September 8, 2009, the entire audience of 21,000 people, gathered on Chicago's Magnificent Mile, surprised Winfrey by breaking out into a synchronized dance set to The Black Eyed Peas' performance of \"I Gotta Feeling\" (with new lyrics congratulating Winfrey on her show's longevity). The dance had been choreographed and rehearsed for weeks by a core group of dancers, who taught it to the entire crowd earlier in the day.\nDuring the farewell season, two hundred men who were molested came forward as part of a two-day event in 2010 to take a stand against sexual abuse. The men were joined by director and producer Tyler Perry, who had also experienced sexual abuse. Winfrey hoped that the episode would help survivors suffering in silence release the shame.\nOn January 24, 2011, Winfrey revealed that just before Thanksgiving 2010 she had discovered she has a half-sister. Winfrey decided to share the news on her show because she knew the story would eventually get out and wanted to be the first to address the matter.\nGiveaways.\nOn the season premiere of 2004, every person in Winfrey's show audience was given a new Pontiac G6 that was donated by General Motors, worth about $8 million in total. The giveaway was the genesis of the oft-satirized Oprah quote, \"You get a car! You get a car! Everybody gets a car!\" For the premiere of the show's farewell season, the studio audience of 300 \"ultimate fans\" were rewarded by being given a trip to Australia with Winfrey (donated by Australian tourism bodies). Other giveaway shows included the annual Oprah's Favorite Things show, in which the studio audience received products Winfrey considered good Christmas gifts.\nControversies.\nIn 1996, on a discussion of Mad Cow Disease, Winfrey stated that the disease fears had \"stopped [her] cold from eating another burger!\" Texas cattle ranchers considered that quote tantamount to defamation, and promptly sued her for libel. The show was still producing new episodes at the time of the trial and could not go into reruns, so the production was forced to move to Amarillo, Texas for a period of approximately one month during the proceedings. A gag order meant Winfrey was not allowed to even mention the trial on her show. Winfrey was found not liable. The trial and move to Amarillo led to Winfrey meeting Phil McGraw; Winfrey made McGraw a regular guest on her show shortly thereafter, which eventually led to McGraw getting his own show, produced by Winfrey's Harpo Productions.\nA controversial episode, which aired in 2005 (though originally aired to little apparent notice in October 2003), saw guests discussing the sexual act of \"rimming\", igniting criticism. The FCC received a proliferation of complaints from angry parents whose children watched the show in an early-evening slot in many television markets. However, most FCC correspondents were prodded to write by Howard Stern, a noteworthy target of the agency, as well as Jimmy Kimmel, in an attempt to expose an FCC double standard.\nDuring the 2008 presidential election campaign, Winfrey was criticized for apparently declining to invite Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to her show until after the election.\nA 2009 episode attracted criticism from the crowd after Winfrey suggested mothers should buy vibrators for their teenage daughters.\nWinfrey's program was criticized for featuring alternative medicine and junk science advocates such as Suzanne Somers and vaccine denialist Jenny McCarthy.\nIn the lead-up to Winfrey's tour of Australia, the show was heavily criticized for airing a segment sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation in which it was claimed by Australian TV personality Carrie Bickmore that Australians liked to hang out at \"hip McCaf\u00e9s\". This depiction of Australian culture was greeted with surprise by many Australians, and anger throughout the Australian coffee industry, which claimed the statements did not accurately reflect the industry, painted the Australian coffee drinker in a bad light, and expected that the industry would be negatively affected by the statements. In the same episode, McDonald's products were handed out to the studio audience.\nFinal season.\nEarly in its twelfth season, Winfrey confessed she was \"exhausted\" and considered quitting. However, while making the 1998 movie \"Beloved\", Winfrey then admitted that it brought her back to her responsibility as an admired black woman with a great deal of power and influence. She realized that being in such a position within the media industry, she could make a positive difference in people's lives. Winfrey was once again inspired to continue to help people take better control of their destinies, hence her slogan, \"Live Your Best Life\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I made the decision ... in the midst of doing \"Beloved\". I was doing some scenes\u2014\"Beloved\" is about an ex-slave, and during that process of doing that I connected to really what slavery had meant, and my own personal ancestry and history connected it to a way I have never before from reading all about Black history and, you know, talking to relatives. And I realized that I had no right to quit coming from a history of people who had no voice, who had no power, and that I have been given this\u2014this blessed opportunity to speak to people, to influence them in ways that can make a difference in their lives, and to just use that.\nOn January 15, 2008, Discovery Communications, Harpo Productions, and Winfrey announced a joint venture to establish a new cable channel in 2009, known as the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN). In November 2008, it was reported that, during a conference call, Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav stated that Winfrey did not intend to renew her contracts for \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" beyond the 2010\u201311 season. Zaslav stated that \"Oprah\" could potentially move to the new channel in some form following the end of the syndicated series. However, Harpo Productions denied the report, stating that Winfrey had \"not made a final decision as to whether she will continue her show in syndication beyond [2011]\".\nOn November 20, 2009, Winfrey officially announced that \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" would conclude in 2011, after its 25th and final season. Winfrey explained that 25 was \"the perfect number\u2014the exact right time\", and that \"I love this show. This show has been my life. And I love it enough to know when it's time to say goodbye.\" The 25th season premiered on September 13, 2010, featuring guest John Travolta, and an audience of 300 of her \"most loyal\" fans.\nDuring the episode, it was also announced that the entire audience had been invited to join Winfrey on an eight-day, all-expenses-paid trip to Sydney, Australia for a series of special episodes, via a plane piloted by Travolta. On December 11, 2010, Winfrey arrived in Sydney to record shows at the Sydney Opera House. Winfrey and her 300 American audience members were officially welcomed at a cocktail party in Sydney's Botanical Gardens overlooking Sydney Harbour. The beach-themed party, hosted by New South Wales Premier Kristina Keneally, featured live music and a fireworks display over the water which culminated in the lighting of a red 'O' on the Harbour Bridge. The episodes in Australia were coordinated between Harpo Studios, Tourism Australia, Tourism New South Wales, the Sydney Opera House, Tourism Victoria, Tourism Queensland, R. M. Williams and Network Ten. The federal government of Australia spent $1.5 million on the event while the government of the state of New South Wales spent an additional $1\u20132 million to promote the region. Tourism minister Martin Ferguson said \"I think it's money well spent\". In addition, Tourism Victoria spent a further A$650,000.\nThe farewell season featured several notable cast reunions, including \"The Sound of Music\", \"The Color Purple\", and \"The Way We Were\".\nIn May 2011, Winfrey interviewed U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, her first-ever interview with a sitting president and First Lady. They talked about the challenges of parenting at the White House, the strength of their relationship, and their concern for the country's future. President Obama also thanked Winfrey for her contributions to the country. \"You've got a big heart, and you share it with people. Nobody knows how to connect better than you do,\" he said. \"We are just blessed and grateful to have you in our lives.\"\nFinal episodes.\nThe final episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" aired on May 25, 2011. It was preceded by a two-part farewell special recorded at the United Center in Chicago in front of an audience of 13,000. The two-part show featured appearances by Aretha Franklin, Tom Cruise, Stevie Wonder, Patti LaBelle, Beyonc\u00e9, Tom Hanks, Maria Shriver, Will Smith, and Madonna. Several hundred graduates of Morehouse College who were the recipients of Oprah's Oprah Winfrey Scholarship also attended to thank Oprah and pledge their future support of the scholarship program. The final episode was a smaller affair, recorded in the usual recording studio. Winfrey spent most of the finale thanking the show's staff and her fans.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I've been asked many times during this farewell season, 'Is ending the show bittersweet?' Well, I say all sweet. No bitter. And here is why: Many of us have been together for 25 years. We have hooted and hollered together, had our aha! moments, we ugly-cried together and we did our gratitude journals. So I thank you all for your support and your trust in me. I thank you for sharing this yellow brick road of blessings. I thank you for tuning in every day along with your mothers and your sisters and your daughters, your partners, gay and otherwise, your friends and all the husbands who got coaxed into watching \"Oprah\". And I thank you for being as much of a sweet inspiration for me as I've tried to be for you. I won't say goodbye. I'll just say...until we meet again. To God be the glory.\nShe finished the show in tears. The finale was marked by viewing parties across the US, and the episode was also shown in movie theaters. The episode received the show's highest rating in 17 years.\nAfter the show's final episode, reruns of \"Oprah\" remained available to air until September 2011, by which point individual stations had selected other syndicated or local programs to fill the show's timeslot. Several stations that had carried the show in the 4:00\u00a0p.m. timeslot began carrying local news programs at that time, with a handful of stations debuting these newscasts the day after the final episode aired; as a result, the show's final months of reruns did not air in the normal timeslot in some areas.\nBroadcast history and release.\nThe show aired on most ABC-owned stations in the United States (except KTRK-TV in Houston and former O&amp;O WTVG in Toledo, with the show being aired on the CBS-affiliated stations in the respective markets) (as well as various other stations through CBS Television Distribution, successor to King World), CTV in most Canadian markets, Diva Universal in Malaysia, TV3 in Ireland, GNT in Brazil, national TV3 in Sweden, Network Ten in Australia, La7d in Italy, MBC 4 in the Arab world, MetroTV in Indonesia, FARSI1 in Iran, Star World in India, and in the Netherlands on RTL 4.\nIn the United Kingdom, the show has been broadcast on a number of different channels. Channel 4 first broadcast the series on Monday October 3, 1988, The BBC &amp; Sky one acquired the rights and started broadcasting the series from 9 January 1995 which meant at time during 1995 the show went out on 3 different channel. Five pick up the terrestrial rights from early 1998. Rights subsequently went to Living TV by 2002, followed by ITV2 in 2006, and then to Diva TV, until rights went to TLC for the last couple of series.\nThe show aired in 149 countries worldwide and was often renamed and dubbed into other languages.\nReception.\nTelevision viewership and ratings.\nIt has been reported that the show averages an estimated 7, 14, and 15\u201320 million viewers a day in the United States. It has also been reported at 26 million and 42 million a week (5.2 and 8.4 million a day). Viewership for the show has been reported to have dropped over the years, averaging 12.6 million in 1991\u20132, 9 million in 2004, 9 million in 2005, 7.8 in 2006, 7.3 million in 2008, and 6.2 million in 2009.\nThe show was number one in the talk show ratings since its debut. The show spent many years as the highest-rated program in daytime television. Even with stiff competition, \"Oprah\" still maintained a consistent lead over other talk shows.\nCritical response.\nKen Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised Winfrey's ability to connect with her audience.\n\"Newsweek\" listed the show as one of the best talk shows in television history.\nCultural impact.\nMultiple shows have spun off of \"Oprah\", including \"Dr. Phil\" (2002\u22122023), \"Rachael Ray\" (2006\u22122023), \"The Dr. Oz Show\" (2009\u22122022) and \"The Nate Berkus Show\" (2010\u22122012). \"The Doctors\" (2009\u22122022) is a spin-off of \"Dr. Phil\", making it a third-generation spin-off.\nThe show inspired television presenters of other talk shows, such as Jenny Jones of \"The Jenny Jones Show\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

They are typically served chilled or at room temperature, though some can be served warm. Condiments called \"salad dressings\", which exist in a variety of flavors, are usually used to make a salad. \nGarden salads have a base of raw leafy greens (sometimes young \"baby\" greens) such as lettuce, arugula (rocket), kale or spinach; they are common enough that the word \"salad\" alone often refers specifically to garden salads. Other types of salad include bean salad, tuna salad, bread salads (such as fattoush, panzanella), vegetable salads without leafy greens (such as Greek salad, potato salad, coleslaw), rice-, pasta- and noodle-based salads, fruit salads and dessert salads.\nSalads may be served at any point during a meal:\nWhen a sauce is used to flavor a salad, it is generally called a \"dressing\"; most salad dressings are based on either a mixture of oil and vinegar or a creamy dairy base.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"salad\" comes to English from the French \"salade\" of the same meaning, itself an abbreviated form of the earlier Vulgar Latin \"herba salata\" (salted herb), from the Latin \"salata\" (salted), from \"sal\" (salt). In English, the word first appears as \"salad\" or \"sallet\" in the 14th century. Salt is associated with salad because vegetables were seasoned with brine (a solution of salt in water) or salty oil-and-vinegar dressings during Roman times.\nThe phrase \"salad days\", meaning a \"time of youthful inexperience\" (based on the notion of \"green\"), is first recorded by Shakespeare in 1606, while the use of salad bar, referring to a buffet-style serving of salad ingredients, first appeared in American English in 1937.\nHistory.\nAncient Greeks and Romans ate mixed greens with dressing, a type of mixed salad. Salads, including layered and dressed salads, have been popular in Europe since the Greek and Roman imperial expansions. In his 1699 book, \"\", often considered the first book on salads, John Evelyn attempted with little success to encourage his fellow Britons to eat fresh salad greens. Mary, Queen of Scots, ate boiled celery root over greens covered with creamy mustard dressing, truffles, chervil, and slices of hard-boiled eggs.\nOil used on salads can be found in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, and also in the 17th-century colony of New Netherland (later called New York, New Jersey and Delaware). A list of common items arriving on ships and their designated prices when appraising cargo included \"a can of salad oil at 1.10 florins\" and \"an anker of wine vinegar at 16 florins\". In a 1665 letter to the Director of New Netherland from the Island of Cura\u00e7ao there is a request to send greens: \"I request most amicably that your honors be pleased to send me seed of every sort, such as cabbage, carrots, lettuce, parsley, etc. for none can be acquired here and I know that your honor has plenty...\".\nSalads may be sold in supermarkets, at restaurants and at fast food chains. In the United States, restaurants may have a salad bar with salad-making ingredients, which the customers will use to put together their salad. Salad restaurants were earning more than $300 million in 2014. At-home salad consumption in the 2010s was rising but moving away from fresh-chopped lettuce and toward bagged greens and salad kits, with bag sales expected to reach $7 billion per year.\nTypes.\nA salad can be a composed salad (with the ingredients specifically arranged on the serving dish) or a tossed salad (with the ingredients placed in a bowl and mixed, often with salad dressing). An antipasto plate, the first dish of a formal Italian meal, is similar to a composed salad, and has vegetables, cheese, and meat.\nGreen salad.\nA green salad, or green leaf salad, another name for garden salad, is most often composed of leafy vegetables such as lettuce varieties, spinach, or rocket (arugula). If non-greens make up a large portion of the salad it may instead be called a vegetable salad. Common raw vegetables (in the culinary sense) used in a salad include cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, onions, carrots, celery, radishes, mushrooms, avocado, olives, artichoke hearts, heart of palm, watercress, parsley, fennel, garden beets, and green beans. Nuts, berries, seeds, lentils, and flowers are less common components. Hard-boiled eggs, bacon, shrimp, and cheeses may be used as garnishes, but large amounts of animal-based foods would be more likely in a dinner salad.\nWedge salad.\nA wedge salad is a green salad made from a head of lettuce (often iceberg), halved or quartered, with other ingredients on top.\nBound salads.\nBound salads are assembled with thick sauces such as mayonnaise. One portion of a bound salad will hold its shape when placed on a plate with a scoop. Examples of bound salad include tuna salad, chicken salad, egg salad, coleslaw, and potato salad. Some bound salads are used as sandwich fillings. Some pasta salads, e.g. macaroni salad, are bound salads. They are popular at picnics, potlucks and barbecues.\nDinner salads.\nMain course salads (known as dinner salads or as entr\u00e9e salads in the United States) may contain small pieces of poultry, seafood, or steak. Caesar salad, chef salad, Cobb salad, Chinese chicken salad, Michigan salad, and Pittsburgh salad are dinner salads.\nA wide variety of cheeses are used in dinner salads, including Roquefort blue cheese (traditional for a Cobb salad), and Swiss, Cheddar, Jack, and Provolone (for chef and Cobb salads).\nFruit salads.\nFruit salads are made of fruit (in the culinary sense), which may be fresh or canned. Examples include fruit cocktail.\nDessert salads.\nDessert salads rarely include leafy greens and are often sweet. Common variants are made with gelatin or whipped cream; e.g. jello salad, pistachio salad, and ambrosia. Other forms of dessert salads include regional dishes such as Midwestern America's ambrosia-like glorified rice and cookie salad, which contains crumbled cookies as an ingredient.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It promotes excellence in world literature and is solely sponsored by Dublin City Council, Ireland. At \u20ac100,000, the award is one of the richest literary prizes in the world. If the winning book is a translation (as it has been twelve times), the prize is divided between the writer and the translator, with the writer receiving \u20ac75,000 and the translator \u20ac25,000. The first award was made in 1996 to David Malouf for his English-language novel \"Remembering Babylon\".\nNominations are submitted by public libraries worldwide \u2013 over 400 library systems in 177 countries worldwide are invited to nominate books each year \u2013 from which the shortlist and the eventual winner are selected by an international panel of judges (which changes each year).\nEligibility and procedure.\nThe prize is open to novels written in any language and by authors of any nationality, provided the work has been published in English or English translation. The presentation of the award is post-dated by two years from the date of publication. Thus, to win an award in 2017, the work must have been published in 2015. If it is an English translation, the work must have been published in its original language between two and six years before its translation. The scope for inclusion has been subject to criticism; according to \"The Irish Times\" journalist Eileen Battersby, \"many of the titles are already well known even at the time of the publication of the long list.\"\nDublin City Public Libraries seek nominations from 400 public libraries from major cities across the world. Libraries can apply to be considered for inclusion in the nomination process. The longlist is announced in October or November of each year, and the shortlist (up to 10 titles) is announced in March or April of the following year. The longlist and shortlist are chosen by an international panel of judges which rotates each year. Allen Weinstein was the non-voting chair of the panel from 1996 to 2003. As of 2017, the former Chief Judge of the US Court of Appeals, Eugene R. Sullivan, is the non-voting chair. The winner of the award is announced each June.\nHistory.\nThe award was established in 1994 as the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, a joint initiative of Dublin City Council and the American productivity company IMPAC, which had its European headquarters in Dublin. James Irwin, president of IMPAC, established the prize money at \u20ac100,000. A trust fund was established to pay for the award and its maintenance. The award has been administered by Dublin City Public Libraries since its inception. IMPAC went defunct in the late-2000s when its founder and president James Irwin died in 2009. In late 2013, the trust fund became exhausted and there was no money left to run the award. The council agreed to step in and continue funding the award under the same brand name of the now-defunct company while seeking a new sponsor. It was reported that the council paid \u20ac100,000 for the prize plus \u20ac80,250 in administration costs in 2015. The award was subsequently renamed the International DUBLIN Literary Award in November 2015. In 2021, it was awarded as the Dublin Literary Award.\nDescribing the award as \"the most eclectic and unpredictable of the literary world's annual gongs\", the journalist Michelle Pauli posed the question in relation to the longlist for the 2004 edition: \"Where would you find Michael Dobbs and Tony Parsons up against Umberto Eco and Milan Kundera for a \u20ac100,000 prize?\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The novel was published on 3 October 1895. Taking place during the American Civil War, the story is about a young private of the Union Army, Henry Fleming, who flees from the field of battle. Overcome with shame, he longs for a wound, a \"red badge of courage\", to counteract his cowardice. When his regiment once again faces the enemy, Henry acts as flag-bearer, carrying the regimental colors.\nAlthough Crane was born after the war, and had not at the time experienced battle first-hand, the novel is known for its realism and naturalism. He began writing what would become his second novel in 1894, using various contemporary and written accounts (such as those published previously by \"Century Magazine\") as inspiration. It is believed that he based the fictional battle on that of Chancellorsville; he may also have interviewed veterans of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. Initially shortened and serialized in newspapers in December 1894, the novel was published in full in October 1895. A longer version of the work, based on Crane's original manuscript, was published in 1982.\nThe novel is known for its distinctive style, which includes realistic battle sequences as well as the repeated use of color imagery, and ironic tone. Separating itself from a traditional war narrative, Crane's story reflects the inner experience of its protagonist (a soldier fleeing from combat) rather than the external world around him. Also notable for its use of what Crane called a \"psychological portrayal of fear\", the novel's allegorical and symbolic qualities are often debated by critics. Several of the themes that the story explores are maturation, heroism, cowardice, and the indifference of nature. \"The Red Badge of Courage\" garnered widespread acclaim, what H. G. Wells called \"an orgy of praise\", shortly after its publication, making Crane an instant celebrity at the age of twenty-four. The novel and its author did have their initial detractors, however, including author and veteran Ambrose Bierce. Adapted several times for the screen, the novel became a bestseller. Never out of print, it is Crane's most important work and a major American text.\nBackground.\nStephen Crane published his first novel, \"\", in March 1893 at the age of 21. \"Maggie\" was not a success, either financially or critically. Most critics thought the unsentimental Bowery tale crude or vulgar, and Crane chose to publish the work privately after it was repeatedly rejected for publication. Crane found inspiration for his next novel while spending hours lounging in a friend's studio in the early summer of 1893. There, he became fascinated with issues of \"Century Magazine\" that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the Civil War. Frustrated with the dryly written stories, Crane stated, \"I wonder that some of those fellows don't tell how they \"felt\" in those scraps. They spout enough of what they \"did\", but they're as emotionless as rocks.\" Returning to these magazines during subsequent visits to the studio, he decided to write a war novel. He later stated that he \"had been unconsciously working the detail of the story out through most of his boyhood\" and had imagined \"war stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers.\"\nAt the time, Crane was intermittently employed as a freelance writer, contributing articles to various New York City newspapers. He began writing what would become \"The Red Badge of Courage\" in June 1893, while living with his older brother Edmund in Lake View, New Jersey. Crane conceived the story from the point of view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war, only to become disillusioned by war's reality. He took the private's surname, \"Fleming\", from his sister-in-law's maiden name. He would later relate that the first paragraphs came to him with \"every word in place, every comma, every period fixed.\" Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. Because he could not afford a typewriter, he carefully wrote in ink on legal-sized paper, occasionally crossing through or overlying a word. If he changed something, he would rewrite the whole page. He later moved to New York City, where he completed the novel in April 1894.\nPublication history.\nThe title of Crane's original, 55,000-word manuscript was \"Private Fleming/His various battles\", but in order to create the sense of a less traditional Civil War narrative, he ultimately changed the title to \"The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War\". In early 1894, Crane submitted the manuscript to S. S. McClure, who held on to it for six months without publication. Frustrated, the author asked for the manuscript to be returned, after which he gave it to Irving Bacheller in October. An abbreviated version of Crane's story was first serialized in \"The Philadelphia Press\" in December 1894. This version of the story, which was culled to 18,000 words by an editor specifically for the serialization, was reprinted in newspapers across America, establishing Crane's fame. Crane biographer John Berryman wrote that the story was published in at least 200 small city dailies and approximately 550 weekly papers. In October 1895, a version, which was 5,000 words shorter than the original manuscript, was printed in book form by D. Appleton &amp; Company. This version of the novel differed greatly from Crane's original manuscript; the deletions were thought by some scholars to be due to demands by an Appleton employee who was afraid of public disapproval of the novel's content. Parts of the original manuscript removed from the 1895 version include all of the twelfth chapter, as well as the endings to chapters seven, ten and fifteen.\nCrane's contract with Appleton allowed him to receive a flat ten percent royalty of all copies sold. However, the contract also stipulated that he was not to receive royalties from the books sold in Great Britain, where they were released by Heinemann in early 1896 as part of its Pioneer Series. In 1982, W. W. Norton &amp; Company published a version of the novel based on Crane's original 1894 manuscript of 55,000 words. Edited by Henry Binder, this version is questioned by those who believe Crane made the original edits for the 1895 Appleton edition of his own accord. Since its initial publication, the novel has never gone out of print.\nPlot summary.\nOn a cold day, the fictional 304th New York Infantry Regiment awaits battle beside a river. Private Henry Fleming, a young teenaged recruit, remembers his romantic reasons for enlisting as well as his mother's resulting protests, wonders whether he will remain brave in the face of fear or turn and run back. He is comforted by one of his friends from home, Jim Conklin, who admits that he would run from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled. During the regiment's first battle, Confederate soldiers charge, but are repelled. The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again, this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee. Fearing the battle is a lost cause, Henry deserts his regiment. It is not until after he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union's victory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn despair, he declared that he was not like those others. He now conceded it to be impossible that he should ever become a hero. He was a craven loon. Those pictures of glory were piteous things. He groaned from his heart and went staggering off.\n\"The Red Badge of Courage\", Chapter eleven\nAshamed, Henry escapes into a nearby forest, where he discovers a decaying body in a peaceful clearing. In his distress, he hurriedly leaves the clearing and stumbles upon a group of injured men returning from battle. One member of the group, a \"tattered soldier\", asks Henry where he is wounded, but the youth dodges the question. Among the group is Conklin, who has been shot in the side and is suffering delirium from blood loss. Jim eventually dies of his injury, defiantly resisting aid from his friend, and an enraged and helpless Henry runs from the wounded soldiers. He next comes upon a retreating column that is in disarray. In the panic, a man hits Henry on the head with his rifle, wounding him. Exhausted, hungry, thirsty, and now wounded, Henry decides to return to his regiment regardless of his shame. When he arrives at camp, the other soldiers believe his injury resulted from a grazing bullet during battle. The other men care for the youth, dressing his wound.\nThe next morning Henry goes into battle for the third time. His regiment encounters an isolated Confederate unit, and in the ensuing fight Henry proves to be a capable soldier, comforted by the belief that his previous cowardice had not been noticed, as he \"had performed his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man\". Afterward, while looking for a stream from which to obtain water with a friend, he discovers from his commanding officer that his regiment has a lackluster reputation. The officer speaks casually about sacrificing the 304th because they are nothing more than \"mule drivers\" and \"mud diggers\". With no other regiments to spare, the general orders his men forward.\nIn the final battle, Henry acts as the flag-bearer after the color sergeant falls. A line of Confederates, hidden behind a fence beyond a clearing, shoots with impunity at Henry's regiment, which is ill-covered in the tree-line. Facing withering fire if they stay and disgrace if they retreat, the officers order a charge. Unarmed, Henry leads the men while entirely escaping injury. Most of the Confederates run before the regiment arrives, and four of the remaining men are taken prisoner. The novel closes with the following passage:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It rained. The procession of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky. Yet the youth smiled, for he saw that the world was a world for him, though many discovered it to be made of oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.\nOver the river a golden ray of sun came through the hosts of leaden rain clouds.\nHistorical accuracy and inspiration.\nAlthough Crane once wrote in a letter, \"You can tell nothing ... unless you are in that condition yourself,\" he wrote \"The Red Badge of Courage\" without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco-Turkish and Spanish\u2013American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in \"The Red Badge of Courage\" has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six years after the end of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: \"Of course, I have never been in a battle, but I believe that I got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days\".\nCrane drew from a variety of sources in order to realistically depict battle. \"Century\"'s \"Battles and Leaders\" series served as direct inspiration for the novel, and one story in particular (Warren Lee Goss's \"Recollections of a Private\") contains many parallels to Crane's work. Thomas Beer wrote in his problematic 1923 biography that Crane was challenged by a friend to write \"The Red Badge of Courage\" after having announced that he could do better than \u00c9mile Zola's \"La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle\". This anecdote, however, has not been substantiated. The metaphor of the \"red badge of courage\" itself may have been inspired by true events; historian Cecil D. Eby, Jr. noted that Union officer Philip Kearny insisted his troops wear bright red unit insignia patches, which became known as marks of valor and bravery. While the 304th New York Volunteer Infantry is fictional, many strategies and occurrences in the novel echo actual events during the Civil War. Details concerning specific campaigns during the war, especially regarding battle formations and actions during the Battle of Chancellorsville, have been noted by critics.\nIt is believed that Crane listened to war stories in the town square of Port Jervis, New York (where his family at times resided) told by members of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Orange Blossoms. The Orange Blossoms first saw battle at Chancellorsville, which is believed by local historians to have been the inspiration for the battle depicted in \"The Red Badge of Courage\". Furthermore, there was a Private James Conklin who served in the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and Crane's short story \"The Veteran\", which was published in \"McClure's Magazine\" the year after \"The Red Badge of Courage\", depicts an elderly Henry Fleming who specifically identifies his first combat experience as having occurred at Chancellorsville.\nStyle and genre.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA river, amber-tinted in the shadow of its banks, purled at the army's feet; and at night, when the stream had become of a sorrowful blackness, one could see across it the red, eyelike gleam of hostile camp-fires set in the low brows of distant hills.\n\"The Red Badge of Courage\", Chapter one\n\"The Red Badge of Courage\" has a distinctive style, which is often described as naturalistic, realistic, impressionistic or a mixture of the three. Told in a third-person limited point of view, the novel reflects the inner-experience of Henry Fleming, a young soldier who flees from combat, rather than upon the external world around him. \"The Red Badge of Courage\" is notable in its vivid descriptions and well-cadenced prose, both of which help create suspense within the story. Critics in particular have pointed to the repeated use of color imagery throughout the novel, both literal and figurative, as examples of the novel's use of Impressionism. Blue and gray uniforms are mentioned, as are yellow and orange sunlight, and green forests, while men's faces grow red with rage or courage, and gray with death. Crane also uses animalistic imagery to comment upon people, nature, and war itself. For example, the novel begins by portraying the army as a living entity that is \"stretched out on the hills, resting.\"\nWhile the novel takes place during a series of battles, \"The Red Badge of Courage\" is not a traditional Civil War narrative. Focusing on the complex internal struggle of its main character, rather than on the war itself, Crane's novel often divides readers as to whether the story is intended to be either for or against war. By avoiding political, military, and geographic details, the story becomes divorced from its historical context. Notably lacking are the dates in which the action takes place, and the name of the battle; these omissions effectively shift attention away from historical patterns in order to concentrate on the emotional violence of battle in general. The writer alluded to as much in a letter, in which he stated he wished to depict war through \"a psychological portrayal of fear.\"\nWriting more than thirty years after the novel's debut, author Joseph Conrad agreed that the novel's main struggle was internal rather than external, and that Fleming \"stands before the unknown. He would like to prove to himself by some reasoning process that he will not 'run from the battle'. And in his unblooded regiment he can find no help. He is alone with the problem of courage.\" Crane's realistic portrayal of the psychological struck a chord with reviewers; as one contemporary critic wrote for \"The New York Press\": \"At times the description is so vivid as to be almost suffocating. The reader is right down in the midst of it where patriotism is dissolved into its elements and where only a dozen men can be seen, firing blindly and grotesquely into the smoke. This is war from a new point of view.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt times he regarded the wounded soldiers in an envious way. He conceived persons with torn bodies to be peculiarly happy. He wished that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage.\n\"The Red Badge of Courage\", Chapter nine\nWith its heavy use of irony, symbolism and metaphor, the novel also lends itself to less straightforward readings. As with many of Crane's fictional works, the novel's dialogue often uses distinctive local dialects, contributing to its apparent historicity; for example, Jim Conklin muses at the beginning of the novel: \"I s'pose we must go reconnoiterin' 'round th' kentry jest t' keep 'em from gittin' too clost, or t'develope'm, or something\". The ironic tone increases in severity as the novel progresses, especially in terms of the ironic distance between the narrator and protagonist. The title of the work itself is ironic; Henry wishes \"that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage\", echoing a wish to have been wounded in battle. The wound he does receive (from the rifle butt of a fleeing Union soldier), however, is not a badge of courage but a badge of shame.\nBy substituting epithets for characters' names (\"the youth\", \"the tattered soldier\"), Crane injects an allegorical quality into his work, making his characters point to a specific characteristic of man. There have been numerous interpretations concerning hidden meanings within \"The Red Badge of Courage\". Beginning with Robert W. Stallman's 1968 Crane biography, several critics have explored the novel in terms of Christian allegory. In particular, the death of Henry Fleming's Christ-like friend, Jim Conklin, is noted for evidence of this reading, as well as the concluding sentence of chapter nine, which refers to the sun as \"fierce wafer\" in the sky. John Berryman was one of the first critics to interpret the novel as a modern wasteland through which the protagonist plays the role of an Everyman. Still others read the novel as having a Naturalist structure, comparing the work to those by Theodore Dreiser, Frank Norris and Jack London.\nThemes.\nAs the title of the work suggests, the main theme of the novel deals with Henry Fleming's attempt to prove himself a worthy soldier by earning his \"red badge of courage\". The first twelve chapters, until he receives his accidental wound, expose his cowardice. The following chapters detail his growth and apparently resulting heroism. Before the onset of battle, the novel's protagonist romanticized war; what little he knew about battle he learned from books: \"He had read of marches, sieges, conflicts, and he had longed to see it all\". Therefore, when confronted by the harsh realities of war, Henry is shocked, and his idealism falters. Finding solace in existential thoughts, he internally fights to make sense of the senseless world in which he finds himself. When he seems to come to terms with his situation, he is yet again forced into the fears of battle, which threaten to strip him of his enlightened identity. Joseph Hergesheimer wrote in his introduction to the 1925 Knopf edition of the novel that, at its heart, \"The Red Badge of Courage\" was a \"story of the birth, in a boy, of a knowledge of himself and of self-command.\"\nHowever, the text is ambiguous, making it questionable that Henry ever matures. As critic Donald Gibson stated in \"The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero\", \"the novel undercuts itself. It says there is no answer to the questions it raises; yet it says the opposite... It says that Henry Fleming finally sees things as they are; it says he is a deluded fool. It says that Henry does not see things as they are; but no one else does either.\" Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry's \"spiritual change\" by the end of the story, he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel's enigmatic ending. Although Henry \"progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph\", as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous \"romantic notions,\" \"the education of the hero ends as it began: in self deception.\" Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel's heroism paradox, especially in terms of the introspective Henry's lapse into unreasoning self-abandon in the second half of the book. Dillingham stated that \"in order to be courageous, a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities, reason and imagination, and act instinctively, even animalistically.\"\nThe indifference of the natural world is a reoccurring theme in Crane's work. At the beginning of the novel, as the regiments advance toward battle, the sky is described as being an innocuous \"fairy blue.\" In chapter seven, Henry notes the inexplicable tranquility of nature, \"a woman with a deep aversion to tragedy\", even as the battle rages on. Similarly, Heaven itself is indifferent to the slaughter he encounters on the battlefield. The dichotomy between nature's sweetness and war's destructiveness is further described in chapter eighteen: \"A cloud of dark smoke as from smoldering ruins went up toward the sun now bright and gay in the blue, enameled sky.\" After his desertion, however, Henry finds some comfort in the laws of nature, which seem to briefly affirm his previous cowardice:\nThis landscape gave him assurance. A fair field holding life. It was the religion of peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down with an air of trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.\nReception.\n\"The Red Badge of Courage\" received generally positive reviews from critics on its initial publication; in particular, it was said to be a remarkably modern and original work. Appleton's 1895 publication went through ten editions in the first year alone, making Crane an overnight success at the age of twenty-four. H. G. Wells, a friend of the author, later wrote that the novel was greeted by an \"orgy of praise\" in England and the United States. An anonymous reviewer for \"The New York Press\" wrote shortly after the novel's initial publication that \"One should be forever slow in charging an author with genius, but it must be confessed that \"The Red Badge of Courage\" is open to the suspicion of having greater power and originality than can be girdled by the name of talent.\" The reviewer for \"The New York Times\" was impressed by Crane's realistic portrayal of war, writing that the book \"strikes the reader as a statement of facts by a veteran\", a sentiment that was echoed by the reviewer for \"The Critic\", who called the novel \"a true book; true to life, whether it be taken as a literal transcript of a soldier's experiences in his first battle, or... a great parable of the inner battle which every man must fight.\"\nThe novel, however, did have its initial detractors. Some critics found Crane's young age and inexperience troubling, rather than impressive. For example, one reviewer wrote, \"As Mr. Crane is too young a man to write from experience, the frightful details of his book must be the outcome of a very feverish imagination.\" Crane and his work also received criticism from veterans of the war; one in particular, Alexander C. McClurg, a brigadier general who served through the Chickamauga and Chattanooga campaigns, wrote a lengthy letter to \"The Dial\" (which his publishing company owned) in April 1896, lambasting the novel as \"a vicious satire upon American soldiers and American armies.\" Author and veteran Ambrose Bierce, popular for his Civil War-fiction, also expressed contempt for the novel and its writer. When a reviewer for \"The New York Journal\" referred to \"The Red Badge of Courage\" as a poor imitation of Bierce's work, Bierce responded by congratulating them for exposing \"the Crane freak\". Some reviewers also found fault with Crane's narrative style, grammar mistakes, and apparent lack of traditional plot.\nWhile it eventually became a bestseller in the United States, \"The Red Badge of Courage\" was more popular and sold more rapidly in England when it was published in late 1895. Crane was delighted with his novel's success overseas, writing to a friend: \"I have only one pride and that is that the English edition of \"The Red Badge of Courage\" has been received with great praise by the English reviewers. I am proud of this simply because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win.\" Critic, veteran and Member of Parliament George Wyndham called the novel a \"masterpiece\", applauding Crane's ability to \"stage the drama of man, so to speak, within the mind of one man, and then admits you as to a theatre.\" Harold Frederic wrote in his own review that \"If there were in existence any books of a similar character, one could start confidently by saying that it was the best of its kind. But it has no fellows. It is a book outside of all classification. So unlike anything else is it that the temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all\". Frederic, who would later befriend Crane when the latter relocated to England in 1897, juxtaposed the novel's treatment of war to those by Leo Tolstoy, \u00c9mile Zola and Victor Hugo, all of whose works he believed to be \"positively... cold and ineffectual\" when compared to \"The Red Badge of Courage\".\nLegacy.\nCrane himself later wrote about the novel: \"I don't think \"The Red Badge\" to be any great shakes but then the very theme of it gives it an intensity that the writer can't reach every day.\" For the remainder of Crane's short career (he died from tuberculosis at the age of 28), \"The Red Badge of Courage\" served as the standard against which the rest of his works were compared. Appleton republished the novel again in 1917, shortly after the US entered World War I, reissuing it three additional times that same year.\nSince the resurgence of Crane's popularity in the 1920s, \"The Red Badge of Courage\" has been deemed a major American text and Crane's most important work. While modern critics have noted Crane's \"anticipation of the modern spectacle of war\", others, such as Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim, believe the work to be \"unquestionably the most realistic novel about the American Civil War\". Donald Gibson called the novel \"ahead of its time\" because it did \"not conform to very many contemporary notions about what literature should be and do.\" The novel has been anthologized numerous times, including in Ernest Hemingway's 1942 collection \"Men at War: The Best War Stories of All Time\". In the introduction, Hemingway wrote that the novel \"is one of the finest books of our literature, and I include it entire because it is all as much of a piece as a great poem is.\" Robert W. Stallman's introduction to the Modern Library's 1951 edition of \"The Red Badge of Courage\" contained one of the first modern assessments of the novel. This novel is followed by other works by Crane, such as the novella, \"\".\nThe novel has been adapted several times for the screen. A 1951 film by the same name was directed by John Huston, starring Medal of Honor recipient Audie Murphy as Henry Fleming. Written by Huston and Albert Band, the film suffered from a troubled production history, went over budget, and was cut down to only seventy minutes despite objections from the director. A made-for-television movie was released in 1974, starring Richard Thomas as Fleming, while the 2008 Czech film \"Tobruk\" was partly based on \"The Red Badge of Courage\".\nThe novel is also the inspiration for the title of the \"South Park\" episode \"The Red Badge of Gayness\", which revolves around a Civil War re-enactment.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61961", "revid": "1311690339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61961", "title": "Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19", "text": "Air superiority fighter aircraft family\nThe Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 (; NATO reporting name: Farmer) is a Soviet second generation, single-seat, twinjet fighter aircraft. It was the first Soviet production aircraft capable of supersonic speeds in level flight. A comparable U.S. \"Century Series\" fighter was the North American F-100 Super Sabre, although the MiG-19 primarily fought against the more modern McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and Republic F-105 Thunderchief over North Vietnam. This aircraft was originally used by the Soviet Union but it was later used by the People's Liberation Army Air Force of China.\nDesign and development.\nIn 1950 the Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG) design bureau (also known as OKB-155) began work on a new fighter aircraft, intended to have a greater range than the existing MiG-15 and MiG-17 aircraft, and capable of reaching supersonic speeds in level flight. MiG chose to use two of the new Mikulin AM-5 axial jet engines (a scaled-down version of the Mikulin AM-3 that powered the Tupolev Tu-16 bomber) for its new fighter. As a test bed for the new engine, OKB-155 was authorised on 20 April 1951 to convert one of the prototype MiG-17s, replacing the single Klimov VK-1 engine with two AM-5s (later replaced by AM-5As), with the testbed, designated SM-1 (or I-340), flying late in 1951. While the SM-1 was a useful testbed, its performance was less than expected, and first resulted in an afterburner being designed for the AM-5, resulting in the AM-5F (reaching with afterburner).\nWhile the SM-1 was a test bed, the SM-2 (or I-360) was intended as the required supersonic escort fighter, with work authorised on 10 August 1951. The SM-2 was a twin-engined, mid-winged aircraft. Its thin wings, which had been designed at TsAGI, the Soviet Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, for supersonic flight were swept back at an angle of 55 degrees and had a single wing fence on each side. Unusually, a T-tail was fitted. Armament was two Nudelman N-37 37-mm cannon located in the leading edge of the aircraft's wings, near the wing roots \u2013 the guns had been moved compared to those in the MiG-15 and -17 to avoid ingestion of gun blast gases causing surging of the aircraft's engines. The first SM-2, the SM-2/1 was sent to the \"Letno-Issledovatel'skiy Institut\" (en:flight research institute) (LII) in April 1952 for testing, and was flown for the first time on 24 May 1952, with test pilot G. A. Sedov at the aircraft's controls. With the AM-5A engines without an afterburner the SM-2 could not exceed the speed of sound in level flight. To solve this, AM-5F engines with afterburners were substituted. While the new engines improved performance, the aircraft was found to have handling problems, particularly at high angles of attack, where the aircraft was prone to spinning. To solve these problems the aircraft's horizontal tail was lowered, with other changes including moving the aircraft's airbrakes and deepening the wing fences, with the modifications causing the aircraft to be redesignated SM-2A and then SM-2B.\nThe AM-5F still generated inadequate thrust and so the Mikulin engine design bureau developed a new engine to replace it, the AM-9B (later re-designed the Tumansky RD-9), rated at dry and with afterburner. When fitted with the new engines, the SM-2B became the SM-9, first flying in this form on 5 January 1954. The SM-9's performance impressed the Soviet authorities, and it was ordered into production as the MiG-19 on 17 February 1954, despite the fact that factory testing had only just started.\nThe rush to get the MiG-19 into service resulted in initial production aircraft having a number of serious problems. The type suffered a number of in-flight explosions, eventually traced to poor insulation between the aircraft's engines and fuel tanks in the rear fuselage - overheating of these tanks could cause fuel explosions. This was eventually partly solved by fitting a metal heat shield between the engines and the tanks. The aircraft's elevators proved ineffective at supersonic speeds, and an all-moving slab tail was tested by the second and third SM-9 prototypes, and later included in the major production type, the MiG-19S, which also featured an improved armament.\nAt the same time that the daylight escort fighter was developed from the SM-2 and SM-9 into the MiG-19 and MiG-19S, work went on in parallel to design and build a radar-equipped all-weather fighter, with the first prototype SM-7/1 flying for the first time on 28 August 1954. This prototype had a similar airframe to the first SM-9, including the conventional fixed horizontal tail, with the second and third SM-7s introducing similar changes to those tested on the SM-9 prototypes, including the slab tail. The all weather fighter entered production as the MiG-19P in 1955. Major differences from the MiG-19S included RP-1 \"Izumrud\" radar in the aircraft's nose, with small radomes in the centre and on the top lip of the air intake and an armament of two cannon in the aircraft's wing roots. From 1957, production of all weather fighters switched to the missile equipped MiG-19PM, with an armament of four K-5M air-to-air missiles, with the cannon removed.\nIn 1955, following American introduction of high-altitude reconnaissance balloons and overflights by British Canberra aircraft, which could not be intercepted by existing aircraft, together with intelligence reports of the development of the Lockheed U-2 with an even greater ceiling, development began on a specialist high-altitude version of the MiG-19, the MiG-19SV, which entered limited production. This had more powerful engines and was lightened, with seatback armour and one of the guns removed, while flap settings were adjusted to give greater lift at higher altitudes and a new pressure suit was introduced. These changes increased the aircraft's ceiling from to . The prototype MiG-19SV was further modified (as the MiG-19SVK) with increased wingspan, giving a ceiling of , but this was still inadequate to deal with the U-2, and effort was switched to adding rocket boosters.\nOperational history.\nSoviet Union.\nDeliveries of the new fighter to the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) began in June 1955, with the type being publicly unveiled on 3 July that year, when 48 MiG-19s took part in a flypast during an airshow at Tushino Airfield, Moscow.\nDuring their service with Soviet Anti-Air Defense and in East Germany, MiG-19s were involved in multiple interceptions of illegal overflights of Western reconnaissance aircraft. The first documented encounter with a Lockheed U-2 took place in the autumn of 1957. The MiG-19 pilot reported seeing the aircraft, but could not make up the difference in altitude. When Francis Gary Powers's U-2 was shot down in the 1960 incident, one pursuing MiG-19P was also hit by the salvo of S-75 Dvina (NATO: SA-2 \"Guideline\") missiles, killing the pilot Sergei Safronov. In a highly controversial incident, on 1 July 1960, a MiG-19 shot down an RB-47H (S/N 53-4281) reconnaissance aircraft which the Americans claimed was in international airspace over the Arctic Circle with four of the crew killed and two captured by the Soviets (they were released in 1961). In another incident, on 28 January 1964, a MiG-19 shot down a T-39 Sabreliner which had intruded into East German airspace while on a training mission; all three crewmembers were killed.\nEast Asia.\nChina.\nThe first use and loss of a U.S. fighter to a MiG-19 (J-6) was in 1965 when a USAF Lockheed F-104 Starfighter piloted by Captain Philip E. Smith was intercepted by a PLAAF aircraft after illegally flying into Chinese airspace over Hainan Island. His Starfighter took cannon fire which damaged a portion of his wing and missile mount. Smith attempted to attack the defending aircraft and stated he received missile tone on the MiG but, shortly after pressing his missile firing button, his Starfighter lost all power. He ejected and was captured. Smith was held prisoner until he was released on 15 March 1973, due to improving US-China relations following U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972.\nVietnam.\nThe Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF) began receiving the MiG-19 at the end of Operation Rolling Thunder, which ended in 1968. Despite their limited numbers, MiG-19s were involved in extensive combat during Operations Linebacker and Linebacker 2. The VPAF claimed seven victories over U.S. aircraft using the MiG-19, all of which were F-4 Phantom IIs. The MiG-19 was tested by U.S. pilots in the United States in 1969 after receiving an F-6 (J-6 export model) from Pakistan. In addition to finding the aircraft to have a good canopy allowing good visibility for the pilot, along with three hard-hitting 30mm cannons, U.S. pilots found the MiG-19 (J-6/F-6) to be an excellent fighter, \"like the MiG-17, it could easily out-turn the Phantom...and could out-accelerate the F-4 out to Mach 1.2, but was slower than the MiG-21.\". However, the MiG-19's greatest fault was its extremely short range, as one U.S. test pilot remarked, \"after going in full after-burner at low altitude for five minutes, the MiG driver will be looking for a place to land!\" This, combined with the aircraft's twin engines, which were difficult to maintain, made the MiG-19 unpopular with North Vietnamese pilots.\nThe North Vietnamese government decided in early 1969 to strengthen its air defenses by creating a third jet fighter unit, the 925th Fighter Regiment. This unit would consist of late model MiG-17s and the newly acquired MiG-19s (nearly all of which were Shenyang J-6s from the People's Republic of China (PRC)). The regiment was established at Yen Bai, and by April 1969, nine combat-rated MiG-19 pilots were posted for combat duty. While some of North Vietnam's MiG-17s and all of their MiG-21s were supplied by the Soviet Union, the MiG-19s (J-6 models) were supplied by the PRC, which seldom exceeded 54 MiG-19s in number.\nWhile the MiG-19 lacked mounts for early air-to-air missiles, unlike early model F-4 Phantom IIs, it was armed with cannons effective in ACM. VPAF MiG-19s had three 30\u00a0mm cannons which \"were notable for their large muzzle flash\" when fired. The aircraft were loaded with 90 rounds per cannon, giving approximately six seconds of firing time. A single two second burst of 90 shells could impact a US aircraft with of metal. This contrasted to the small U.S. 20\u00a0mm cannon such as the M61 Vulcan which would deliver of metal.\nUS sources claim that 10 VPAF MiG-19s were lost in aerial combat. On 2 June 1972 a MiG-19 was the first recorded jet fighter to be shot down in aerial combat by cannon fire at supersonic speeds, by a USAF F-4 Phantom flown by Phil Handley. According to the VPAF, from 1965 to 1972, North Vietnamese MiG-19s shot down 13 enemy aircraft and helicopters, while five MiG-19s were lost (four shot down by enemy aircraft and one by friendly fire) and one pilot was killed.\nAir-to-air victories.\nThe following are Chinese and Vietnamese air-to-air kills, confirmed by US sources; all were achieved with 30\u00a0mm cannon shells.\nMiddle East.\nEgypt.\nOne of the first Egyptian MiG-19 units was the 15th Air Brigade, consisting of Nos 20 and 21 Squadrons, which became operational at Fayid with a forward location at Milayz in the early 1960s.\nIn 1962, Egyptian MiG-19s saw some action in the ground-attack role during the North Yemen Civil War. The first reported air combat in the Middle East with the MiG-19 happened on 29 November 1966 when an Israeli Air Force (IAF) Dassault Mirage III shot down two Egyptian MiG-19s which were trying to intercept an Israeli reconnaissance Piper J-3 Cub in Israeli airspace. The first MiG was destroyed with a R.530 radar-guided missile at a range of less than 1.6 km (one mile), marking the first aerial kill for the French-made missile. The second MiG-19 was dispatched with cannon fire.\nAround 80 MiG-19s were in service with Egypt during the Six-Day War in June 1967, but more than half of them were destroyed on the ground during the opening Israeli airstrikes of Operation Focus. Israeli pilots, however, did find the MiG-19 a potentially dangerous adversary because of its performance, maneuverability, and heavy armament.\nFollowing the war, the Egyptians reorganized their surviving MiG-19 fleet, and assigned them to the air defense of Egypt's interior. The Soviet Union did not supply Egypt with any additional MiG-19s as replacements for those destroyed in the Six-Day War, but Egypt might have received some from Syria and Iraq, so that by the end of 1968 there were more than 80 MiG-19s in service with the Egyptian Air Force. The aircraft also saw combat during the War of Attrition; in one engagement on 19 May 1969, a MiG-19 engaged two Israeli Mirages, shooting down one with cannon fire while the other escaped.\nIraq.\nhttps://, https:// (a couple remaining in local museums), though a few remaining airframes did see some action against the Kurds in the 1960s.\nSyria.\nThe Syrian Air Force used MiG-19s in the Yemen War.\nNorth Korea.\nNorth Korea received an unknown number of MiG-19S from the Soviet Union following the signing of a mutual assistance treaty in 1961. Thirty of these aircraft may have been sold to Iraq in 1983. At least 100 F-6s were acquired from China in 1988\u201389. As of April 2002, the Korean People's Army Air and Anti-Air Force was reportedly operating about 100 Shenyang J-6 and/or MiG 19s.\nVariants.\nProduction aircraft designations.\n\"Data from:\":\nFirst production version.

{"id": "61962", "revid": "5718152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61962", "title": "Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21", "text": "1956 Soviet fighter aircraft family\nThe Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 (; NATO reporting name: Fishbed) is a supersonic jet fighter and interceptor aircraft, designed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau in the Soviet Union. Its nicknames include: \"\"Balalaika\", because its planform resembles the stringed musical instrument of the same name; \"O\u0142\u00f3wek\"\", Polish for \"pencil\", due to the shape of its fuselage, and \"\u00c9n B\u1ea1c\", meaning \"silver swallow\", in Vietnamese.\nApproximately 60 countries across four continents have flown the MiG-21, and it still serves many nations seven decades after its maiden flight. It set aviation records, becoming the most-produced supersonic jet aircraft in aviation history, the most-produced combat aircraft since the Korean War and, previously, the longest production run of any combat aircraft.\nDevelopment.\nOrigins.\nThe MiG-21 jet fighter was a continuation of Soviet jet fighters, starting with the subsonic MiG-15 and MiG-17, and the supersonic MiG-19. A number of experimental Mach 2 Soviet designs were based on nose intakes with either swept-back wings, such as the Sukhoi Su-7, or tailed deltas, of which the MiG-21 would be the most successful.\nDevelopment of what would become the MiG-21 began in the early 1950s when Mikoyan OKB finished a preliminary design study for a prototype designated Ye-1 in 1954. This project was very quickly reworked when it was determined that the planned engine was underpowered; the redesign led to the second prototype, the Ye-2. Both these and other early prototypes featured swept wings. The first prototype with the delta wings found on production variants was the Ye-4. It made its maiden flight on 16 June 1955 and its first public appearance during the Soviet Aviation Day display at Moscow's Tushino airfield in July 1956.\nIn the West, due to the lack of available information, early details of the MiG-21 often were confused with those of similar Soviet fighters of the era. In one instance, \"Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1960\u20131961\" listed the \"Fishbed\" as a Sukhoi design and used an illustration of the Su-9 'Fishpot'.\nDesign.\nThe MiG-21 was the first successful Soviet aircraft combining fighter and interceptor characteristics in a single aircraft. It was a lightweight fighter, achieving Mach 2 with a relatively low-powered afterburning turbojet, and is thus comparable to the American Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter and the French Dassault Mirage III. Its basic layout was used for numerous other Soviet designs; delta-winged aircraft included the Su-9 interceptor and fast Ye-150 prototype from the MiG bureau, while the successful mass-produced frontline fighter Su-7 and Mikoyan's I-75 experimental interceptor combined a similar fuselage shape with swept-back wings. However, the characteristic layout with the shock cone and front air intake did not see widespread use outside the USSR and ultimately proved to have limited development potential, mainly due to the small available space for the radar.\nLike many aircraft designed as interceptors, the MiG-21 had a short range. This was exacerbated by the poor placement of the internal fuel tanks ahead of the centre of gravity. As the internal fuel was consumed, the center of gravity would shift rearward beyond acceptable parameters. This had the effect of making the plane statically unstable to the point of being difficult to control, resulting in an endurance of only 45 minutes in clean condition. This can be somewhat countered by carrying fuel in external tanks closer to the center of gravity. The Chinese variants somewhat improved the internal fuel tank layout (as did the second generation of Soviet variants), and also carried significantly larger external fuel tanks to counter this issue. Additionally, when more than half the fuel was used up, violent maneuvers prevented fuel from flowing into the engine, thereby causing it to shut down in flight. This increased the risk of tank implosions (MiG-21 had tanks pressurized with air from the engine's compressor), a problem inherited from the MiG-15, MiG-17 and MiG-19. The short endurance and low fuel capacity of the MiG-21F, PF, PFM, S/SM and M/MF variants\u2014though each had a somewhat greater fuel capacity than its predecessor\u2014led to the development of the MT and SMT variants. These had an increased range of compared to the MiG-21SM, but at the cost of worsening all other performance figures, such as a lower service ceiling and slower time to altitude.\nThe delta wing, while excellent for a fast-climbing interceptor, meant any form of turning combat led to a rapid loss of speed. However, the light loading of the aircraft could mean that a climb rate of 235\u00a0m/s (46,250\u00a0ft/min) was possible with a combat-loaded MiG-21bis, not far short of the performance of the later F-16A. MiG-21's Tumansky R-25 jet engine's specialty was the addition of a second fuel pump in the afterburning stage. Activating the \u0427\u0420 (rus. \"\u0447\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0432\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c\" - emergency mode)(Emergency Power Rating, EPR in India) booster feature allows the engine to develop 97.4 kilonewtons (21,896\u00a0lbf) of thrust under 2,000 meters (6,600\u00a0ft) of altitude. The rpm of the engine would increase by 2.5% and the compression ratio would thus increase, with a rise in exhaust temperature. The limit of operation is 2 minutes for both practice and actual wartime use, as further use causes the engine to overheat. The fuel consumption increased by 50% over the rate in full afterburner. Use of this temporary power gave the MiG-21bis slightly better than 1:1 thrust-to-weight ratio and a climbing rate of 254 meters/second, equalling the F-16's nominal capabilities in a close-quarters dogfight.\nThe use of WEP thrust was limited to 2 minutes to reduce stress on the engines' 750 (250+250+250) flight hours lifetime since every second of super-afterburner counted as several minutes of regular power run due to extreme thermal stress. With WEP on, the MiG-21bis's R-25 engine produced a huge 10\u201312 meter long blowtorch exhaust, with six or seven brightly glowing rhomboid shock diamonds visible inside the exhaust. The Russians gave the emergency power setting its \"diamond regime\" name, which was never popularly used in India. Given a skilled pilot and capable missiles, it could give a good account of itself against contemporary fighters. Its G-limits were increased from +7Gs in initial variants to +8.5Gs in the latest variants. It was replaced by the newer variable-geometry MiG-23 and MiG-27 for ground support duties. However, not until the MiG-29 would the Soviet Union ultimately replace the MiG-21 as a maneuvering dogfighter to counter new American air superiority types.\nThe MiG-21 was exported widely and remains in use. The aircraft's simple controls, engine, weapons, and avionics were typical of Soviet-era military designs. The use of a tail with the delta wing aids stability and control at the extremes of the flight envelope, enhancing safety for lower-skilled pilots; this, in turn, enhanced its marketability in exports to developing countries with limited training programs and restricted pilot pools. While technologically inferior to the more advanced fighters it often faced, low production and maintenance costs made it a favorite of nations buying Eastern Bloc military hardware. Several Russian, Israeli and Romanian firms have begun to offer upgrade packages to MiG-21 operators, designed to bring the aircraft up to a modern standard, with greatly upgraded avionics and armaments.\nProduction.\nA total of 10,645 aircraft were built in the USSR. They were produced in three factories: AZ 30 (3,203 aircraft) in Moscow (also known as \"MMZ Znamya Truda\"), GAZ 21 (5,765 aircraft) in Gorky, and TAZ 31 (1,678 aircraft) in Tbilisi. Generally, Gorky built single-seaters for the Soviet forces. Moscow constructed single-seaters for export, and Tbilisi manufactured two-seaters both for export and the USSR, though there were exceptions. The MiG-21R and MiG-21bis for export and for the USSR were built in Gorky, 17 single-seaters were built in Tbilisi (MiG-21 and MiG-21F), the MiG-21MF was first constructed in Moscow and then Gorky, and the MiG-21U was built in Moscow as well as in Tbilisi.\nA total of 194 MiG-21F-13s were built under licence in Czechoslovakia, and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. of India built 657 MiG-21FL, MiG-21M and MiG-21bis (of which 225 were bis)\nCost.\nDue to the mass production, the aircraft was very cheap: the MiG-21MF, for example, was cheaper than the BMP-1. The F-4 Phantom's cost was several times higher than MiG-21.\nDesign.\nThe MiG-21 has a delta wing. The sweep angle on the leading edge is 57\u00b0 with a TsAGI S-12 airfoil. The angle of incidence is 0\u00b0 while the dihedral angle is \u22122\u00b0. On the trailing edge there are ailerons with an area of 1.18\u00a0m2, and flaps with an area of 1.87\u00a0m2. In front of the ailerons there are small wing fences.\nThe fuselage is semi-monocoque with an elliptical profile and a maximum width of . The air flow to the engine is regulated by an inlet cone in the air intake. On early model MiG-21s, the cone has three positions. For speeds up to Mach 1.5, the cone is fully retracted to the maximum aft position. For speeds between Mach 1.5 and Mach 1.9, the cone moves to the middle position. For speeds higher than Mach 1.9, the cone moves to the maximum forward position. On the later model MiG-21PF, the intake cone moves to a position based on the actual speed. The cone position for a given speed is calculated by the UVD-2M system using air pressures from in front and behind the compressor of the engine. On both sides of the nose, there are gills to supply the engine with more air while on the ground and during takeoff. In the first variant of the MiG-21, the pitot tube is attached to the bottom of the nose. After the MiG-21P variant, this tube is attached to the top of the air intake. Later versions shifted the pitot tube attachment point 15 degrees to the right, as seen from the cockpit, and had an emergency pitot head on the right side, just ahead of the canopy and below the pilot's eyeline.\nThe cabin is pressurized and air-conditioned. On variants prior to the MiG-21PFM, the cabin canopy is hinged at the front. When ejecting, the SK-1 ejection seat connects with the canopy to provide a windbreak from the high-speed airflow encountered during high-speed ejections. After ejection, the canopy opens to allow the pilot to parachute to the ground. However, ejecting at low altitudes can cause the canopy to take too long to separate, sometimes resulting in pilot death. The minimum height for ejection in level flight was 110\u00a0m. Starting with the MiG-21PFM, a new ejection seat proved to be very reliable and did not need the canopy to protect the pilot which had never been fully satisfactory. The canopy is hinged on the right side of the cockpit.\nOn the underside of the aircraft, there are three air brakes, two at the front and one at the rear. The front air brakes have an area of 0.76\u00a0m2, and a deflection angle of 35\u00b0. The rear air brake has an area of 0.47\u00a0m2 and a deflection angle of 40\u00b0. The rear air brake is blocked if the airplane carries an external fuel tank. Behind the air brakes are the bays for the main landing gear. On the underside of the airplane, just behind the trailing edge of the wing are attachment points for two JATO rockets. The front section of the fuselage ends at former #28. The rear section of the fuselage starts at former #28a and is removable for engine maintenance.\nThe empennage of the MiG-21 consists of a vertical stabilizer, a stabilator and a small fin on the bottom of the tail to improve yaw control. The vertical stabilizer has a sweep angle of 60\u00b0 and an area of 5.32\u00a0m2 (on earlier version 3.8\u00a0m2) and a rudder. The stabilator has a sweep angle of 57\u00b0, an area of 3.94\u00a0m2 and a span of 2.6\u00a0m.\nThe MiG-21 uses a tricycle-type undercarriage. On most variants, the main landing gear uses tires that are 800\u00a0mm in diameter and 200\u00a0mm in width. Only the MiG-21F variants use tires with the size 660\u00d7200\u00a0mm. The wheels of the main landing gear retract into the fuselage after rotating 87\u00b0 and the shock absorbers retract into the wing. The nose gear retracts forward into the fuselage under the radar. The nose wheel can be lowered manually by simply unlocking its hatch from inside the cockpit. Thus, landing with undercarriage locked in the up position due to an internal failure was not a major issue, with a number of such successful landings on the nosewheel and ventral fuel tank or the airbrake.\nOperational history.\nNorth Korea.\nNorth Korea acquired its first MiG-21s from the Soviet Union in 1963, and possibly earlier, making it one of the very first countries to receive the aircraft. This was the last time the USSR exported its most capable frontline fighter class to its neighbour. During low level hostilities in the inter-Korean Demilitarised Zone, Korean People's Army Air Force (KPAAF) MiG-21s were credited with shooting down an American RF-4C reconnaissance plane on August 31, 1967, an F-105D fighter five months later on January 14, 1968 and an F-4B fighter the following month on February 12. On January 23, 1968 pair of MiG-21 fighters were involved in the first stages of the joint operation with the Korean People's Army Navy to capture the American surveillance ship \"USS Pueblo\". The following year, two MiG-21s shoot down an EC-121 plane in international airspace, killing all 31 Americans servicemen on board.\nDuring the Vietnam War North Korean personnel manned one MiG-21 company and two MiG-17 companies in the North Vietnamese fleet, providing a 50 percent increase to North Vietnam's fighter strength. Between 87 and 96 North Korean pilots served in the conflict, and were credited by North Vietnamese pilots with downing 26 American aircraft while taking 14 losses. \nDuring the Yom Kippur War North Korean veteran pilots, many with more than 2,000 hours flight experience, flew Egyptian and Syrian MiG-21 fighters and engaged Israeli forces multiple times. KPAAF pilots continued to fly Syrian MiG-21s throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. \nNorth Korea made its last known MiG-21 acquisition in the 1990s, and while failing to purchase 133 airframe enhanced MiG-21bis aircraft being retired by Kazakhstan, it was able to acquire 30 of them. The MiG-21bis\u2019 integration of the more powerful R-25 engine, use of four wing hard points instead of two, and compatibility with the R-60 air-to-air missile, made these aircraft significantly superior to its previous MiG-21s. The fighters were acquired for just $200,000 each. The MiG-21bis has continued to play an important role in the North Korean fleet, with the aircraft modernised with multi function cockpit displays and new communications equipment. MiG-21BiS pilots also began sporting new helmets and flight suits around 2015, while a range of indigenous air to ground munitions including bombs and anti tank guided missiles have been produced in the country such as the AGP-250 GNSS guided glide bomb. Integration of indigenous electronic warfare systems has also been speculated.\nIndia.\nIn 1961, the Indian Air Force (IAF) opted to purchase the MiG-21 over several other Western competitors. As part of the deal, the Soviet Union offered India full transfer of technology and rights for local assembly. A first batch of eight pilots trained on MiG-15s and MiG-17s at the Lugvoya Air base to familiarise themselves with the Russian aircraft models and procedures from late October 1962 to early January 1963, before transitioning to the MiG-21s, which later formed the No. 28 Squadron of the IAF. In 1963, the MiG-21 became the first supersonic fighter aircraft to enter service with the IAF.\nDue to limited numbers and lack of training, the IAF MiG-21s played a limited role during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. However, the IAF gained valuable experience while operating the MiG-21 for defensive sorties during the war. The positive feedback from the IAF pilots prompted India to place more orders for the fighter jet and invest in building the MiG-21's maintenance infrastructure and pilot training programs. Since 1963, India inducted more than 1,200 MiG-21s into its air force. At its peak, the IAF operated 400 MiG-21s across 19 squadrons. The expansion of the MiG-21 fleet helped India develop a military partnership with Soviet Union, to counter Chinese and Pakistani threats.\nIndia-Pakistan Wars.\nDuring the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, the MiG-21s played a major role for the IAF in to establish air superiority over vital points and areas of conflict. The war witnessed the first supersonic dog fight in the India subcontinent when an Indian MiG-21FL shot a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Lockheed F-104 Starfighter with its GSh-23 twin-barrelled cannon. The IAF MiG-21FLs had an upper hand in the highly anticipated air combat with the PAF F-104A Starfighters. As per the IAF, the MiG-21s had claimed four F-104As, two Shenyang F-6Cs, one North American F-86F Sabre and one Lockheed C-130E Hercules aircraft of the PAF.\nDuring the Kargil war in 1999, the IAF MiG-21s were pressed into combat air patrols and reconnaissance duties at high altitudes in Kashmir. As a part of Operation Safed Sagar, the aircraft flew multiple sorties against Pakistani positions and provided air support to Indian Army units. However, operating at high altitudes proved extremely challenging for the aircraft, limiting its effectiveness as a fighter aircraft. On 27 May 1999, a MiG-21 was shot down by the PAF, and the pilot was captured and later killed.\nLater years.\nOn 10 August 1999, two MiG-21FLs of the IAF intercepted and shot down a Pakistani Br\u00e9guet 1150 Atlantic maritime patrol aircraft with an R-60 missile after it allegedly entered Indian airspace for surveillance, killing all 16 on board. In December 2013, the MiG-21FL variants were decommissioned by the IAF. The aircraft was further involved during the 2019 India\u2013Pakistan border skirmishes, with a PAF F-16 shooting down an IAF MiG-21, whose pilot was captured and later returned to India. \nSince 1970, more than 170 IAF pilots and 40 civilians were killed in MiG-21 accidents, thus the earning the aircraft the nickname of \"flying coffin\". Over half of the 840 aircraft built between 1966 and 1984 were lost to crashes. When in afterburner, the engine operates very close to its surge line and the ingestion of a small object led to an engine surge/seizure and flame out. Poor maintenance and quality of replacement parts was considered to be a factor in the crashes. As a result, the IAF announced that it would replace its remaining fleet of MiG-21\u00a0Bison aircraft with the indigenous HAL Tejas fighter aircraft in 2023. In October 2023, the aircraft made the final public appearance at the Air Force Day flypast held at Prayagraj. The aircraft were retired in August 2025 in a ceremony at the Nal Air Force Station in Bikaner, which was the last airbase operating the aircraft. An official farewell ceremony was held at Chandigarh Air Force Station on 26 September 2025.\nIndonesia.\nThe Indonesian Air Force purchased 22 MiG-21s. In 1962, 20 MiG-21F-13s and MiG-21Us were received during Operation Trikora in the Western New Guinea conflict. Indonesian MiG-21s never fought in any dogfights. Right after the U.S.-backed anti-communist forces took over the government, 13 Indonesian MiG-21s were delivered to the U.S. in exchange for T-33, UH-34D, and later, F-5 and OV-10 aircraft. All remaining MiG-21s were grounded and retired due to a lack of spare parts and the withdrawal of Soviet maintenance support.\nThe MiGs were added to the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron (\"Red Eagles\"), a USAF aggressor squadron at Tonopah Test Range.\nVietnam War.\nThe MiG-21 was designed for very short ground-controlled interception (GCI) missions. It became renowned for this type of mission in the skies over North Vietnam. The first MiG-21s arrived directly from the Soviet Union by ship in April 1966. After being unloaded and assembled they were given to the Vietnam People's Air Force's (VPAF) oldest fighter unit, the 921st Fighter Regiment (921st FR), which had been created on 3 February 1964 as a MiG-17 unit. Because the VPAF's 923rd FR was newer and less experienced, they continued to operate MiG-17s, while the arrival of the MiG-19s (J-6 versions) from China in 1969 led to North Vietnam's only MiG-19 unit, the 925th FR. On 3 February 1972, North Vietnam commissioned its fourth and last fighter regiment created during the war with South Vietnam, the MiG-21PFM (Type 94)-equipped 927th FR.\nFormer MiG-17 pilot Nguyen Nhat Chieu and his wingman Tran Ngoc Siu intercepted USAF F-105Ds while on CAP duty over Phuc Yen Airbase (a.k.a. Noi Bai Airbase) on 7 July 1966, shooting down one piloted by Capt. Tomes with a salvo from Tran's UB-16-57/S-5M unguided rocket-equipped MiG-21, while flight leader Nguyen was unable to establish a lock on another, wildly-evading F-105 with his R-3S AAM; this was the first instance of a VPAF MiG-21 shooting down a piloted enemy aircraft in the Vietnam War.\nAlthough 13 of North Vietnam's flying aces attained their status while flying the MiG-21 (cf. three in the MiG-17), many VPAF pilots preferred the MiG-17 because the high wing loading of the MiG-21 made it relatively less maneuverable and the lighter framed canopy of the MiG-17 gave better visibility. However, this is not the impression British author Roger Boniface got when he interviewed Pham Ngoc Lan and ace Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1eadt Chi\u00eau (who scored victories flying both the MiG-17 and MiG-21). Pham Ngoc Lan told Boniface that \"The MiG-21 was much faster, and it had two Atoll missiles which were very accurate and reliable when fired between 1,000 and 1,200 yards.\" And Chi\u00eau asserted that \"...\u00a0for me personally, I preferred the MiG-21 because it was superior in all specifications in climb, speed and armament. The Atoll missile was very accurate and I scored four kills with the Atoll.\u00a0... In general combat conditions, I was always confident of a kill over an F-4 Phantom when flying a MiG-21.\"\nAlthough the MiG-21 lacked the long-range radar, missiles, and heavy bomb load of its contemporary multi-mission U.S. fighters, its RP-21 Sapfir radar helped make it a challenging adversary in the hands of experienced pilots, especially when used in high-speed hit-and-run attacks under GCI control. MiG-21 intercepts of Republic F-105 Thunderchief strike groups were effective in downing U.S. aircraft or forcing them to jettison their bomb loads.\nAerial combat victories 1966\u20131972.\nThe VPAF flew their interceptors with guidance from ground controllers, who positioned the MiGs in ambush battle stations to make \"one pass, then haul ass\" attacks. The MiGs made fast and often accurate attacks against US formations from several directions (usually the MiG-17s performed head-on attacks and the MiG-21s attacked from the rear). After shooting down a few American planes and forcing some of the F-105s to drop their bombs prematurely, the MiGs did not wait for retaliation but disengaged rapidly. These \"guerrilla warfare in the air\" tactics generally proved successful during the war. In December 1966, the MiG-21 pilots of the 921st FR downed 14 F-105 Thunderchiefs without any losses.\nThe USAF and the US Navy had high expectations of the F-4 Phantom, assuming that their massive firepower, best available on-board radar, highest speed and acceleration properties, coupled with new tactics, would provide an advantage over the MiGs. But in confrontations with the lighter MiG-21, F-4s began to suffer losses. From May to December 1966, the USAF lost 47 aircraft, destroying only 12 VPAF fighters in return. From April 1965 to November 1968, over 268 air battles occurred over the skies of North Vietnam. North Vietnam claimed 244 downed U.S. aircraft while admitting to the loss of 85 MiGs. Of 46 air battles between F-4s and MiG-21s, losses amounted to 27 F-4 Phantoms and 20 MiG-21s.\nAfter a million sorties and nearly 1,000 US aircraft losses, Operation Rolling Thunder came to an end on 1 November 1968. A poor air-to-air combat loss-exchange ratio against the smaller, more agile enemy MiGs during the early part of the war eventually led the US Navy to create their Navy Fighter Weapons School, also known as \"TOPGUN\", at Naval Air Station Miramar, California, on 3 March 1969. The USAF quickly followed with its own version, called the Dissimilar Air Combat Training (sometimes referred to as Red Flag) program at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. These two programs employed the subsonic Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and supersonic F-5 Tiger II, as well as the Mach 2.4-capable USAF Convair F-106 Delta Dart, to mimic the MiG-21.\nThe culmination of the air struggle over Vietnam in early 1972 was 10 May, when VPAF aircraft completed 64 sorties, resulting in 15 air battles. The VPAF claimed 7 F-4s were shot down (the U.S. confirmed five F-4s were lost.) The F-4s, in turn, managed to destroy two MiG-21s, three MiG-17s and one MiG-19. On 11 May, two MiG-21s, playing the \"bait\", brought four F-4s to 2 MiG-21s circling at low altitude. The MiGs quickly stormed the Phantoms and 3 missiles shot down two F-4s. On 13 May, a MiG-21 unit intercepted a group of F-4s and a second pair of MiGs made a missile attack before being hit by two F-4s. On 18 May, VPAF aircraft made 26 sorties, eight of which resulted in combat, downing four F-4s without any VPAF losses.\nOver the course of the air war, between 3 April 1965 and 8 January 1973, each side would ultimately claim favorable kill ratios. In 1972, the number of air battles between American and Vietnamese planes stood at 201. The VPAF lost 54 MiGs (including 36 MiG-21s and one MiG-21US) and claimed 90 U.S. aircraft shot down, including 74 F-4 fighters and two RF-4C reconnaissance jets (MiG-21s shot down 67 enemy aircraft while MiG-17s shot down 11 and MiG-19s downed another 12).\nOne MiG-21 was shot down on 21 February 1972 by a USAF F-4 Phantom based at Udorn RTAFB, Thailand and piloted by Major Lodge with 1st Lt Roger Locher as his weapon systems officer (WSO). This was claimed as the first-ever USAF MiG kill at night, and the first in four years at that time.\nTwo MiG-21s were claimed shot down by USAF Boeing B-52 Stratofortress tail gunners; the only confirmed air-to-air kills ever made by the B-52. The first aerial victory was scored on 18 December 1972 by tail gunner Staff Sgt Samuel Turner, who was awarded the Silver Star. The second took place on 24 December 1972, when A1C Albert E. Moore downed a MiG-21 over the Thai Nguyen railroad yards. Both actions occurred during Operation Linebacker II, also known as the Christmas Bombings. These air-to-air kills were not confirmed by VPAF.\nThe biggest threat to North Vietnam during the war had always been the Strategic Air Command's B-52 bombers. Hanoi's MiG-17 and MiG-19 interceptors could not deal with the B-52s at their flying altitude. In the summer of 1972, the VPAF was directed to train 12 MiG-21 pilots for the specific mission of shooting the B-52 bombers, with two-thirds of the pilots specifically trained in night attacks. On 26 December 1972, just two days after tail gunner Albert Moore downed a MiG-21, a VPAF MiG-21MF (number 5121) from the 921st Fighter Regiment, flown by Major Ph\u1ea1m Tu\u00e2n over Hanoi, claimed the first aerial combat kill of a B-52. The B-52 had been above Hanoi at over when Major Tu\u00e2n launched two Atoll missiles from 2 kilometres away and claimed to have destroyed one of the bombers flying in the three-plane formation. Other sources argue that the Atoll missiles failed to hit their mark, but as it was disengaging, a B-52 from a three-bomber cell in front of his target took a hit from a surface-to-air missile (SAM), exploding in mid-air: this may have caused Tu\u00e2n to think his missiles destroyed the target he had been aiming for.\nThe Vietnamese claimed another kill on 28 December 1972 by a MiG-21 from the 921st FR, this time flown by Vu Xuan Thieu. Thieu is said to have perished in the explosion of a B-52 hit by his own missiles, having approached the target too closely. In this case, the Vietnamese version appears to be erroneous: while one MiG-21 kill was claimed by Phantoms that night (this may have been Thieu's MiG), no B-52s were lost for any reason on the date of the claimed kill.\nOn 3 January 1968, a single MiG-21 pilot, Ha Van Chuc, entered battle with 36 American planes and claimed one F-105 Thunderchief.\nDuring the war, the VPAF claimed 103 F-4 Phantoms were shot down by MiG-21s, and that they lost 60 MiG-21s in air combat (54 by Phantoms).\nAccording to Soviet data, the VPAF MiG-21s claimed 165 air victories, with the loss of 65 aircraft (including a few by accident or friendly fire) and 16 pilots. The losses of MiG-21 pilots were the lowest of all airplanes.\nArab\u2013Israeli conflicts.\nThe MiG-21 was also used extensively in Middle Eastern conflicts of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s by the Egyptian Air Force, Syrian Air Force and Iraqi Air Force. The MiG-21 first encountered Israeli Mirage IIICJs on 14 November 1964, but it was not until 14 July 1966 that the first MiG-21 was shot down. Another six Syrian MiG-21s were shot down by Israeli Mirages on 7 April 1967. MiG-21s also faced McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs and Douglas A-4 Skyhawks, but were later outclassed by the more modern McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, both acquired by Israel starting in the mid-1970s. During this period, Syrian pilots flying MiG-21s also independently discovered the Cobra maneuver, which became a standard defensive maneuver under the name \"zero speed maneuver\" (Syrian: \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0635\u0641\u0631).\nDuring the opening attacks of the 1967 Six-Day War, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) struck Arab air forces in four attack waves. In the first wave, Israeli pilots claimed to have destroyed eight Egyptian aircraft in air-to-air combat, of which seven were MiG-21s; Egypt claimed five kills scored by MiG-21PFs. During the second wave, Israel claimed four more MiG-21s downed in air-to-air combat, with the third wave resulting claimed air victories over two Syrian and one Iraqi MiG-21. The fourth wave destroyed many more Syrian MiG-21s on the ground. Overall, Egypt lost around 100 out of about 110 MiG-21s they had, almost all on the ground; Syria lost 35 of its 60 MiG-21F-13s and MiG-21PFs in the air and on the ground.\nBetween the end of the Six-Day War and the start of the War of Attrition, IAF Mirage fighters scored six confirmed kills of Egyptian MiG-21s, and Egyptian MiG-21s scored two confirmed and three probable kills against Israeli aircraft. Between the end of the Six-Day War to the end of the War of Attrition, Israel claimed a total of 25 destroyed Syrian MiG-21s; the Syrians claimed three confirmed and four probable kills of Israel aircraft, although Israel denied these.\nHigh losses to Israeli aircraft and continuous bombing during the War of Attrition caused Egypt to ask the Soviet Union for help. In March 1970, Soviet pilots and SAM crews arrived with their equipment. On 13 April, during the air battle over the Red Sea coast, the Soviet MiG-21MFs, according to some data, shot down two Israeli F-4 fighters On 18 April, one Israeli scout RF-4E \"Phantom\" was damaged by a Soviet MiG-21MF. On 16 May, an Israeli aircraft was shot down in air combat, probably by a Soviet MiG-21. On 22 June 1970, a Soviet pilot flying a MiG-21MF shot down an Israeli A-4E. After that, several more successful intercepts were carried out by Soviet pilots and another Israeli A-4 was shot down on 25 June.\nIn response, Israel planned an ambush, calling it Operation Rimon 20. On 30 July, Israeli F-4s lured Soviet MiG-21s into an area where they were ambushed by Israeli Mirages. Asher Snir, flying a Mirage IIICJ, destroyed a Soviet MiG-21; Avihu Ben-Nun and Aviam Sela, both piloting F-4Es, each got a kill, and an unidentified pilot in another Mirage scored a fourth kill against a Soviet-flown MiG-21; the IAF suffered only a damaged Mirage. Three Soviet pilots were killed and the Soviet Union was alarmed by the losses. Yet though it was a morale-boosting achievement, \"Rimon 20\" did not change the course of the war. After the operation, other IAF aircraft were lost to Soviet MiG-21s and SAMs. A week later, on 7 August, the Soviets responded by deploying more aircraft to Egypt and luring Israeli fighter jets into an ambush of their own, \"Operation Kavkaz\", downing two Israeli Mirage IIICJs. In all, during March and August 1970, Soviet MiG-21 pilots and SAM crews destroyed 21 Israeli aircraft (eight by SA-3 missile systems and 13 by MiG-21s) at a cost of 5 MiG-21s shot down by the IAF, helping to convince the Israelis to sign a ceasefire.\nIn September 1973, a large air battle erupted between Syria and Israel; Israel claimed a total of 12 Syrian MiG-21s destroyed, while Syria claimed eight kills scored by MiG-21s and admitted five losses.\nDuring the Yom Kippur War, Israel claimed 73 kills against Egyptian MiG-21s (65 confirmed). Egypt claimed 27 confirmed kills and eight probables against Israeli aircraft by its MiG-21s. However, according to most Israeli sources, these were exaggerated claims, as Israeli air-to-air combat losses for the entire war did not exceed fifteen.\nOn the Syrian front, 6 October 1973 saw a flight of Syrian MiG-21MFs shoot down an Israeli A-4E and Mirage IIICJ, losing three of their own to Israeli IAI Neshers. On 7 October, Syrian MiG-21MFs downed two Israeli F-4Es, three Mirage IIICJs and an A-4E while losing two of their MiGs to Neshers and one to an F-4E, as well as two to friendly SAM fire. Iraqi MiG-21PFs also operated on this front, and on that same day destroyed two A-4Es while losing one MiG. On 8 October 1973, Syrian MiG-21PFMs downed three F-4Es, but six of their MiG-21s were lost. By the end of the war, Syrian MiG-21s claimed a total of 30 confirmed kills against Israeli aircraft; 29 MiG-21s were claimed (26 confirmed) as destroyed by the IDF.\nLater on 26 April 1974, an unusual occurrence involving Pakistani fighter pilot Flight Lieutenant Sattar Alvi took place while he was on deputation to the No. 67A Squadron of the Syrian Air Force. Alvi, flying a Syrian MiG-21F-13 (Serial No. 1863) out of Syria's Al-Dumayr Air Base with a fellow PAF pilot, was on aerial patrol near the Golan Heights when he spotted two Israeli Mirage-IIICJs intruding in Syrian airspace. According to modern Pakistani sources, Alvi and his flight leader engaged them, and after a brief dogfight, shot down one of the Mirages, flown by Captain M. Lutz. The Israeli pilot later succumbed to wounds he sustained during ejection. However, no major sources from the time reported on such an incident, and there is no mention of \"Captain Lutz\" in Israel's Ministry of Defense's record of Israel's casualties of war.\nBetween the end of the Yom Kippur War and the start of the 1982 Lebanon War, Israel received modern F-15s and F-16s which were far superior to the old Syrian MiG-21MFs. According to the IDF, these new aircraft shot down 24 Syrian MiG-21s over this period, though Syria did claim five IAF kills by MiG-21s armed with outdated K-13 missiles; Israel denied that it had suffered any losses.\nThe 1982 Lebanon War began on 6 June 1982, and during the conflict the IAF claimed to have destroyed about 45 Syrian MiG-21MFs. Syria confirmed the loss of 37 MiG-21s, including 24 MiG-21bis and 10 MiG-21MF downed and 2 MiG-21bis and 1 MiG-21MF written off Syria claimed two confirmed and 15 probable kills of Israeli aircraft. Two Israeli F-15s and one F-4 were damaged in combat with MiG-21s. In the largest air battle since the Korean War, one Israeli F-15 was heavily damaged by a Syrian MiG-21 firing a R-60 (missile), but was able to make back to base for repairs. \nSyrian civil war.\nBeginning in July 2012, at which point the Syrian civil war had lasted a year without aerial action, the Syrian Air Force started operations against Syrian insurgents. MiG-21s were among the first combat-ready aircraft used in bombings, rocket attacks and strafing runs, with numerous videos showing the attacks.\nThe rebels had access to heavy machine guns, different anti-aircraft guns and Russian and Chinese MANPADS, up to modern designs such as the FN-6. The first loss of a MiG-21 during the Syrian civil war was recorded on 30 August 2012. The MiG, registration number 2271, was likely downed by heavy machine gun fire on takeoff or landing at Abu al-Duhur Military Airbase, under siege by rebels. A few days later, on 4 September 2012, another MiG-21 (registration number 2280) was shot down in similar circumstances at the same base, also likely on takeoff or landing by rebels using by KPV 14.5\u00a0mm machine guns; the downing was recorded on video.\nOn 10 November 2014, Syrian Air Force MiG-21bis number 2204 was shot down, and its pilot killed, by rebels either using a MANPADS or antiaircraft guns, near the town of Sabburah, 45\u00a0km east of Hama Airbase where it was likely based. Video and photo evidence of the crash site later emerged.\nFour months after a MiG-23 was shot down and during which time the Syrian Air Force suffered no losses from enemy fire, one of its MiG-21s was shot down on 12 March 2016 by the Jaysh al-Nasr faction over Hama near Kafr Nabudah. While the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, as suggested by video evidence, reported that the warplane had been downed by two MANPADS, Jaysh al-Nasr militants claimed to have shot it down with anti-aircraft guns. The pilot appeared to have bailed out of the stricken MiG, but died from ground fire or other causes.\nOn 4 March 2017, a Syrian MiG-21bis from No. 679 squadron, operating out of Hama Airbase and piloted by Col. Mohammad Sawfan, was shot down by Ahrar al-Sham rebels, crashing in Turkish territory near the border. Col. Sawfan successfully ejected but was arrested and taken to a hospital in Antakya, Turkey. A recording between the pilot and ground controller clearly showed Sawfan's disorientation due to a malfunctioning compass, followed by a failure of the entire navigation system. He could not find his way back to base as ordered and inadvertently flew within range of rebel anti-aircraft guns. After being suspended for a number of years, Sawfan was allowed to return to service.\nLibyan\u2013Egyptian War.\nEgypt received American Sidewinder missiles, fitting them to their MiG-21s and successfully using them in combat against Libyan Mirages and MiG-23s during the brief Egyptian\u2013Libyan War of July 1977.\nIran\u2013Iraq War.\nDuring the Iran\u2013Iraq War, 23 Iraqi MiG-21s were shot down by Iranian F-14s, as confirmed by Iranian, Western and Iraqi sources and another 29 Iraqi MiG-21s were downed by F-4s.\nHowever, from 1980 to 1988, Iraqi MiG-21s shot down 43 Iranian fighter aircraft.\nLibya.\nLibyan Civil War (2011).\nLibyan MiG-21s saw limited service during the 2011 Libyan civil war. On 15 March 2011, one MiG-21bis and one MiG-21UM flown by defecting Libyan Air Force pilots flew from Ghardabiya Airbase near Sirte to Benina Airport to join the rebellion's Free Libyan Air Force. On 17 March 2011, the MiG-21UM experienced a technical fault and crashed after taking off from Benina.\nLibyan Civil War (2014\u20132020).\nIn the Second Libyan Civil War (2014\u20132020), the Libyan National Army, under the command of Khalifa Haftar is loyal to the legislative body in Tobruk, which is the Libyan House of Representatives, internationally recognised until October 2015. It fights against the now internationally recognized Government of National Accord and the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries as well as Islamic State in Libya which are common enemies for both the Government of National Accord and the Libyan National Army. Both the Libyan National Army and the Government of National Accord field small airforces.\nAs such, a number of former Libyan Arab Air Force (LARAF) MiG-21s were returned to service with the Tobruk-based Libyan National Army, thanks to spare parts and technical assistance from Egypt and Russia, while a number of former Egyptian Air Force MiG-21s were pressed into service as well.\nMiG-21s under the control of the Libyan House of Representatives have been used extensively to bomb forces loyal to the rival General National Congress in Benghazi during the 2014 Libyan Civil War.\nOn 29 August 2014, an LNA MiG-21bis, serial number 208, after a bombing mission over Derna, crashed in Bayda according to an official statement as a result of a technical failure of the plane, while Islamist Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries claimed it was shot down. The pilot did not eject and died in the crash.\nOn 2 September 2014 an LNA MiG-21bis, serial number 800, crashed in a city block of Tobruk, due to pilot error during a pull-up maneuver. It is unclear whether the pilot had been on a bombing mission on the way to Derna, further East, or had been performing an aerial ceremony for the MiG-21 pilot who died a few days earlier.\nPart of the 2019 Western Libya offensive, on 9 April 2019, a Libyan National Army MiG-21 made a low altitude diving rocket attack, probably firing S-24 rockets on Mitiga airport in Tripoli, making limited damages to one of the runways.\nOn 14 April 2019, a Libyan National Army MiG-21MF was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, probably a MANPADS fired by the forces of the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) south of Tripoli. Video evidence confirmed the MiG-21 came under fire from anti-aircraft guns, small arms and two SAMs, one of which apparently hit the target. The pilot, Colonel Jamal Ben Amer ejected safely and recovered to LNA-held territory by a Mi-35 helicopter. LNA sources confirmed the loss but blamed a technical problem.\nHorn of Africa.\nDuring the Ogaden War of 1977\u201378, Ethiopian Air Force F-5As engaged Somali Air Force MiG-21MFs in combat on several occasions. In one lopsided incident, two F-5As piloted by Israeli advisers or mercenaries engaged four MiG-21MFs. The MiGs were handled incompetently by the Somali pilots, and the F-5As destroyed two while the surviving pilots collided with each other avoiding an AIM-9.\nEthiopia claimed to have shot down 10 Somali MiG-21MFs; while Somalia also claimed to have destroyed several Ethiopian MiG-21MFs, three F-5Es, one Canberra bomber and three Douglas DC-3s. Ethiopian MiG-21s were deployed largely in the ground attack role, and proved instrumental during the final offensive against Somali ground forces.\nEthiopian pilots who had flown both the F-5E and the MiG-21 and received training in both the US and the USSR considered the F-5 to be the superior fighter because of its manoeuvrability at low to medium speeds, its superior instrumentation and the fact that it was far easier to fly, allowing the pilot to focus on combat rather than controlling his airplane. This effect was enhanced by the poor quality of pilot training provided by the Soviets, which provided limited flight time and focussed exclusively on taking off and landing, with no practical training in air combat.\nAngola.\nDuring Angola's long-running civil war, MiG-21s of the Cuban Air Force were frequently deployed to attack ground targets manned by rebel forces or engage South African Air Force Mirage F1s conducting cross-border strikes. Most MiG-21 losses over Angola were attributed to accurate ground fire, such as an example downed by National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) insurgents near Luena with an American FIM-92 Stinger.\nDespite extensive losses to man-portable air-defense systems, MiG-21s were instrumental during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale; Cuban pilots became accustomed to flying up to three sorties a day. Both the MiG-21MF and the MiG-21bis were deployed almost exclusively in the fighter/bomber role. As interceptors, they were somewhat unsuccessful due to their inability to detect low-flying South African aircraft. On 6 November 1981, a Mirage F1CZ achieved South Africa's first confirmed air-to-air kill since the Korean War when it destroyed Cuban Lieutenant Danacio Valdez's MiG-21MF with 30mm cannon fire. On 5 October 1982, Mirages escorting an English Electric Canberra on routine reconnaissance over Cahama were engaged by at least two MiG-21bis. A South African radar operator picked up the attacking MiGs and was able to alert the Mirage pilots in advance, instructing them to change course immediately. As they jettisoned their auxiliary tanks, however, they were pinpointed by the Cubans, who opened pursuit. In a vicious dogfight, SAAF Major John Rankin closed range and maneuvered into the MiGs' rear cones. From there, one of his two R.550 Magic missiles impacted directly behind the lead MiG and forced it down. The second aircraft, piloted by Lieutenant Raciel Marrero Rodriguez, could not detect the Mirage's proximity until it had entered his turn radius and was perforated by Rankin's autocannon. This damaged MiG-21 landed safely at Lubango.\nContacts between MiG-21s and SAAF Mirage F1s or Mirage IIIs became increasingly common throughout the 1980s. Between 1984 and 1988, thirteen MiG-21s were lost over Angola. On 9 August 1984, a particularly catastrophic accident occurred when the 9th Fighter Training Squadrons and the 12th Fighter Squadrons of the Cuban Air Force attempted to carry out an exercise in poor weather. A single MiG-21bis and three MiG-23s were lost. \nOn 14 December 1988, an Angolan Air Force MiG-21bis, serial number C340, strayed off course and being low on fuel executed an emergency landing on an open field in South West Africa, modern-day Namibia, where it was seized by local authorities. Since Angola did not request its return after the South African Border War, the MiG was restored by Atlas Aviation and until September 2017 it was displayed at Swartkops Air Force Base, Pretoria. The jet was returned to Angola, flying in an Angolan Il-76 cargo plane, as a sign of goodwill on 15 September 2017.\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe MiG-21MFs of the 25th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the National Air Force of Angola flew ground sorties during the Second Congo War, sometimes being piloted by mercenaries. Some six MiG-21s were imported into the country during the First Congo War for the Congo Air Force, but do not appear to have seen operational service. (Cooper and Weinert, \"African MiGs: Volume 1: Angola to Ivory Coast\").\nYugoslavia.\nYugoslavia purchased its first batch of MiG-21s in 1962 from the Soviet Union. From 1962 to the early 1980s, Yugoslavia purchased 261 MiG-21s, of ten different variants. There were 41 MiG-21f-13, 36 MiG-21PfM, 25 MiG-21M, 6 MiG-21MF, 46 MiG-21bis, 45 MiG-21bisK, 12 MiG-21R, 18 MiG-21U, 25 MiG-21UM, and 7 MiG-21US. Yugoslav Air force units that operated MiG-21s were the 204th Fighter-Aviation Regiment at Batajnica Air Base (126th, 127th and 128th fighter-aviation squadrons), 117th fighter-aviation regiment at \u017deljava Air Base (124th and 125th fighter-aviation squadron and 352nd recon squadron), 83rd fighter-aviation regiment at Slatina Air Base (123rd and 130th fighter aviation squadron), 185th fighter-bomber-aviation squadron (129th fighter-aviation squadron) at Pula and 129th training center at Batajnica air base.\nDuring the early stages of the 1990s' Yugoslav wars, the Yugoslav military used MiG-21s in a ground-attack role, while Croatian and Slovene forces did not yet have air forces at that point in the conflict. Aircraft from air bases in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina were relocated to air bases in Serbia. Detailed records show at least seven MiG-21s were shot down by AA defenses in Croatia and Bosnia. A MiG-21 piloted by a Serbian Yugoslav Air Force pilot shot down an EC helicopter in 1992.\nCroatia acquired three MiG-21s in 1992 through defections by Croatian pilots serving with the JNA, two of which were lost in subsequent actions \u2013 one to Serbian air defenses, the other a friendly fire accident. In 1993, Croatia purchased about 40 MiG-21s in violation of an arms embargo, but only about 20 of these entered service, while the rest were used for spare parts. Croatia used them alongside the sole remaining defector for ground attack missions in operations Flash (during which one was lost) and Storm. The only air-to-air action for Croatian MiGs was an attempt by two of them to intercept Soko J-22 Oraos of Republika Srpska's air force on a ground attack mission on 7 August 1995. After some maneuvering, both sides disengaged without firing.\nThe remaining Yugoslav MiG-21s were flown to Serbia by 1992 and continued their service in the newly created Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, three MiG-21s were destroyed on the ground. The type continued to serve with the Serbian Air Force until 25 September 2020, when the country's last active MiG-21 crashed in the village of Brasina, near Mali Zvornik, killing both pilots. The aircraft, a MiG-21UM that left the assembly line in December 1986, was the last MiG-21 ever produced in the Soviet Union.\nRomania.\nIn 1962, Romanian Air Force (RoAF) received the first 12 MiG-21F-13, followed by another 12 of the same variant in 1963. Deliveries continued over the next years with other variants: 38 aircraft of MiG-21RFM (PF) variant in 1965, 7 MiG-21U-400/600 in 1965\u20131968, 56 MiG-21RFMM (PFM) in 1966\u20131968, 12 MiG-21R in 1968\u20131972, 68 MiG-21M plus 11 MiG-21US in 1969\u20131970, 74 MiG-21MF/MF-75 in 1972\u20131975, and 27 MiG-21UM in 1972\u20131980 plus another 5 of the same variant in 1990, for a total number of 322 aircraft.\nIn 1995\u20132002, a total of 111 MiG-21s were modernized, of which 71 were M and MF/MF-75 variants modernized under the LanceR A designation (for ground attack), 14 were UM variant as LanceR B designation (trainer), and another 26 MF/MF-75 variant were modernized under LanceR C designation (air superiority). Today, only 36 LanceRs are operational for the RoAF. It can use both Western and Eastern armament such as the R-60M, R-73, Magic 2, or Python III missiles.\nThe MiG-21s are to be retired in 2024, after another two F-16 squadrons will be ready following the purchase of 32 more F-16s from Norway. The first F-16 squadron was completed in 2021 with the arrival of the last F-16 purchased from Portugal.\nDespite being one of the newest MiG-21 fleets in service, the Romanian MiG-21 LanceR fleet was grounded due to difficulties maintaining the aircraft, and since 1996 it has had an accident rate of over 30 per 100,000 hours. Serviceability rates below 50% are not uncommon.\nThe Romanian Air Force has suffered numerous events in recent years with its arsenal of MiG-21s. On 12 June 2017, a MiG-21 crashed in Constan\u021ba County, with Adrian Stancu, the pilot, managing to escape in time. On 7 July 2018, Florin Rotaru died during an airshow in Borcea with some 3,000 attendants while piloting a MiG-21 that suffered technical difficulties, choosing to deflect the plane and die to protect the attendants rather than ejecting himself in time. On 20 April 2021, during a training flight, a MiG-21 crashed in an uninhabited zone in Mure\u0219 County. The pilot, Andrei Criste, managed to eject safely and survived the crash.\nOn the March 2nd 2022, A MiG-21 LanceR crashed during adverse weather conditions near the village of Gura Dobrogei, Cogealac Commune. On 15 April 2022, the RoAF suspended all MiG-21 LanceR flights due to the high rate of accidents, and announced that it planned to speed up the acquisition of the ex-Norwegian F-16s. On 23 May, the LanceRs resumed flights for a period of one year, until 15 May 2023. On 15 May 2023, a retirement ceremony was held for the aircraft at the 71st Air Base, and at the 86th Air Base. From there, the MiG-21 took off to their final destination at the 95th Air Base.\nBulgaria.\nThe Bulgarian Air Force received a total of 224 MiG-21 aircraft. From September 1963 the 19th Fighter Regiment of the Air Force received 12 MiG-21F-13s. Later some of these aircraft were converted for reconnaissance as MiG-21F-13Rs, which were submitted to the 26th Reconnaissance Regiment in 1988. In January 1965 the 18th Fighter Regiment received a squadron of 12 MiG-21PFs, some of which also were converted and used as reconnaissance aircraft (MiG-oboznachevnieto 21PFR). The 26 Regiment reconnaissance aircraft from this squadron were removed from service in 1991, the 15 Fighter Regiment in 1965 received another 12 MiG-21PF fighters and in 1977\u20131978 operated another 36 refurbished aircraft. This unit received two more aircraft in 1984 and operated them until 1992.\nFor reconnaissance, a regiment received 26 specialized reconnaissance MiG-21Rs in 1962, and in 1969\u20131970, 19 Fighter Aviation Regiment received 15 MiG-21m aircraft, which operated in 21 Fighter Aviation Regiment and were removed from active service in 1990. An additional 12 MiG-21MF fighters were received in 1974\u20131975, with a reconnaissance version of the MiG-21MFR provided to the 26th Reconnaissance Regiment and used until 2000, when removed from active service.\nFrom 1983 to 1990, the Bulgaria Air Force received 72 MiG-21bis. Of these, 30 (six new and renovated) are under option with ACS and provided to the 19th Fighter Regiment; the rest are equipped with the \"Lazur\".

{"id": "61963", "revid": "43066271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61963", "title": "List of Greek deities", "text": "In ancient Greece, deities were regarded as immortal, anthropomorphic, and powerful. They were conceived of as persons rather than abstract concepts or notions, and were described as being similar to humans in appearance, albeit larger and more beautiful. The emotions and actions of deities were largely the same as those of humans; they frequently engaged in sexual activity, and were jealous and amoral. Deities were considered far more knowledgeable than humans, and it was believed that they conversed in a language of their own. Their immortality, the defining marker of their godhood, meant that they ceased aging after growing to a certain point. In place of blood, their veins flowed with ichor, a substance which was a product of their diet, and conferred upon them their immortality. Divine power allowed the gods to intervene in mortal affairs in various ways: they could cause natural events such as rain, wind, the growing of crops, or epidemics, and were able to dictate the outcomes of complex human events, such as battles or political situations.\nAs ancient Greek religion was polytheistic, a multiplicity of gods were venerated by the same groups and individuals. The identity of a deity was demarcated primarily by their name, which could be accompanied by an epithet (a title or surname). Religious epithets could refer to specific functions of a god, to connections with other deities, or to a divinity's local forms. The Greeks honoured the gods by means of worship, as they believed deities were capable of bringing to their lives positive outcomes outside their own control. Greek cult, or religious practice, consisted of activities such as sacrifices, prayers, libations, festivals, and the building of temples. By the 8th century BC, most deities were honoured in sanctuaries (), sacred areas which often included a temple and dining room, and were typically dedicated to a single deity. Aspects of a god's cult such as the kinds of sacrifices made to them and the placement of their sanctuaries contributed to the distinct conception worshippers had of them.\nIn addition to a god's name and cult, their character was determined by their mythology (the collection of stories told about them) and their iconography (how they were depicted in ancient Greek art). A deity's mythology told of their deeds (which played a role in establishing their functions) and genealogically linked them to gods with similar functions. The most important works of mythology were the Homeric epics, including the \"Iliad\" (c.750\u2013700 BC), an account of a period of the Trojan War, and Hesiod's \"Theogony\" (c. 700 BC), which presented a genealogy of the pantheon. Myths known throughout Greece had different regional versions, which sometimes presented a distinct view of a god according to local concerns. Some myths attempted to explain the origins of certain cult practices, and some may have arisen from rituals. Artistic representations allow us to understand how deities were depicted over time, and works such as vase paintings sometimes substantially predate literary sources. Art contributed to how the Greeks conceived of the gods, and depictions would often assign deities certain symbols, such as the thunderbolt of Zeus or the trident of Poseidon.\nThe principal figures of the pantheon were the twelve Olympians, thought to live on Mount Olympus and to be connected as part of a family. Zeus was considered the chief god of the pantheon, though Athena and Apollo were honoured in a greater number of sanctuaries in major cities, and Dionysus is the deity who has received the most attention in modern scholarship. Beyond the central divinities of the pantheon, the Greek gods were numerous. Some parts of the natural world, such as the earth, sea, or sun, were held as divine throughout Greece, while other natural deities, such as the various nymphs and river gods, were primarily of local significance. Personifications of abstract concepts appeared frequently in Greek art and poetry, though many were also venerated in cult, some as early as the 6th century BC. Groups or societies of deities could be purely mythological in importance, such as the Titans, or they could be the subject of substantial worship, such as the Muses or Charites.\nMajor deities in Greek religion.\nThe following section is structured after Walter Burkert's \"Greek Religion\", particularly his section \"Chapter III: The Gods\".\nTwelve Olympians.\nThe main deities of the Greek pantheon were the twelve Olympians. They were believed to reside on Mount Olympus, from which they derived their name, and were connected as part of a familial group which had Zeus at its head. This family included two generations: the first consisted of children of Cronus and Rhea \u2013 Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia \u2013 and the second consisted of children of Zeus \u2013 Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Hermes, and Dionysus (though Aphrodite and Hephaestus were sometimes said not to be children of Zeus). In myth, the Olympians were preceded by another group of gods, the Titans (among them Cronus and Rhea), who were supplanted by Zeus and the Olympian gods in a war known as the Titanomachy, after which Zeus became ruler of the gods.\nIn cult, the notion of the twelve gods (or ) is first attested in the latter half of the 6th century BC, when the Altar of the Twelve Gods was constructed in Athens. Around the same time, the \"Homeric Hymn to Hermes\" referred to the division of a sacrifice into twelve pieces, and in 484 BC the poet Pindar mentioned the honouring of twelve gods at Olympia. By the Classical period (c.5th\u20134th centuries BC), this idea of twelve gods had become established. Although the Olympians were consistently considered twelve in number, the individual gods which comprised this group of twelve could differ by region; in particular, Hestia and Dionysus were sometimes excluded. Although Hades is the brother of the first-generation Olympians, he was not included among the twelve Olympians owing to his residency in the underworld. In addition to the canonical twelve Olympians, there were numerous other gods generally believed to live on Olympus.\nChthonic deities.\nThe word \"chthonic\" is applied to deities who were believed to inhabit the underworld or to be otherwise subterranean in nature, and who were associated with fertility or the dead. Hades and Persephone, the rulers of the underworld, were the principal chthonic deities. They were not the only gods held as chthonic, though such figures were typically only referenced through allusion and with apprehension.\nNature deities.\nWhile many of the major Greek gods were associated with aspects of nature, various lesser deities are classed as nature gods because they personify particular parts of the natural world. Some such deities stood for parts of nature that played a role in the lives of all people \u2013 such as the earth, sea, sun, moon, and winds \u2013 and so were held as divine throughout Greece (though these gods did not experience the same development in myth and cult as figures such as the Olympians). Other nature deities \u2013 the river gods and nymphs, who represented features of the landscape such as rivers, springs, or mountains \u2013 were individually worshipped only in a specific town or area. They were numerous, and their cults were found throughout the Greek world.\nForeign deities worshipped in Greece.\nGreek poleis (sg.: polis, 'city') were able to adopt new gods fairly easily, a process which involved starting a cult in their honour. Some deities were introduced from abroad (such as Cybele), experiencing some amount of alteration in the process, and others were original creations (such as Serapis) that pulled from existing divinities of different origins. The choice to adopt a new deity was largely pragmatic, and seems to have been decided through the regular political systems of the polis. Which gods were considered \"foreign\" (a designation that could include gods from elsewhere in Greece) was also determined by the authority of the polis.\nThe Greeks thought that different cultures all revered the same set of deities, who were simply known under varying names. Because of this, when the Greeks encountered gods of other cultures, they identified them with their own deities (in a process known as ).\nEarly deities.\nThe following section is structured after the chapter \"1. The Early Gods\" in Timothy Gantz's \"Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources\".\nIn antiquity, the \"Theogony\" (c.700 BC), a work by the Boeotian poet Hesiod, was considered the standard mythological telling of the world's earliest ages. The poem details an extensive genealogy of the gods, and describes the events which led to the current state of the cosmos, under the rule of Zeus. The cosmogonic part of the work, which is fairly brief, begins the account of this mythical history.\nThough Hesiod's poem is the only theogony which is extant in its entirety, during the archaic era (c. 800\u2013480 BC) there existed similar works, ascribed to various legendary or historical writers such as Orpheus, Musaeus, Pherecydes, and Epimenides. Of works outside the theogonic genre, Homeric epic only briefly references the world prior to Zeus's rule, and the 1st\u20132nd-century AD \"Bibliotheca\" of Apollodorus provides an account similar to Hesiod's.\nPrimal elements.\nHesiod's cosmogony begins with Chaos, who is followed by several other primal beings. The poet then details two generations of descendants of Chaos. Later in the poem, he continues his enumeration of her descendants, listing various dismal abstractions who descend from her daughter, Nyx (these figures are listed under ). Of these primordial figures in Hesiod's poem, deities such as Nyx, Aether, and Eros feature in a number of other early cosmogonies.\nDescendants of Gaia and Uranus.\nAside from the descendants of Chaos, all the remaining deities of Hesiod's poem genealogically originate from Gaia (or Earth). On her own, she produces several figures who represent parts of the physical world, including Uranus (or Sky) and Pontus (or Sea), both of whom subsequently mate with her. Together with Uranus, she sits at the head of the family which eventually produces the Olympians; the couple's children include the twelve Titans (listed under ), the youngest of whom, Cronus, castrates his father. The resulting spilt blood and detached genitals lead in time to further offspring.\nDescendants of Gaia and Pontus.\nThe other lineage arising from Gaia is the family she produces with Pontus, which includes figures associated with the sea and an assortment of monsters.\nThe Titans and their descendants.\nThe Titans, the twelve offspring of Uranus and Gaia, are the generation who come before the Olympians. The group consists of six members of each sex: four male-female pairs are married couples, with the remaining two male Titans marrying other goddesses, and the remaining two female Titans later coupling with Zeus. Many of the Titans' descendants relate to the physical world and its organisation. In sources after Hesiod, there is some disagreement as to the names of the twelve Titans, and there are several figures described as Titans beyond the original group of twelve.\nGroups of divinities and nature spirits.\nThe following section is based upon the chapter \"6. Lesser deities and nature-spirits\" in Robin Hard's \"Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology\", and the section \"Minor Divinities\" in Timothy Gantz's \"Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources\".\nAmong the various minor deities are divine groups such as the Muses or Horae. These sorts of divinities are referred to under a collective name, and appear in one another's company. The members of these groups, who are sometimes individually named, are consistently of one sex and are around the same age, though their number often differs by source, as do their names. These divinities often feature in the retinues of major gods, or are otherwise said to accompany such deities; the satyrs and maenads, for example, are among the companions of Dionysus, and the dancing Kouretes surround the infant Zeus. In some cases, these divine groups reflect the existence of real-world religious associations.\nThe various nature spirits, such as the nymphs and satyrs, are inhabitants of different parts of the landscape, and fall somewhere between gods and humans. In antiquity, for example, there was disagreement as to the mortality of nymphs (who were sometimes described as goddesses), though it was seen as evident that they lived long enough to be virtually immortal by human standards. Similarly, whether or not satyrs were immortal seems to have been uncertain in ancient times.\nAbstract personifications.\nNote that abstract personifications listed in previous sections are excluded here.\nThe Greeks often personified abstract concepts and represented them as deities; these concepts ranged from emotions such as love and fear, to forces such as persuasion, luck, and longing, to states such as night, victory, and death. The sex of the resulting deity was dictated by the gender of the personified noun. Such personifications are first attested in Greece in the 8th century BC, with the emergence of epic poetry. They sometimes appear in the retinues of major gods \u2013 for example, Eros and Himeros are companions of Aphrodite \u2013 and they commonly feature in cosmogonies, where these concepts are genealogically linked to one another \u2013 for example, in the \"Theogony\", the progeny of Nyx (Night) includes figures such as Thanatos (Death), Hypnos (Sleep), and Eris (Strife).\nAlthough personifications originated in poetry, some who were more developed in literature were also represented in art. The earliest known artistic depiction of personifications is the Chest of Cypselus (c.600 BC), which was followed in the late 6th century BC by vase paintings. Various personifications from epic poetry later developed cults, the earliest of which are attested in the 6th century BC; by the 4th century BC, there was worship of personifications who had no connection to the epic tradition. Only two personifications, Nemesis and Themis, are known to have been the dedicatees of a sanctuary, which was located in Rhamnous.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61967", "revid": "40568879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61967", "title": "Detonator", "text": "Small explosive device used to trigger a larger explosion\nA detonator is a device used to make an explosive or explosive device explode. Detonators come in a variety of types, depending on how they are initiated (chemically, mechanically, or electrically) and details of their inner working, which often involve several stages. Types of detonators include non-electric and electric. Non-electric detonators are typically stab or pyrotechnic while electric are typically \"hot wire\" (low voltage), exploding bridge wire (high voltage) or explosive foil (very high voltage).\nThe original electric detonators invented in 1875 independently by Julius Smith and Perry Gardiner used mercury fulminate as the primary explosive. Around the turn of the century performance was enhanced in the Smith-Gardiner blasting cap by the addition of 10\u201320% potassium chlorate. This compound was superseded by others: lead azide, lead styphnate, some aluminium, or other materials such as DDNP to reduce the amount of lead emitted into the atmosphere by mining and quarrying operations. They also often use a small amount of TNT or tetryl in military detonators and PETN in commercial detonators.\nHistory.\nThe first blasting cap or detonator was demonstrated in 1745 when British physician and apothecary William Watson showed that the electric spark of a friction machine could ignite black powder, by way of igniting a flammable substance mixed in with the black powder.\nIn 1750, Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia made a commercial blasting cap consisting of a paper tube full of black powder, with wires leading in both sides and wadding sealing up the ends. The two wires came close but did not touch, so a large electric spark discharge between the two wires would fire the cap.\nIn 1832, a hot wire detonator was produced by American chemist Robert Hare, although attempts along similar lines had earlier been attempted by the Italians Volta and Cavallo. Hare constructed his blasting cap by passing a multistrand wire through a charge of gunpowder inside a tin tube; he had cut all but one fine strand of the multistrand wire so that the fine strand would serve as the hot bridgewire. When a strong current from a large battery (which he called a \"deflagrator\" or \"calorimotor\") was passed through the fine strand, it became incandescent and ignited the charge of gunpowder.\nIn 1863, Alfred Nobel realized that although nitroglycerin could not be detonated by a fuse, it could be detonated by the explosion of a small charge of gunpowder, which in turn was ignited by a fuse. Within a year, he was adding mercury fulminate to the gunpowder charges of his detonators, and by 1867 he was using small copper capsules of mercury fulminate, triggered by a fuse, to detonate the nitroglycerin.\nIn 1868, Henry Julius Smith of Boston introduced a cap that combined a spark gap ignitor and mercury fulminate, the first electric cap able to detonate dynamite.\nIn 1875, Smith\u2014and then in 1887, Perry G. Gardner of North Adams, Massachusetts\u2014developed electric detonators that combined a hot wire detonator with mercury fulminate explosive. These were the first generally modern type blasting caps. Modern caps use different explosives and separate primary and secondary explosive charges, but are generally very similar to the Gardner and Smith caps.\nSmith also invented the first satisfactory portable power supply for igniting blasting caps: a high-voltage magneto that was driven by a rack and pinion, which in turn was driven by a T-handle that was pushed downwards.\nElectric match caps were developed in the early 1900s in Germany, and spread to the US in the 1950s when ICI International purchased the Atlas Powder Company, these match caps have become the predominant world standard cap type.\nPurpose.\nThe need for detonators such as blasting caps came from the development of safer secondary and tertiary explosives . Secondary and tertiary explosives are typically initiated by an explosives train starting with the detonator. For safety, detonators and the main explosive device are typically only joined just before use.\nDesign.\nA detonator is usually a multi stage device, with three parts:\nExplosives commonly used as primary in detonators include lead azide, lead styphnate, tetryl, and DDNP. Early blasting caps also used silver fulminate, but it has been replaced with cheaper and safer primary explosives. Silver azide is still used sometimes, but very rarely due to its high price.\nIt is possible to construct a Non Primary Explosive Detonator (NPED) in which the primary explosive is replaced by a flammable but non-explosive mixture that propagates a shock wave along a tube into the secondary explosive. NPEDs are harder to accidentally trigger by shock and can avoid the use of lead.\nAs secondary \"base\" or \"output\" explosive, TNT or tetryl are typically found in military detonators and PETN in commercial detonators.\nWhile detonators make explosive handling safer, they are hazardous to handle since, despite their small size, they contain enough explosive to injure people; untrained personnel might not recognize them as explosives or wrongly deem them not dangerous due to their appearance and handle them without the required care.\nTypes.\nOrdinary detonators usually take the form of ignition-based explosives. While they are mainly used in commercial operations, ordinary detonators are still used in military operations. This form of detonator is most commonly initiated using a safety fuse, and used in non time-critical detonations e.g. conventional munitions disposal. Well known detonators are lead azide [Pb(N3)2], silver azide [AgN3] and mercury fulminate [Hg(ONC)2].\nThere are three categories of electrical detonators: instantaneous electrical detonators (IED), short period delay detonators (SPD) and long period delay detonators (LPD). SPDs are measured in milliseconds and LPDs are measured in seconds. In situations where nanosecond accuracy is required, specifically in the implosion charges in nuclear weapons, exploding-bridgewire detonators are employed. The initial shock wave is created by vaporizing a length of a thin wire by an electric discharge. A new development is a slapper detonator, which uses thin plates accelerated by an electrically exploded wire or foil to deliver the initial shock. It is in use in some modern weapons systems. A variant of this concept is used in mining operations, when the foil is exploded by a laser pulse delivered to the foil by optical fiber.\nA non-electric detonator is a shock tube detonator designed to initiate explosions, generally for the purpose of demolition of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. Instead of electric wires, a hollow plastic tube delivers the firing impulse to the detonator, making it immune to most of the hazards associated with stray electric current. It consists of a small diameter, three-layer plastic tube coated on the innermost wall with a reactive explosive compound, which, when ignited, propagates a low energy signal, similar to a dust explosion. The reaction travels at approximately 6,500\u00a0ft/s (2,000\u00a0m/s) along the length of the tubing with minimal disturbance outside of the tube. Non-electric detonators were invented by the Swedish company Nitro Nobel in the 1960s and 1970s, and launched to the demolitions market in 1973.\nIn civil mining, electronic detonators have a better precision for delays. Electronic detonators are designed to provide the precise control necessary to produce accurate and consistent blasting results in a variety of blasting applications in the mining, quarrying, and construction industries. Electronic detonators may be programmed in millisecond or sub-millisecond increments using a dedicated programming device.\nWireless electronic detonators are beginning to be available in the civil mining market. Encrypted radio signals are used to communicate the blast signal to each detonator at the correct time. While currently expensive, wireless detonators can enable new mining techniques as multiple blasts can be loaded at once and fired in sequence without putting humans in harm's way.\nA number 8 test blasting cap is one containing 2 grams of a mixture of 80 percent mercury fulminate and 20 percent potassium chlorate, or a blasting cap of equivalent strength. An equivalent strength cap comprises 0.40-0.45 grams of PETN base charge pressed in an aluminum shell with bottom thickness not to exceed to 0.03 of an inch (0.762\u00a0mm), to a specific gravity of not less than 1.4\u00a0g/cc, and primed with standard weights of primer depending on the manufacturer.https://\nBlasting caps.\nThe oldest and simplest type of cap, fuse caps are a metal cylinder, closed at one end. From the open end inwards, there is first an empty space into which a pyrotechnic fuse is inserted and crimped, then a pyrotechnic ignition mix, a primary explosive, and then the main detonating explosive charge. The primary hazard of pyrotechnic blasting caps is that for proper usage, the fuse must be inserted and then crimped into place by crushing the base of the cap around the fuse. If the tool used to crimp the cap is used too close to the explosives, the primary explosive compound can detonate during crimping. A common hazardous practice is crimping caps with one's teeth; an accidental detonation can cause serious injury to the mouth. Fuse type blasting caps are still in active use today. They are the safest type to use around certain types of electromagnetic interference, and they have a built in time delay as the fuse burns down.\nSolid pack electric blasting caps use a thin bridgewire in direct contact (hence solid pack) with a primary explosive, which is heated by electric current and causes the detonation of the primary explosive. That primary explosive then detonates a larger charge of secondary explosive. Some solid pack fuses incorporate a small pyrotechnic delay element, up to a few hundred milliseconds, before the cap fires.\nMatch type blasting caps use an electric match (insulating sheet with electrodes on both sides, a thin bridgewire soldered across the sides, all dipped in ignition and output mixes) to initiate the primary explosive, rather than direct contact between the bridgewire and the primary explosive. The match can be manufactured separately from the rest of the cap and only assembled at the end of the process. Match type caps are now the most common type found worldwide.\nThe exploding-bridgewire detonator was invented in the 1940s as part of the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons. The design goal was to produce a detonator which functioned very rapidly and predictably. Both Match and Solid Pack type electric caps take a few milliseconds to fire, as the bridgewire heats up and heats the explosive to the point of detonation. Exploding bridgewire or EBW detonators use a higher voltage electric charge and a very thin bridgewire, .04 inch long, .0016 inch diameter, (1\u00a0mm long, 0.04\u00a0mm diameter). Instead of heating up the explosive, the EBW detonator wire is heated so quickly by the high firing current that the wire actually vaporizes and explodes due to electric resistance heating. That electrically-driven explosion causes the low-density initiating explosive (usually PETN) to detonate, which in turn detonates a higher density secondary explosive (typically RDX or HMX) in many EBW designs. In addition to firing very quickly when properly initiated, EBW detonators are much safer than blasting caps from stray static electricity and other electric current. Enough current will melt the bridgewire, but it cannot detonate the initiator explosive without the full high-voltage high-current charge passing through the bridgewire. EBW detonators are used in many civilian applications where radio signals, static electricity, or other electrical hazards might cause accidents with conventional electric detonators.\nExploding foil initiators (EFI), also known as Slapper detonators are an improvement on EBW detonators. Slappers, instead of directly using the exploding foil to detonate the initiator explosive, use the electrical vaporization of the foil to drive a small circle of insulating material such as PET film or kapton down a circular hole in an additional disc of insulating material. At the far end of that hole is a pellet of high-density secondary explosive. Slapper detonators omit the low-density initiating explosive used in EBW designs and they require much greater energy density than EBW detonators to function, making them inherently safer.\nLaser initiation of explosives, propellants or pyrotechnics has been attempted in three different ways, (1) direct interaction with the HE or Direct Optical Initiation (DOI); (2) rapid heating of a thin film in contact with a HE; and (3) ablating a thin metal foil to produce a high velocity flyer plate that impacts the HE (laser flyer).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If the infection is only with a few worms, there are often no symptoms. In those who are infected with many worms, there may be abdominal pain, fatigue and diarrhea. The diarrhea sometimes contains blood. Infections in children may cause poor intellectual and physical development. Low red blood cell levels may occur due to loss of blood.\nThe disease usually spreads when people eat food or drink water containing these worms' eggs. This may occur when contaminated vegetables are not fully cleaned or cooked. Often these eggs are in the soil in areas where people defecate outside and where untreated human feces is used as fertilizer. These eggs originate from the feces of infected people. Young children playing in such soil and putting their hands in their mouths also become infected easily. The worms live in the large bowel and are about four centimetres in length. Whipworm is diagnosed by seeing the eggs when examining the stool with a microscope. Eggs are barrel-shaped. Trichuriasis belongs to the group of soil-transmitted helminthiases.\nPrevention is by properly cooking food and hand washing before cooking. Other measures include improving access to sanitation such as ensuring use of functional and clean toilets and access to clean water. In areas of the world where the infections are common, often entire groups of people will be treated all at once and on a regular basis. Treatment is with three days of the medication: albendazole, mebendazole or ivermectin. People often become infected again after treatment.\nWhipworm infection affected about 464 million in 2015. It is most common in tropical countries. Those infected with whipworm often also have hookworm and ascariasis infections. These diseases have a large effect on the economy of many countries. Work is ongoing to develop a vaccine against the disease. Trichuriasis is classified as a neglected tropical disease.\nSigns and symptoms.\nLight infestations (&lt;100 worms) frequently have no symptoms. Heavier infestations, especially in small children, can present gastrointestinal problems including abdominal pain and distension, bloody or mucus-filled diarrhea, and tenesmus (feeling of incomplete defecation, generally accompanied by involuntary straining). Mechanical damage to the intestinal mucosa, and toxic, or inflammatory damage to the host's intestines may occur. While appendicitis may be brought on by damage and edema of the adjacent tissue, if there are large numbers of worms or larvae present, it has been suggested that the embedding of the worms into the ileocecal region may also make the host susceptible to bacterial infection. A severe infection with high numbers of embedded worms in the rectum leads to edema, which can cause rectal prolapse, although this is typically only seen in small children. The prolapsed, inflamed, and edematous rectal tissue may even show visible worms.\nPhysical growth delay, weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and anemia (due to long-standing blood loss) are also characteristic of infection, and these symptoms are more prevalent and severe in children. It can cause eosinophilia but it is not common.\nCoinfection of \"T. trichiura\" with other parasites is common and with larger worm burdens can cause both exacerbations of dangerous trichuriasis symptoms such as massive gastrointestinal bleeding (shown to be especially dramatic with coinfection with \"Salmonella typhi\") and exacerbation of symptoms and pathogenesis of the other parasitic infection (as is typical with coinfection with \"Schistosoma mansoni\", in which higher worm burden and liver egg burden is common). Parasitic coinfection with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria is also common, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and helminth coinfection adversely affects the natural history and progression of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and can increase clinical malaria severity. In a study performed in Senegal, infections of soil-transmitted helminths like \"T. trichiura\" (as well as schistosome infections independently) showed enhanced risk and increased the incidence of malaria.\nHeavy infestations may have bloody diarrhea. Long-standing blood loss may lead to iron-deficiency anemia. Vitamin A deficiency may also result due to infection.\nCause.\nTrichuriasis is caused by a parasitic worm also known as a helminth called \"Trichuris trichiura\". It belongs to the genus \"Trichuris\", formerly known as \"Trichocephalus\", meaning hair head, which would be a more accurate name; however the generic name is now \"Trichuris\", which means hair tail (implying that the posterior end of the worm is the attenuated section). Infections by parasitic worms are known as helminthiasis.\nReservoir.\nHumans are the main, but not the only reservoir for \"T. trichiura\". Recent research verified by the application of molecular techniques (PCR) that dogs are a reservoir for \"T. trichiura\", as well as \"T. vulpis\".\nVector.\nNon-biting cyclorrhaphan flies (\"Musca domestica\", \"M. sorbens\", \"Chrysomya rufifacies\", \"C. bezziana\", \"Lucina cuprina\", \"Calliphora vicina\" and \"Wohlfarthia magnifica\") have been found to carry \"Trichuris trichiura\". A study in two localized areas in Ethiopia found cockroaches were carriers for several human intestinal parasites, including \"T. trichiura\".\nTransmission.\nHumans can become infected with the parasite due to ingestion of infective eggs by mouth contact with hands or food contaminated with egg-carrying soil. However, there have also been rare reported cases of transmission of \"T. trichiura\" by sexual contact. Some major outbreaks have been traced to contaminated vegetables (due to presumed soil contamination).\nLife cycle.\nUnembryonated eggs (unsegmented) are passed in the feces of a previous host to the soil. In the soil, these eggs develop into a 2-cell stage (segmented egg) and then into an advanced cleavage stage. Once at this stage, the eggs embryonate and then become infective, a process that occurs in about 15 to 30 days). Next, the infective eggs are ingested by way of soil-contaminated hands or food and hatch inside the small intestine, releasing larvae into the gastrointestinal tract. These larvae burrow into a villus and develop into adults (over 2\u20133 days). They then migrate into the cecum and ascending colon where they thread their anterior portion (whip-like end) into the tissue mucosa and reside permanently for their year-long lifespan. About 60 to 70 days after infection, female adults begin to release unfertilized eggs (oviposit) into the cecum at a rate of 3,000 to 20,000 eggs per day, linking the life cycle to the start.\nMorphology.\nAdult worms are usually long, with females being larger than males as is typical of nematodes. The thin, clear majority of the body (the anterior, whip-like end) is the esophagus, and it is the end that the worm threads into the mucosa of the colon. The widened, pinkish-gray region of the body is the posterior, and it is the end that contains the parasite's intestines and reproductive organs.\n\"T. trichiura\" eggs are prolate spheroids, the shape of the balls used in Rugby and Gridiron football. They are about long and have polar plugs (also known as refractile prominences) at each end.\nDiagnosis.\nA stool ova and parasites exam reveals the presence of typical whipworm eggs. Typically, the Kato-Katz thick-smear technique is used for identification of the \"Trichuris trichiura\" eggs in the stool sample. Trichuria eggs often appear larger and more swollen on Kato-Katz preparation compared to when using other techniques.\nAlthough colonoscopy is not typically used for diagnosis, as the adult worms can be overlooked, especially with an imperfect colon, there have been reported cases in which colonoscopy has revealed adult worms. Colonoscopy can directly diagnose trichuriasis by identification of the threadlike form of worms with an attenuated, whip-like end. Colonoscopy is a useful diagnostic tool, especially in patients infected with only a few male worms and with no eggs presenting in the stool sample.\nTrichuriasis can be diagnosed when \"T. trichiura\" eggs are detected in stool examination. Eggs will appear barrel-shaped and unembryonated, having bipolar plugs and a smooth shell. Rectal prolapse can be diagnosed easily using defecating proctogram and is one of many methods for imaging the parasitic infection. Sigmoidoscopies show characteristic white bodies of adult worms hanging from inflamed mucosa (\"coconut cake rectum\").\nPrevention.\nDeworming.\nLimited access to essential medicine has made the eradication of trichuriasis worldwide challenging. Also, it is a public health concern that rates of post-treatment re-infection need to be determined and addressed to diminish the incidence of untreated re-infection. Lastly, with mass drug administration strategies improved diagnosis, and prompt treatment, the detection of an emergence of antihelminthic drug resistance should be examined.\nMass Drug Administration (preventative chemotherapy) has had a positive effect on the disease burden of trichuriasis in East and West Africa, especially among children, who are at highest risk for infection.\nSanitation.\nInfection can be avoided by proper disposal of human feces, avoiding fecal contamination of food, not eating soil, and avoiding crops fertilized with untreated human feces. Simple and effective proper hygiene such as washing hands and food is recommended for control.\nImproved facilities for feces disposal have decreased the incidence of whipworm. Handwashing before food handling, and avoiding ingestion of soil by thorough washing of food that may have been contaminated with egg-containing soil are other preventive measures. In addition to washing, it is also advisable to peel and/or cook fruits and vegetables. Improvement of sanitation systems, as well as improved facilities for feces disposal, have helped to limit defecation onto soil and contain potentially infectious feces from bodily contact.\nA study in a Brazilian urban centre demonstrated a significant reduction in the prevalence and incidence of soil-transmitted helminthiasis, including trichuriasis, following the implementation of a citywide sanitation program. A 33% reduction in the prevalence of trichuriasis and a 26% reduction in the incidence of trichuriasis was found in a study performed on 890 children ages 7\u201314 years old within 24 different sentinel areas chosen to represent the varied environmental conditions throughout the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Control of soil fertilizers has helped eliminate the potential for contact with human fecal matter and fertilizer in the soil.\nTreatment.\nTrichuriasis is treated with benzimidazole anthelmintic agents such as albendazole or mebendazole, sometimes in conjunction with other medications.\nMebendazole is 90% effective in the first dose. Higher clearance rates can be obtained by combining mebendazole or albendazole with ivermectin. The safety of ivermectin in children under and pregnant women has not yet been established.\nIn people with diarrhea, loperamide may be added to increase the contact time between anthelmintic agents and the parasites. Oral iron supplementation may be useful in treating the iron-deficiency anemia which often accompanies trichuriasis.\nEpidemiology.\nRegions.\nInfection of \"T. trichiura\" is most frequent in areas with tropical weather and poor sanitation practices. Trichuriasis occurs frequently in areas in which untreated human feces is used as fertilizer or where open defecation takes place. Trichuriasis infection prevalence is 50 to 80 percent in some regions of Asia (noted especially in China and Korea) and also occurs in rural areas of the southeastern United States.\nInfection estimates.\n\"T. trichiura\" is the third most common nematode (roundworm) infecting humans. Infection is most prevalent among children, and in North America, infection occurs frequently in immigrants from tropical or sub-tropical regions. It is estimated that 600\u2013800 million people are infected worldwide, with 3.2 billion individuals at risk because they live in regions where this intestinal worm is common.\nHistory.\nThe first written record of \"T. trichiura\" was made by the Italian anatomist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, who identified the presence of the parasite in a case of worms residing in the colon in 1740. An exact morphological description and accurate drawings were first recorded in 1761 by Johann Georg Roederer, a German physician. Soon after, the name \"Trichuris trichiura\" was given to this species.\nSynonyms.\nHuman whipworm, trichocephaliasis, and tricuriasis are all synonyms for trichuriasis, human infection of the \"T. trichiura\" intestinal nematode. In Spanish, trichuriasis is called tricuriasis, while it is known as trichuriose in French and Peitschenwurmbefall in German.\nResearch.\nDevelopment of subunit vaccines requires the identification of protective antigens and their formulation in a suitable adjuvant. \"Trichuris muris\" is an antigenically similar laboratory model for \"T. trichiura\". Subcutaneous vaccination with adult excretory-secretory products (ES) protects susceptible mouse strains from \"T. muris\". Larval stages may contain novel and more relevant antigens which when incorporated in a vaccine induce worm expulsion earlier in infection than the adult worm products. Nematode vaccines marketed to date have been of the irradiated larval type and used exclusively for the treatment of animals. These vaccines are unstable and require annual production, involving the yearly production and sacrifice of donor animals for passage. There has been much interest in producing subunit vaccines against human and agricultural parasites since the early 1980s. Development of subunit vaccines requires the identification of protective antigens and their formulation with a suitable adjuvant to stimulate the immune response appropriately.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is commonly served with fried or breaded seafood dishes including fish and chips, fish sandwiches, fried oysters and calamari.\nTartar sauce developed from eighteenth-century dishes served \"\u00e0 la tartare\", breaded meats and fish paired with pungent cold dressings. Nineteenth-century cookbooks contained yolk-free and mayonnaise-based versions, and writers such as Alexis Soyer and Jules Gouff\u00e9 positioned the sauce within the mayonnaise family. By the early twentieth century Auguste Escoffier presented tartar sauce with fried fish and tied it to steak tartare, while English usage of the term dates to the 1820s.\nRecipe.\nNineteenth-century French cookbooks describe \"sauce tartare\" as a mayonnaise to which pungent condiments and finely chopped aromatics are added. \"La grande cuisine illustr\u00e9e\" (late 19th to early 20th century) defines it as mayonnaise \"augmented with capers, cornichons, tarragon and chervil, and strongly seasoned with mustard, English sauce (Worcestershire) and cayenne.\" In \"Le Guide Culinaire\" (1903), Auguste Escoffier's \"Sauce Tartare\" is built by working hard-boiled egg yolks into a paste, mounting with oil and vinegar, and finishing with a pur\u00e9e of green onion or chives and a little mayonnaise. Escoffier intended the sauce for cold fish, shellfish, meats and poultry.\nHistory.\n18th century early dishes \"\u00e0 la tartare\".\nEighteenth-century cookbooks in French, English, and Polish use \"\u00e0 la tartare\" for dishes of meat or fish that were breaded (or crumbed) and grilled or roasted, typically served with a sharp, cold sauce. The accompanying \"tartar\" sauce in these early sources was an oil and acid emulsion or dressing sharpened with mustard and chopped aromatics, such as shallot or onion, anchovy, pickles and parsley, rather than a true mayonnaise. An English example is Nott's \"Pigeons a la Tartare with cold Sauce\" (1723), mixed from chopped onion or shallot, anchovy and pickles with oil, water, lemon juice and mustard.\nThe earliest English attestations of the term \"sauce tartare\" date from the 1820s.\n\"Tartar sauce\" without yolks or mayonnaise.\nNineteenth-century books record tartar sauce recipes assembled without egg yolk or mayonnaise. \"Manuel de gastronomie\" (1825) gives a version thickened with breadcrumbs. Antoine Beauvilliers's \"L'art du cuisinier\" (1814 edition) lists a tartar sauce without crumbs but likewise not mayonnaise based. Louis-Eustache Audot reproduced the recipe in \"La cuisiniere de la campagne et de la ville\" (1853) and in a Spanish translation (1854), suggesting broad circulation across Europe. An anonymous Polish manual, \"Nowa kuchnia warszawska\" (1838), likewise gives a cold tartar sauce of chopped shallots or onion and tarragon seasoned with mustard, salt, pepper, vinegar and oil, with no yolks. The chef C. P. Robert even contrasted a hot tartar sauce without yolk to a cold yolk-based sauce he labeled \"r\u00e9moulade\".\nEmergence of mayonnaise-based tartar sauce.\nBy the early to mid-19th century, authors also described tartar sauce built from hard-boiled or raw yolks and oil. An Austrian manual (1824) printed \"Senf-Tunke oder Remulade (Sauce Tartare)\" with herbs and yolk. Alexis Soyer's \"The Gastronomic Regeneration\" (1849) gives \"Sauce a la Tartare\" using both cooked and raw yolks with cornichons, capers, parsley and shallot, plus French mustard and cayenne. Polish sources adopted yolk-based versions as well. For example, Jozef Schmidt's \"Kuchnia polska\" (1860) sieved hard-boiled yolks with mustard and oil, adjusted with vinegar and optionally colored green with spinach or garden cress juice.\nIn late-19th-century French practice, tartar sauce was firmly classed among the mayonnaise family. Jules Gouffe's \"Le livre de cuisine\" (1867 and later editions of 1877) listed \"sauce tartare\" alongside related cold sauces, and encyclopedic manuals of the era reinforced the mayonnaise base with chopped cornichons or capers and herbs.\n\"\u00c0 la tartare\" and steak tartare.\nIn classical usage, \"a la tartare\" meant \"served with tartar sauce.\" Auguste Escoffier's \"Beefsteak a la Tartare\" (1903) was defined as the raw chopped beef preparation \"a l'Americaine without the egg yolk on top,\" with \"sauce tartare\" served separately. Escoffier also listed the sauce as a standard accompaniment for fried fish, for example \"Cabillaud frit\". Over the 20th century, the raw-beef dish now generally called \"steak tartare\" evolved independently, while \"sauce tartare\" persisted as a widely used cold mayonnaise sauce.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61974", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61974", "title": "Onobrychis viciifolia", "text": "Plant species in the pea family\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOnobrychis viciifolia, also known as O. sativa or common sainfoin () was an important forage legume in temperate regions until the 1950s. During the Green Revolution it was replaced by high yielding alfalfa and clover species. Due to its anthelmintic properties, common sainfoin is a natural alternative to drugs to control nematode parasitism in the guts of small ruminants. This is the main reason why \"O. viciifolia\" returned to the scientific agenda in recent years.\nBiological, ecological and biochemical properties.\nThe genus \"Onobrychis\" comprises 54 different species of which \"O. viciifolia\" is of greatest agronomic importance. Two different agricultural types of \"O. viciifolia\" are known. The single-cut type is characterized by a vegetative regrowth after cutting and its origin is in Europe. A generative regrowth after cutting is typical for the second or the double-cut type. Originated in the Middle East the double-cut type grows larger than the single-cut type. Compared to other forage legumes both types are weak in competition and their regrowth after mowing is considered to be low. Also the yields of common sainfoin are significantly lower than those of alfalfa and clover.\nIn terms of symbiotic nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere, common sainfoin is not as specific as other legumes. A relatively broad range of rhizobia genera is able to colonize the roots of \"O. viciifolia\".\nThe common sainfoin is an open pollinating plant, mainly pollinated by nectar feeding insects. Therefore, \"O. viciifolia\" is a promising crop to enhance biodiversity within agro-ecosystems. This pollination biology leads to certain difficulties in breeding programs resulting in a low number of registered cultivars.\nThe leaves of common sainfoin contain high levels of condensed tannins. This content can be more than five times higher than in clover species or alfalfa .\nBeneficial aspects in animal production.\nAn animal diet containing common sainfoin is able to reduce nematode (e.g. \"Haemonchus contortus\") parasitism in ruminant\u2019s guts. Due to the high levels of condensed tannins, the fecundity of nematodes and the number of their eggs in the ruminant\u2019s digestive system are reduced. Especially in goat and sheep production systems feeding of \"O. viciifolia\" is a promising alternative or complement to synthetic drugs.\nBesides these anthelmintic properties diets containing common sainfoin can lead to increasing daily weight gains of small ruminants. Also milk quantity and quality of these animals are not negatively affected by \"O. viciifolia\" intake. Furthermore, various studies showed that the voluntary intake of sainfoin was comparable or even higher than the intake of alfalfa or clover species.\nCultivation of \"O. viciifolia\".\nTo reach high levels of condensed tannins common sainfoin should be sown in pure culture. Due to its low competitiveness, weed infestation has to be controlled, especially in the first year. Normally fertilizer applications are not needed to reach satisfying yields. Nevertheless, slurry or phosphate applications can promote initial growth. Pests and diseases are almost never a serious problem.\nFrost and drought tolerance of common sainfoin is higher than in other forage legumes such as alfalfa or different clover species. In contrast, \"O. viciifolia\" is much more intolerant to water logging than other forage legumes. Therefore, clayey soils with a bad drainage should be avoided. Also acidic soils are not appropriate for the cultivation of common sainfoin.\nSeedbed preparation and sowing procedure are done in a similar manner and with the same machinery as for cereal cultivation. Around 800 seeds per square meter should be sown on a weed free seedbed between spring and late summer. In the year of establishment common sainfoin can be cut twice a year. Afterwards up to four cuts per growing season are possible. Careful mowing is important to minimize disintegration losses. Common sainfoin can be stored and fed to animals in the form of hay, pellets or silage.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most of the waterways that fed these falls carved the hanging valleys into steep cascades, but Bridalveil Creek still leaps into the valley from the edge of the precipice, although that edge has moved back into an alcove from the original edge of the valley. While Yosemite Falls seem to also fall into this category, the original course took the Yosemite Creek down a gorge to the west of its current location.\nThe primary source of Bridalveil Fall is Ostrander Lake, some to the south.\nIn a brisk wind, the falling water is often blown sideways, and when the flow is light, it may not reach the ground directly below. Because of this, the Ahwahneechee Native Americans called this waterfall \"Pohono\", which means \"Spirit of the Puffing Wind\". On August 5, 1856, newspaper editor Warren Baer suggested the name Bridalveil Fall, inspired by its delicate, lacy appearance in late summer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61976", "revid": "50724392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61976", "title": "Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier", "text": "Russian and Chinese ship class\nThe \"Kuznetsov\"-class aircraft carrier (), Soviet designation Project 1143.5, is a class of conventionally powered STOBAR aircraft carriers currently operated by the Russian Navy and Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy. Originally designed for the Soviet Navy, the \"Kuznetsov\"-class ships use a ski-jump for launching high-performance fixed-wing jet aircraft and arrestor gears for landing, representing a major advance in Soviet naval aviation design over the previous aircraft cruisers, which did not have full-length flight deck and could only launch VSTOL aircraft. The official classification for the ship class by the Soviet Union and Russian Federation was \"heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser\" (), which permits the ships to transit the Turkish Straits without violating the Montreux Convention. However, the Chinese variants are properly classified as aircraft carriers.\nDue to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the three \"Kuznetsov\"-class ships were built over a protracted period of almost four decades. Two ships were originally laid down at the Nikolayev South Shipyard in the Ukrainian SSR, to be followed by the \"Ulyanovsk\"-class nuclear-powered supercarriers. Only the lead ship had been commissioned when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, and the ship now serves in the Russian Navy. Construction of her sister ship \"Varyag\", which was only two-thirds-complete at the time, was abandoned until 1998, when a now-independent Ukraine sold the uncompleted ship to a Chinese company registered in Macau for use as a floating casino, along with a complete set of design blueprints. After a protracted towed journey through three different oceans, \"Varyag\" arrived at the Dalian Shipyard and was eventually completed and commissioned in 2012 as China's first aircraft carrier, the Type 001 aircraft carrier . China subsequently constructed a third ship to a modified Type 002 design, commissioning in 2019.\nRole.\nThe \"Kuznetsov\"-class ships were described by their Soviet builders as \"Tyazholiy Avianesushchiy Kreyser\" (TAKR or TAVKR) \u2013 \"heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser\" \u2013 intended to support and defend strategic missile-carrying submarines, surface ships, and maritime missile-carrying aircraft of the Soviet fleet. In its fleet defense role, \"Admiral Kuznetsov\"'s P-700 Granit (SS-N-19 NATO reporting name: \"Shipwreck\") anti-ship cruise missiles, 3K95 Kinzhal (\"Gauntlet\") surface-to-air missiles, and Su-33 (\"Flanker-D\") aircraft are its main weapons. The fixed-wing aircraft on \"Kuznetsov\" are intended for air superiority operations to protect a deployed task force. The carrier also carries numerous helicopters for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and search and rescue (SAR) operations.\nTransiting the Turkish Straits.\nBoth the Soviet and Russian naval system classifies the \"Kuznetsov\"-class as a \"heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser\" because it was fitted with long-range anti-ship cruise missiles. Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, aircraft carriers heavier than 15,000 tons may not pass through the Turkish Straits. Since \"Kuznetsov\" far exceeds that displacement limit, it would have been confined to the Black Sea (where the ship class was built) if classified as an aircraft carrier. However, since there is no tonnage restriction on other types of capital ships operated by Black Sea powers, a large \"cruiser\" can pass freely through the Turkish Straits without any nominal violation. Turkey has allowed to pass through the Straits, and no other signatory to the Montreux Convention has objected to its designation as an aircraft cruiser.\nThe Chinese naval classification regards its \"Kuznetsov\"-class ships (known as Type 001 and Type 002) as aircraft carriers. Both the Type 001 and the Type 002 are armed with air-defense weapons, but not equipped with the anti-ship or anti-submarine missiles as on \"Admiral Kuznetsov\". Instead, the hangar was extended to carry more aircraft. When \"Liaoning\" (then known as \"Varyag\", and only completed as an unengined hull) was sold to a Chinese company in Macau (ostensibly to become a floating casino) and due to be towed through the Turkish Strait in June 2000, the Turkish Government denied its access (effectively as an extortion) for 16 months and only relented after Chinese Government promised trade and tourism concessions via diplomacy, and the ship finally passed through both the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles by 2 November 2001.\nHistory.\nIn October 1978 the Soviet government decided to continue the production of additional Project 1143 (\"Kiev\"-class) aircraft carriers, with the fifth vessel built with improved features like catapults and arresting gear. This resulted in the Project 1143.5 (\"Kuznetsov\" class) plan created by the Nevskoye Bureau and approved at the end of 1979. As originally planned, Project 1143.5 was to have a full load displacement of 65,000 tons, CATOBAR capability, and an air wing based around fixed-wing aircraft and Kamov helicopters. However, by 1980 Soviet defense minister Dmitry Ustinov ordered the deletion of the catapults, reduction of the ship's displacement by 10,000 tons, and revision of the air component toward VSTOL aircraft. The design was revised to support only VSTOL aircraft under the project name \"Nitka\", but then was revised again to its final configuration to provide for fixed-wing aircraft by adding a 12-degree ski-jump.\nDesign.\nHull and flight deck.\nThe hull design is derived from the 1982 , but is larger in both length and beam. The \"Kiev\"-class ships had only an angled flight deck, with surface weaponry on the foredeck. The \"Kuznetsov\" class is the first Soviet carrier to be designed with a full-length flight deck. The ship's 12 anti-ship cruise missiles are located in launchers below the flight deck, just aft of the ski-jump.\nThe aircraft carriers are of a STOBAR configuration: Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery. Short take-off is achieved by using a 14-degree ski-jump on the bow. There is also an angled recovery deck with arresting wires, allowing aircraft to land without interfering with launching aircraft. The flight deck has a total area of . Two aircraft elevators, on the starboard side forward and aft of the island, move aircraft between the hangar deck and the flight deck.\nAir wing.\nIn the original project specifications, the ship should be able to carry up to 33 fixed-wing aircraft and 12 helicopters . The primary aircraft carried are Sukhoi Su-33 fighters, naval variants of the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker. Kamov Ka-27 naval utility helicopters (and subsequent variants) make up the helicopter wing, providing anti-submarine, maritime patrol and naval assault mobility capabilities. In addition, the Kamov Ka-52K \"Katran\" attack helicopter, a naval variant of the Kamov Ka-50, can also be included in its air wing.\nArmament.\nThe \"Kuznetsov\"-class ships were originally designed as aircraft cruisers. \"Kuznetsov\" carried twelve launchers for P-700 Granit (SS-N-19 \"Shipwreck\") anti-ship surface-to-surface missiles, which also form the main armament of the s. The Granits were stored in 12 vertical launchers located beneath the ship's front deck, just before the inclined ski-jump. The top deck hatches of these launchers open to fire the missiles; however, when open they prevent the simultaneous launch of aircraft. \"Kuznetsov's\" heavy surface armament differs from that of other countries' aircraft carriers, which carry only defensive armament and rely on their aircraft for strike power.\nFor long-range air defense, \"Kuznetsov\" carries 24 vertical Tor missile system (SA-N-9 \"Gauntlet\") surface-to-air missile launchers, with 192 missiles. For close-range air defense, the ship carries eight Kashtan close-in weapon system (CIWS) mounts. Each mount has two launchers for 9M311 SAMs, twin GSh-30 30\u00a0mm rotary cannons, and a radar/optronic director. The ship also carries six AK-630 30\u00a0mm rotary cannons in single mounts. For defense against underwater attack, the ship carries the UDAV-1 ASW rocket launcher.\nThe Russian Navy reportedly removed the Granit missile tubes in the late 2000s to make room for a larger hangar bay, but it was never clear that the tubes were ever actually removed. During a major overhaul set to begin in September 2017, the P-700 tubes were to be replaced with new vertical launch tubes capable of housing newer Kalibr and P-800 Oniks cruise missiles. Air defense upgrades would include replacement of the Kashtan CIWS with the Pantsir-M and the 3K95 Kinzhal/Tor system with the Poliment-Redut system.\nElectronics.\n\"Admiral Kuznetsov\" has D/E band air and surface target acquisition radar (passive electronically scanned array), F band surface search radar, G/H band flight control radar, I band navigation radar, and four K band fire-control radars for the Kashtan CIWS.\nThe ship has hull-mounted medium- and low-frequency search and attack sonar. The ASW helicopters have surface search radar, dipping sonar, sonobuoys, and magnetic anomaly detectors.\nPropulsion and performance.\n\"Admiral Kuznetsov\" is conventionally powered by mazut fuelled steam boilers which feed four steam turbines, each producing , driving four shafts with fixed-pitch propellers. The maximum speed is , and her range at maximum speed is . At , her maximum economical range is .\nReliability.\n\"Admiral Kuznetsov\" has been plagued by years of technical problems. The vessel's steam turbines and turbo-pressurised boilers have been reported to be so unreliable that the carrier is accompanied by a large ocean-going tug whenever it deploys, in case it breaks down. There are also flaws in the water piping system, which causes it to freeze during winter. To prevent pipes from bursting, the water is turned off in most of the cabins, and half the latrines do not work.\nType 001 design changes.\nThe Chinese Type 001 ships are configured as aircraft carriers. The cruise missile launchers were never installed, and the launcher base was removed during the refit to incorporate a larger hangar bay. The air-defense system consists of FL-3000N surface-to-air-missiles and the Type 1130 CIWS.\nType 002 design changes.\nSeveral design changes were made to the Type 002 aircraft carrier. Length, width, and displacement have been slightly increased. The island of the ship has been reduced in size to increase the size of the flight deck, and it carries a 3-D phased array radar. The ship is claimed to carry 36 aircraft instead of the 24 J-15 fighters carried by \"Liaoning\".\nShips.\n\"Admiral Kuznetsov\".\n\"Admiral Flota Sovetskogo Soyuza Kuznetsov\" was designed by the Neva Design Bureau, St. Petersburg, and built at the Nikolayev South Shipyard (Chernomorskoye Shipyard) in the Ukrainian SSR. She was launched in 1985, commissioned in 1990, and became fully operational in 1995. The vessel was named \"Riga\", \"Leonid Brezhnev\", and \"Tbilisi\", before finally being named after Soviet admiral Nikolay Kuznetsov.\nDuring the winter of 1995\u20131996, \"Admiral Kuznetsov\" deployed to the Mediterranean Sea to mark the 300th anniversary of the Russian Navy. In late 2000, \"Admiral Kuznetsov\" went to sea for recovery and salvage operations for the submarine . In late 2007 and early 2008, \"Admiral Kuznetsov\" again deployed to the Mediterranean. Most recently, \"Admiral Kuznetsov\" was deployed to the Mediterranean in late 2016 and early 2017 to support Russian operations in Syria.\n\"Admiral Kuznetsov\" started an overhaul and modernization program in the first quarter of 2017 to extend its service life by 25 years, but several setbacks have hampered this effort. Prior to a December 2022 fire the overhaul of the carrier was projected to last into 2024.\n the non-operational \"Admiral Kuznetsov\" is the Russian Navy's only carrier leaving the Russian Navy without an operational aircraft carrier. Reports that the \"Admiral Kuznetsov\"'s crew of 1500 has been reassigned to the Russian Army for combat duty in Ukraine have fueled speculation that there is no plan to make \"Admiral Kuznetsov\" seaworthy again.\n\"Liaoning\".\nThe second member of the \"Kuznetsov\" class took a much more roundabout route to active service. Known first as \"Riga\" and then \"Varyag\", she was laid down by the Nikolayev South Shipyard in 1985 and launched in 1988. \"Varyag\" had not yet been commissioned when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, and the ship was left to deteriorate in the elements. In 1998, the unfinished hull was sold by Ukraine to what was apparently a Chinese travel agency for ostensible use as a floating hotel and casino. After an eventful journey under tow, she arrived in China in February 2002 and was berthed at the Dalian naval shipyard, where she was overhauled and completed as the first operational ship of the Chinese aircraft carrier programme.\nIn September 2012, the ship was commissioned in the People's Liberation Army Navy as \"Liaoning\". The ship was named after the province where the shipyard is located, and its Chinese ship class is Type 001. Today, she serves as the first aircraft carrier of the PLAN, and its home port is Qingdao.\n\"Shandong\".\nThe second Chinese aircraft carrier was constructed in China according to a modified design, known as Type 002. The ship was laid down in 2013 at the Dalian naval shipyard and was launched on 26 April 2017. Sea trials began on 13 May 2018, and the ship was commissioned as \"Shandong\" on 17 December 2019.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

About 206 species are presently accepted. The Flora Europaea lists 23 species of \"Onobrychis\"; the main centre of diversity extends from Central Asia to Iran, with 56 species \u2013 27 of which are endemic \u2013 in the latter country alone. \"O.\u00a0viciifolia\" is naturalized throughout many countries in Europe and North America grasslands on calcareous soils.\nDescription.\nThe leaves are pinnate, alternate, with 6 to 14 pairs of oblong to linear leaflets. Sainfoins have pale pink flowers, typically blooming between June and September and pollinated by honey bees and solitary bees. The rounded single-seeded pods bear prominent spikes or similar protrusions in many species, enabling them to cling to the fur of large mammals and be thus distributed.\nTaxonomy.\nList of species.\nThe following species are considered at least provisionally valid by the International Legume Database &amp; Information Service; some notable subspecies are also listed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEtymology.\n\"Onobrychis\" means \"devoured by donkeys\", from Ancient Greek (, \"donkey\") and (, \"to eat greedily\"). This refers to sainfoin's good properties as a forage plant for large mammalian herbivores.\n\"Sainfoin\" is derived from Old French (\"healthy hay\"). In the words of the 16th-century soil scientist Olivier de Serres:\n\"The herb is called in France, in Italy , in Provence and the Languedoc . From the inordinate praise the plant has been given, for its medical virtues and for fattening the livestock that graze on it, comes the term .\"\nIn northern European languages that have been less influenced by French, the plants' name usually derives from , the Proven\u00e7al term for the similar-looking and closely related sweetvetches (\"Hedysarum\"). Examples are Danish , Dutch , German , Lithuanian , Polish , Russian ' () and Swedish . Meanwhile, the Occitan name of sainfoin, , has in many languages come to mean species of the related genus \"Medicago\", in particular Alfalfa (\"M. sativa\").\nThe native name of the cock's head (\"O. caput-galli\") is one of the few words of the extinct Dacian language that have been recorded. The Dacians called this plant or .\nDistribution and habitat.\nSainfoins are mostly subtropical plants, but their range extends throughout Europe as far north as southern Sweden. These plants grow on grassland, agricultural land and wasteland.\nEcology.\n\"Onobrychis\" species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species, such as the case-bearer moth \"Coleophora colutella\" (recorded on \"O. saxatilis\") and the Damon Blue (\"Polyommatus damon\") butterfly.\nUses.\nThese highly nutritious plants were an important forage for heavy working horses in agriculture, and are still an excellent source of nectar for honey production as well as pollen for bee food. Because sainfoins are rich in tannins which protect proteins from hydrolysis in the rumen, the proteins are instead absorbed in the abomasum. \"Onobrychis\" typically have a deep taproot and so are very drought resistant, but do not recover well from overgrazing. Adapted to slow but steady growth in the arid steppe belt of Eurasia, sainfoins are difficult to establish as pasture, are not persistent in grassland, and only yield one crop of hay or seeds per year. Thus they are seldom grown in any significant extent, though \"O. viciifolia\" is met with somewhat more regularly.\nNutrition.\nSainfoin provides a superb forage for grazing animals and voluntary intake of sainfoin by cattle and sheep is 20% higher than for grass. Unlike many other legumes, it is non-bloating and is known to have anthelmintic properties, so reducing the problems associated with livestock worms. Sainfoin contains condensed tannins, and it is these that protect animals against bloat. Sainfoin has also been shown to increase protein absorption. This, combined with its other health benefits, mean that animals grazing sainfoin have very rapid liveweight gains, so young stock can be finished sooner and with very good carcass grades. Sainfoin is therefore extremely useful to low input and organic farmers. Yields can be very high at around 16t DM per hectare.\nMethods and research techniques have been studied and developed to look specifically at Sainfoin polyphenols which include tannins and flavonoids. There are significant differences between Sainfoin types and this will lead to further development of Sainfoin plant breeding.\nOne method for improving nitrogen utilisation by ruminants and reduce greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O), without altering their nitrogen and energy value, is to use forages that contain condensed tannins, such as sainfoin. The nutritive value of sainfoin, despite its lower nitrogen content than lucerne, is high. Future research, on the nutritional impact of condensed tannins is likely not only be based on condensed tannin content, but also include structure-activity considerations. The results obtained, with sheep at maintenance fed a diet containing only sainfoin will be tested with producing animals, for example growing sheep and cattle, lactating ewes, goats or cows. In producing animals the diet will comprise different forage sources and supplement feeds.\nSainfoin is seldom used as a pure crop and is generally introduced in pasture in a grass-legume mix with cocksfoot (\"Dactylis\"), ryegrass (\"Lolium\") or with other legumes such as red clover, white clover or lucerne. Results have shown the choice of the variety is important. A variety like Esparcette, characterised by the highest condensed tannin content, may provide beneficial effects with a lower proportion in a mixture with other legumes. Preserving legumes, as silage, is a good way to provide an on-farm source of home-grown energy and protein, offers advantages over traditional haymaking, being less weather-dependent, and allows a high quality of forage during the harvesting period. In particular, wrapped silage bales of sainfoin have great potential in animal nutrition and can be used by farmers, as found that condensed tannin effects were not reduced by this mode of preservation.\nIn culture.\nIn George Orwell's \"Coming Up for Air\", travelling salesman George Bowling regularly reminisces about the smell of sainfoin in his father's seed shop in Lower Binfield.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the oldest city in the South Island and the second-oldest settled city in the country; it was established in 1841 and became a city by British royal charter in 1858.\nNelson City is bordered to the west and south-west by the Tasman District and to the north-east, east and south-east by the Marlborough District. The Nelson urban area has a population of 50,800, making it New Zealand's 15th most populous urban area.\nNelson is well known for its thriving local arts and crafts scene; each year, the city hosts events popular with locals and tourists alike, such as the Nelson Arts Festival.\nNaming.\nNelson was named in honour of Admiral Horatio Nelson, who defeated both the French and Spanish fleets at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Many roads and public areas around the city are named after people and ships associated with that battle. Inhabitants of the city are referred to as Nelsonians; Trafalgar Street is its main shopping axis.\nNelson's M\u0101ori name, , means 'construct', 'raise', or 'establish'.\nIn an article to \"The Colonist\" newspaper on 16 July 1867, Francis Stevens described Nelson as \"The Naples of the Southern Hemisphere\". Today, Nelson is nicknamed \"Sunny Nelson\" due to its high sunshine hours per year and the \"Top of the South\" because of its geographic location.\nIn New Zealand Sign Language, the name is signed by putting the index and middle fingers together which are raised to the nose until the fingertips touch the nose, then move the hand forward so that the fingers point slightly forward away from oneself.\nHistory.\nM\u0101ori settlement.\nSettlement of Nelson began about 700 years ago by M\u0101ori. There is evidence that the earliest settlements in New Zealand were around the Nelson\u2013Marlborough regions. Some of the earliest recorded iwi in the Nelson district are Ng\u0101ti H\u0101wea, Ng\u0101ti Wairangi, Waitaha and K\u0101ti M\u0101moe. Waitaha people developed the land around the Waimea Gardens, are believed to have been the first people to quarry argillite in around Nelson. They also developed much of the Waimea Gardens complex \u2013 more than on the Waimea Plains near Nelson. In the early 1600s, Ng\u0101ti T\u016bmatak\u014dkiri displaced other te Tau Ihu M\u0101ori, becoming the dominant tribe in the area until the early 1800s. Raids from northern tribes in the 1820s, led by Te Rauparaha and his Ng\u0101ti Toa, soon decimated the local population and quickly displaced them.\nToday there are eight mutually recognised tribes of the northwestern region: Ng\u0101ti Kuia, Ng\u0101ti Apa ki te R\u0101 T\u014d, Rangit\u0101ne, Ng\u0101ti Toarangatira, Ng\u0101ti Koata, Ng\u0101ti R\u0101rua, Ng\u0101ti Tama and Te Atiawa o Te Waka-a-M\u0101ui.\nNew Zealand Company.\nPlanning.\nThe New Zealand Company in London planned the settlement of Nelson. They intended to buy from the M\u0101ori some of land, which they planned to divide into one thousand lots and sell to intending settlers. The company earmarked profits to finance the free passage of artisans and labourers, with their families, and for the construction of public works. However, by September 1841 only about one third of the lots had sold. Despite this, the colony pushed ahead, and land was surveyed by Frederick Tuckett.\nThree ships, the \"Arrow\", \"Whitby\", and \"Will Watch\", sailed from London, the expedition commanded by Captain Arthur Wakefield. Arriving in New Zealand, they discovered that the new Governor of the colony, William Hobson, would not give them a free hand to secure vast areas of land from the M\u0101ori or indeed to decide where to site the colony. However, after some delay, Hobson allowed the company to investigate the Tasman Bay area at the north end of the South Island. The Company selected the site now occupied by Nelson City because it had the best harbour in the area. But it had a major drawback: it lacked suitable arable land; Nelson City stands right on the edge of a mountain range while the nearby Waimea Plains amount to only about , less than one third of the area required by the Company plans.\nThe Company secured land, which was not clearly defined, from the M\u0101ori for \u00a3800: it included Nelson, Waimea, Motueka, Riwaka and Whakapuaka. This allowed the settlement to begin, but the lack of definition would prove the source of much future conflict. The three colony ships sailed into Nelson Haven during the first week of November 1841. When the first four immigrant ships \u2013 \"Fifeshire\", \"Mary-Ann\", \"Lord Auckland\" and \"Lloyds\" \u2013 arrived three months later, they found the town already laid out with streets, some wooden houses, tents and rough sheds. The town was laid out on a grid plan. Within 18 months, the company had sent out 18 ships with 1,052 men, 872 women and 1,384 children. However, fewer than ninety of the settlers had the capital to start as landowners.\nCultural and religious immigrants.\nThe early settlement of Nelson province included a proportion of German immigrants, who arrived on the ship \"Sankt Pauli\" and formed the nucleus of the villages of Sarau (Upper Moutere) and Neudorf. These were mostly Lutheran Protestants with a small number of Bavarian Catholics.\nIn 1892, the New Zealand Church Missionary Society (NZCMS) was formed in a Nelson church hall.\nProblems with land.\nAfter a brief initial period of prosperity, the lack of land and of capital caught up with the settlement and it entered a prolonged period of relative depression. The labourers had to accept a cut in their wages. Organised immigration ceased (a state of affairs that continued until the 1850s). By the end of 1843, artisans and labourers began leaving Nelson; by 1846, some 25% of the immigrants had moved away.\nThe pressure to find more arable land became intense. To the south-east of Nelson lay the wide and fertile plains of the Wairau Valley. The New Zealand Company tried to claim that they had purchased the land. The M\u0101ori owners stated adamantly that the Wairau Valley had not formed part of the original land sale, and made it clear they would resist any attempts by the settlers to occupy the area. The Nelson settlers led by Arthur Wakefield and Henry Thompson attempted to do just that. This resulted in the Wairau Affray, where 22 settlers and 4 M\u0101ori died. The subsequent Government inquiry exonerated the M\u0101ori and found that the Nelson settlers had no legitimate claim to any land outside Tasman Bay. Public fears of a M\u0101ori attack on Nelson led to the formation of the Nelson Battalion of Militia in 1845.\nCity status.\nNelson township was managed by the Nelson Provincial Council through a Board of Works constituted by the Provincial Government under the Nelson Improvement Act 1856 until 1874. It was proclaimed a Bishop's See and city under letters patent by Queen Victoria on 27 September 1858, the second New Zealand city proclaimed in this manner after Christchurch. Nelson only had some 5,000 residents at this time. Edmund Hobhouse was the first Bishop. The Municipal Corporations Act 1876 stated that Nelson was constituted a city on 30 March 1874.\nNelson Province.\nFrom 1853 until 1876, when provincial governments were abolished, Nelson was the capital of Nelson Province. The province itself was much larger than present-day Nelson City and included all of the present-day Buller, Kaik\u014dura, Marlborough, Nelson, and Tasman, as well as the Grey District north of the Grey River and the Hurunui District north of the Hurunui River. The Marlborough Province split from Nelson Province in October 1859.\nProvincial anniversary.\nNelson Anniversary Day is a public holiday observed in the northern half of the South Island of New Zealand, being the area's provincial anniversary day. It is observed throughout the historic Nelson Province, even though the provinces of New Zealand were abolished in 1876. The modern area of observation includes all of Nelson City and includes all of the present-day Buller, Kaik\u014dura, Marlborough, Tasman districts as well as the Grey District north of the Grey River / M\u0101wheranui and the Hurunui District north of the Hurunui River. The holiday usually falls on the Monday closest to 1 February, the anniversary of the arrival of the first New Zealand Company boat, the \"Fifeshire\", on 1 February 1842.\nAnniversary celebrations in the early years featured a sailing regatta, horse racing, running races, shooting and ploughing matches. In 1892, the Nelson Jubilee Celebration featured an official week-long programme with church services, sports, concerts, a ball and a grand display of fireworks.\nTime gun.\nIn 1858, the Nelson Provincial Council erected a time gun at the spot on Brittania Heights where Captain Wakefield erected his flagpole in 1841. The gun was fired each Saturday at noon to give the correct time. The gun is now preserved as a historical relic and the Songer Tree marks the site on Signal Hill of the original flagpole.\nGeography.\nThe Nelson-Tasman area comprises two unitary authorities \u2013 Nelson City, administered by the Nelson City Council, and Tasman District, administered by the Tasman District Council, based in Richmond to the southwest. It is between Marlborough, another unitary authority, to the east, and the West Coast Regional Council to the west. The Nelson City territorial authority area is small, at only .\nFor at least two decades, there has been talk about amalgamating Nelson City and the Tasman District to streamline and render more financially economical the existing co-operation between the two councils, exemplified by the jointly owned Port Nelson and the jointly funded Nelson Regional Development Agency. However, an official poll conducted in April 2012 showed nearly three-quarters of those who voted in Tasman were opposed to the proposal, while a majority of Nelson voters were in favour.\nNelson has beaches and a sheltered harbour. The harbour entrance is protected by a Boulder Bank, a natural, bank of rocks transported south from Mackay Bluff via longshore drift. The bank creates a perfect natural harbour which enticed the first settlers, although the entrance was narrow. The wreck of the \"Fifeshire\" on Arrow Rock (now called Fifeshire Rock in memory of this disaster) in 1842 proved the difficulty of the passage. A cut was later made in the bank in 1906 which allowed larger vessels access to the port.\nThe creation of Rocks Road around the waterfront area after the T\u0101hunanui slump in 1892 increased the effects of the tide on Nelson city's beach, T\u0101hunanui, and removed sediment. This meant the popular beach and adjoining car park were being eroded (plus the sand dunes) so a project to replace these sands was put in place and has so far proved a success, with the sand rising a considerable amount and the dunes continuing to grow.\nWaterways.\nThe Nelson territorial authority area has four main waterways, the Whangamoa, Wakapuaka, Maitai and Roding Rivers. The Roding River, the southernmost in Nelson, rises in the hills between Mount Meares and Dun Mountain. From there it flows westward before entering the Tasman District where it eventually joins the Waimea River, which flows into Waimea Inlet near Moturoa / Rabbit Island. The Maitai River flows westward from the Dun Mountain area into the town centre of Nelson before entering the Nelson Haven then Tasman Bay via 'The Cut'. Major tributaries of the Maitai River are: York and Brook Streams plus Sharland, Packer, Groom, Glen, Neds, Sclanders, Beauchamp and Mill Creeks. The Wakapuaka River, which flows north from the Saddle Hill area to its mouth at Cable Bay in North Nelson, has two main tributaries, the Lud and Teal Rivers. Entering Tasman Bay near Kokorua in the north of Nelson, the Whangamoa River is the longest waterway in Nelson. Smaller waterways in the south of Nelson include: Saxton Creek, Orchard Stream, Poorman Valley Stream, Arapiki Stream, Jenkins Creek and Maire Stream.\nCentral city.\nThe central city of Nelson, also referred to as the central business district (CBD), is bounded by Halifax Street to the north, Rutherford Street to the west, Collingwood Street to the east, and Selwyn Place to the south. Other major streets within the CBD include Trafalgar Street, Bridge Street and Hardy Street.\nSuburbs and localities.\nThere are 30 recognised suburbs and localities in Nelson City as of 2025.\nSuburbs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLocalities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Nelson commuter belt extends to Richmond, Brightwater, Hope, M\u0101pua and Wakefield in the Tasman District.\nClimate.\nNelson has a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb), with cool winters and warm summers. Nelson has rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year and has fewer frosts due to the highly marine geography of New Zealand. Winter is the stormiest time, where gales and storms are more common. Nelson has one of the sunniest climates of all major New Zealand centres, earning the nickname 'Sunny Nelson' with an annual average total of over 2400 hours of sunshine. The highest recorded temperature in Nelson is , the lowest .\n\"Centre of New Zealand\" monument.\nNelson has a monument on Botanical Hill, near the centre of the city. The walk to this is called the \"Centre of New Zealand walk\". Despite the name, this monument does not mark the actual geographic centre of New Zealand.\nInstead, the monument marks the \"zero, zero\" point to which the first geodetic surveys of New Zealand were referenced. These surveys were started in the 1870s by John Spence Browning, the Chief Surveyor for Nelson. From this 360-degree viewpoint, survey marks in neighbouring regions (including Wellington in the North Island) could be triangulated and the local surveys connected.\nIn 1962, Ian Reilly from the now defunct Department of Scientific and Industrial Research calculated the geographic centre of New Zealand (including Stewart Island and some smaller islands in addition to the North and South Island, but excluding the Chathams) to be in a forest in Spooners Range southwest of Nelson at .\nOwing to the coarse nature of the underlying data (use of rectangular areas of 7.5 minutes of arc on each side), the centre calculated by Reilly has quite large error margins. Recalculating the result with more modern and accurate data shows the geographic centre of New Zealand is approximately 60\u00a0km southwest of Nelson, in the Big Bush Conservation Area north of Saint Arnaud, New Zealand.\nDemographics.\nNelson covers and had an estimated population of 54,300 as of June 2025, with a population density of people per km2.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNelson City had a population of 52,584 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,704 people (3.3%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 6,147 people (13.2%) since the 2013 census.

This is different from most other local authorities in New Zealand. More often, a regional council is a separate organisation with several territorial authorities (city or district councils) within its borders. Other unitary authorities are the Auckland Council, Gisborne District Council, Marlborough District Council, Tasman District Council and the Chatham Islands Council.\nThe Nelson City Council holds elections for the mayor of Nelson and 12 councillors under the STV electoral system every three years. As of 12 October 2025, the mayor is Nick Smith.\nNelson City has a coat of arms, obtained in 1958 from the College of Arms to mark the centenary of Nelson as a city. The blazon of the arms is:\n\"Barry wavy Argent and Azure a Cross Flory Sable on a Chief also Azure a Mitre proper And for the Crest on a Wreath of the Colours Issuant from a Mural Crown proper a Lion rampant Gules holding between the fore paws a Sun in splendour or. The supporters on the dexter side a Huia Bird and on the sinister side a Kotuku both proper.\"\nMotto \"Palmam qui meruit ferat\" (Let him who has earned it bear the palm). This motto is the same as that of Lord Nelson.\nNational.\nNelson is covered by the Nelson general electorate, and the Te Tai Tonga M\u0101ori electorate, which covers the entire South Island and part of Wellington in the North Island. Since the 2023 general election, Nelson is held by Rachel Boyack of the Labour Party, and Te Tai Tonga by T\u0101kuta Ferris of Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori.\nEconomy.\nThe Nelson economy (and that of the neighbouring Tasman District) is based on the 'big five' industries; seafood, horticulture, forestry, farming and tourism. Port Nelson is the biggest fishing port in Australasia. There are also a range of growth industries, including art and craft, aviation, engineering technology, and information technology. The region was sixth in terms of GDP growth in the 2007\u201310 period.\nThe combined sub-national GDP of Nelson and Tasman District was estimated at $3.4\u00a0billion in 2010, 1.8% of New Zealand's national GDP.\nThe Nelson Regional Development Agency is an economic development agency for Nelson and the Tasman District.\nSome of the region's largest companies and employers are:\nFormer regional airline Air Nelson had its headquarters and maintenance base at Nelson Airport.\nIn 2013, Nelson Mayor Aldo Miccio worked on a proposal that would see Australian call centres for companies such as Gen-i and Xero relocated to Nelson. The plan was in response to Australian companies moving call and contact centres out of Asia because their Australian customers preferred English-speaking centres. If the plan was successful, Miccio expected 100 to 300 jobs paying NZ$50,000-plus in the first year to be created in Nelson.\nTourism.\nNelson is a gateway for tourists and visitors exploring the Abel Tasman, Kahurangi, and Nelson Lakes National Parks, and the Great Taste Trail, and popular walks such as the Abel Tasman Coast Track, and Heaphy Track.\nIt is a centre for both ecotourism and adventure tourism and has a high reputation among caving enthusiasts due to several prominent cave systems around Takaka Hill and the Wharepapa / Arthur Range, including the Nettlebed Cave and some of the largest and deepest explored caverns in the Southern Hemisphere.\nCulture and the arts.\nAs the major regional centre, the city offers many lodgings, restaurants, and unique speciality shopping such as at the Jens Hansen Goldsmiths where \"The One Ring\" in \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy was designed.\nArchitecture.\nUnlike many towns and cities in New Zealand, Nelson has retained many Victorian buildings in its historic centre. The South Street area has been designated as having heritage value.\nThe tallest building is the tall Rutherford Hotel located on the west edge of Trafalgar Square.\nMarae.\nWhakat\u016b Marae, in the suburb of Atawhai, is the \"marae\" (meeting ground) of Ng\u0101ti Kuia, Ng\u0101ti K\u014data, Ng\u0101ti R\u0101rua, Ng\u0101ti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu, Ng\u0101ti Toa Rangatira and Te Atiawa o Te Waka-a-M\u0101ui. It includes the K\u0101k\u0101ti \"wharenui\" (meeting house). In October 2020, the Government committed $240,739 from the Provincial Growth Fund to restore the marae, creating an estimated 9 jobs.\nMuseums.\nFounders Heritage Park is an interactive park that shows the history of Nelson. The park is set up as a village filled with buildings set in a historical time, including well established gardens. Throughout the park, there are stories to be learned about the history of this town. It houses a number of groups with historical themes, including transport.\nThe Nelson Provincial Museum houses a collection of locally significant artefacts. The Nelson Classic Car Museum houses a collection of collectable cars.\nParks and zoo.\nNelson has a large number and variety of public parks and reserves maintained at public expense by Nelson City Council. Major reserves include Grampians Reserve, close to the suburb of Braemar, and the botanical Reserve in the east of Nelson, close to The Wood.\nNatureland Wildlife Trust (formerly Natureland Zoological Park) is a small zoological facility close to T\u0101hunanui Beach. The facility is popular with children, where they can closely approach: monkeys (black-capped capuchins, cotton-top tamarins and pygmy marmosets), lemurs, meerkats, agoutis, porcupines, llamas and alpacas, Kune Kune pigs and peacocks. There are also green iguanas, tropical fish, k\u0101k\u0101s, keas and other birds including in a walk through aviary. Although the zoo nearly closed in 2008, the Orana Wildlife Trust took over its running instead. It looked like a bright future ahead for Natureland and its staff, but since the repeated earthquakes in Christchurch in 2011 and the damage to Orana Park, Orana Wildlife Trust are uncertain of the future of Natureland.\nOrana Wildlife Trust have since pulled out of Natureland, which is now run independently.\nSymphony orchestra.\nNelson Symphony Orchestra is a regional symphony orchestra that was originally known as the Nelson School of Music Orchestra, and was established in 1966. It became an independent Incorporated Society in 1995, and has been performing as the Nelson Symphony Orchestra since then.\nEvents and festivals.\nSeveral major events take place:\nThe annual World of Wearable Art Awards was founded in Nelson in 1987 by Suzie Moncrieff. The first show was held at the restored William Higgins cob cottage in Spring Grove, near Brightwater. The show moved to Wellington in 2005 when it became too big to hold in Nelson. A local museum showcased winning designs alongside their collection of classic cars until the venture was forced to close because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The classic car museum re-opened in 2020.\nSister cities.\nNelson has sister city relationships with:\nInfrastructure and services.\nHealthcare.\nThe main hospital in Nelson is the Nelson Hospital. It is the seat of the Nelson Marlborough District Health Board.\nThe Manuka Street Hospital is a private institution.\nLaw enforcement.\nThe Nelson Central Police Station, located in St John Street, is the headquarters for the Tasman Police District. The Tasman Police District has the lowest crime rate within New Zealand.\nSeveral gangs have established themselves in Nelson. They include the now disbanded Lost Breed and the Red Devils a support club for the Hells Angels. The Rebels Motorcycle Club also has a presence in the wider Nelson-Tasman area.\nElectricity.\nThe Nelson City Municipal Electricity Department (MED) established the city's public electricity supply in 1923, with electricity generated by a coal-fired power station at Wakefield Quay. The city was connected to the newly commissioned Cobb hydroelectric power station in 1944 and to the rest of the South Island grid in 1958. The grid connection saw the Wakefield Quay power station was relegated to standby duty before being decommissioned in 1964.\nToday, Nelson Electricity operates the local distribution network in the former MED area, which covers the CBD and inner suburbs, while Network Tasman operates the local distribution network in the outer suburbs (including Stoke, T\u0101hunanui and Atawhai) and rural areas.\nTransport.\nAir transport.\nNelson Airport is at Annesbrook, an industrial suburb southwest of the central city. It operates a single terminal and runway. About a million passengers use the airport annually and it was the fifth-busiest airport in New Zealand by passenger numbers in 2024. It is primarily used for domestic flights, with regular flights to and from Auckland, Christchurch, Hamilton, Kapiti Coast, Palmerston North and Wellington. Sounds Air offers flights to and from Wellington. In 2006, it received restricted international airport status to facilitate small private jets.\nThe airport was home to Air Nelson, which operated and maintained New Zealand's largest domestic airline fleet, and is now merged into Air New Zealand. It was also the headquarters of Origin Pacific Airways until its collapse in 2006.\nIn February 2018, the approach road to the airport was flooded when the adjoining Jenkins Creek burst its banks during a storm that brought king tides and strong winds. The airport was closed for about one hour. In 2022, the NZ SeaRise programme identified Nelson airport as an area of particular vulnerability to sea level rise, with a projected subsidence of per year. The airport's chief executive said that the proposed runway extension would be planned around the latest sea level rise forecast, and that the airport was \"here to stay\", despite the concerns over the threats posed by sea level rise.\nMaritime transport.\nPort Nelson is the maritime gateway for the Nelson, Tasman and Marlborough regions and an important hub for economic activity. The following shipping companies call at the port:\nIn the mid-1994, a group of local businessmen, fronted by local politician Owen Jennings, proposed building a deep-water port featuring a one-kilometre-long wharf extending from the Boulder Bank into Tasman Bay, where giant ships could berth and manoeuvre with ease. Known as Port Kakariki, the $97 million project was to become the hub to ship West Coast coal to Asia, as well as handling logs, which would be barged across Tasman Bay from Mapua.\nIn January 2010, the Western Blue Highway, a Nelson to New Plymouth ferry service, was proposed by Port Taranaki. However, to date, neither the Interislander nor Bluebridge have shown any interest in the route.\nThe Anchor Shipping and Foundry Company was formed 31 March 1901 from the earlier companies of Nathaniel Edwards &amp; Co (1857\u20131880) and the Anchor Steam Shipping Company (1880\u20131901). The Anchor Company never departed from its original aim of providing services to the people of Nelson and the West Coast of the South Island and was never a large company; it only owned 37 ships during its history. At its peak around 1930, there were 16 vessels in the fleet. The company operated three nightly return trips per week ferry service between Nelson and Wellington and a daily freight service was maintained between the two ports in conjunction with the Pearl Kasper Shipping Company, while another service carried general cargo on a Nelson\u2013Onehunga route. In 1974, the Anchor Company was sold and merged into the Union Company.\nPublic transport.\nThe passenger and freight company Newmans Coach Lines was formed in Nelson in 1879, and merged with Transport Nelson in 1972. Nelson Motor Service Company ran the first motor bus in Nelson in 1906 and took over the Palace horse buses in 1907. InterCity provides daily bus services connecting Nelson with towns and cities around the South Island.\nEbus provides public transport services between Nelson, Richmond, Motueka and Wakefield as well as on two local routes connecting Atawhai, Nelson Hospital, The Brook and the Airport.\nThe Late Late Bus is a weekend night transport service between Nelson and Richmond. NBus Cards were replaced by Bee Cards on 3 August 2020.\nTaxi companies include Nelson Bays Cabs, Nelson City Taxis and Sun City Taxis.\nRail transport.\nThe Dun Mountain Railway was a horse-drawn tramway that served a mine from 1862 to 1901. The Nelson Section was an isolated, gauge, government-owned railway line between Nelson and Glenhope that operated for years between 1876 and 1955. In 1886, a route was proposed from Nelson to the junction of the Midland Railway Company at Buller via Richmond, Waimea West, Upper Moutere, Motueka, the Motueka Valley, Tadmor and Glenhope.\nThe only rail activity today is a short heritage operation run by the Nelson Railway Society from Founders Heritage Park using their own line between Wakefield Grove and Grove. The society has proposed future extensions of their line, possibly into or near the city centre. Nelson is one of only five major urban areas in New Zealand without a rail connection \u2013 the others being Taup\u014d, Rotorua, Gisborne and Queenstown. There have been several proposals to connect Nelson to the South Island rail network, but none have come to fruition.\nRoading.\nThe Nelson urban area is served by State Highway\u00a06, which runs in a north to southwest direction. The highway travels through the city and nearby town of Richmond, continuing southwest across the plains of the Wairoa and Motueka Rivers. Plans to construct a motorway linking North Nelson to Brightwater in the south have so far been unsuccessful. A number of studies have been undertaken since 2007 including the 2007 North Nelson to Brightwater Study, the Southern Link Road Project and the Arterial Traffic Study. On 28 June 2013, the Nelson Mayor Aldo Miccio and Nelson MP Nick Smith jointly wrote to Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee seeking for the Southern Link to be given Road of National Significance (RoNS) status.\nOther significant road projects proposed over the years include a cross-city tunnel from T\u0101hunanui Drive to Haven Road; or from Annesbrook (or T\u0101hunanui) to Emano Street in Victory Square; or from T\u0101hunanui to Washington Valley.\nMedia.\n\"The Nelson Examiner\" was the first newspaper published in the South Island. It was established by Charles Elliott (1811\u20131876) in 1842, within a few weeks of New Zealand Company settlers arriving in Nelson. Other early newspapers were \"The Colonist\" and the \"Nelson Evening Mail\". Today, Stuff Ltd publishes the \"Nelson Mail\" four days a week, and the community paper \"The Nelson Tasman Leader\" weekly. The city's largest circulating newspaper is the locally owned \"Nelson Weekly\", which is published every Wednesday.\n\"WildTomato\" was a glossy monthly lifestyle magazine focused on the Nelson and Marlborough regions. It was launched by Murray Farquhar as a 16-page local magazine in Nelson in July 2006, and put into liquidation in March 2021.\nThe city is served by all major national radio and television stations, with terrestrial television (Freeview) and FM radio. Local radio stations include The Hits (formerly Radio Nelson), More FM (formerly Fifeshire FM), The Breeze, ZM (formerly The Planet 97FM) and community station Fresh FM. The city has one local television station, Mainland Television.\nSport.\nThe first rugby union match in New Zealand took place at the Botanic Reserve in Nelson on 14 May 1870, between the Nelson Suburbs FC and Nelson College. An informative commemorative plaque was renovated at the western edge of the grassed area by Nelson City Council in 2006.\nMajor sports teams\nMajor venues\nNelson has also served as a training location for professional Japanese long-distance runners.\nEducation.\nThere are four secondary schools: Garin College, Nayland College, Nelson College and Nelson College for Girls.\nNelson hosts two tertiary education institutions. The main one is Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, which has two main campuses, one in Nelson and the other in Blenheim in Marlborough. The institute has been providing tertiary education in the Nelson-Marlborough region for the last 100 years. Nelson also has a University of Canterbury College of Education campus, which currently has an intake two out of every three years for the primary sector.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

The region covers an area of , making it the largest region in the country by area. It is home to a population of 698,200 (June 2025).\nThe region in its current form was established in 1989 during nationwide local government reforms. The Kaik\u014dura District joined the region in 1992 following the abolition of the Nelson-Marlborough Regional Council.\nChristchurch, the South Island's largest city and the country's second-largest urban area, is the seat of the region and home to percent of the region's population. Other major towns and cities include Timaru, Ashburton, Rangiora and Rolleston.\nHistory.\nNatural history.\nThe land, water, flora, and fauna of Canterbury has a long history, stretching from creation of the greywacke basement rocks that make up the Southern Alps to the arrival of the first humans. This history is linked to the solidification and development of tectonic plates, the development of oceans and then life itself.\nThe region is a part of the larger Zealandia continent, itself a part of the larger Australian and Pacific tectonic plates. In the first instance, the land is based upon the constructive tectonic forces of this convergent and transformational tectonic plate boundary. In the second instance, the erosive forces of rain, snow, ice, and rock grinding against rock have developed large gravel fans that extend out from the mountains. In the third instance, there is volcanism punching through the basement rocks and blanket of sediments to the surface. Upon this solid foundation, and slowly over the billions of years, life made up of a countless generations of interconnected adaptations developed into the unique flora and fauna of Aotearoa/New Zealand. The remnants populations of these unique species are visible today in the publicly protected conservation lands.\nThe species of Waitaha/Canterbury were adapted to the climate and geography that traverses inland from the coastline to the highest peaks, and from the warmer climes in the north to the colder in the south.\nBefore European settlement.\nCanterbury has been populated by a succession of M\u0101ori peoples over the centuries. When European settlers arrived, it was occupied by Ng\u0101i Tahu, whose numbers had been greatly reduced by warfare, among themselves and with Te Rauparaha and his Ng\u0101ti Toa from the North Island, in the early 19th century.\nColonisation.\nIn 1848, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, a Briton, and John Robert Godley, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, founded the Canterbury Association to establish an Anglican colony in the South Island. The colony was based upon theories developed by Wakefield while in prison for eloping with a woman not-of-age. Due to ties to the University of Oxford, the Canterbury Association succeeded in raising sufficient funds and recruiting middle-class and upper-class settlers. In April 1850, a preliminary group led by Godley landed at Port Cooper \u2013 modern-day Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraup\u014d \u2013 and established a port, housing and shops in preparation for the main body of settlers. In December 1850, the first wave of 750 settlers arrived at Lyttelton in a fleet of four ships.\nFollowing 1850, the province's economy developed with the introduction of sheep farming. The Canterbury Region's tussock plains in particular were suitable for extensive sheep farming. Since they were highly valued by settlers for their meat and wool, there were over half a million sheep in the region by the early 1850s. By the 1860s, this figure had risen to three million. During this period, the architect Benjamin Mountfort designed many civic and ecclesiastical buildings in the Gothic Revival style.\nCanterbury Province.\nThe Canterbury Province was formed in 1853 following the passing of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. It was formed from part of New Munster Province and covered the middle part of the South Island, stretching from the east coast to the west coast. The province was abolished, along with other provinces of New Zealand, when the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 November 1876. The modern Canterbury Region has slightly different boundaries, particularly in the north, where it includes some districts from the Nelson Province.\n2010\u20132011 earthquakes.\nSeptember 2010.\nA magnitude 7.1 earthquake occurred in the region on Saturday 4 September 2010, at 04:35\u00a0am. The epicentre was located west of Christchurch; south-east of Darfield, and had a depth of . The earthquake caused widespread damage to buildings and power outages, but no direct fatalities. Sewers were damaged, gas and water lines were broken, and power to up to 75% of the city was disrupted. Christchurch residents reported chimneys falling in through roofs, cracked ceilings and collapsed brick walls.\nA local state of emergency was declared at 10:16\u00a0am on 4 September for the city, and evacuations of parts were planned to begin later in the day. People inside the Christchurch city centre were evacuated, and the city's central business district remained closed until 5 September. A curfew from 7\u00a0pm on 4 September to 7\u00a0am on 5 September was put in place. The New Zealand Army was deployed to assist police and enforce the curfew.\nThere were 63 reported aftershocks in the first 48 hours, with three registering 5.2 magnitude. The total insurance costs of the event were estimated as up to $11\u00a0billion, according to the New Zealand Treasury.\nFebruary 2011.\nA large aftershock of magnitude 6.3 occurred on 22 February 2011 at 12:51\u00a0pm. It was centred just to the north of Lyttelton, 10 kilometres south-east of Christchurch, at a depth of 5\u00a0km.\nAlthough lower on the moment magnitude scale than the quake of September 2010, the intensity and violence of the ground shaking was measured to be VIII on the MMI, which is among the strongest ever recorded globally in an urban area due to the shallowness and proximity of the epicentre.\nThe quake struck on a busy weekday afternoon. This, along with the strength of the quakes, and the proximity to the city centre, resulted in 181 deaths. Many buildings and landmarks were severely damaged, including the iconic Shag Rock and Christchurch Cathedral. New Zealand's first National State of Emergency was promptly declared.\nJune 2011.\nOn 13 June 2011 at about 1:00\u00a0pm New Zealand time, Christchurch was rocked by a magnitude 5.7 quake, followed by a magnitude 6.3 quake at 2:20\u00a0pm, centred in a similar location to that of the February quake with a depth of 6.0 kilometres. Dozens of aftershocks occurred over the following days, including several over magnitude 4.\nPhone lines and power were lost in some suburbs, and liquefaction surfaced mainly in the eastern areas of the city which were worst affected following the aftershocks. Many residents in and around the hillside suburb of Sumner self-evacuated. Further damage was reported to buildings inside the cordoned central business district, with an estimate of 75 additional buildings needing demolition. Among the buildings further damaged was the Christchurch Cathedral, which lost its iconic rose window. There was one death and multiple injuries.\nGeography.\nThe area administered by the Canterbury Regional Council consists of all the river catchments on the east coast of the South Island from that of the Waiau Toa / Clarence River, north of Kaik\u014dura, to that of the Waitaki River, in South Canterbury. It is New Zealand's largest region by area, with an area of 45,346\u00a0km2.\nCanterbury was formerly bounded in the north by the Conway River, to the west by the Southern Alps, and to the south by the Waitaki River. The area is commonly divided into North Canterbury (north of the Rakaia River to the Conway River), Mid Canterbury (from the Rakaia River to the Rangitata River), South Canterbury (south of the Rangitata River to the Waitaki River) and Christchurch City.\nDemographics.\nCanterbury Region covers . Statistics New Zealand estimates the population of Canterbury is 698,200 as of June 2025, which gives a population density of people per km2. The region is home to % of New Zealand's population.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCanterbury Region had a population of 651,027 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 51,333 people (8.6%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 111,594 people (20.7%) since the 2013 census. There were 322,038 males, 326,082 females and 2,907 people of other genders in 251,661 dwellings. 3.7% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 39.1 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 113,751 people (17.5%) aged under 15 years, 125,919 (19.3%) aged 15 to 29, 297,834 (45.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 113,520 (17.4%) aged 65 or older.\nOf those at least 15 years old, 101,367 (18.9%) people had a bachelor's or higher degree, 279,984 (52.1%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 124,818 (23.2%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $41,400, compared with $41,500 nationally. 57,885 people (10.8%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 274,113 (51.0%) people were employed full-time, 79,245 (14.7%) were part-time, and 12,546 (2.3%) were unemployed.\nUrban areas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCulture and identity.\nPeople could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 80.3% European (P\u0101keh\u0101); 10.6% M\u0101ori; 3.7% Pasifika; 13.3% Asian; 1.6% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.5% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as \"New Zealander\". English was spoken by 96.3%, M\u0101ori language by 2.1%, Samoan by 1.0% and other languages by 13.8%. No language could be spoken by 2.0% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.6%. The percentage of people born overseas was 24.6, compared with 28.8% nationally.\nReligious affiliations were 32.2% Christian, 1.7% Hindu, 1.0% Islam, 0.3% M\u0101ori religious beliefs, 0.8% Buddhist, 0.5% New Age, 0.1% Jewish, and 1.7% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 55.1%, and 6.8% of people did not answer the census question.\nIn the 2013 census, just under 20 percent of Canterbury's population was born overseas, compared to 25 percent for New Zealand as a whole. The British Isles remains the largest region of origin, accounting for 36.5 percent of the overseas-born population in Canterbury. Around a quarter of Canterbury's overseas-born population at the 2013 Census had been living in New Zealand for less than five years, and 11 percent had been living in New Zealand for less than two years (i.e. they moved to New Zealand after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake).\nAnglicanism is the largest Christian denomination in Canterbury with 14.8 percent affiliating, while Catholicism is the second-largest with 12.7 percent affiliating.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the Canterbury Region was estimated at NZ$44.2 billion in the year to March 2022, representing 12.4% of New Zealand's national GDP. The regional GDP per filled job was $126,733, 4.6% below the national average of $132,815.\nFor the year ended March 2022, the manufacturing industry was the largest contributor to the Canterbury regional economy, at $4.1 billion. Primary manufacturing (the process of creating a product from raw materials) represented $2.48 billion of the total. Manufacturing industries in the region employed 10.6% of the filled jobs in the region. The construction sector represented the next highest category of regional GDP, at $3.67 billion, followed by professional, scientific and technical services at $3.64 billion.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture contributed $3.26 billion to the regional economy in the year ended March 2022. The agriculture sector is diversified into dairy farming, sheep farming and horticulture particularly viticulture. The strength of the region's agricultural economy is displayed every November at the Canterbury A&amp;P Show. The show coincides with the regional anniversary day and Cup Week. During the interwar period, agricultural productivity was boosted by the introduction of mechanization, lime and the improvement of seed stocks. Canterbury is also New Zealand's main producer of cereal crops such as wheat, barley and oats. As of 2002, the region produced 60.7% of the nation's supply of wheat, 51.1% of its barley stocks and 43.7% of its supply of oats.\nCanterbury has 25,065 hectares of horticultural land, the largest area in New Zealand. The largest crops are potatoes (4,330 ha), peas and beans (2,700 ha), wine grapes (1,770 ha), berries (1,100 ha), and onions (1,000 ha). The region produces half of the New Zealand's mushrooms, nuts and berries.\nThe region's viticulture industry was established by French settlers in Akaroa. Since then, wine-growing is concentrated into two regions: Waipara and Burnham. Recently, there have been vintages from plantings from Kurow further to the south. White wine has typically predominated in Canterbury from Riesling, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Gew\u00fcrztraminer, and to a lesser extent Pinot blanc and Pinot gris. Pinot noir has had some success in the province, particularly in Waipara.\nEnvironment.\nLike much of the Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands the Canterbury Plains have been highly modified since human settlement and now support a large agricultural industry. Prior to the arrival of M\u0101ori settlers in the 13th century, much of the modern Canterbury Region was covered in scrub and beech forests. Forest fires destroyed much of the original forest cover which was succeeded by tussock grassland. By the 19th century, only ten percent of this forest cover remained, and the European settlers introduced several new exotic grass, lupin, pine and macrocarpa that gradually supplanted the native vegetation. Much of the native vegetation was isolated to the alpine zones and Banks Peninsula. From a minimum of about one percent of its original forest cover in circa 1900, the amount of forest on Banks Peninsula has increased.\nThe amount of dairy farming is increasing with a corresponding increase in demand for water. Water use is now becoming a contentious issue in Canterbury. Lowland rivers and streams are generally polluted and some of the aquifers are being overdrawn. The Central Plains Water scheme is a proposal for water storage that has attracted much controversy. The Canterbury Water Management Strategy is one of the many means being used to address the water issue.\nThe Canterbury mudfish (kowaro) is an endangered species that is monitored by the Department of Conservation.\nGovernment and politics.\nLocal government.\nThe Canterbury Region is administered by the Canterbury Regional Council. The area includes ten territorial authorities, including Christchurch City Council and part of the Waitaki District, the other part of which is in Otago. Following the local government reform of 1989, Kaik\u014dura District was part of the Nelson-Marlborough Region. That region was later abolished and replaced with three unitary authorities. Kaik\u014dura was too small to function as an independent unitary authority and was moved under the jurisdiction of the Canterbury Regional Council in 1992. However, Kaik\u014dura remains part of Marlborough in the minds of many people. In 2006, the Banks Peninsula District was merged into Christchurch City following a 2005 referendum.\nNational government.\nThe Canterbury Region is covered by ten general electorates and one M\u0101ori electorate. The city of Christchurch as a whole consists of five of these electorates, while the electorate of Waimakariri contains a mix of Christchurch and exurban Canterbury. The Banks Peninsula, Ilam, and Waimakariri electorates are currently held by members of the governing National Party (as part of the coalition-led Sixth National Government of New Zealand) Vanessa Weenink, Hamish Campbell, and Matt Doocey. Meanwhile, the Christchurch Central, Christchurch East, and Wigram electorates are currently held by opposition (Labour Party) members Duncan Webb, Reuben Davidson, and Megan Woods respectively.\nIn contrast to Christchurch, much of the surrounding Canterbury Region is dominated by the National Party due to its ties to rural farming and business interests. The large Kaik\u014dura electorate covers all of the Marlborough Region and northern Canterbury and is represented by National MP Stuart Smith. The substantial Waitaki electorate, held by National MP Miles Anderson, covers most of South Canterbury and neighbouring North Otago. Rangitata and Selwyn are held by National members James Meager and Nicola Grigg respectively.\nUnder the M\u0101ori electorates system, Canterbury is part of the large Te Tai Tonga electorate which covers the entire South Island, the surrounding islands and most of Wellington in the North Island. It is currently held by T\u0101kuta Ferris of Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori.\nJudicially, the region is served by four District Courts at Christchurch, Ashburton, Timaru and Kaik\u014dura, and two High Courts at Christchurch and Timaru. The Christchurch High Court also hosts a divisional court of the Court of Appeal.\nTransport.\nState Highway 1 runs the length of Canterbury, connecting north to Blenheim and the Cook Strait ferry terminal at Picton and south to Oamaru, Dunedin and Invercargill.\nChristchurch International Airport, located in Harewood on the northwest outskirts of Christchurch, is the region's main airport. Regular flights operate from Christchurch to most major centres in New Zealand, as well as Australia, the Pacific Islands and eastern Asia. Timaru's Richard Pearse Airport serves South Canterbury with daily flights to Wellington.\nEducation.\nCanterbury is served by 292 primary and secondary schools, educating roughly 94,000 students from ages 5 to 18. Around 13 percent of students attend state-integrated schools and 5 percent attend private schools, with the remaining 82 percent attending state schools. Christchurch and Timaru have single-sex state secondary schools.\nCanterbury has two universities: the University of Canterbury located in western Christchurch, and Lincoln University located in Lincoln.\nSport.\nSport in Canterbury has developed from the time of the initial settlement by British migrants, and remains an important part of community life. Cricket and rugby union have been popular team sports since the early years of settlement, with the first cricket club established in Christchurch in 1851, and the first rugby club in 1863. Interest in organised sports has diversified and now includes a wide range of codes. In 2022, the top five sporting codes in Canterbury based on club membership were netball, touch rugby, rugby union, golf and cricket.\nThere are around 1,200 sports clubs and associations in Christchurch, and in 2022 there were 140,000 affiliated members. Most of the sporting codes remain amateur, and rely upon volunteers as administrators and officials. However, there are some professional teams. Notable teams representing Christchurch or the Canterbury Region include the Mainland Tactix (netball), Crusaders (rugby) and the Canterbury Kings (cricket).\nThe Crusaders, who play in the Super Rugby competition, are based in Christchurch. They represent Canterbury and other provinces of the upper South Island. They were formerly known as the \"Canterbury Crusaders\". In provincial rugby, Canterbury is represented by three unions; Canterbury, Mid Canterbury and South Canterbury. For historical reasons, players from Kaik\u014dura District still play for the Marlborough Rugby Union, which is part of the Tasman Provincial team (Nelson/Marlborough Unions combined). Other sporting teams include the Mainland Tactix (netball), Canterbury United FC (football) and Canterbury Rams (basketball).\nChristchurch has hosted many international competitions including championship events. A particularly notable international event was the 1974 Commonwealth Games.\nThere are many outdoor sportsgrounds and a variety of indoor venues. Christchurch City Council maintains 110 sportsgrounds across Christchurch City and Banks Peninsula. The sports venues Lancaster Park and Queen Elizabeth II Park were damaged beyond repair in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and were demolished. New facilities built to replace those damaged in the earthquake include the Ng\u0101 Puna Wai Sports Hub, the Parakiore Recreation and Sport Centre \u2014 an aquatic and indoor sports venue scheduled to open in 2025, and a multi\u2013purpose covered stadium \"Te Kaha\" seating 30,000 spectators that is expected to be complete by April 2026.\nFilm location.\nCanterbury has been a filming location for a range of international and national TV shows and films. Most notable are the locations used in the filming of \"The Lord of the Rings\" with the fictional city of Edoras, Rohan, being set on Mount Sunday, as well as Helm's deep backdrop, several miles down the valley. For the battle of the Pelennor Fields private farmland near Twizel was used. Canterbury also appeared in The Hobbit trilogy with Lake Pukaki being the setting for Laketown.\nOther productions have been \"\" with Flock Hill being used for the battle of Beruna. Slow West, Bookworm and Mulan used locations in the Mackenzie basin, with Mulan also using Omarama's Clay Cliffs in a scene. Plates from the Tranz Alpine were used for the Murder on the Orient Express (2017 film) to double as the Swiss Alps on a sound stage in the UK. And Christchurch itself has featured in productions like Heavenly Creatures, The Frighteners, Z for Zachariah (film) and .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lasu\u00e9n was born at Vitoria in \u00c1lava, Spain, on 7 July 1736 and joined the Franciscan order as a teenager, entering the Friary of San Francisco shortly before his fifteenth birthday on 19 March 1751. On 19 March 1751, Lasu\u00e9n was ceremoniously invested with his Franciscan habit.\nIn 1759, Lasu\u00e9n left the Franciscan Sanctuary of Arantzazu (Gipuzkoa). He then set sail from C\u00e1diz with seventeen other friars while still a deacon to volunteer for ministry in the Americas. He arrived in New Spain in 1761 and was sent west to Las Californias in 1768. Following the establishment of Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 in 1769, he moved north to Alta California in 1773. He based himself in San Diego and remained there until 1775; he helped establish Mission San Juan Capistrano before the murder of Lu\u00eds Jayme. Kumeyaay Indian unrest caused his return to San Diego.\nIn late 1776 he went to San Luis Obispo before again returning to San Diego in 1777 when he was made minister there. He was appointed the second \"Presidente\" of the missions in California in 1785, following the death of Jun\u00edpero Serra, and transferred to Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo. Lasu\u00e9n continued the work begun by Serra, establishing 9 more missions, bringing the total to 18 (the final total was 21).\nHe died at Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on 26 July 1803. On his death he was succeeded by Esteban T\u00e1pis.\nIntellect, personality and character.\nAlthough of a more introspective and brooding temperament than his predecessor Junipero Serra, Lasu\u00e9n was a dedicated and capable administrator, founding the remaining California missions. Captain Alessandro Malaspina described Lasu\u00e9n as such: \"...a man who in Christian lore, piety and conduct was truly apostolic, and his manner and learning unusual.\" It is clear from his diaries that Lasu\u00e9n struggled with loneliness and perhaps some depression brought about by the extreme conditions he encountered in San Diego when he was asked to return to restore order after the murder of Fray Jayme. Lasu\u00e9n described the ardors of missionary life as such:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"A missionary priest has to engage in many duties, many of which only concern him as a means to something else. He is responsible for the spiritual and temporal welfare of people who are many and varied. He has individuals who are more dependent on him than small children, for there are many needs that arise...and many different things to be done for the different groups that make up the community. He is surrounded by pagans, and placed in charge of neophytes who can be trusted but a little...\"\nAt age 47, writing to his friend Fray Joseph de Jesus Maria Velez in 1783, Lasu\u00e9n stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I am already old and entirely gray and although [to some extent] this is caused by my age, yet the difficult exercise of my position here has also brought this about, especially during the five years I am about to celebrate as minister of San Diego. This land is for apostles only and its people call for apostolic men greater than I happen to be; but (thanks to God) I enjoy good health and shall try to use it to some good purpose, although somewhat languidly.\nRelationship with Junipero Serra and Felipe de Neve.\nIn 1774, Fermin Lasu\u00e9n requested to return to the College of San Fernando in Mexico City. The request was denied, and Lasu\u00e9n was eventually appointed by Padre Serra as rector of Mission San Diego, which was considered at the time to be the poorest and most unstable of the existing missions. Lasu\u00e9n was fearful of Indian uprisings, and often wrote Serra and Felipe de Neve, Governor of California (1777 to 1782) about his difficulties, seeking advice about the placement of both friaries and the number of troops to guard the mission properties. His Christian zeal and sense of \"civilizing\" purpose led him to great lengths in order to acculturate Native Americans, even using their language in his pursuit, despite the Spanish king's prohibition in that respect. News of the mistreatment of Native Americans in the Mission of San Francisco reached the governor of California Diego de Borica, also a Basque, who warned of a lawsuit against Lasu\u00e9n should he not give up on his practices. Although it is clear that, at points during their ministry and friendship, they did not always agree about how to discipline the Indians and protect mission property, Lasu\u00e9n wrote that Serra was a \"most exemplary superior and a holy man.\"\nMissions founded by Fray Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n.\nHe also oversaw the expansion of many of the California mission sites and helped many other missions like Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61981", "revid": "12418561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61981", "title": "Festschrift", "text": "Academic work honoring a respected person\nIn academia, a Festschrift (; plural, \"Festschriften\" ) is a book honoring a respected person, especially an academic, and presented during their lifetime. It generally takes the form of an edited volume, containing contributions from the honoree's colleagues, former pupils, and friends. \"Festschriften\" are often titled something like \"Essays in Honour of...\" or \"Essays Presented to... .\"\nTerminology.\nThe term, borrowed from German, and literally meaning \"celebration writing\" (cognate with \"feast-script\"), might be translated as \"celebration publication\" or \"celebratory (piece of) writing\". An alternative Latin term is (literally: \"book of friends\"). A comparable book presented posthumously is generally termed a memorial volume in English, or a (, \"memorial publication\") in German.\nA \"Festschrift\" compiled and published by electronic means on the internet is called a (pronounced either or ), a term coined by the editors of the late Boris Marshak's , \"Eran ud Aneran\", published online in October 2003.\nHistory.\nOriginating in Germany before World War I, this European tradition of honoring special achievements in science and culture was carried to the United States by scientists who escaped the Nazis. In the second half of the 20th century, the practice became used internationally. Since no English term for such a book to mark a special occasion had been in use, the German word has been incorporated into English and is frequently used without the italics that designate a foreign term, although the capitalization of the first letter is usually retained from German. Its plural may be either the original or anglicized as \"Festschrifts\".\nDescription.\nA \"Festschrift\" contains original contributions by the honored academic's close colleagues, often including their former doctoral students. It is typically published on the occasion of the honoree's retirement, significant birthday, or other notable career anniversary. A \"Festschrift\" can be anything from a slim volume to a work in several volumes. \"Aufstieg und Niedergang der r\u00f6mischen Welt\", for example, began in 1972 as a \"Festschrift\" to commemorate the 75th birthday of Joseph Vogt, a German classical historian. Four volumes were planned, but it has since reached 89 volumes (including several which were planned for the next years, but put on hold in 1998). The essays usually relate in some way to, or reflect upon, the honoree's contributions to their scholarly field, but can include important original research by the authors. Many \"Festschriften\" also feature a \"tabula gratulatoria\", an extended list of academic colleagues and friends who send their best wishes to the honoree.\nIn the case of prominent academics, several \"Festschriften\" might be prepared by various groups of students and colleagues, particularly if the scholar made significant contributions to different fields.\nAccording to psychiatrist Claudio Naranjo, being selected by a prominent academic to edit a \"Festschrift\" can symbolize the proverbial passing of the torch. Thus, being designated to prepare such a collection is considered an honor in Germany.\nCritique.\nAs Irving Louis Horowitz summarized, \"\"Festschriften\" persist and multiply. Why? Because they are not just retrospective, but prospective. That is to say the \"Festschrift\" is a \"Beruf\", a call to further work, effort, and energy, a call to the improvement of learning, of a discipline, a science, an artistic vision, or an intellectual position. Even in this age of mass \"Festschriften\", they remain a special literary genre\".\nEndel Tulving, a Canadian neuroscientist, proposed that \"a Festschrift frequently enough also serves as a convenient place in which those who are invited to contribute find a permanent resting place for their otherwise unpublishable or at least difficult-to-publish papers.\"\nIn a review of the book \"Human Expeditions: Inspired by Bruce Trigger\", Marxist archeologist Randall H. McGuire (at Binghamton University) observed in 2014 that \"the festschrift [book] and the memorial volume are dying enterprises\", and suggested that creating festschrift websites instead, because many observers think that the festschrift volumes are a waste of time, often lack coherence and frequently include articles that the authors could not publish elsewhere. He suggested that because of the weaknesses, festschrifts do not sell and publishers are reluctant to publish them.\nPhilosopher Alan Soble, in a review of the book \"Fact and Value\" in honor of MIT's philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson, has formulated \u2013 somewhat tongue-in-cheek \u2013 13 conditions that should be satisfied by a \"Festschrift\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Across a career spanning more than six decades, Redford earned widespread recognition and numerous awards, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award and five Golden Globe Awards, (including a Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1994). He has also received various honors including the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 1996, the Academy Honorary Award in 2002, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2005, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 and the Honorary C\u00e9sar in 2019.\nRedford began his career on television in the late 1950s, appearing in anthology series such as \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" and \"The Twilight Zone\". He made his Broadway debut in Neil Simon's comedy \"Barefoot in the Park\" (1963) before taking film roles in \"War Hunt\" (1962) and \"Inside Daisy Clover\" (1965). He then achieved Hollywood stardom with \"Barefoot in the Park\" (1967), \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1969), \"Downhill Racer\" (1969), \"Jeremiah Johnson\" (1972), \"The Candidate\" (1972) and \"The Sting\" (1973), with the latter earning him an Academy Award nomination.\nHis stardom continued with films such as \"The Way We Were\" (1973), \"The Great Gatsby\" (1974), \"Three Days of the Condor\" (1975), \"All the President's Men\" (1976), \"The Electric Horseman\" (1979), \"The Natural\" (1984) and \"Out of Africa\" (1985).

He also played Alexander Pierce in the MCU films ' (2014) and ' (2019), the latter serving as his final on-screen role.\nRedford made his directorial debut with the family drama \"Ordinary People\" (1980), which won four Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. His later directing credits include \"The Milagro Beanfield War\" (1988), \"A River Runs Through It\" (1992), \"Quiz Show\" (1994), \"The Horse Whisperer\" (1998) and \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" (2000). A major advocate for independent cinema, Redford co-founded the Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival in 1978, helping to foster a new generation of filmmakers. Beyond his artistic career, he was noted for his environmental activism, his support of Native American and Indigenous rights and his advocacy for LGBTQ equality.\nEarly life and education.\nCharles Robert Redford Jr. was born on August 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California, to Martha Woodruff Redford (n\u00e9e Hart; 1914\u20131955), who was from Austin, Texas and Charles Robert Redford Sr. (1914\u20131991), an accountant. He had a paternal half-brother, William. Redford was of Irish, Scottish and English ancestry. His patrilineal great-great-grandfather, a Protestant Englishman named Elisha Redford, married Mary Ann McCreery, of Irish Catholic descent, in Manchester, Lancashire. They immigrated to New York City in 1849, immediately settling next in Stonington, Connecticut. They had a son named Charles, the first in line to have been given the name. Regarding Redford's maternal lineage, the Harts were Irish from Galway and the Greens were Scotch-Irish who settled in the United States in the 18th century. Redford's family lived in Van Nuys while his father worked in El Segundo. As a child, he and his family often traveled to Austin to visit his maternal grandfather. Redford credited his environmentalism and love of nature to his childhood in Texas.\nRedford attended Van Nuys High School, where he was classmates with baseball pitcher Don Drysdale. He described himself as having been a \"bad\" student, finding inspiration outside the classroom in art and sports. He hit tennis balls with Pancho Gonzalez at the Los Angeles Tennis Club to help Gonzalez warm up for matches. Redford had a mild case of polio when he was 11.\nAfter graduating from high school in 1954, he attended the University of Colorado in Boulder for a year and a half, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. While there, he worked at a restaurant/bar called The Sink, where a painting of his likeness now figures prominently among the bar's murals. While at Colorado, Redford began drinking heavily and, as a result, lost his half-scholarship and was expelled from school. He went on to travel in Europe, living in France, Spain and Italy. He later studied painting at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York and took classes at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (Class of 1959) in Manhattan, New York.\nCareer.\n1959\u20131966: Early roles.\nRedford's acting career began in New York City, where he worked both on stage and in television. His Broadway debut was in a small role in \"Tall Story\" (1959), followed by parts in \"The Highest Tree\" (1959) and \"Sunday in New York\" (1961). His biggest success on Broadway was as the stuffy newlywed husband of Elizabeth Ashley in the original 1963 cast of Neil Simon's \"Barefoot in the Park\". Starting in 1960, Redford appeared as a guest star on numerous television drama programs, including \"Naked City\", \"Maverick\", \"The Untouchables\", \"The Americans\", \"Whispering Smith\", \"Perry Mason\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"Route 66\", \"Dr. Kildare\", \"Playhouse 90\", \"Tate\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"The Virginian\" and \"Captain Brassbound's Conversion\", among others.\nRedford made his screen debut in the film adaptation of \"Tall Story\" (1960), reprising his Broadway role, although he was not credited. The film's stars were Anthony Perkins, Jane Fonda and Ray Walston. After his Broadway success, he was cast in larger feature roles in movies. In 1960, Redford was cast as Danny Tilford, a mentally disturbed young man trapped in the wreckage of his family garage, in \"Breakdown\", one of the last episodes of the syndicated adventure series \"Rescue 8\", starring Jim Davis and Lang Jeffries. Redford earned an Emmy nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in \"The Voice of Charlie Pont\" (ABC, 1962). One of his last television appearances until 2019 was on October 7, 1963, on \"Breaking Point\", an ABC medical drama about psychiatry.\nIn 1962, Redford received his second film role in \"War Hunt,\" and was cast soon after alongside screen legend Alec Guinness in the war comedy \"Situation Hopeless... But Not Serious\", in which he played a U.S. soldier falsely imprisoned by a German civilian even after the war had ended. In \"Inside Daisy Clover\" (1965), which won him a Golden Globe for best new star, he played a bisexual movie star who marries starlet Natalie Wood and rejoined her along with Charles Bronson for Sydney Pollack's \"This Property Is Condemned\" (1966)\u2014again, as her lover, though this time in a film which achieved even greater success. The same year saw his first teaming (on equal footing) with Jane Fonda, in Arthur Penn's \"The Chase\". The film marked the only time Redford starred with Marlon Brando.\n1967\u20131979: Career stardom.\nFonda and Redford were paired again in the popular big-screen version of \"Barefoot in the Park\" (1967) and were again co-stars a dozen years later in Pollack's \"The Electric Horseman\" (1979), followed 38 years later with a Netflix feature, \"Our Souls at Night\". After this initial success, Redford became concerned about his blond male stereotype image and refused roles in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" and \"The Graduate\". Redford found the niche he was seeking in George Roy Hill's \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1969), scripted by William Goldman, in which he was paired for the first time with Paul Newman. The film was a huge success and made him a major bankable star, cementing his screen image as an intelligent, reliable, sometimes sardonic good guy.\nWhile Redford did not receive an Academy Award or Golden Globe nomination for playing the Sundance Kid, he won a British Academy of Film and Television Award (BAFTA) for that role and his parts in \"Downhill Racer\" (1969) and \"Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here\" (1969). The latter two films and the subsequent \"Little Fauss and Big Halsy\" (1970) and \"The Hot Rock\" (1972) were not commercially successful. Redford had long harbored ambitions to work on both sides of the camera. As early as 1969, Redford had served as the executive producer for \"Downhill Racer\". The political satire \"The Candidate\" (1972) was a moderate box-office and critical success.\nStarting in 1973, Redford experienced a four-year run of box-office successes. The western \"Jeremiah Johnson\"'s (1972) box-office earnings from early 1973 until its second re-release in 1975 would have placed it as the 2nd-highest-grossing film of 1973. His romantic period drama with Barbra Streisand, \"The Way We Were\" (1973), was the 5th-highest-grossing film of 1973. The crime caper reunion with Paul Newman, \"The Sting\" (1973), became the top-grossing film of 1974 and one of the top-twenty highest-grossing movies of all time when adjusted for inflation and it also landed Redford the lone nomination of his career for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The following year he starred in the romantic drama \"The Great Gatsby\" (1974), also starring Mia Farrow, Sam Waterston and Bruce Dern. The film was the 8th-highest-grossing film of 1974. \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1969) placed as the 10th-highest-grossing film for 1974, as it was re-released due to the popularity of \"The Sting.\" In 1974, Redford became the first performer since Bing Crosby in 1946 to have three films in a year's top-ten-grossing titles. Each year between 1974 and 1976, movie exhibitors voted Redford Hollywood's top box-office star.\nIn 1975, Redford's hit movies included a 1920s aviation drama, \"The Great Waldo Pepper\" (1975) and the spy thriller \"Three Days of the Condor\" (1975), alongside Faye Dunaway, which finished 16th and 17th in box-office grosses for 1975, respectively. In 1976, he co-starred with Dustin Hoffman in the 2nd-highest-grossing film for the year, the critically acclaimed \"All the President's Men\". In 1976, Redford published \"The Outlaw Trail: A Journey Through Time\". Redford stated, \"The Outlaw Trail. It was a name that fascinated me\u2014a geographical anchor in Western folklore. Whether real or imagined, it was a name that, for me, held a kind of magic, a freedom, a mystery. I wanted to see it in much the same way as the outlaws did, by horse and by foot and document the adventure with text and photographs.\"\n\"All the President's Men\", in which Redford and Hoffman play \"Washington Post\" reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, was a landmark film for Redford. Not only was he the executive producer and co-star, but the film's serious subject matter\u2014the Watergate scandal\u2014and its attempt to create a realistic portrayal of journalism also reflected the actor's offscreen concerns for political causes. The film landed eight Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Director (Alan J. Pakula), while winning for the Best Screenplay (Goldman). It won the New York Film Critics Award for Best Picture and Best Director. In 1977, Redford appeared in a segment of the war film \"A\u00a0Bridge Too Far\" (1977). He took a two-year hiatus from movies before starring as a past-his-prime rodeo star in the adventure-romance \"The Electric Horseman\" (1979). This film reunited him with Fonda, finishing at No. 9 at the box office in 1980.\n1980\u20131998: Directorial debut.\nRedford's first film as director was the drama film \"Ordinary People\" (1980), a drama about the slow disintegration of an upper-middle class family after the death of a son. Redford was credited with obtaining a powerful, dramatic performance from Mary Tyler Moore, as well as superb work from Donald Sutherland and Timothy Hutton, who also won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The film is one of the most critically and publicly acclaimed films of the decade, winning four Academy Awards, including Best Director for Redford himself and Best Picture. Critic Roger Ebert declared it \"an intelligent, perceptive and deeply moving film.\" Later that year he appeared in the prison drama \"Brubaker\" (1980), playing a prison warden attempting to reform the system.\nSoon afterwards, he starred in the baseball drama \"The Natural\" (1984). Sydney Pollack's \"Out of Africa\" (1985), with Redford in the male lead role opposite Meryl Streep, became a large box office success (combined 1985 and 1986 grosses placed it at No. 5 for 1986), won a Golden Globe for Best Picture, and won seven Oscars, including Best Picture. Streep was nominated for Best Actress, but Redford did not receive a nomination. The movie proved to be Redford's biggest success of the decade and Redford and Pollack's most successful of their seven movies together. Redford's next film, \"Legal Eagles\" (1986) alongside Debra Winger, was only a minor success at the box office.\nRedford did not direct again until \"The Milagro Beanfield War\" (1988), a well-crafted, though not commercially successful, screen version of John Nichols's acclaimed novel of the Southwest. \"The Milagro Beanfield War\" is the story of the people of Milagro, New Mexico (based on the real town of Truchas in northern New Mexico), overcoming big developers who set about to ruin their community and force them out with tax increases.\nRedford continued as a major star throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In 1992, he released his third film as a director, the period drama \"A River Runs Through It\", based on Norman Maclean's novella, starring Craig Sheffer, Brad Pitt and Tom Skerritt. Redford received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director. This was a return to mainstream success for Redford as a director and brought a young Pitt to greater prominence. In 1994, he directed the expos\u00e9 \"Quiz Show\" about the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s. In the latter film, Redford worked from a screenplay by Paul Attanasio with cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and a cast that featured Paul Scofield, John Turturro, Rob Morrow and Ralph Fiennes. David Ansen of \"Newsweek\" wrote, \"Robert Redford may have become a more complacent movie star in the last decade, but he has become a more daring and accomplished filmmaker. 'Quiz Show' is his best movie since 'Ordinary People'\".\nIn 1993, he starred in \"Indecent Proposal\" as a billionaire businessman who tests a couple's morals; the film became one of the year's biggest hits. He co-starred with Michelle Pfeiffer in the newsroom romance \"Up Close &amp; Personal\" (1996), and with Kristin Scott Thomas and a young Scarlett Johansson in \"The Horse Whisperer\" (1998), which he also directed. Redford also continued work in films with political contexts, such as \"Havana\" (1990), playing Jack Weil, a professional gambler in 1959 Cuba during the Revolution, as well as \"Sneakers\" (1992), in which he co-starred with River Phoenix and Sidney Poitier.\n1999\u20132012: Expansive filmmaking and later works.\nRedford also directed Matt Damon and Will Smith in \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" (2000). He appeared as a disgraced Army general sent to prison in the prison drama \"The Last Castle\" (2001), directed by Rod Lurie. In the same year, Redford reteamed with Pitt for \"Spy Game\", another success for the pair but with Redford switching this time from director to actor. During that time, he planned to direct and star in a sequel of \"The Candidate\" but the project never happened. Redford, a leading environmental activist, narrated the IMAX documentary \"Sacred Planet\" (2004), a sweeping journey across the globe to some of its most exotic and endangered places. In \"The Clearing\" (2004), Redford portrayed Wayne Hayes, a shrewd businessman whose kidnapping forces him and his wife to confront the personal compromises behind their seemingly ideal life.\nRedford stepped back into producing with \"The Motorcycle Diaries\" (2004), a coming-of-age road film about Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara as a young medical student and his friend Alberto Granado. It also explored the political and social issues of South America that influenced Guevara and shaped his future. With five years spent on the film's making, Redford was credited by director Walter Salles for being instrumental in getting it made and released. Back in front of the camera, Redford received good notices for his role in director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m's \"An Unfinished Life\" (2005) as a cantankerous rancher who takes in his estranged daughter-in-law (Jennifer Lopez) and the granddaughter he never knew, after they flee an abusive relationship.\nMeanwhile, Redford returned to familiar territory when he reteamed with Streep, 22 years after they starred in \"Out of Africa\", for his personal project \"Lions for Lambs\" (2007), which also starred Tom Cruise. After a great deal of hype, the film opened to mixed reviews and disappointing box office. Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote, \"\"Lions for Lambs\" is so square it's like something out of the gray twilight glow of the golden age of television. Even the military plot, which clunks, seems to be taking place on stage.\" In 2010, Redford released \"The Conspirator\", a period drama revolving around the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Redford appeared in the 2011 documentary \"Buck\" by Cindy Meehl, where he discussed his experiences with title subject Buck Brannaman during the production of \"The Horse Whisperer\". In 2012, Redford directed \"The Company You Keep\", in which he starred as a former Weather Underground activist who goes on the run after a journalist discovers his identity. The film starred himself, Shia LaBeouf and Julie Christie.\n2013\u20132025: Final roles and retirement.\nIn 2013, Redford starred in \"All Is Lost\", directed by J.C. Chandor, about a man lost at sea. He received acclaim for his performance in the film, in which he was its only cast member and there is almost no dialogue. Redford was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor, his first time winning an acting honor from that group (he had been nominated in 1969 for \"Downhill Racer\"). Ali Arikan wrote in \"RogerEbert.com\", \"Chandor plays to Redford's strengths: his battered visage, calm determination and detachment from the vagaries of a \"normal\" existence. In return, Redford gives the performance of the latter half of his career in a role that is not just physically, but also psychologically demanding\".\nIn the 2014 Marvel Studios superhero film \"\", Redford played antagonist Alexander Pierce, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and secretly leader of the Hydra cell operating the Triskelion. Redford was a co-producer and, with Emma Thompson and Nick Nolte, acted in the film \"A Walk in the Woods\" (2015), based on Bill Bryson's book of the same name. Redford had optioned the film rights for the book from Bryson after reading it more than a decade earlier, with the intent of co-starring in it with Paul Newman, but had shelved the project after Newman's death.\nAlso in 2015, he played news anchor Dan Rather in James Vanderbilt's \"Truth\" alongside Cate Blanchett. The film received mixed reviews with Justin Chang of \"Variety\" noting, \"Redford, who bears a solid resemblance to Rather but not quite enough to make you forget whom you're watching, plays the veteran newsman with easy gravitas, inner strength and a gentle paternal twinkle, with little display of the anger and volatility for which he was often known over the course of his storied career.\" In 2016, he took the supporting role of Mr. Meacham in the Disney remake \"Pete's Dragon\". The next year, Redford starred in \"The Discovery\" and \"Our Souls at Night\", both released on Netflix streaming in 2017. The latter film, which he also produced, reunited him with Fonda for the fifth time and garnered positive reviews.\nRedford played bank robber Forrest Tucker in the David Lowery\u2013directed drama film \"The Old Man &amp; the Gun\", which was released in September 2018 and for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. Alissa Wikinson wrote in \"Vox\", \"In \"The Old Man &amp; the Gun\", both Redford and Lowery are returning to their roots. For Redford, a role as a lifelong bank robber feels like a fitting cap to a career effectively launched half a century ago with his role alongside Paul Newman in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\".\" In August 2018, Redford announced his retirement from acting after completion of the film, though the following month, Redford stated that he \"regretted\" announcing his retirement because \"you never know\".\nRedford briefly reprised his role as Alexander Pierce with a cameo in \"\", filmed in 2017 before the completion of the former film. Redford, an executive producer of the series \"Dark Winds\", made a cameo alongside fellow executive producer George R. R. Martin portraying a detainee playing chess.\nFilmography and accolades.\nIn his directing debut, Redford won the 1980 Academy Award for Best Director for the film \"Ordinary People\". He was a 2002 Academy Honorary Award recipient at the 74th Academy Awards. In 2017, he was awarded the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 74th Venice Film Festival. On February 22, 2019, Redford received the Honorary C\u00e9sar at the 44th C\u00e9sar Awards in Paris.\nRedford attended the University of Colorado in the 1950s and received an honorary degree in 1988. In 1989, the National Audubon Society awarded Redford its highest honor, the Audubon Medal. In 1995, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Bard College. Redford received an honorary doctorate from Brown University in 2008. He was a 2010 recipient of the New Mexico Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts. In 2014, Redford was named by \"Time magazine\" as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In May 2015, Redford delivered the commencement address and received an honorary degree from Colby College in Maine.\nIn 1996, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts from President Bill Clinton. On October 14, 2010, Redford was appointed \"chevalier\" of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by President Nicolas Sarkozy.\nOn November 22, 2016, President Barack Obama honored Redford with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. In December 2005, he received the Kennedy Center Honors for his contributions to American culture. The honors recipients are recognized for their lifetime contributions to American culture through the performing arts: whether in dance, music, theater, opera, motion pictures, or television.\nIn 2008, Redford received The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize, one of the richest prizes in the arts, given annually to \"a man or woman who has made an outstanding contribution to the beauty of the world and to mankind's enjoyment and understanding of life.\" The University of Southern California (USC) School of Dramatic Arts announced the first annual \"Robert Redford Award for Engaged Artists\" in 2009. According to the school's website, the award was created \"to honor those who have distinguished themselves not only in the exemplary quality, skill and innovation of their work, but also in their public commitment to social responsibility, to increasing awareness of global issues and events and to inspiring and empowering young people.\"\nOther ventures.\nSundance Film Festival.\nWith the financial proceeds of his acting success, starting with his salaries from \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and \"Downhill Racer\", Redford bought a ski area on the east side of Mount Timpanogos, located in the Wasatch Mountains northeast of Provo, Utah, called \"Timp Haven\". He renamed it \"Sundance\" after his \"Sundance Kid\" character. Redford's ex-wife Lola was from Utah and they had built a home in the area in 1963. Portions of the movie \"Jeremiah Johnson\" (1972), a film which was both one of Redford's favorites and one that heavily influenced him, were shot near the ski area. Redford went on to create the Sundance Film Festival, which became the country's largest festival for independent films. The festival, which was initially known as the Utah/US festival, eventually would be named for Redford's \"Sundance\" land. In 2008, Sundance exhibited 125 feature-length films from 34 countries, with more than 50,000 attendees in Salt Lake City and Park City, Utah. Robert Redford also founded the Sundance Institute, Sundance Cinemas, Sundance Catalog and the Sundance Channel, all in and around Park City, 30 miles (48\u00a0km) north of the Sundance ski area. Redford also owned a Park City restaurant, Zoom, that closed in May 2017.\nProduction companies.\nRedford was the co-owner of Wildwood Enterprises, Inc., with Bill Holderman, producer, with the following film credits: \"Lions for Lambs\"; \"Quiz Show\"; \"A River Runs Through It\"; \"Ordinary People\"; \"The Horse Whisperer\"; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\"; \"Slums of Beverly Hills\"; \"The Motorcycle Diaries\"; and \"The Conspirator\".\nRedford was the president and co-founder of Sundance Productions, with Laura Michalchyshyn. Sundance Productions produced \"Chicagoland (CNN)\", \"Cathedrals of Culture\" (Berlin Film Festival), \"The March (PBS)\" and Emmy nominee \"All The President's Men Revisited\" (Discovery), Isabella Rossellini's \"Green Porno Live!\" and \"To Russia With Love\" on Epix.\nFollowing his founding of the nonprofit Sundance Institute in Park City, Utah, in 1981, Redford was deeply involved with independent film. Through its various workshop programs and popular film festival, Sundance has provided support for independent filmmakers. In 1995, Redford signed a deal with Showtime to start a 24-hour cable television channel devoted to airing independent films. The Sundance Channel premiered on February 29, 1996.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and family.\nOn August 9, 1958, Redford married Lola Van Wagenen in Las Vegas. The couple had four children: Scott Anthony, Shauna Jean, David James and Amy Hart. Scott died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 2\u00bd months. Shauna is a painter and married to journalist Eric Schlosser. James was a writer and producer who died of cancer in 2020. Amy is an actress, director and producer. Redford had seven grandchildren.&lt;ref name=\"closerweekly/redfords-kids\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nRedford and Van Wagenen never publicly announced a separation or divorce, but in 1982, entertainment columnist Shirley Eder reported that the pair \"have been very much apart for a number of years.\" Redford was negotiating their divorce settlement while filming \"Out of Africa\" in 1984. In 1991, \"Parade\" magazine said, \"it is unclear whether the divorce has been finalized.\"\nOn July 11, 2009, Redford and his longtime girlfriend, Sibylle Szaggars, married at the Louis C. Jacob Hotel in Hamburg, Germany. She had moved in with Redford in 1996 and shared his home in Sundance, Utah. In May 2011, \"Robert Redford: The Biography\" was published by Alfred A. Knopf, written by Michael Feeney Callan with Redford's cooperation, drawing extensively from his personal papers, diaries and taped interviews.\nAlthough Redford primarily resided at the Sundance Resort in Utah, he owned a house in Tiburon, California, which was sold in 2024. He also had a property in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nPolitical activism.\nRedford supported environmentalism, Native American rights, LGBT rights, and the arts. He was a supporter of advocacy groups like the Political Action Committee of the Directors Guild of America. He was the executive producer and narrator of the documentary film \"Incident at Oglala\", about American Indian Movement activist Leonard Peltier.\nRedford supported Brent Cornell Morris in his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomination for Utah's 3rd congressional district in 1990. Redford also supported Gary Herbert, another Republican and a friend, in Herbert's successful 2004 campaign to be elected lieutenant governor of Utah. Herbert later became governor of Utah.\nAs an avid environmentalist, Redford was a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He also served as vice president for The Way of the Rain, a group that raises awareness about environmental issues through artistic performances, for which Sibylle Szaggars Redford is founder and president. He endorsed Democratic president Barack Obama for re-election in 2012. Redford was the first quote on the back cover of Donald Trump's book \"Crippled America\" (2015), saying of Trump's candidacy, \"I'm glad he's in there, being the way he is and saying what he says and the ways he says it, I think shakes things up and I think that is very needed.\" A representative later clarified that Redford's statement, taken from a longer conversation with Larry King, was not intended to endorse Trump for president.\nIn 2019, Redford penned an op-ed in which he referred to Trump's administration as a \"monarchy in disguise\" and stated \"[i]t's time for Trump to go\". Redford later co-authored another op-ed in which he criticized Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic while also citing the collective public response to the pandemic as a model for how to respond to climate change. He criticized the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. In July 2020, Redford penned an op-ed in which he stated that President Trump lacks a \"moral compass\". In the same piece, he announced that he would be supporting Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\nRedford was opposed to the TransCanada Corporation's Keystone Pipeline. In 2013, he was identified by its CEO, Russ Girling, for leading the anti-pipeline protest movement. In April 2014, Redford, a Pitzer College Trustee and Pitzer College President Laura Skandera Trombley announced that the college would divest fossil fuel stocks from its endowment; at the time, it was the higher-education institution with the largest endowment in the U.S. to make this commitment. The press conference was held at the LA Press Club. In November 2012, Pitzer launched the Robert Redford Conservancy for Southern California Sustainability at Pitzer College.\nDeath and tributes.\nOn September 16, 2025, Redford died in his sleep at his home in Sundance, Utah, at the age of 89. Several of Redford's co-stars paid tribute to him, including frequent collaborator Jane Fonda, who wrote, \"He meant a lot to me and was a beautiful person in every way. He stood for an America that we have to keep fighting for.\" His \"Out of Africa\" co-star Meryl Streep wrote, \"One of the lions has passed. Rest in peace, my lovely friend.\" His \"The Way We Were\" co-star Barbra Streisand released a lengthy statement, which read in part, \"Bob was charismatic, intelligent, intense, always interesting\u2014and one of the finest actors ever.\" His \"All the President's Men\" co-star Dustin Hoffman paid tribute to Redford, writing, \"Working with Redford...was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had...I'll miss him\". \nJournalist Bob Woodward, whom Redford portrayed in \"All the President's Men\", also paid tribute calling Redford a close friend and a \"principled force for good\". Others who commented on Redford's death include politicians such as current U.S. president Donald Trump, former U.S. president Barack Obama, the former First Lady Hillary Clinton and former vice president Al Gore. Numerous prominent figures from the entertainment industry paid tribute to Redford, including filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese and Ron Howard, and actors such as Morgan Freeman, Leonardo DiCaprio, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson and Reese Witherspoon.\nRedford was laid to rest on his property in Sundance after a private funeral.\nLegacy and reception.\nDuring his career, Redford was often described as a sex symbol, particularly during the 1970s. The BBC News called his appeal \"all-American good looks [that] couldn't be ignored\". The Associated Press noted that Redford's \"wavy blond hair and boyish grin made him the most desired of leading men\" during the height of his career. However, Redford himself rejected the label of being a sex symbol. In a 1974 interview with \"The New York Times\", Redford responded to his image as a symbol by saying \"I never thought of myself as a glamorous guy, a handsome guy, any of that stuff. Suddenly, there's this image...Glamour image can be a real handicap. It is crap.\"\nFollowing Redford's death, an obituary published in \"Variety\" remarked that he \"became a godfather for independent film as founder of the Sundance Film Institute\", that \"as a movie star in his prime, few could touch him\" and that \"in his '70s heyday, few actors possessed Redford's star wattage\". Writing for \"The Guardian\", Andrew Pulver characterized Redford as a \"giant of American cinema\" and \"one of the defining movie stars of the 1970s, crossing with ease between the Hollywood New Wave and the mainstream film industry\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" remembered Redford as a \"generational icon\". In France, Culture Minister Rachida Dati praised him as \"a giant of American cinema\". As the founder of Sundance Film Festival, he has been described as a \"godfather of independent cinema\".\n\"The New York Times\" noted that Redford's films were known for depicting serious topics such as corruption and grief that \"[resonated] with the masses\", as he wanted his films to carry \"cultural weight\" and that Redford took \"risks by exploring dark and challenging material\". He was hailed as one of \"few truly iconic screen figures of the past half-century\" and as \"Hollywood's Golden Boy\" by \"The Hollywood Reporter\". Filmmaker Ron Howard praised Redford and his work, calling him \"a tremendously influential cultural figure\" and an \"artistic gamechanger\". His creation of the Sundance Film Festival was credited as a \"boost [to] independent film-making\". After he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" called Redford's Sundance Film Festival a \"catalyst for an explosion of independent films\".\n\"Time\" noted Redford's environmental activism, calling him \"fiercely dedicated to pushing for a world that was habitable for all\" and mentioning that the Redford Foundation helped support environmentally friendly filmmaking. His environmental awareness led to Fox News remembering Redford as a \"Hollywood icon\" [who] \"committed himself to being a good steward of the environmental movement and a champion of the American Southwest\". In 2016, then-president Barack Obama called Redford \"one of the foremost conservationists of our generation\".\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"tannin\" is widely applied to any large polyphenolic compound containing sufficient hydroxyls and other suitable groups (such as carboxyls) to form strong complexes with various macromolecules.\nThe term \"tannin\" (from scientific French \"tannin\", from French \"tan\" \"crushed oak bark\", \"tanner\" \"to tan\", cognate with English \"tanning\", Medieval Latin \"tannare\", from Proto-Celtic \"*tannos\" \"oak\") refers to the abundance of these compounds in oak bark, which was used in tanning animal hides into leather.\nThe tannin compounds are widely distributed in many species of plants, where they play a role in protection from predation (acting as pesticides) and might help in regulating plant growth. The astringency from the tannins is what causes the dry and puckery feeling in the mouth following the consumption of unripened fruit, red wine or tea. Likewise, the destruction or modification of tannins with time plays an important role when determining harvesting times.\nTannins have molecular weights ranging from 500 to over 3,000 (gallic acid esters) and up to 20,000 daltons (proanthocyanidins).\nStructure and classes of tannins.\nThere are three major classes of tannins: Shown below are the base unit or monomer of the tannin. Particularly in the flavone-derived tannins, the base shown must be (additionally) heavily hydroxylated and polymerized in order to give the high molecular weight polyphenol motif that characterizes tannins. Typically, tannin molecules require at least 12 hydroxyl groups and at least five phenyl groups to function as protein binders.\nOligostilbenoids (oligo- or polystilbenes) are oligomeric forms of stilbenoids and constitute a minor class of tannins.\nPseudo-tannins.\nPseudo-tannins are low molecular weight compounds associated with other compounds. They do not change color during the Goldbeater's skin test, unlike hydrolysable and condensed tannins, and cannot be used as tanning compounds. Some examples of pseudo tannins and their sources are:\nHistory.\nEllagic acid, gallic acid, and pyrogallic acid were first discovered by chemist Henri Braconnot in 1831. Julius L\u00f6we was the first person to synthesize ellagic acid by heating gallic acid with arsenic acid or silver oxide.\nMaximilian Nierenstein studied natural phenols and tannins found in different plant species. Working with Arthur George Perkin, he prepared ellagic acid from algarobilla and certain other fruits in 1905. He suggested its formation from galloyl-glycine by \"Penicillium\" in 1915. Tannase is an enzyme that Nierenstein used to produce m-digallic acid from gallotannins. He proved the presence of catechin in cocoa beans in 1931. He showed in 1945 that luteic acid, a molecule present in the myrobalanitannin, a tannin found in the fruit of \"Terminalia chebula\", is an intermediary compound in the synthesis of ellagic acid.\nAt these times, molecule formulas were determined through combustion analysis. The discovery in 1943 by Martin and Synge of paper chromatography provided for the first time the means of surveying the phenolic constituents of plants and for their separation and identification. There was an explosion of activity in this field after 1945, including prominent work by Edgar Charles Bate-Smith and Tony Swain at Cambridge University.\nIn 1966, Edwin Haslam proposed a first comprehensive definition of plant polyphenols based on the earlier proposals of Bate-Smith, Swain and Theodore White, which includes specific structural characteristics common to all phenolics having a tanning property. It is referred to as the White\u2013Bate-Smith\u2013Swain\u2013Haslam (WBSSH) definition.\nOccurrence.\nTannins are distributed in species throughout the plant kingdom. They are commonly found in both gymnosperms and angiosperms. Mole (1993) studied the distribution of tannin in 180 families of dicotyledons and 44 families of monocotyledons (Cronquist). Most families of dicot contain tannin-free species (tested by their ability to precipitate proteins). The best known families of which all species tested contain tannin are: Aceraceae, Actinidiaceae, Anacardiaceae, Bixaceae, Burseraceae, Combretaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Ericaceae, Grossulariaceae, Myricaceae for dicot and Najadaceae and Typhaceae in Monocot. To the family of the oak, Fagaceae, 73% of the species tested contain tannin. For those of acacias, Mimosaceae, only 39% of the species tested contain tannin, among Solanaceae rate drops to 6% and 4% for the Asteraceae. Some families like the Boraginaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Papaveraceae contain no tannin-rich species.\nThe most abundant polyphenols are the condensed tannins, found in virtually all families of plants, and comprising up to 50% of the dry weight of leaves.\nCellular localization.\nIn all vascular plants studied, tannins are manufactured by a chloroplast-derived organelle, the tannosome. Tannins are mainly physically located in the vacuoles or surface wax of plants. These storage sites keep tannins active against plant predators, but also keep some tannins from affecting plant metabolism while the plant tissue is alive.\nTannins are classified as ergastic substances, i.e., non-protoplasm materials found in cells. Tannins, by definition, precipitate proteins. In this condition, they must be stored in organelles able to withstand the protein precipitation process. Idioblasts are isolated plant cells which differ from neighboring tissues and contain non-living substances. They have various functions such as storage of reserves, excretory materials, pigments, and minerals. They could contain oil, latex, gum, resin or pigments etc. They also can contain tannins. In Japanese persimmon (\"Diospyros kaki\") fruits, tannin is accumulated in the vacuole of tannin cells, which are idioblasts of parenchyma cells in the flesh.\nPresence in soils.\nThe convergent evolution of tannin-rich plant communities has occurred on nutrient-poor acidic soils throughout the world. Tannins were once believed to function as anti-herbivore defenses, but more and more ecologists now recognize them as important controllers of decomposition and nitrogen cycling processes. As concern grows about global warming, there is great interest to better understand the role of polyphenols as regulators of carbon cycling, in particular in northern boreal forests.\nLeaf litter and other decaying parts of kauri (\"Agathis australis\"), a tree species found in New Zealand, decompose much more slowly than those of most other species. Besides its acidity, the plant also bears substances such as waxes and phenols, most notably tannins, that are harmful to microorganisms.\nPresence in water and wood.\nThe leaching of highly water soluble tannins from decaying vegetation and leaves along a stream may produce what is known as a blackwater river. Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown color from dissolved peat tannins. The presence of tannins (or humic acid) in well water can make it smell bad or taste bitter, but this does not make it unsafe to drink.\nTannins leaching from an unprepared driftwood decoration in an aquarium can cause pH lowering and coloring of the water to a tea-like tinge. A way to avoid this is to boil the wood in water several times, discarding the water each time. Using peat as an aquarium substrate can have the same effect. Many hours of boiling the driftwood may need to be followed by many weeks or months of constant soaking and many water changes before the water will stay clear. Raising the water's pH level, e.g. by adding baking soda, will accelerate the process of leaching.\nTannins in water can lead to feather staining on wild and domestic waterfowl which frequent the water; mute swans, which are typically white in colour, can often be observed with reddish-brown staining as a result of coming into contact with dissolved tannins, though dissolved iron compounds also play a role.\nSoftwoods, while in general much lower in tannins than hardwoods, are usually not recommended for use in an aquarium so using a hardwood with a very light color, indicating a low tannin content, can be an easy way to avoid tannins. Tannic acid is brown in color, so in general white woods have a low tannin content. Woods with a lot of yellow, red, or brown coloration to them (like cedar, redwood, red oak, etc.) tend to contain a lot of tannin.\nExtraction.\nThere is no single protocol for extracting tannins from all plant material. The procedures used for tannins are widely variable. It may be that acetone in the extraction solvent increases the total yield by inhibiting interactions between tannins and proteins during extraction or even by breaking hydrogen bonds between tannin-protein complexes.\nTests for tannins.\nThere are three groups of methods for the analysis of tannins: precipitation of proteins or alkaloids, reaction with phenolic rings, and depolymerization.\nAlkaloid precipitation.\nAlkaloids such as caffeine, cinchonine, quinine or strychnine, precipitates polyphenols and tannins. This property can be used in a quantitation method.\nGoldbeater's skin test.\nWhen goldbeater's skin or ox skin is dipped in HCl, rinsed in water, soaked in the tannin solution for 5 minutes, washed in water, and then treated with 1% FeSO4 solution, it gives a blue black color if tannin was present.\nFerric chloride test.\nThe following describes the use of ferric chloride (FeCl3) tests for phenolics in general: Powdered plant leaves of the test plant (1.0\u00a0g) are weighed into a beaker and 10\u00a0ml of distilled water are added. The mixture is boiled for five minutes. Two drops of 5% FeCl3 are then added. Production of a greenish precipitate is an indication of the presence of tannins. Alternatively, a portion of the water extract is diluted with distilled water in a ratio of 1:4 and few drops of 10% ferric chloride solution is added. A blue or green color indicates the presence of tannins (Evans, 1989).\nOther methods.\nThe hide-powder method is used in tannin analysis for leather tannin and the Stiasny method for wood adhesives. Statistical analysis reveals that there is no significant relationship between the results from the hide-powder and the Stiasny methods.\n400\u00a0mg of sample tannins are dissolved in 100\u00a0ml of distilled water. 3\u00a0g of slightly chromated hide-powder previously dried in vacuum for 24h over CaCl2 are added and the mixture stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. The suspension is filtered without vacuum through a sintered glass filter. The weight gain of the hide-powder expressed as a percentage of the weight of the starting material is equated to the percentage of tannin in the sample.\n100\u00a0mg of sample tannins are dissolved in 10\u00a0ml distilled water. 1\u00a0ml of 10M HCl and 2\u00a0ml of 37% formaldehyde are added and the mixture heated under reflux for 30 min. The reaction mixture is filtered while hot through a sintered glass filter. The precipitate is washed with hot water (5\u00d7 10\u00a0ml) and dried over CaCl2. The yield of tannin is expressed as a percentage of the weight of the starting material.\nReaction with phenolic rings.\nThe bark tannins of \"Commiphora angolensis\" have been revealed by the usual color and precipitation reactions and by quantitative determination by the methods of L\u00f6wenthal-Procter and of Deijs (formalin-hydrochloric acid method).\nColorimetric methods have existed such as the Neubauer-L\u00f6wenthal method which uses potassium permanganate as an oxidizing agent and indigo sulfate as an indicator, originally proposed by L\u00f6wenthal in 1877. The difficulty is that the establishing of a titer for tannin is not always convenient since it is extremely difficult to obtain the pure tannin. Neubauer proposed to remove this difficulty by establishing the titer not with regard to the tannin but with regard to crystallised oxalic acid, whereby he found that 83\u00a0g oxalic acid correspond to 41.20\u00a0g tannin. L\u00f6wenthal's method has been criticized. For instance, the amount of indigo used is not sufficient to retard noticeably the oxidation of the non-tannins substances. The results obtained by this method are therefore only comparative. A modified method, proposed in 1903 for the quantification of tannins in wine, Feldmann's method, is making use of calcium hypochlorite, instead of potassium permanganate, and indigo sulfate.\nFood items with tannins.\nAccessory fruits.\nStrawberries contain both hydrolyzable and condensed tannins.\nBerries.\nMost berries, such as cranberries, and blueberries, contain both hydrolyzable and condensed tannins.\nNuts.\nNuts vary in the amount of tannins they contain. Some species of acorns of oak contain large amounts. For example, acorns of \"Quercus robur\" and \"Quercus petraea\" in Poland were found to contain 2.4\u20135.2% and 2.6\u20134.8% tannins as a proportion of dry matter, but the tannins can be removed by leaching in water so that the acorns become edible. Other nuts \u2013 such as hazelnuts, walnuts, pecans, and almonds \u2013 contain lower amounts. Tannin concentration in the crude extract of these nuts did not directly translate to the same relationships for the condensed fraction.\nHerbs and spices.\nCloves, tarragon, cumin, thyme, vanilla, and cinnamon all contain tannins.\nLegumes.\nMost legumes contain tannins. Red-colored beans contain the most tannins, and white-colored beans have the least. Peanuts without shells have a very low tannin content. Chickpeas (garbanzo beans) have a smaller amount of tannins.\nChocolate.\nChocolate liquor contains about 6% tannins.\nDrinks with tannins.\nPrincipal human dietary sources of tannins are tea and coffee. Most wines aged in charred oak barrels possess tannins absorbed from the wood. Soils high in clay also contribute to tannins in wine grapes. This concentration gives wine its signature astringency.\nCoffee pulp has been found to contain low to trace amounts of tannins.\nFruit juices.\nApple, grape and berry juices all contain high amounts of tannins. Sometimes tannins are even added to juices and ciders to create a more astringent feel to the taste.\nBeer.\nIn addition to the alpha acids extracted from hops to provide bitterness in beer, condensed tannins are also present. These originate both from malt and hops. Trained brewmasters, particularly those in Germany, consider the presence of tannins to be a flaw. However, in some styles, the presence of this astringency is acceptable or even desired, as, for example, in a Flanders red ale.\nIn lager type beers, the tannins can form a precipitate with specific haze-forming proteins in the beer resulting in turbidity at low temperature. This chill haze can be prevented by removing part of the tannins or part of the haze-forming proteins. Tannins are removed using PVPP, haze-forming proteins by using silica or tannic acid.\nProperties for animal nutrition.\nTannins have traditionally been considered antinutritional, depending upon their chemical structure and dosage.\nMany studies suggest that chestnut tannins have positive effects on silage quality in the round bale silages, in particular reducing NPNs (non-protein nitrogen) in the lowest wilting level.\nImproved fermentability of soya meal nitrogen in the rumen may occur. Condensed tannins inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes (for more on that topic, see plant defense against herbivory). Histatins, another type of salivary proteins, also precipitate tannins from solution, thus preventing alimentary adsorption.\nLegume fodders containing condensed tannins are a possible option for integrated sustainable control of gastrointestinal nematodes in ruminants, which may help address the worldwide development of resistance to synthetic anthelmintics. These include nuts, temperate and tropical barks, carob, coffee and cocoa.\nTannin uses and market.\nTannins have been used since antiquity in the processes of tanning hides for leather, and in helping preserve iron artifacts (as with Japanese iron teapots).\nIndustrial tannin production began at the beginning of the 19th century with the industrial revolution, to produce tanning material for the need for more leather. Before that time, processes used plant material and were long (up to six months).\nThere was a collapse in the vegetable tannin market in the 1950s\u20131960s, due to the appearance of synthetic tannins, which were invented in response to a scarcity of vegetable tannins during World War II. At that time, many small tannin industry sites closed. Vegetable tannins are estimated to be used for the production of 10\u201320% of the global leather production.\nThe cost of the final product depends on the method used to extract the tannins, in particular the use of solvents, alkali and other chemicals used (for instance glycerin). For large quantities, the most cost-effective method is hot water extraction.\nTannic acid is used worldwide as clarifying agent in alcoholic drinks and as aroma ingredient in both alcoholic and soft drinks or juices. Tannins from different botanical origins also find extensive uses in the wine industry.\nUses.\nTannins are an important ingredient in the process of tanning leather. Tanbark from oak, mimosa, chestnut and quebracho tree has traditionally been the primary source of tannery tannin, though inorganic tanning agents are also in use today and account for 90% of the world's leather production.\nTannins produce different colors with ferric chloride (either blue, blue black, or green to greenish-black) according to the type of tannin. Iron gall ink is produced by treating a solution of tannins with iron(II) sulfate.\nTannins can also be used as a mordant, and is especially useful in natural dyeing of cellulose fibers such as cotton. The type of tannin used may or may not have an impact on the final color of the fiber.\nTannin is a component in a type of industrial particleboard adhesive developed jointly by the Tanzania Industrial Research and Development Organization and Forintek Labs Canada. \"Pinus radiata\" tannins has been investigated for the production of wood adhesives.\nCondensed tannins, e.g., quebracho tannin, and Hydrolyzable tannins, e.g., chestnut tannin, appear to be able to substitute a high proportion of synthetic phenol in phenol-formaldehyde resins for wood particleboard.\nTannins can be used for production of anti-corrosive primers for treating rusted steel surfaces prior to painting, converting rust to iron tannate and consolidating and sealing the surface.\nThe use of resins made of tannins has been investigated to remove mercury and methylmercury from solution. Immobilized tannins have been tested to recover uranium from seawater.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The only son of James II of England and his second wife, Mary of Modena, he was Prince of Wales and heir until his Catholic father was deposed and exiled in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. His Protestant half-sister Mary II and her husband William III and II became co-monarchs. As a Catholic, he was subsequently excluded from the succession by the Act of Settlement 1701.\nJames claimed the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland when his father died in September 1701. As part of the War of the Spanish Succession, in 1708 Louis XIV of France backed a landing in Scotland on his behalf. This failed, as did further attempts in 1715 and 1719, after which James lived quietly in Rome. Led by his elder son Charles Edward Stuart, the 1745 Rising was the last serious effort to restore the Stuart line.\nBirth and childhood.\nJames Francis Edward Stuart was born on 10 June 1688, at St. James's Palace, first and only son of James II of England and his second wife, Mary of Modena, both Catholics. As the eldest surviving son of the reigning monarch he was automatically Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay at birth, and was created Prince of Wales in July 1688.\nHis birth was unexpected, coming five years after his mother's tenth and last pregnancy, none of which produced a child that survived more than a few days. The birth reignited controversies of religion, as the new son would be raised Catholic. Wild rumours spread among British Anglicans: that the child had died stillborn, and that the baby feted as the new prince was an impostor smuggled into the royal birth chamber in a warming pan. Protestants found it suspicious that everyone attending the birth was supposedly Catholic, although the Protestant Lady Bellasyse testified that she \"saw the child taken out of the bed with the navel string hanging to its belly\". Another rumour was that James II had not been the father; he was said to be impotent after a bout with venereal disease years earlier. In an attempt to quash these rumours, James published the testimonies of over seventy witnesses to the birth. \nThe line of succession to the throne was thrust into doubt. James II's eldest legitimate daughters, Mary and Anne, had been raised as Protestants. British Protestants had expected Mary, from his father's first marriage, to succeed their father. This possibility had kept Protestants somewhat content, with his rule a temporary inconvenience. Now that Mary or Anne's succession was in doubt with this new Catholic son and heir, discontent grew, already stoked by James II's actions which had alienated Tory Anglicans who had previously been inclined to honour him as sovereign even if they differed in religion. This movement would become the Glorious Revolution; Mary's husband William of Orange landed in England, backed by an army of English and Scottish exiles, as well as Dutch soldiers. Much of the English army promptly defected to William's cause, causing James II and his family to flee rather than stay and fight.\nOn 9 December, Mary of Modena disguised herself as a laundress and escaped with the infant James to France. Young James was brought up at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which Louis XIV had turned over to the exiled James II. Both the ex-king and his family were held in great consideration by the French king (who was his first cousin), and they were frequent visitors at Versailles where Louis XIV and his court treated them as ruling monarchs. In June 1692 James's sister Louisa Maria was born.\nHe later received a military education overseen by Richard Hamilton and Dominic Sheldon, two veterans of the Irish Army.\nStruggle for the throne.\nOn his father's death in 1701, James was proclaimed as rightful king by Louis XIV of France, despite having previously recognised the legitimacy of William III and II under the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick. Spain, the Papal States, and Modena also recognised him as king of England, Ireland and Scotland and refused to recognise William III and II, Mary II, or Anne as legitimate sovereigns. As a result of his claiming his father's lost thrones, James was attainted for treason in London on 2 March 1702, and his titles were forfeited under English law.\nEarly attempts.\nThough delayed in France by an attack of measles, James attempted invasion, trying to land at the Firth of Forth on 23 March 1708. The fleet of Admiral Sir George Byng intercepted the French ships, which, combined with bad weather, prevented a landing.\nJames served for a time as a volunteer in the French army, as his father had done during the interregnum. Between August and September 1710, Queen Anne appointed a new Tory administration led by Robert Harley, who entered into a secret correspondence with de Torcy, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, in which he claimed to desire James's accession to the throne should James convert to Protestantism. A year later, however, the British government pushed for James's expulsion from France as a precondition for a peace treaty with France. In accordance with the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Harley and Lord Bolingbroke, the Secretary of State, colluded with the French in exiling James to the Duchy of Lorraine.\nQueen Anne became severely ill at Christmas 1713 and seemed close to death. In January 1714, she recovered but clearly had little time to live. Through de Torcy and his London agent, Abb\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Gaultier, Harley maintained the correspondence with James and Bolingbroke entered into a separate correspondence with him. They both stated to James that his conversion to Protestantism would facilitate his accession. However, James, a devout Catholic, replied to Torcy: \"I have chosen my own course, therefore it is for others to change their sentiments.\" In March came James's refusal to convert, following which Harley and Bolingbroke reached the opinion that James's accession was not feasible, though they maintained their correspondence with him.\nAs a result, in August 1714, James's second cousin, the Elector of Hanover, George Louis, a German-speaking Lutheran who was the closest Protestant relative of the now-deceased Queen Anne, became king of the recently created Kingdom of Great Britain as George I. James denounced him, noting \"we have beheld a foreign family, aliens to our country, distant in blood, and strangers even to our language, ascend the throne\". Following George's coronation in October 1714, major riots broke out in provincial England.\nThe Fifteen.\nIn the following year, Jacobites started uprisings in Scotland and Cornwall aimed at putting \"James III and VIII\" on the throne. On 22 December 1715, James reached Scotland after the Jacobite defeats at the Battle of Sheriffmuir (13 November 1715) and Battle of Preston (1715). He landed at Peterhead and soon fell ill with fever, his illness made more severe by the icy Scottish winter. In January 1716, he set up court at Scone Palace. Reputedly Jane Stuart, a half-sister, came from Wisbech in England to visit him. Learning of the approach of government forces, he returned to France, sailing from Montrose on 5 February 1716. The abandonment of his rebel allies caused ill-feeling against him in Scotland; nor was he welcomed on his return to France. His patron, Louis XIV, had died on 1 September 1715, and the French government found him a political embarrassment. When France, hitherto his main protector, allied with Britain, this effectively secured the Hanoverian dynasty's monarchy over the Kingdom of Great Britain.\nCourt-in-exile.\nAfter the unsuccessful invasion of 1715, James lived in Papal territory, first at Avignon (April 1716 \u2013 February 1717), then at Pesaro (1717) and Urbino (July 1717 \u2013 November 1718). Pope Clement XI offered James the Palazzo Muti or Palazzo del Re in Rome as his residence, which he accepted. Pope Innocent XIII, like his predecessor, showed much support. Thanks to his friend Cardinal Filippo Antonio Gualterio, James was granted a life annuity of 12,000 Roman scudi. Such help enabled him to organise a Jacobite court at Rome, where, although he lived in splendour, he continued to suffer from fits of melancholy.\nFurther efforts to restore the Stuarts to the British throne were planned. In 1719 a major expedition left Spain but was forced to turn back due to weather. A small landing took place in the Scottish Highlands, but the Jacobite rising of 1719 was defeated at the Battle of Glen Shiel. James had gone to Spain in the hope he could take part in the invasion, but following its abandonment was forced to return to Italy. A further attempt was planned in 1722, but following the exposure of the Atterbury Plot it came to nothing.\nIn exercise of his pretended position, James purported to create titles of nobility, referred to as Jacobite peerages, for his British supporters and members of his court, none of which have ever been recognised in Britain.\nThe court-in-exile became a popular stop for English travellers making a Grand Tour, regardless of political affiliation. For many, it functioned as an unofficial consulate. Those in need of medical attention preferred being treated by one of their own countrymen. In 1735 court physicians tended to Edmund Sheffield, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, and thirty years later to James Boswell.\nJames remained well-treated in Rome until his death. He was allowed to hold Protestant services at Court, and was given land where his Protestant adherents could receive a public burial.\nMarriage and progeny.\nLouise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde d'Orl\u00e9ans (), daughter of Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, was at one time suggested as a wife for James, but nothing came of it. In March 1717, while James was visiting Modena, he became engaged to his cousin Benedetta d'Este, but her father Duke Rinaldo put an end to the engagement to preserve his relations with Hanover and Great Britain.\nOn 3 September 1719, James married Maria Clementina Sobieska (1702\u20131735), granddaughter of King John III Sobieski of Poland. The wedding was held in the chapel of the Episcopal Palace in Montefiascone, near Viterbo. By his wife he had two sons:\nBonnie Prince Charlie.\nFollowing James's failure, attention turned to his son Charles, \"the Young Pretender\", who led the major uprising of 1745. With the failure of this second rebellion, the Stuart hopes of regaining the British throne were effectively destroyed. James and Charles later clashed repeatedly, and relations between them broke down completely when James played a role in the appointment of his son Henry as a cardinal. Henry then took holy orders, which required him to maintain celibacy, ending the possibility that he would produce a legitimate heir, infuriating Charles, who had not been consulted.\nLater years.\nAfter the 1745 rising, there were no other plots to restore the Stuart dynasty except for when, in 1759, the French government briefly considered a scheme to have James (then aged 70) crowned King of Ireland as part of their plans to invade Britain, but the offer was never formally made to James. Several separate plans also involved Charles being given control of a French-backed independent Ireland, though that too was aborted after Charles showed up at a meeting with the French to discuss the plan late, argumentative, and idealistic in expectations, so that the French dismissed the possibility of Jacobite assistance.\nDeath.\nAfter a lingering illness, James died aged 77 on 1 January 1766, at his home, the Palazzo Muti in Rome, and was buried in the crypt of St. Peter's Basilica in present-day Vatican City. His grave is marked by the Monument to the Royal Stuarts. His claimed reign had lasted for 64 years, 3 months and 16 days, longer than any British monarch until Queen Elizabeth II's reign surpassed it on 23 May 2016.\nEnd of papal support.\nFollowing James's death the pope refused to recognise the claim to the British and Irish thrones of his elder son Charles, which had severely exacerbated the hostility between England and the Catholic Church. Instead, from 14 January 1766, in stages over the following decade, Rome accepted the Hanoverian dynasty as the legitimate rulers of Britain and Ireland; this was accompanied by a gradual relaxation and reform of the anti-Catholic \"penal laws\" in Britain and Ireland. Two months after James's death, on 14 March, the royal arms of England were removed from the doorway of the Palazzo Muti. In 1792, the papacy specifically referred to George III as the \"King of Great Britain and Ireland\", which elicited a protest from James's younger son Henry, who was by then the Jacobite claimant.\nTitles and honours.\nJames was Duke of Cornwall from birth. He was created Prince of Wales on 4 July 1688. He lost his titles on his attainder for treason in 1702.\nArms.\nAs Prince of Wales, James bore a coat of arms consisting of those of the kingdom, differenced by a \"label argent of three points\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the earliest groups of arthropods to appear in the fossil record, trilobites were among the most successful of all early animals, existing in oceans for almost 270million years, with over 22,000 species having been described. Because trilobites had wide diversity and an easily fossilized mineralised exoskeleton made of calcite, they left an extensive fossil record. The study of their fossils has facilitated important contributions to biostratigraphy, paleontology, evolutionary biology, and plate tectonics. Trilobites are placed within the clade Artiopoda, which includes many organisms that are morphologically similar to trilobites, but are largely unmineralised. The relationship of Artiopoda to other arthropods is uncertain.\nTrilobites evolved into many ecological niches; some moved over the seabed as predators, scavengers, or filter feeders, and some swam, feeding on plankton. Some even crawled onto land. Most lifestyles expected of modern marine arthropods are seen in trilobites, with the possible exception of parasitism (where scientific debate continues). Some trilobites (particularly the family Olenidae) are even thought to have evolved a symbiotic relationship with sulfur-eating bacteria from which they derived food. The largest trilobites were more than long and may have weighed as much as .\nThe first appearance of trilobites in the fossil record defines the base of the Atdabanian/Cambrian Stage 3 time period of the Early Cambrian around https://\u00a0million years ago. Trilobites were already diverse and globally dispersed shortly after their origination, with trilobites reaching an apex of diversity during the late Cambrian\u2013Ordovician, and remained diverse during the following Silurian and early Devonian. During the mid-late Devonian, their diversity strongly declined, being impacted by successive extinction events, including the Taghanic event, the Late Devonian mass extinction/Kellwasser event and the Hangenberg/end-Devonian mass extinction, wiping out most trilobite diversity and leaving Proetida as the only surviving order. Their diversity moderately recovered during the Early Carboniferous, before dropping to persistently low levels during the late Carboniferous and Permian periods, though they remained widespread until the end of their existence. The last trilobites disappeared in the end-Permian mass extinction event about 251.9million years ago, by which time only a handful of species remained. \nEvolution.\nTrilobite relatives.\nTrilobites belong to the Artiopoda, a group of extinct arthropods morphologically similar to trilobites, though only the trilobites had heavily mineralised exoskeletons. Thus, other artiopodans are typically only found in exceptionally preserved deposits, mostly during the Cambrian period.\nThe exact relationships of artiopods to other arthropods is uncertain. Some scholars consider them closely related to chelicerates (which include horseshoe crabs, sea spiders, and arachnids) as part of a clade called Arachnomorpha, while others consider them to be more closely related to Mandibulata (which contains insects, crustaceans and myriapods) as part of a clade called Antennulata.\nCladogram of Artiopoda including trilobites after Berks et al. 2023.\nFossil record of early trilobites.\nThe earliest trilobites known from the fossil record are redlichiids and ptychopariid bigotinids dated to around 520million years ago. Contenders for the earliest trilobites include \"Profallotaspis jakutensis\" (Siberia), \"Fritzaspis\" spp. (western US), \"Hupetina antiqua\" (Morocco) and \"Serrania gordaensis\" (Spain). Trilobites appeared at a roughly equivalent time in Laurentia, Siberia and West Gondwana.\nAll Olenellina lack facial sutures (see below), and this is thought to represent the original state. The earliest sutured trilobite found so far (\"Lemdadella\"), occurs almost at the same time as the earliest Olenellina, suggesting the trilobites origin lies before the start of the Atdabanian, but without leaving fossils. Other groups show secondary lost facial sutures, such as all Agnostina and some Phacopina. Another common feature of the Olenellina also suggests this suborder to be the ancestral trilobite stock: early protaspid stages have not been found, supposedly because these were not calcified, and this also is supposed to represent the original state. Earlier trilobites may be found and could shed more light on their origins.\nThree specimens of a trilobite from Morocco, \"Megistaspis hammondi\", dated 478million years old contain fossilized soft parts. In 2024, researchers discovered soft tissues and other structures including the labrum in well-preserved trilobite specimens from Cambrian Stage 4 of Morocco, providing new anatomical information regarding the external and internal morphology of trilobites, and the cause of such extraordinary preservation is probably due to their rapid death after an underwater pyroclastic flow.\nDivergence and extinction.\nTrilobites saw great diversification over time. For such a long-lasting group of animals, it is no surprise that trilobite evolutionary history is marked by a number of extinction events where some groups perished, and surviving groups diversified to fill ecological niches with comparable or unique adaptations. Generally, trilobites maintained high diversity levels throughout the Cambrian and Ordovician periods before entering a drawn-out decline in the Devonian, culminating in the final extinction of the last few survivors at the end of the Permian period.\nEvolutionary trends.\nPrincipal evolutionary trends from primitive morphologies, such as exemplified by \"Eoredlichia\", include the origin of new types of eyes, improvement of enrollment and articulation mechanisms, increased size of pygidium (micropygy to isopygy), and development of extreme spinosity in certain groups. Changes also included narrowing of the thorax and increasing or decreasing numbers of thoracic segments. Specific changes to the cephalon are also noted; variable glabella size and shape, position of eyes and facial sutures, and hypostome specialization. Several morphologies appeared independently within different major taxa (e.g. eye reduction or miniaturization).\nEffacement, the loss of surface detail in the cephalon, pygidium, or the thoracic furrows, is also a common evolutionary trend. Notable examples of this were the orders Agnostida and Asaphida, and the suborder Illaenina of the Corynexochida. Effacement is believed to be an indication of either a burrowing lifestyle or a pelagic one. Effacement poses a problem for taxonomists since the loss of details (particularly of the glabella) can make the determination of phylogenetic relationships difficult.\nCambrian.\nAlthough it has historically been suggested that trilobites originated during the Precambrian this is no longer supported, and it is thought that trilobites originated shortly before they appeared in the fossil record. Very shortly after trilobite fossils appeared in the lower Cambrian, they rapidly diversified into the major orders that typified the Cambrian\u2014Redlichiida, Ptychopariida, Agnostida, and Corynexochida. The first major crisis in the trilobite fossil record occurred in the Middle Cambrian; surviving orders developed isopygius or macropygius bodies and developed thicker cuticles, allowing better defense against predators (see Thorax below). The Late Cambrian marks the beginning of the apex of trilobite diversity. The end-Cambrian mass extinction event marked a major change in trilobite fauna; almost all Redlichiida (including the Olenelloidea) and most Late Cambrian stocks became extinct. A continuing decrease in Laurentian continental shelf area is recorded at the same time as the extinctions, suggesting major environmental upheaval.\nNotable trilobite genera appearing in the Cambrian include:\nOrdovician.\nThe Early Ordovician is marked by vigorous radiations of articulate brachiopods, bryozoans, bivalves, echinoderms, and graptolites, with many groups appearing in the fossil record for the first time. Although intra-species trilobite diversity seems to have peaked during the Cambrian, trilobites were still active participants in the Ordovician radiation event, with a new fauna taking over from the old Cambrian one. Phacopida and Trinucleioidea are characteristic forms, highly differentiated and diverse, most with uncertain ancestors. The Phacopida and other \"new\" clades almost certainly had Cambrian forebears, but the fact that they have avoided detection is a strong indication that novel morphologies were developing very rapidly. Changes within the trilobite fauna during the Ordovician foreshadowed the mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician, allowing many families to continue into the Silurian with little disturbance. Ordovician trilobites were successful at exploiting new environments, notably reefs. The Ordovician mass extinction did not leave the trilobites unscathed; some distinctive and previously successful forms such as the Telephinidae and Agnostida became extinct. The Ordovician marks the last great diversification period amongst the trilobites: very few entirely new patterns of organisation arose post-Ordovician. Later evolution in trilobites was largely a matter of variations upon the Ordovician themes. By the Ordovician mass extinction, vigorous trilobite radiation has stopped, and gradual decline is foreshadowed. The Ordovician marks the apex of trilobite morphological and species diversity.\nSome of the genera of Trilobites appearing in the Ordovician include:\nSilurian and Devonian.\nMost Early Silurian families constitute a subgroup of the Late Ordovician fauna. Few, if any, of the dominant Early Ordovician fauna survived to the end of the Ordovician, yet 74% of the dominant Late Ordovician trilobite fauna survived the Ordovician. Late Ordovician survivors account for all post-Ordovician trilobite groups except the Harpetida. Silurian and Devonian trilobite assemblages are superficially similar to Ordovician assemblages, dominated by Lichida and Phacopida (including the well-known Calymenina). The Silurian diversity of trilobites was high during the Llandovery and Wenlock, though there was a sharp drop during the Pridoli at the end of the period, followed by a diversification during the Early Devonian, reaching a high point of 180 trilobite genera during the Emsian stage.\nThe Middle-Late Devonian was a decisive turning point in trilobite history, with the Taghanic event during the Givetian sharply decreasing trilobite diversity, particularly in shallow water environments, which was followed by the Late Devonian mass extinction/Kellwasser event (involving a combination of sea level change and marine anoxia) at the Frasnian\u2013Famennian boundary, widely regarded as one of the most significant mass extinction events in Earth's history, decimating the group's diversity including the extinction of the orders Corynexochida, Harpetida and Odontopleurida, with the low trilobite diversity in its aftermath in the Famennian, consisting only of the orders Phacopida and Proetida, being again strongly impacted by the Hangenberg event (also called the end-Devonian mass extinction) at the end of the Devonian, with both shallow water and deep water trilobites being affected. Only a single order, the Proetida, survived into the Carboniferous.\nGenera of trilobites during the Silurian and Devonian periods include:\nCarboniferous and Permian.\nThe Proetida, the only trilobite order to survive the end of the Devonian, continued through the Carboniferous period and lasted until the end of the Permian (when the vast majority of species on Earth were wiped out). Proetids are generally morphologically homogeneous (similar to each other), having a generally conservative bodyform, and were probably all predators or scavengers. Trilobites rapidly diversified during the earliest Carboniferous (Tournasian), reaching diversity levels unseen since prior to the Taghanic event, though most of this diversification was of the family Phillipsiidae, with other trilobite families barely rebounding. During the Serpukhovian at the end of the Early Carboniferous, trilobite diversity again strongly declined, and trilobite diversity remained stagnantly low throughout the late Carboniferous. Trilobite diversity may have been affected by ecological changes during the Carboniferous, such as the rise of durophagous fish with crushing mouthparts.\nBy the end of the Carboniferous, the diversity of trilobites had dropped to only 1.8\u20132.2% (around 7 genera) of the peak diversity it had had during the early Paleozoic, with this low diversity continuing into the Permian. During the Permian period, while trilobites were widespread and occurred in a variety of environments, they were typically rare components of local faunas, in sharp contrast to their often great abundance earlier in the Paleozoic. Permian trilobite diversity reached a peak during the Guadalupian with diversity sharply dropping by the beginning of the following Lopingian.\nSome of the genera of trilobites during the Carboniferous and Permian periods include:\nFinal extinction.\nAt the end of the Permian (Changhsingian), only two genera of trilobites remained extant, \"Acropyge\" and \"Pseudophillipsia.\" Late Permian trilobites primarily occurred in shallow marine carbonate platform environments, but were also found in deep water, and were widespread, ranging towards the poles. \nExactly why the trilobites became extinct is not clear; with repeated extinction events (often followed by apparent recovery) throughout the trilobite fossil record, a combination of causes is likely. After the extinction event at the end of the Devonian period, what trilobite diversity remained was bottlenecked into the order Proetida. Decreasing diversity of genera limited to shallow-water shelf habitats coupled with a drastic lowering of sea level (regression) meant that the final decline of trilobites happened shortly before the end Permian mass extinction event. With so many marine species involved in the Permian extinction, the end of nearly 300million successful years for the trilobites would not have been unexpected at the time.\nFossil distribution.\nTrilobites appear to have been primarily marine organisms, since the fossilized remains of trilobites are always found in rocks containing fossils of other salt-water animals such as brachiopods, crinoids, and corals. Some trackways suggest trilobites made at least temporary excursions onto land. Within the marine paleoenvironment, trilobites were found in a broad range from extremely shallow water to very deep water. Trilobites, like brachiopods, crinoids, and corals, are found on all modern continents, and occupied every ancient ocean from which Paleozoic fossils have been collected. The remnants of trilobites can range from the preserved body to pieces of the exoskeleton, which it shed in the process known as ecdysis. In addition, the tracks left behind by trilobites living on the sea floor are often preserved as trace fossils.\nThere are three main forms of trace fossils associated with trilobites: \"Rusophycus\", \"Cruziana\" and \"Diplichnites\"\u2014such trace fossils represent the preserved life activity of trilobites active upon the sea floor. \"Rusophycus\", the resting trace, are trilobite excavations involving little or no forward movement and ethological interpretations suggest resting, protection and hunting. \"Cruziana\", the feeding trace, are furrows through the sediment, which are believed to represent the movement of trilobites while deposit feeding. Many of the \"Diplichnites\" fossils are believed to be traces made by trilobites walking on the sediment surface. Care must be taken as similar trace fossils are recorded in freshwater and post-Paleozoic deposits, representing non-trilobite origins.\nTrilobite fossils are found worldwide, with thousands of known species. Because they appeared quickly in geological time, and moulted like other arthropods, trilobites serve as excellent index fossils, enabling geologists to date the age of the rocks in which they are found. They were among the first fossils to attract widespread attention, and new species are being discovered every year.\nIn the United States, the best open-to-the-public collection of trilobites is located in Hamburg, New York. The shale quarry, informally known as Penn Dixie, stopped mining in the 1960s. The large amounts of trilobites were discovered in the 1970s by Dan Cooper. As a well-known rock collector, he incited scientific and public interest in the location. The fossils are dated to the Givetian (387.2\u2013382.7million years ago) when the Western New York Region was 30 degrees south of the equator and completely covered in water. The site was purchased from Vincent C. Bonerb by the Town of Hamburg with the cooperation of the Hamburg Natural History Society to protect the land from development. In 1994, the quarry became Penn Dixie Fossil Park &amp; Nature Reserve when they received 501(c)3 status and was opened for visitation and collection of trilobite samples. The two most common found samples are \"Eldredgeops rana\" and \"Greenops\".\nA famous location for trilobite fossils in the United Kingdom is Wren's Nest, Dudley, in the West Midlands, where \"Calymene blumenbachii\" is found in the Silurian Wenlock Group. This trilobite is featured on the town's coat of arms and was named the \"Dudley Bug\" or \"Dudley Locust\" by quarrymen who once worked the now abandoned limestone quarries. Llandrindod Wells, Powys, Wales, is another famous trilobite location. The well-known \"Elrathia kingi\" trilobite is found in abundance in the Cambrian Wheeler Shale of Utah.\nSpectacularly preserved trilobite fossils, often showing soft body parts (legs, gills, antennae, etc.) have been found in British Columbia, Canada (the Cambrian Burgess Shale and similar localities); New York, US (Ordovician Walcott\u2013Rust quarry, near Russia, New York, and Beecher's Trilobite Bed, near Rome, New York); China (Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shales near Chengjiang); Germany (the Devonian Hunsr\u00fcck Slates near Bundenbach) and, much more rarely, in trilobite-bearing strata in Utah (Wheeler Shale and other formations), Ontario, and Manuels River, Newfoundland and Labrador.\nSites in Morocco also yield very well-preserved trilobites, many buried in mudslides alive and so perfectly preserved. An industry has developed around their recovery, leading to controversies about practices in restoral. The variety of eye and upper body forms and fragile protuberances is best known from these samples preserved similarly to bodies in Pompeii.\nThe French palaeontologist Joachim Barrande (1799\u20131883) carried out his landmark study of trilobites in the Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian of Bohemia, publishing the first volume of \"Syst\u00e8me silurien du centre de la Boh\u00eame\" in 1852.\nImportance.\nThe study of Paleozoic trilobites in the Welsh-English borders by Niles Eldredge was fundamental in formulating and testing punctuated equilibrium as a mechanism of evolution.\nIdentification of the 'Atlantic' and 'Pacific' trilobite faunas in North America and Europe implied the closure of the Iapetus Ocean (producing the Iapetus suture), thus providing important supporting evidence for the theory of continental drift.\nTrilobites have been important in estimating the rate of speciation during the period known as the Cambrian explosion because they are the most diverse group of metazoans known from the fossil record of the early Cambrian.\nTrilobites are excellent stratigraphic markers of the Cambrian period: researchers who find trilobites with alimentary prosopon, and a micropygium, have found Early Cambrian strata. Most of the Cambrian stratigraphy is based on the use of trilobite marker fossils.\nTrilobites are the state fossils of Ohio (\"Isotelus\"), Wisconsin (\"Calymene celebra\") and Pennsylvania (\"Phacops rana\").\nTaxonomy.\nThe 10 most commonly recognized trilobite orders are Agnostida, Redlichiida, Corynexochida, Lichida, Odontopleurida, Phacopida, Proetida, Asaphida, Harpetida and Ptychopariida. In 2020, an 11th order, Trinucleida, was proposed to be elevated out of the asaphid superfamily Trinucleioidea. Sometimes the Nektaspida are considered trilobites, but these lack a calcified exoskeleton and eyes. Some scholars have proposed that the order Agnostida is polyphyletic, with the suborder Agnostina representing non-trilobite arthropods unrelated to the suborder Eodiscina. Under this hypothesis, Eodiscina would be elevated to a new order, Eodiscida.\nOver 22,000 species of trilobite have been described.\nDespite their rich fossil record with thousands of described genera found throughout the world, the taxonomy and phylogeny of trilobites have many uncertainties. Except possibly for the members of the orders Phacopida and Lichida (which first appear during the early Ordovician), nine of the eleven trilobite orders appear prior to the end of the Cambrian. Most scientists believe that order Redlichiida, more specifically its suborder Redlichiina, contains a common ancestor of all other orders, with the possible exception of the Agnostina. While many potential phylogenies are found in the literature, most have suborder Redlichiina giving rise to orders Corynexochida and Ptychopariida during the Lower Cambrian, and the Lichida descending from either the Redlichiida or Corynexochida in the Middle Cambrian. Order Ptychopariida is the most problematic order for trilobite classification. In the 1959 Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, what are now members of orders Ptychopariida, Asaphida, Proetida and Harpetida were grouped together as order Ptychopariida; subclass Librostoma was erected in 1990 to encompass all of these orders, based on their shared ancestral character of a natant (unattached) hypostome. The most recently recognized of the nine trilobite orders, Harpetida, was erected in 2002. The progenitor of order Phacopida is unclear.\nMorphology.\nWhen trilobites are found, only the exoskeleton is preserved (often in an incomplete state) in all but a handful of locations. A few locations (\"\") preserve identifiable soft body parts (legs, gills, musculature &amp; digestive tract) and enigmatic traces of other structures (e.g. fine details of eye structure) as well as the exoskeleton. Of the 20,000 known species only 38 have fossils with preserved appendages.\nTrilobites range in length from minute at less than to very large at over , with an average size range of . Supposedly the smallest species is \"Acanthopleurella stipulae\" with a maximum of . The world's largest-known trilobite specimen, assigned to \"Isotelus rex\" is in length. It was found in 1998 by Canadian scientists in Ordovician rocks on the shores of Hudson Bay. However, a partial specimen of the Ordovician trilobite \"Hungioides bohemicus\" found in 2009 in Arouca, Portugal is estimated to have measured when complete in length.\nOnly the upper (dorsal) part of their exoskeleton is mineralized, composed of calcite and calcium phosphate minerals in a lattice of chitin, and is curled round the lower edge to produce a small fringe called the \"doublure\". Their appendages and soft underbelly were non-mineralized. \n Three distinctive \"tagmata\" (sections) are present: cephalon (head); thorax (body) and pygidium (tail).\nTerminology.\nAs might be expected for a group of animals comprising c.\u20095,000 genera, the morphology and description of trilobites can be complex. Despite morphological complexity and an unclear position within higher classifications, there are a number of characteristics which distinguish the trilobites from other arthropods: a generally sub-elliptical, dorsal, chitinous exoskeleton divided longitudinally into three distinct lobes (from which the group gets its name); having a distinct, relatively large head shield (cephalon) articulating axially with a thorax comprising articulated transverse segments, the hindmost of which are almost invariably fused to form a tail shield (pygidium). When describing differences between trilobite taxa, the presence, size, and shape of the cephalic features are often mentioned.\nDuring moulting, the exoskeleton generally splits between the head and thorax, which is why so many trilobite fossils are missing one or the other. In most groups facial sutures on the cephalon helped facilitate moulting. Similar to lobsters and crabs, trilobites would have physically \"grown\" between the moult stage and the hardening of the new exoskeleton.\nCephalon.\nA trilobite's cephalon, or head section, is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity. The glabella forms a dome underneath which sat the \"crop\" or \"stomach\". Generally, the exoskeleton has few distinguishing ventral features, but the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and occasionally the hypostome, a small rigid plate comparable to the ventral plate in other arthropods. A toothless mouth and stomach sat upon the hypostome with the mouth facing backward at the rear edge of the hypostome.\nHypostome morphology is highly variable; sometimes supported by an un-mineralised membrane (natant), sometimes fused onto the anterior doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the anterior doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent). Many variations in shape and placement of the hypostome have been described. The size of the glabella and the lateral fringe of the cephalon, together with hypostome variation, have been linked to different lifestyles, diets and specific ecological niches.\nThe anterior and lateral fringe of the cephalon is greatly enlarged in the Harpetida, in other species a bulge in the pre-glabellar area is preserved that suggests a brood pouch. Highly complex compound eyes are another obvious feature of the cephalon.\nFacial sutures.\nFacial or cephalic sutures are the natural fracture lines in the cephalon of trilobites. Their function was to assist the trilobite in shedding its old exoskeleton during ecdysis (or molting).\nAll species assigned to the suborder Olenellina, that became extinct at the very end of the Early Cambrian (like \"Fallotaspis\", \"Nevadia\", \"Judomia\", and \"Olenellus\") lacked facial sutures. They are believed to have never developed facial sutures, having pre-dated their evolution. Because of this (along with other primitive characteristics), they are thought to be the earliest ancestors of later trilobites.\nSome other later trilobites also lost facial sutures secondarily. The type of sutures found in different species are used extensively in the taxonomy and phylogeny of trilobites.\nDorsal sutures.\nThe dorsal surface of the trilobite cephalon (the frontmost tagma, or the 'head') can be divided into two regions\u2014the cranidium and the librigena (\"free cheeks\"). The cranidium can be further divided into the glabella (the central lobe in the cephalon) and the fixigena (\"fixed cheeks\"). The facial sutures lie along the anterior edge, at the division between the cranidium and the librigena.\nTrilobite facial sutures on the dorsal side can be roughly divided into five main types according to where the sutures end relative to the genal angle (the edges where the side and rear margins of the cephalon converge).\nThe primitive state of the dorsal sutures is proparian. Opisthoparian sutures have developed several times independently. There are no examples of proparian sutures developing in taxa with opisthoparian ancestry. Trilobites that exhibit opisthoparian sutures as adults commonly have proparian sutures as instars (known exceptions being \"Yunnanocephalus\" and \"Duyunaspis\"). Hypoparian sutures have also arisen independently in several groups of trilobites.\nThe course of the facial sutures from the front of the visual surface varies at least as strongly as it does in the rear, but the lack of a clear reference point similar to the genal angle makes it difficult to categorize. One of the more pronounced states is that the front of the facial sutures do not cut the lateral or frontal border on its own, but coincide in front of the glabella, and cut the frontal border at the midline. This is, inter alia, the case in the Asaphida. Even more pronounced is the situation that the frontal branches of the facial sutures end in each other, resulting in yoked free cheeks. This is known in \"Triarthrus\", and in the Phacopidae, but in that family the facial sutures are not functional, as can be concluded from the fact that free cheeks are not found separated from the cranidium.\nThere are also two types of sutures in the dorsal surface connected to the compound eyes of trilobites. They are:\nVentral sutures.\nDorsal facial sutures continue downward to the ventral side of the cephalon where they become the Connective sutures that divide the doublure. The following are the types of ventral sutures.\nRostrum.\nThe rostrum (or the rostral plate) is a distinct part of the doublure located at the front of the cephalon. It is separated from the rest of the doublure by the rostral suture.\nDuring molting in trilobites like \"Paradoxides\", the rostrum is used to anchor the front part of the trilobite as the cranidium separates from the librigena. The opening created by the arching of the body provides an exit for the molting trilobite.\nIt is absent in some trilobites like \"Lachnostoma\".\nHypostome.\n The hypostome is the hard mouthpart of the trilobite found on the ventral side of the cephalon typically below the glabella. The hypostome can be classified into three types based on whether they are permanently attached to the rostrum or not and whether they are aligned to the anterior dorsal tip of the glabella.\nThorax.\nThe thorax is a series of articulated segments that lie between the cephalon and pygidium. The number of segments varies between 2 and 103 with most species in the 2 to 16 range.\nEach segment consists of the central axial ring and the outer pleurae, which protected the limbs and gills. The pleurae are sometimes abbreviated or extended to form long spines. Apodemes are bulbous projections on the ventral surface of the exoskeleton to which most leg muscles attached, although some leg muscles attached directly to the exoskeleton. Determining a junction between thorax and pygidium can be difficult and many segment counts suffer from this problem.\nVolvation.\nTrilobite fossils are often found \"enrolled\" (curled up) like modern pill bugs for protection; evidence suggests enrollment (\"volvation\") helped protect against the inherent weakness of the arthropod cuticle that was exploited by anomalocarid predators. The earliest evidence of volvation is a little over 510million years old and has been found in Olenellidae, but these forms did not have any of the interlocking mechanisms found in later trilobites.\nSome trilobites achieved a fully closed capsule (e.g. \"Phacops\"), while others with long pleural spines (e.g. \"Selenopeltis\") left a gap at the sides or those with a small pygidium (e.g. \"Paradoxides\") left a gap between the cephalon and pygidium. In \"Phacops\", the pleurae overlap a smooth bevel (facet) allowing a close seal with the doublure. The doublure carries a Panderian notch or protuberance on each segment to prevent over rotation and achieve a good seal. Even in an agnostid, with only 2 articulating thoracic segments, the process of enrollment required a complex musculature to contract the exoskeleton and return to the flat condition.\nPygidium.\nThe pygidium is formed from a number of segments and the telson fused together. Segments in the pygidium are similar to the thoracic segments (bearing biramous limbs) but are not articulated. Trilobites can be described based on the pygidium being micropygous (pygidium smaller than cephalon), subisopygous (pygidium sub equal to cephalon), isopygous (pygidium equal in size to cephalon), or macropygous (pygidium larger than cephalon).\nProsopon (surface sculpture).\nTrilobite exoskeletons show a variety of small-scale structures collectively called prosopon. Prosopon does not include large scale extensions of the cuticle (e.g. hollow pleural spines) but to finer scale features, such as ribbing, domes, pustules, pitting, ridging and perforations. The exact purpose of the prosopon is not resolved but suggestions include structural strengthening, sensory pits or hairs, preventing predator attacks and maintaining aeration while enrolled. In one example, alimentary ridge networks (easily visible in Cambrian trilobites) might have been either digestive or respiratory tubes in the cephalon and other regions.\nSpines.\nSome trilobites such as those of the order Lichida evolved elaborate spiny forms, from the Ordovician until the end of the Devonian period. Examples of these specimens have been found in the Hamar Laghdad Formation of Alnif in Morocco. Spectacular spined trilobites have also been found in western Russia; Oklahoma, US; and Ontario, Canada.\nSome trilobites had horns on their heads similar to several modern beetles. Based on the size, location, and shape of the horns it has been suggested that these horns may have been used to combat for mates. Horns were widespread in the family Raphiophoridae (Asaphida).\nAnother function of these spines was protection from predators. When enrolled, trilobite spines offered additional protection.\nThis conclusion is likely to be applicable to other trilobites as well, such as in the Phacopid trilobite genus \"Walliserops,\" that developed spectacular tridents.\nSoft body parts.\nOnly 21 or so species are described from which soft body parts are preserved, so some features (e.g. the posterior antenniform cerci preserved only in \"Olenoides serratus\") remain difficult to assess in the wider picture.\nAppendages.\nTrilobites had a single pair of preoral antennae and otherwise undifferentiated biramous limbs (four cephalic pairs, followed by one pair per thoracic segment and some pygidium pairs). Each endopodite (walking leg) had six or seven segments, homologous to other early arthropods. Endopodites are attached to the coxa, which also bore a feather-like exopodite, or gill branch, which was used for respiration and, in some species, swimming. A 2021 study found that the upper limb branch of trilobites is a \"well-developed gill\" that oxygenates the hemolymph, comparable to the book gill in modern horseshoe crab \"Limulus\". In \"Olenoides\", the partially articulated junction with the body is distinct from the exopods of Chelicerata or Crustacea. The inside of the coxa (or gnathobase) carries spines, probably to process prey items. The last exopodite segment usually had claws or spines. Many examples of hairs on the legs suggest adaptations for feeding (as for the gnathobases) or sensory organs to help with walking.\nDigestive tract and diet.\nThe toothless mouth of trilobites was situated on the rear edge of the hypostome (facing backward), in front of the legs attached to the cephalon. The mouth is linked by a small esophagus to the stomach that lay forward of the mouth, below the glabella. The \"intestine\" led backward from there to the pygidium. The \"feeding limbs\" attached to the cephalon are thought to have fed food into the mouth, possibly \"slicing\" the food on the hypostome and/or gnathobases first. Recent propagation phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography, or (PPC-SR\u03bcCT), which is a 3d imagining of tissue related to an organism's function, of a sample of \"Bohemolichas incola\" show large concentrations of undigestible fragments of \"Conchoprimitia osekensis,\" a small-shelled species now extinct\",\" in the \"B.\u00a0incola\" sample digestive tract.\nThe fragments are indicative of durophagous predation (shell crushing). As the composition of the shells found were not taxonomically significant, rather based on physical properties regarding the shell strength and size, \"B.\u00a0incola\" was opportunistic for food classifying feeding habits to be similar to scavengers. The remains of shells address another digestive aspect of \"B.\u00a0incola\", in the enzymatic ways in which these indigestible shells were siphoned out of little nutrition leaving only fragments behind. These remnants build on the concept of early Trilobites potentially having glands that secrete enzymes that aid in the digestive process.\nInternal organs.\nWhile there is direct and implied evidence for the presence and location of the mouth, stomach and digestive tract (see above) the presence of heart, brain and liver are only implied (although \"present\" in many reconstructions) with little direct geological evidence.\nMusculature.\nAlthough rarely preserved, long lateral muscles extended from the cephalon to midway down the pygidium, attaching to the axial rings allowing enrollment while separate muscles on the legs tucked them out of the way.\nSensory organs.\nMany trilobites had complex eyes; they also had a pair of antennae. Some trilobites were blind, probably living too deep in the sea for light to reach them. As such, they became secondarily blind in this branch of trilobite evolution. Other trilobites (e.g., \"Phacops rana\" and \"Erbenochile erbeni\") had large eyes that were for use in well lit, predator-filled waters.\nAntennae.\nThe pair of antennae suspected in most trilobites (and preserved in a few examples) were highly flexible to allow them to be retracted when the trilobite was enrolled. One species (\"Olenoides serratus\") preserves antenna-like cerci, which project from the rear of the trilobite.\nEyes.\nEven the earliest trilobites had complex, compound eyes with lenses made of calcite (a characteristic of all trilobite eyes), confirming that the eyes of arthropods and probably other animals could have developed before the Cambrian. Improving eyesight of both predator and prey in marine environments has been suggested as one of the evolutionary pressures furthering an apparent rapid development of new life forms during what is known as the Cambrian explosion.\nTrilobite eyes were typically compound, with each lens being an elongated prism. The number of lenses in such an eye varied: some trilobites had only one, while some had thousands of lenses in a single eye. In compound eyes, the lenses were typically arranged hexagonally. The fossil record of trilobite eyes is complete enough that their evolution can be studied through time, which compensates to some extent for the lack of preservation of soft internal parts.\nLenses of trilobites' eyes were made of calcite (calcium carbonate, CaCO3). Pure forms of calcite are transparent, and some trilobites used crystallographically oriented, clear calcite crystals to form each lens of each eye. Rigid calcite lenses would have been unable to accommodate to a change of focus like the soft lens in a human eye would; in some trilobites, the calcite formed an internal doublet structure, giving superb depth of field and minimal spherical aberration, according to optical principles discovered by French scientist Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens in the 17th century. A living species with similar lenses is the brittle star \"Ophiocoma wendtii\".\nIn other trilobites, with a Huygens interface apparently missing, a gradient-index lens is invoked with the refractive index of the lens changing toward the center.\nSublensar sensory structures have been found in the eyes of some phacopid trilobites. The structures consist of what appear to be several sensory cells surrounding a rhadomeric structure, resembling closely the sublensar structures found in the eyes of many modern arthropod apposition eyes, especially \"Limulus\", a genus of horseshoe crabs.\nSecondary blindness is not uncommon, particularly in long lived groups such as the Agnostida and Trinucleioidea. In Proetida and Phacopina from western Europe and particularly Tropidocoryphinae from France (where there is good stratigraphic control), there are well studied trends showing progressive eye reduction between closely related species that eventually leads to blindness.\nSeveral other structures on trilobites have been explained as photo-receptors. Of particular interest are \"macula\", the small areas of thinned cuticle on the underside of the hypostome. In some trilobites macula are suggested to function as simple \"ventral eyes\" that could have detected night and day or allowed a trilobite to navigate while swimming (or turned) upside down.\nSensory pits.\nThere are several types of prosopon that have been suggested as sensory apparatus collecting chemical or vibrational signals. The connection between large pitted fringes on the cephalon of Harpetida and Trinucleoidea with corresponding small or absent eyes makes for an interesting possibility of the fringe as a \"compound ear\".\nDevelopment.\nTrilobites grew through successive moult stages called instars, in which existing segments increased in size and new trunk segments appeared at a sub-terminal generative zone during the anamorphic phase of development. This was followed by the epimorphic developmental phase, in which the animal continued to grow and moult, but no new trunk segments were expressed in the exoskeleton. The combination of anamorphic and epimorphic growth constitutes the hemianamorphic developmental mode that is common among many living arthropods.\nTrilobite development was unusual in the way in which articulations developed between segments, and changes in the development of articulation gave rise to the conventionally recognized developmental phases of the trilobite life cycle (divided into three stages), which are not readily-comparable with those of other arthropods. Actual growth and change in external form of the trilobite would have occurred when the trilobite was soft shelled, following moulting and before the next exoskeleton hardened.\nTrilobite larvae are known from the Cambrian to the Carboniferous and from all sub-orders. As instars from closely related taxa are more similar than instars from distantly related taxa, trilobite larvae provide morphological information important in evaluating high-level phylogenetic relationships among trilobites.\nDespite the absence of supporting fossil evidence, their similarity to living arthropods has led to the belief that trilobites multiplied sexually and produced eggs.\nSome species may have kept eggs or larvae in a brood pouch forward of the glabella, particularly when the ecological niche was challenging to larvae. Size and morphology of the first calcified stage are highly variable between (but not within) trilobite taxa, suggesting some trilobites passed through more growth within the egg than others. Early developmental stages prior to calcification of the exoskeleton are a possibility (suggested for fallotaspids), but so is calcification and hatching coinciding.\nThe earliest post-embryonic trilobite growth stage known with certainty are the \"protaspid\" stages (anamorphic phase). Starting with an indistinguishable proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (anaprotaspid) a number of changes occur ending with a transverse furrow separating the proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (metaprotaspid) that can continue to add segments. Segments are added at the posterior part of the pygidium, but all segments remain fused together.\nThe \"meraspid\" stages (anamorphic phase) are marked by the appearance of an articulation between the head and the fused trunk. Prior to the onset of the first meraspid stage the animal had a two-part structure\u2014the head and the plate of fused trunk segments, the pygidium. During the meraspid stages, new segments appeared near the rear of the pygidium as well as additional articulations developing at the front of the pygidium, releasing freely articulating segments into the thorax. Segments are generally added one per moult (although two per moult and one every alternate moult are also recorded), with number of stages equal to the number of thoracic segments. A substantial amount of growth, from less than 25% up to 30%\u201340%, probably took place in the meraspid stages.\nThe \"holaspid\" stages (epimorphic phase) commence when a stable, mature number of segments has been released into the thorax. Moulting continued during the holaspid stages, with no changes in thoracic segment number. Some trilobites are suggested to have continued moulting and growing throughout the life of the individual, albeit at a slower rate on reaching maturity.\nSome trilobites showed a marked transition in morphology at one particular instar, which has been called \"trilobite metamorphosis\". Radical change in morphology is linked to the loss or gain of distinctive features that mark a change in mode of life. A change in lifestyle during development has significance in terms of evolutionary pressure, as the trilobite could pass through several ecological niches on the way to adult development and changes would strongly affect survivorship and dispersal of trilobite taxa. It is worth noting that trilobites with all protaspid stages solely planktonic and later meraspid stages benthic (e.g. asaphids) failed to last through the Ordovician extinctions, while trilobites that were planktonic for only the first protaspid stage before metamorphosing into benthic forms survived (e.g. lichids, phacopids). Pelagic larval life-style proved ill-adapted to the rapid onset of global climatic cooling and loss of tropical shelf habitats during the Ordovician.\nThere is no evidence that trilobites reabsorbed their exoskeletons during moulting. Some authors have argued that the failure of trilobites to reabsorb their mineralised exoskeletons when they moulted was a functional disadvantage when compared to modern arthropods that generally do reabsorb their cuticles, as it took substantially longer to reconstruct their exoskeletons, making them more vulnerable to predators.\nHistory of usage and research.\nRev. Edward Lhwyd published in 1698 in The \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\", the oldest scientific journal in the English language, part of his letter \"Concerning Several Regularly Figured Stones Lately Found by Him\", that was accompanied by a page of etchings of fossils. One of his etchings depicted a trilobite he found near Llandeilo, probably on the grounds of Lord Dynefor's castle, he described as \"the skeleton of some flat Fish\".\nThe discovery of \"Calymene blumenbachii\" (the Dudley locust) in 1749 by Charles Lyttleton, could be identified as the beginning of trilobite research. Lyttleton submitted a letter to the Royal Society of London in 1750 concerning a \"petrified insect\" he found in the \"limestone pits at Dudley\". In 1754, Manuel Mendez da Costa proclaimed that the Dudley locust was not an insect, but instead belonged to \"the crustaceous tribe of animals\". He proposed to call the Dudley specimens \"Pediculus marinus major trilobos\" (large trilobed marine louse), a name which lasted well into the 19th century. German naturalist Johann Walch, who executed the first inclusive study of this group, proposed the use of the name \"trilobite\". He considered it appropriate to derive the name from the unique three-lobed character of the central axis and a pleural zone to each side.\nWritten descriptions of trilobites date possibly from the third century BC and definitely from the fourth century AD. The Spanish geologists Eladio Li\u00f1\u00e1n and Rodolfo Gozalo argue that some of the fossils described in Greek and Latin lapidaries as scorpion stone, beetle stone, and ant stone, refer to trilobite fossils. Less ambiguous references to trilobite fossils can be found in Chinese sources. Fossils from the Kushan formation of northeastern China were prized as inkstones and decorative pieces.\nIn the New World, American fossil hunters found plentiful deposits of \"Elrathia kingi\" in western Utah in the 1860s. Until the early 1900s, the Ute Native Americans of Utah wore these trilobites, which they called \"pachavee\" (little water bug), as amulets. A hole was bored in the head and the fossil was worn on a string. According to the Ute themselves, trilobite necklaces protect against bullets and diseases such as diphtheria. In 1931, Frank Beckwith uncovered evidence of the Ute use of trilobites. Travelling through the badlands, he photographed two petroglyphs that most likely represent trilobites. On the same trip he examined a burial, of unknown age, with a drilled trilobite fossil lying in the chest cavity of the interred. Since then, trilobite amulets have been found all over the Great Basin, as well as in British Columbia and Australia.\nIn the 1880s, archaeologists discovered in the Grotte du Trilobite (Caves of Arcy-sur-Cure, Yonne, France) a much-handled trilobite fossil that had been drilled as if to be worn as a pendant. The occupation stratum in which the trilobite was found has been dated as 15,000 years old. Because the pendant was handled so much, the species of trilobite cannot be determined. This type of trilobite is not found around Yonne, so it may have been highly prized and traded from elsewhere.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
