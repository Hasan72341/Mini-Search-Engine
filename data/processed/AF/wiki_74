It was later ported to numerous other platforms. The game was programmed by Russell Kay, Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In any given level, the player must save a specified number or percentage of the lemmings in order to advance. To this end, the player must decide how to assign limited quantities of eight different skills to individual lemmings, allowing them to alter the landscape and/or their own behaviour so that enough of the lemmings can reach the exit safely.\n\"Lemmings\" was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second-highest-rated game in the history of \"Amstrad Action\", and was considered the eighth-greatest game of all time by \"Next Generation\" in 1996. \"Lemmings\" is also one of the most widely ported video games, and is estimated to have sold around 20 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several other \"Lemmings\" games, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games. Despite its success, \"Lemmings\" lost considerable popularity by the late 1990s, which was attributed in part to its slow pace of gameplay compared to games of later generations.\nGameplay.\n\"Lemmings\" is divided into a number of levels, grouped into four difficulty categories. Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other. Levels include a variety of obstacles that prevent lemmings from reaching the exit, such as large drops, booby traps and pools of lava.\nThe goal of each level is to guide at least a portion of the green-haired, blue-robed lemmings from the entrance to the exit by clearing or creating a safe passage through the landscape for the lemmings to use. Unless assigned a special task, a lemming will walk in one direction ignoring any other lemming in its way (except Blockers), falling off any edges and turning around if it hits an obstacle it cannot pass. A lemming can die in a number of ways: falling from too great a height, drowning or falling into lava, falling off the bottom edge of the screen, being caught in a trap or fire, or being assigned the Bomber skill for five seconds. Every level has a time limit; if the timer expires, all the lemmings explode (even non-Bombers), the level ends, and the player is evaluated on the number of lemmings rescued.\nTo successfully complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills and how many uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings. There are eight skills that can be assigned: Climbers climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang. Floaters use a parachute to fall safely from heights. Bombers explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. Blockers stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. Builders build a stairway of 12 steps, but will stop building when either it hits its head, runs out of bricks, or when the stairway hits a solid object. Bashers, Miners and Diggers tunnel horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively, but cannot break through steel barriers.\nWhile the player is able to pause the game to inspect the level and status of the lemmings, skills can only be assigned in real-time. Lemmings are initially released at a rate predetermined by the level (from 1 to 99). The player can increase the rate as desired to a maximum of 99, and later decrease it down to, but not lower than, the initial rate. The player also has the option to \"nuke\" all the remaining lemmings on the screen, converting them to Bombers. This option can be used to abort a level when in a no-win situation, remove any Blockers that remain after the remaining lemmings have been rescued, or end a level quickly once the required percentage of saved lemmings has been reached.\nThe four difficulty groups \u2013 \"Fun\", \"Tricky\", \"Taxing\" and \"Mayhem\" \u2013 are used to organise the levels to reflect their overall difficulty. This rating reflects several factors, including the number of obstacles the player has to surpass, the limitation on the number of types of skills available to assign, the time limit, the minimum rate of lemming release, and the percentage of lemmings that must be saved. Some versions have additional difficulty ratings with more levels in each.\nTwo-player mode.\nThe original \"Lemmings\" also has 20 two-player levels. This took advantage of the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a joystick simultaneously. Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and has their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.\nOh No! More Lemmings.\n\"Oh No! More Lemmings\" is an expansion for the game. It contains 100 more levels, leading to 150 levels in total, including the two-player levels.\nDevelopment.\nMike Dailly, the first employee of DMA Design and one of the programmers for \"Lemmings\", provided a detailed history of the development of the game titled \"The Lemmings Story\" in 2006. David Jones, founder of DMA Design, has also commented on the development and success of \"Lemmings\".\nThe inspiration for gameplay came as a result of a simple animated character sprite in an 8\u00d78 pixel box created by Dailly using Deluxe Paint as part of development for \"Walker\", then envisioned as a sequel to \"Blood Money\". Dailly was able to quickly produce an animated graphic showing his creations moving endlessly, with additional graphical improvements made by Gary Timmons and other members of the DMA Design team to help remove the stiffness in the animation. One member, Russell Kay, observed that \"There's a game in that!\", and later coined the term \"lemmings\" for these creations, according to Dailly. Allowing the creatures to move across the landscape was based on a \"Salamander\" weapon concept for \"Blood Money\" and demonstrated with the animations.\nLevels were designed based on a Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in \"hundreds of levels\". There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones \"used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and doing it in a much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it.\" They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that \"Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\"\nEach of the designers had a somewhat different style in their levels: Dailly's levels often had titles containing clues to what to do (such as \"It's hero time!\", suggesting that one lemming had to be separated from the crowd) and generally required the player to perform several actions at once; Gary Timmons's levels were minimalistic, with popular culture references in the titles; and Scott Johnston's (whose mother was the first voice of the lemmings) levels were generally tightly packed. Dailly was also responsible for the \"custom\" levels based on other Psygnosis and Reflections Interactive Amiga games, including \"Shadow of the Beast\", \"Menace\", \"Awesome\" and \"Shadow of the Beast II\". These \"crossover\" levels also used music from those games, though in ports these levels have been removed or altered to remove such references. After they developed most of the hard levels, they then created several simple levels either by copying the existing ones or creating new layouts; as Dailly states, \"This I believe is where many games fall down today, they don't spend the time making a good learning curve.\" Timmons is credited with the official drawings of the lemmings, as necessitated by the need of Psygnosis for box cover artwork.\nThe two-player option was inspired by then-current games \"Populous\" and \"Stunt Car Racer\". DMA Design initially wanted to use a null-modem connection between two machines to allow competitive play, but ended up using the ability of the Amiga to have two mouse pointer devices usable at the same time and thus created the split-screen mode.\nMusic.\nMusic was originally created by Brian Johnston (Scott's younger brother), who sampled bits of copyrighted music. This had been common practice, but at that point there was a growing awareness of music copyright. Psygnosis therefore asked Tim Wright to replace the offending tracks; he often used arrangements and reworkings of classical and traditional music to avoid copyright problems.\nPorts and expansions.\nThe game's popularity on the Amiga led to its rapid porting to many other platforms, and it is regarded as one of the most widely ported video games. Within a year of its release, the game had been ported to the Atari ST, Sinclair Spectrum, PC and SNES. David Jones stated that after porting the game to 20 systems, he stopped keeping count of additional ports. Other commercial ports of the original game include 3DO, Acorn Archimedes, Apple IIGS, Macintosh, CDTV, Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, Mega Drive, PC Engine, CD-i, and X68000.\nThe license to the \"Lemmings\" intellectual property had remained with Psygnosis, which became part of Sony Computer Entertainment in 1993 but ultimately folded in 2012, leaving \"Lemmings\" as a Sony property. Sony has used that to craft more modern remakes. In early 2006, Sony released a remake of \"Lemmings\" for the PlayStation Portable, developed by Team17. It features all 120 levels from the original game, 36 brand-new levels as well as DataPack support (similar to the Extra Track system featured in \"Wipeout Pure\"), and a user-level editor. Every level in the game is a pre-rendered 3D landscape, although their gameplay is still 2D and remains faithful to the original game. User levels can be constructed from pre-rendered objects and distributed by uploading them to a PlayStation-specific \"Lemmings\" online community. The soundtrack also marks the final video game score created by longtime composer Tim Follin after he announced his retirement from the industry in mid-2005. In October 2006 the game was ported by developer Rusty Nutz for the PlayStation 2 with use of the EyeToy. The basic change in the concept is that the player must stretch and use their limbs in the recorded picture to aid the lemmings.\nExpansions.\n\"Lemmings\" received some expansion packs following its launch. \"Oh No! More Lemmings\", originally released for the Amiga in 1991 both as a data disk or standalone game, added five varying difficulties \u2013 Tame, Crazy, Wild, Wicked and Havoc \u2013 each with 20 new levels. The game also features enhanced graphics and altered sound effects. The expansion was also ported to Acorn Archimedes, Atari ST, DOS, Macintosh, and SAM Coup\u00e9, and the levels were made available with the Game Boy Color, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation and Sega Mega Drive versions of \"Lemmings\". \"Oh No! More Lemmings\" received generally positive reviews. Dan Slingsby of \"CU Amiga\" found the game addictive, calling the puzzles \"ingenious\", and Peter Lee of \"Amiga Action\" praised the quality and difficulty of the levels; Stuart Campbell of \"Amiga Power\" was disappointed by the lack of fixes from the original game, and Ed Ricketts of \"ST Format\" criticized the difficulty gradient of the levels and the price of the expansion, but both ultimately gave positive reviews nonetheless.\n\"Christmas Lemmings\", also known as \"Holiday Lemmings\", was also released as a series of short games released between 1991 and 1994. The gameplay remains unchanged from the base game, which is not required. First released as \"Xmas Lemmings\" as two four-level demos in 1991 and 1992, there were two later full retail releases on the Amiga and Atari ST in 1993 and 1994, both with an additional 32 levels. The games were well-received; Rob Mead of \"Amiga Format\" described it as \"funny, frustrating and incredibly addictive\", despite being disappointed by the number of levels, and Will Greenwald of \"PC Magazine\" ranked it among the best Christmas video games in 2014.\nReception.\nThe original sales for \"Lemmings\" on the Amiga topped 55,000 copies on the first day of sales; in comparison, \"Menace\" sold 20,000 copies and \"Blood Money\" sold 40,000 copies cumulatively. With all ports included, Mike Dailly estimated that 15 million copies of \"Lemmings\" were sold between 1991 and 2006. In 2011, Luke Plunkett from \"Kotaku\" placed the figure at over 20 million, a figure which has been quoted as far back as 1997.\nAt the time of its first release, \"Lemmings\" received several high scores from gaming magazines, with only the level of graphics and sound receiving some small amount of criticism. David Sears of \"Compute!\", in his review of \"Lemmings\" for the PC, stated that \"perhaps Psygnosis has tapped into the human instinct for survival in formulating this perfect blend of puzzle, strategy, and action.\" \"Amiga Computing\" stated that \"\"Lemmings\" is absolutely brilliant. Psygnosis have managed to produce a game that is not only totally original, but also features the kind of addictive gameplay that will keep you coming back for more time and time again.\" A review from the \"Australian Commodore and Amiga Review\" (\"ACAR\") stated that \"above all, the concept is simple, and the game is a lot of fun.\" \"Computer Gaming World\" stated that \"Not since \"Tetris\" has this reviewer been so addicted to, or completely fascinated with, a series of challenging puzzles ... follow the crowd and get \"Lemmings\"\". In 1992 the magazine named it its Action Game of the Year. The game was reviewed in 1991 in \"Dragon\" by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. The Lessers reviewed the Macintosh version of the game in 1993 in \"Dragon\", also giving that version 5 stars.\nIn the Finnish magazine \"Mikrobitti\", Jukka Tapanim\u00e4ki gave the Amiga and DOS versions of \"Lemmings\" 84 points of 100. He praised the game's originality but expressed criticism for it being repetitive.\nIn 1994, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" complimented the Lynx version's large number of options and password feature, and remarked, \"\"Lemmings\" has always been a good strategy game, and the Lynx version continues the tradition.\" The following year they reviewed the CD-i version, criticising that it has nothing but the obligatory full-motion video intro to set it apart from the numerous ports of the game that had already been released over the past four years. \"GamePro\" made the same criticisms, commenting that \"this former 16-bit puzzler isn't going anywhere new on the CD-i.\"\n\"Next Generation\"'s review of the 3DO version assessed that \"If you've played any version, you've played this one, too, but if you haven't tried it, this is one of the better ones, and it's still one game that's addictive as hell.\"\nIn 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"Lemmings\" the 12th-best computer game ever released, and that same year, \"Next Generation\" declared it the 8th-greatest game of all time, and \"second only to \"Tetris\"\" in the puzzle genre. In 2004, readers of \"Retro Gamer\" voted \"Lemmings\" as the 21st-top retro game, with the editors calling it \"perhaps Psygnosis' finest hour and a turning point in the puzzle genre.\" In 1991, \"PC Format\" named \"Lemmings\" one of the 50 best computer games ever. The editors wrote, \"Yes, we know it sounds stupid, but you will like it \u2013 everyone else has.\" In 1994, \"PC Gamer US\" named \"Lemmings\" the 30th-best computer game ever. The editors called it \"one of the biggest puzzlers ever released for PC\" and \"cleaner and less complicated\" than its sequel. That same year, \"PC Gamer UK\" named it the 25th-best computer game of all time, calling it \"a seminal title.\"\nIn 1998, \"PC Gamer\" declared it the 21st-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \"as fresh and addictive today as it was when it was first released\". In 2018, Complex listed the game 70th on its \"The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time\". In 1995, Total! ranked the game 81st on their Top 100 SNES Games summarizing: \"The game that spawned a dozen imitators is still one of the best platform puzzlers available.\"\nLegacy.\n\"Lemmings\" inspired several further games in the franchise, including the \"Christmas Lemmings\" short games that were released between 1991 and 1994, and the 1991 expansion \"Oh No! More Lemmings\". Stand-alone sequels were \"\" (1993), \"All New World of Lemmings\" (1994), \"3D Lemmings\" (1995) and \"Lemmings Revolution\" (2000). By mid-1995, \"Lemmings\" and its sequels had accumulated combined sales of more than 4 million units worldwide. Two spin-off games were also made, both in 1996; \"Lemmings Paintball\" and \"The Adventures of Lomax\".\nThe intellectual property (IP) of \"Lemmings\" stayed with the initial publisher Psygnosis, who were acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment in 1993. Sony gained the IP for \"Lemmings\" from this acquisition; in 2006 a new game also titled \"Lemmings\" was released for PlayStation consoles. The next game in the franchise, \"Lemmings Touch\", was developed by D3T and released in 2014 for PlayStation Vita. Sony eventually licensed the rights to Exient Entertainment, who published a mobile game \"Lemmings: The Puzzle Adventure\" in 2018. Exient produced a 30th anniversary documentary of the history of \"Lemmings\", released in February 2022.\nNumerous clones of \"Lemmings\" were made, including \"The Humans\" (1992) and \"Pingus\" (1998). Other similar games include \"Clones\" (2009), which was described by the developed as \"a multiplayer version of Lemmings\". \nYannick LeJacq of Kotaku, commenting on the 2014 game \"MouseCraft\" which incorporates elements of \"Lemmings\" and \"Tetris\", speculated that games like \"Lemmings\" would not be very successful in the current gaming market, as the pace of the game is far too slow to satisfy most players.\nIn 2004, Graham Cormode proved that deciding whether it is possible to complete a level of Lemmings is NP-hard. Later, Giovanni Viglietta showed that the task is PSPACE-complete, even for levels where there is only one lemming to save.\nIn 2010, it was announced that \"Lemmings\" would be ported to the iOS operating system by developer Mobile 1UP, though Sony Computer Entertainment Europe later presented them with a cease-and-desist letter, forcing them to halt development of the port. Mobile 1UP reworked the game to replace the Lemmings with humans in a prehistoric setting, and instead released the game under the name \"Caveman\" in 2011. Brutal Deluxe, the developer who did the porting of the Apple IIGS version of \"Lemmings\", has released the port's source code.\n\"Lemmings\" has also been called a predecessor of the modern real-time strategy (RTS) video game genre. A 1991 \"Amiga Power\" article claimed that \"Lemmings\" \"was the first major game to introduce the 'indirect-control' concept,\" an element that is now common in many RTS games. Blizzard Entertainment developer Bob Fitch said that part of the inspiration for the first \"Warcraft\" game, \"\", was based on developing a competitive multiplayer RTS that combined elements of \"The Lost Vikings\" (which he had worked on) and \"Lemmings\"; Fitch said \"We just went, 'Oh it's so cool when you see lots of Lemmings all over the place. Why don't we have lots of Vikings all over instead, and then the Vikings can fight each other.\" \"Lemmings\"' introduction of RTS elements has been noted by fantasy author Terry Pratchett; in his novel \"Interesting Times\", an army of golems is controlled in a fashion reminiscent of the \"Lemmings\" user interface. When readers asked if this was deliberate, Pratchett responded: \"Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that... Not only did I wipe \"Lemmings\" from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn't get it back.\"\n\"Lemmings\" was one of six games featured in a stamp series issued by the Royal Mail in 2020 to pay tribute to the United Kingdom's early video game industry.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The tree is also known by the names sycamore fig tree (\"Ficus sycomorus\"), and fig-mulberry. It appears also in Luke 17:6 and 19:4 of the Bible. The Hebrew word for the tree is \"shi\u1e33mah\" (sing.) (), \"shi\u1e33m\u012bn\" (pl.) (), having nearly the same phonemes in Greek ( \"sykomorea\"). Other translations, however, identify the tree as mulberry tree, found in two species, the Black Mulberry (\"Morus nigra\") and the White Mulberry (\"Morus alba\"), which are common in Palestine. It is in the same family as the fig-tree.\nThe bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but cedars will we put in their place.\nThe trees were once very common along the lowlands and coastal plains of Israel. During the Second Temple period, sycamore fig trees grew in Jericho, but when passers-by would come along and appropriate the tree branches unto themselves, the owners came and dedicated the trees, in their entirety, to the Temple treasury as a dedicatory offering in order to prevent their theft.\nThe sycamine is a deciduous to semi-deciduous tree and sheds its fruit in a prolific manner, by reason of which the Sages of Israel prohibited a Jewish planter from planting such trees within the radius of 50 cubits from his neighbor's cistern.\nAll sycamines that currently grow in the Land of Israel (\"Ficus sycomorus\") are believed to be invasive species, but which are now cultivated in Israel. The tree is native to East Africa. It is thought that the species was once endemic to the Land of Israel. Another species of sycamine endemic to the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia and Yemen is \"Ficus vasta\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}

It is the simplest aromatic ketone. This colorless, viscous liquid is a precursor to useful resins and fragrances.\nProduction.\nAcetophenone is formed as a byproduct of the cumene process, the industrial route for the synthesis of phenol and acetone. In the Hock rearrangement of isopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, migration of a methyl group rather than the phenyl group gives acetophenone and methanol as a result of an alternate rearrangement of the intermediate:\nThe cumene process is conducted on such a large scale that even the small amount of acetophenone by-product can be recovered in commercially useful quantities. \nAcetophenone is also generated from ethylbenzene hydroperoxide. Ethylbenzene hydroperoxide is primarily converted to 1-phenylethanol (\u03b1-methylbenzyl alcohol) in the process with a small amount of by-product acetophenone. Acetophenone is recovered or hydrogenated to 1-phenylethanol which is then dehydrated to produce styrene.\nUses.\nPrecursor to resins.\nCommercially significant resins are produced from treatment of acetophenone with formaldehyde and a base. The resulting copolymers are conventionally described with the formula , resulting from aldol condensation. These substances are components of coatings and inks. Modified acetophenone-formaldehyde resins are produced by the hydrogenation of the aforementioned ketone-containing resins. The resulting polyol can be further crosslinked with diisocyanates. The modified resins are found in coatings, inks and adhesives.\nNiche uses.\nAcetophenone is an ingredient in fragrances that resemble almond, cherry, honeysuckle, jasmine, and strawberry. It is used in chewing gum. \nIt is also listed as an approved excipient by the U.S. FDA. \nLaboratory reagent.\nIn instructional laboratories, acetophenone is converted to styrene in a two-step process that illustrates the reduction of carbonyls using sodium borohydride and the dehydration of alcohols:\n\nA similar two-step process is used industrially, but reduction step is performed by hydrogenation over a copper chromite catalyst:\nBeing prochiral, acetophenone is also a popular test substrate for asymmetric hydrogenation experiments.\nDrugs.\nAcetophenone is used for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals.\nNatural occurrence.\nAcetophenone occurs naturally in many foods including apple, cheese, apricot, banana, beef, and cauliflower. It is also a component of castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature beaver.\nPharmacology.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, acetophenone was used in medicine. It was marketed as a hypnotic and anticonvulsant under brand name Hypnone. The typical dosage was 0.12 to 0.3 milliliters. It was considered to have superior sedative effects to both paraldehyde and chloral hydrate. In humans, acetophenone is metabolized to benzoic acid, carbonic acid, and acetone. Hippuric acid occurs as an indirect metabolite and its quantity in urine may be used to confirm acetophenone exposure, although other substances, like toluene, also induce hippuric acid in urine.\nToxicity.\nThe LD50 is 815\u00a0mg/kg (oral, rats). Acetophenone is currently listed as a Group D carcinogen indicating that there is no evidence at present that it causes cancer in humans.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Johnson through Executive Order on November 29, 1963, to investigate the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy that had taken place on November 22, 1963.\nThe U.S. Congress passed Senate Joint Resolution 137 authorizing the Presidential appointed Commission to report on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, mandating the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence. Its 888-page final report was presented to President Johnson on September 24, 1964, and made public three days later.\nIt concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald two days later. The Commission's findings have proven controversial and have been both challenged and supported by later studies.\nThe Commission took its unofficial name\u2014the Warren Commission\u2014from its chairman, Chief Justice Earl Warren. According to published transcripts of Johnson's presidential phone conversations, some major officials were opposed to forming such a commission and several commission members took part only reluctantly. One of their chief reservations was that a commission would ultimately create more controversy than consensus.\nFormation.\nThe creation of the Warren Commission was a direct consequence of the murder by Jack Ruby of the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963, carried live on national television in the basement of the Dallas police station. The lack of a public process addressing the mistakes of the Dallas Police, who concluded that the case was closed, created doubt in the mind of the public.\nThe new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, himself from Texas, the state where the two assassinations had taken place, found himself faced with the risk of a weakening of his presidency. Confronted with the results obtained by the Texas authorities, themselves seriously discredited and criticized, he decided after various consultations, including in particular that with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, to create a presidential commission of inquiry by Executive Order 11130 of November 29, 1963. This act made it possible both to avoid an independent investigation led by Congress and to avoid entrusting the case to the Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, deeply affected by the assassination, whose federal jurisdiction would have been applied in the event of withdrawal of the share of the State of Texas for the benefit of the federal authorities in Washington.\nNicholas Katzenbach, Deputy Attorney General, provided advice that led to the creation of the Warren Commission. On November 25 he sent a memo to Johnson's White House aide Bill Moyers recommending the formation of a Presidential Commission to investigate the assassination. To combat speculation of a conspiracy, Katzenbach said that the results of the FBI's investigation should be made public. He wrote: \"The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did not have confederates who are still at large.\"\nFour days after Katzenbach's memo, Johnson appointed to the commission some of the nation's most prominent figures, including Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United States. At first, Warren refused to head of the commission because he stated the principle of law that a member of the judicial power could not be at the service of the executive power. It was only under pressure from President Lyndon Johnson, who spoke of international tensions and the risks of war resulting from the death of his predecessor, that he agreed to chair the commission. The other members of the commission were chosen from among the representatives of the Republican and Democratic parties, in both houses of Congress, and added diplomat John J. McCloy, former president of the World Bank, and former CIA director Allen Dulles.\nThe national image of the United States was also of concern. McCloy states that a motive of the commission was to \"show the world that America is not a banana republic, where a government can be changed by conspiracy\". Warren shared this concern, and in part agreed to head the commission after President Johnson made it clear to him that the \"nation's prestige\" was at stake.\nMeetings.\nThe Warren Commission met formally for the first time on December 5, 1963, on the second floor of the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. The Commission conducted its business primarily in closed sessions, but these were not \"secret\" sessions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Two misconceptions about the Warren Commission hearing need to be clarified...hearings were closed to the public unless the witness appearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. No witness except one...requested an open hearing... Second, although the hearings (except one) were conducted in private, they were not secret. In a secret hearing, the witness is instructed not to disclose his testimony to any third party, and the hearing testimony is not published for public consumption. The witnesses who appeared before the Commission were free to repeat what they said to anyone they pleased, and \"all\" of their testimony was subsequently published in the first fifteen volumes put out by the Warren Commission.\nAccording to a 1963 FBI memo that was released to the public in 2008, Commission member Gerald Ford was in contact with the FBI throughout his time on the Warren Commission and relayed information to the deputy director, Cartha DeLoach, about the panel's activities.\nMembers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nConclusions of the report.\nThe report concluded that:\nInternal disagreement.\nNotably, three of the Commission members, Sherman Cooper, Boggs, and Russell disagreed with the single-bullet theory advanced by the commission. Cooper felt its conclusions were \"premature and inconclusive\", and informed Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy that he strongly felt Lee Harvey Oswald had not acted alone. When Cooper expressed his same thoughts to Jacqueline Kennedy, he reportedly stated that \"it's important for this nation that we bring the true murderers to justice.\"\nRussell in particular was unhappy with the Commission's conclusions. His personal papers indicated that he was troubled by the Commission's single-bullet theory, the Soviet Union's failure to provide greater detail regarding Lee Harvey Oswald's period in Russia, and the lack of information regarding Oswald's Cuba-related activities. In a telephone conversation with President Johnson in September 1964 he expressed his disbelief in the single-bullet theory, to which Johnson replied that he did not believe it either. Russell had written a dissenting opinion for the Warren Commission that \"a number of suspicious circumstances\" could not allow him to agree that there was no conspiracy to kill Kennedy and that citing a lack of evidence he believed this \"preclude[d] the conclusive determination that Oswald and Oswald alone, without the knowledge, encouragement or assistance of any other person, planned and perpetrated the assassination\". With Russell's agreement this statement was not included in the final report. He had also made a request to Warren that \"Senator Russell dissents\" be placed in a footnote of the final report, although Warren refused to do so, insisting that there must be unanimity among the Commission.\nDeath of Lee Harvey Oswald.\nIn response to Jack Ruby's shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald, the Warren Commission declared that the news media must share responsibility with the Dallas police department for \"the breakdown of law enforcement\" that led to Oswald's death. In addition to the police department's \"inadequacy of coordination\", the Warren Commission noted that \"these additional deficiencies [in security] were directly related to the decision to admit newsmen to the basement\".\nThe commission concluded that the pressure of press, radio, and television for information about Oswald's prison transfer resulted in relaxed security standards for admission to the basement, allowing Ruby to enter and subsequently shoot Oswald, noting that \"the acceptance of inadequate press credentials posed a clear avenue for a one-man assault.\" Oswald's death was said to have been a direct result of \"the failure of the police to remove Oswald secretly or control the crowd in the basement.\"\nThe consequence of Oswald's death, according to the Commission, was that \"it was no longer possible to arrive at the complete story of the assassination of John F. Kennedy through normal judicial procedures during the trial of the alleged assassin.\" While the Commission noted that the prime responsibility was that of the police department, it also recommended the adoption of a new \"code of conduct\" for news professionals regarding the collecting and presenting of information to the public that would ensure \"there [would] be no interference with pending criminal investigations, court proceedings, or the right of individuals to a fair trial.\"\nAftermath.\nSecret Service.\nThe findings prompted the Secret Service to make numerous modifications to its security procedures. The Commission made other recommendations to the Congress to adopt new legislation that would make the murder of the President (or Vice-President) a federal crime, which was not the case in 1963.\nCommission records.\nIn November 1964, two months after the publication of its 888-page report, the commission published twenty-six volumes of supporting documents, including the testimony or depositions of 552 witnesses and more than 3,100 exhibits making a total of more than 16,000 pages. The Warren Report, however, lacked an index, which greatly complicated the work of reading. It was later endowed with an index by the work of Sylvia Meagher for the report and the twenty-six volumes of documents.\nAll of the commission's records were then transferred on November 23 to the National Archives. The unpublished portion of those records was initially sealed for seventy-five years (to 2039) under a general National Archives policy that applied to all federal investigations by the executive branch of government, a period \"intended to serve as protection for innocent persons who could otherwise be damaged because of their relationship with participants in the case.\"\nThe 75-Year Rule no longer exists, supplanted by the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 and the JFK Records Act of 1992. By 1992, ninety-eight percent of the Warren Commission records had been released to the public. Six years later, after the Assassination Records Review Board's work, all Warren Commission records, except those records that contained tax return information, were available to the public with redactions.\nThe remaining Kennedy assassination-related documents were partly released to the public on October 26, 2017, twenty-five years after the passage of the JFK Records Act. President Donald Trump, as directed by the FBI and the CIA, took action on that date to withhold certain remaining files, delaying the release until April 26, 2018, then on April 26, 2018, took action to further withhold the records \"until 2021\".\nCIA \"benign cover-up\".\nAccording to a report by the CIA Chief Historian David Robarge (which was released to the public in 2014), CIA Director McCone was complicit in a Central Intelligence Agency \"benign cover-up\" by withholding information from the Warren Commission. According to this report, CIA officers had been instructed to give only \"passive, reactive, and selective\" assistance to the commission, to keep the commission focused on \"what the Agency believed at the time was the 'best truth' \u2014 that Lee Harvey Oswald, for as yet undetermined motives, had acted alone in killing John Kennedy.\" The CIA may have also covered up evidence of being in communication with Oswald before 1963, according to the 2014 report findings.\nAlso withheld were earlier CIA plots, involving CIA links with the Mafia, to assassinate Cuban president Fidel Castro, which might have been considered to provide a motive to assassinate Kennedy. The report concluded, \"In the long term, the decision of John McCone and Agency leaders in 1964 not to disclose information about CIA's anti-Castro schemes might have done more to undermine the credibility of the Commission than anything else that happened while it was conducting its investigation.\"\nSkepticism.\nMany independent investigators, journalists, historians, jurists, and academics issued opinions opposing the conclusions of the Warren commission based on the same elements collected by its works. \nThese skeptics and their works included Thomas Buchanan, Sylvan Fox, Harold Feldman, Richard E. Sprague, Mark Lane's \"Rush to Judgment\", Edward Jay Epstein's \"Inquest\", Harold Weisberg's \"Whitewash\", Sylvia Meagher's \"Accessories After the Fact\" or Josiah Thompson's \"Six Seconds in Dallas\". English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote: \"The Warren Report will have to be judged, not by its soothing success, but by the value of its argument. I must admit that from the first reading of the report, it seemed impossible to me to join in this general cry of triumph. I had the impression that the text had serious flaws. Moreover, when probing the weak parts, they appeared even weaker than at first sight.\"\nIn 1992, following popular political pressure in the wake of the film \"JFK\", the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was created by the JFK Records Act to collect and preserve the documents relating to the assassination. In a footnote in its final report, the ARRB wrote: \"Doubts about the Warren Commission's findings were not restricted to ordinary Americans. Well before 1978, President Johnson, Robert F. Kennedy, and four of the seven members of the Warren Commission all articulated, if sometimes off the record, some level of skepticism about the Commission's basic findings.\"\nWeak points of the report.\nThe Warren Commission argued that direct witnesses to the shooting, who immediately rushed en masse to the grassy knoll after the shots were fired, were fleeing the area of the shooting. In reality, the people present, including a dozen members of the security forces, in particular Sheriff Decker's team, who had given the order to investigate the area, all testified that they were running to the search for one or more shooters posted on the grassy Knoll. \nThe Commission did not examine photographs or X-rays of President Kennedy's body, although they did have the power to subpoena them. Commission member John J. McCloy later said that \"I think that if there\u2019s one thing that I would do over again, I would insist on those photographs and\nthe X-rays having been produced before us\".\nIt did not interview John Fitzgerald Kennedy's personal doctor, George Burkley, who was present during the shooting in the convoy of official vehicles then at Parkland Hospital, on board Air Force One, then at Bethesda Naval Hospital during the autopsy. He signed the death certificate and also took delivery of the brain of John Fitzgerald Kennedy which is declared lost in the National Archives. Concerning the conclusions of the Warren commission about the three shots, the practitioner had declared in 1967: \"I would not like to be quoted on this subject\".\nThe ballistic reports conducted by the FBI and the autopsy reports were not the subject of any counter-investigation, which made the commission directly dependent on the work of the latter. The Warren Commission, by decision of Earl Warren, refused to hire its own independent investigators. However, it had its own investigative capacity thanks to direct access to the emergency presidential budget funds granted by President Lyndon Johnson when it was created, to conduct its own investigations. Thus the Warren commission was not informed by the FBI of the discovery the day after the attack, on November 23, 1963, by a medical student, William Harper, of a piece of occiput located at the rear left in relation to at the position of the presidential limo during the fatal shot to the head. He had it examined by the professor and medical examiner, Doctor Cairns who measured it and photographed this piece before informing the FBI, on November 25, 1963. The latter received instructions not to make any publicity on this subject. It was the Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, who, informed by a letter from Dr. Cairns transmitted to the Warren Commission, allowed the latter to question the practitioner. The non-use by the members of the Warren Commission of the direct elements of the autopsy such as notes, photos and x-rays. He only used drawings by FBI artists reproducing photographic images.\nThe revelation by Edward Jay Epstein, in his book \"Inquest\" published in 1966, that as early as the beginning of 1964, the chief adviser, J. Lee Rankin, had given the outcome of the results of the work of the commission: guilt of Oswald, the latter having acted alone. Even before the creation of the commission, on November 25, 1963, and a few hours after the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby in the premises of the Dallas police, Nicolas Katzenbach, assistant attorney general, had indicated in a memorandum intended of Bill Moyers that: \"The public must be convinced that Oswald was the killer; that he had no accomplices still at large; and that evidence was such that he would have been found guilty at trial\" creating a political orientation of the results of the investigation, even before the start of the first official investigations and knowledge of the results. Its objective was to cut short the speculations of public opinion either on a plot of communist origin (thesis of the Dallas police) or a plot fomented by the far right to blame the communists (hypothesis defended by the press of communist bloc formed around the USSR).\nAs early as the 1970s, official members of the Warren Commission questioned its work, in particular Hale Boggs who criticized the influence of J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI from 1924 to 1972, who had centralized all of the information from the FBI agents before synthesizing it and transmitting it to the Warren Commission. He campaigned for a reopening of the file considering that the director of the FBI had lied to the Warren commission. He disappeared in a plane crash in October 1972.\nCommission member Richard Russell told the \"Washington Post\" in 1970 that Kennedy had been the victim of a conspiracy, criticizing the commission's no-conspiracy finding and saying \"we weren't told the truth about Oswald\". John Sherman Cooper also considered the ballistic findings to be \"unconvincing\". Russell also particularly rejected Arlen Specter's \"single bullet\" theory, and he asked Earl Warren to indicate his disagreement in a footnote, which the chairman of the commission refused.\nOther investigations.\nFour other U.S. government or senate investigations have been conducted about the Warren Commission's conclusion or its material in different circumstances. The Church Committee analyzed in 1976 the work of the CIA and FBI which had communicated the different elements to the Warren Commission Members. The three others concluded with the initial conclusions that two shots struck JFK from the rear: the 1968 panel set by Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the 1975 Rockefeller Commission, and the 1978-79 House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), which reexamined the evidence with the help of the largest forensics panel and bringing new materials to the public.\nThe Church Committee.\nIn 1975, the Church Committee was created per US Senate after the revelations about illegal actions of federal agency as the FBI, CIA and IRS on the territory of the United States of America and after the political Watergate scandal. The Church Committee carried out investigative work on the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, questioning 50 witnesses and accessing 3,000 documents.\nIt focuses on the necessary actions and the support provided by the FBI and the CIA to the Warren Commission and raises the question of the possible connection between the plans to assassinate political leaders abroad, in particular in relation to Fidel Castro in Cuba, a huge point of international tension in the 1960s, and that of the 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy. The Church Committee questioned the process of obtaining the information, blaming federal agencies for failing in their duties and responsibilities and concluding that the investigation into the assassination had been flawed.\nThe American Senator Richard Schweiker indicated on this subject, in a television interview on June 27, 1976: \"The John F. Kennedy assassination investigation was snuffed out before it even began,\" and that \"the fatal mistake the Warren Commission made was to not use its own investigators, but instead to rely on the CIA and FBI personnel, which played directly into the hands of senior intelligence\"\".\"\nThe results of the Church Committee opened the way of the creation of the HSCA, with parallelly the March 6, 1975, first time diffusion on network television in the show \"Good Night America\" of the Zapruder film, which had been stored by \"Life\" magazine and never shown to the public during the preceding twenty years.\nThe House Select Committee on Assassinations.\nThe HSCA involved Congressional hearings and ultimately concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, probably as the result of a conspiracy. The HSCA concluded that Oswald fired shots number one, two, and four, and that an unknown assassin fired shot number three (but missed) from near the corner of a picket fence that was above and to President Kennedy's right front on the Dealey Plaza grassy knoll. However, this conclusion has also been criticized, especially for its reliance upon disputed acoustic evidence. The HSCA Final Report in 1979 did agree with the Warren Report's conclusion in 1964 that two bullets caused all of President Kennedy's and Governor Connally's injuries, and that both bullets were fired by Oswald from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.\nIn his September 1978 testimony to the HSCA, President Ford defended the Warren Commission's investigation as thorough. Ford stated that knowledge of the assassination plots against Castro may have affected the scope of the Commission's investigation but expressed doubt that it would have altered its finding that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy.\nAs part of its investigation, the HSCA also evaluated the performance of the Warren Commission, which included interviews and public testimony from the two surviving Commission members (Ford and McCloy) and various Commission legal counsel staff. The Committee concluded in their final report that the Commission was reasonably thorough and acted in good faith, but failed to adequately address the possibility of conspiracy: \"...the Warren Commission was not, in some respects, an accurate presentation of all the evidence available to the Commission or a true reflection of the scope of the Commission's work, particularly on the issue of possible conspiracy in the assassination.\"\nThe HSCA also pointed to the role of the mafia in the attack because of Cuba. Indeed, the Cuban Castro Revolution of 1959 had caused the criminal organization to lose millions of dollars, which had tried in vain to win the favors of the Cuban leader during the change of regime. In 1959, the income generated by criminal activities amounted to an annual amount of 100 million dollars, i.e. 900 million reported in 2013.\nThe HSCA determined that the gradual change in policy of the Kennedy administration toward Cuba, first with the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961, then more sustainably with the missile crisis of October 1962, in order to appease relations with the Cuban regime on a lasting basis and to open up new prospects, contributed to directing, if not slightly, within the many groups of paramilitary operations the most radical fringe of anti-Castro Cubans, American intelligence agents and Mafia criminals who continued their operations to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro despite requests for formal arrests from the White House. The HSCA invited the Department of Justice to resume investigations. The latter would respond eight years later, arguing the absence of decisive evidence allowing the reopening of an investigation, which is equivalent to supporting the conclusions of Warren report.\nLegacy.\nThe findings of the Warren Commission are generally highly criticized, and while the majority of American citizens believe that Oswald shot President Kennedy, the majority also believe that Oswald was part of a conspiracy and therefore do not believe the official thesis defended by the commission. In 1976, 81% of Americans disputed the findings of the Warren Report, 74% in 1983, 75% in 1993 and 2003. In 2009, a CBS poll indicated that 74% of respondents believed there had been an official cover-up by the authorities to keep the general public away from the truth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A modern ring consists of a square raised platform with a post at each corner. Four ropes are attached to the posts and pulled parallel under tension with turnbuckles to form the boundary of the competition area. It also traditionally features a red corner for the higher ranked, more experienced, crowds favorite or home boxer and a blue corner for the lower ranked, less experienced or guest boxer.\nConstruction.\nAs there are a number of professional boxing organizations, the standards of construction vary. A standard ring is between to a side between the ropes with another outside. The platform of the ring is generally from the ground and is covered by about of padding topped by stretched canvas. The ropes are approximately in diameter and at heights of 18, 30, 42, and 54\u00a0inches (.46, .76, 1.07, and 1.37 m) above the mat, held up on posts rising around above the mat. The ropes are attached together with spacers that prevent them from spreading too far apart.\nConstruction of the ring environment extends to maximization of lighting in the ring, minimization of heat of the lighting, and a complete as possible cut-off of illumination at the ringside.\nConstruction differs from the similar wrestling ring. A wrestling ring sports only three ropes (which may be sheathed steel cable) and is constructed to provide a more flexible mat surface than a boxing ring.\nTerminology.\nThe name \"ring\" is a relic from when contests were fought in a roughly drawn circle on the ground. The name ring continued with the London Prize Ring Rules in 1743, which specified a small circle in the centre of the fight area where the boxers met at the start of each round. The first square ring was introduced by the Pugilistic Society in 1838. That ring was specified as square and bound by two ropes. For these and other reasons, the boxing ring is commonly referred to as the \"squared circle\". The term \"ringside seat\" dates as far back as the 1860s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "69197", "revid": "1286730312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69197", "title": "Cenovis", "text": "Swiss brand of spread similar to Marmite\nCenovis is a dark brown food paste from Switzerland consisting of yeast extract, onions, carrots and spices. Sold internationally under the brand Sonaris, it is similar to English Marmite, Brazilian Cenovit, and Australian Vegemite. Rich in vitamin B1, it may be used to flavour soups, sausages, and salads. The most popular way to consume Cenovis, however, is to spread it on a slice of buttered bread, as stated on the product's packaging. It can also be blended into butter and used as a spread or a filling for croissants and buns.\nThe company does not disclose whether the Swiss Cenovis was a licensed product from the older German one. In contrast to comparable yeast extracts, the Swiss Cenovis, similar to Thomy mustard, was sold in tubes early on and is somewhat lighter and more liquid.\nProtein versus vitamin.\nSince the beginning of the 20th century many attempts to turn brewer's yeast into food have been made. The main reason being its availability and nutritional physiology. The English Marmite (1902) and the Australian Vegemite (1922) became successful as products. 1912 Casimir Funk discovered an active ingredient against deficiency diseases which he called vitamin. The high thiamine content (vitamin B1) then became the quality of nutritional yeast that was more effective in advertising than its protein content, which had been known for a long time.\nOrigins in Germany.\nIn 1915, Cenovis Nahrungsmittelwerke GmbH was founded in Munich as a brewer's yeast and malt factory, which also produced by-products of these products and other foods such as oatmeal and baking powder, making it one of Maggi's main competitors. The German Cenovis vitamin extract was available from around 1920 in jars labeled \"unbegrenzt haltbar\" (unlimited shelf life).\nThe image of the Cenovis products was associated with the life reform movement (from which the Reformh\u00e4user emerged). It was reported in 1921 that the Cenovis yeast extract consisted of cleaned and de-bittered brewer's yeast and had a honey-like consistency. It has a \"similar, only finer taste than Liebig's meat extract\". The founder and main shareholder of Cenovis, Julius Sch\u00fclein, a son of the brewery owner Joseph Sch\u00fclein, reports in his book from 1938 (the year when his Munich company was expropriated by Aryanization and he emigrated to the USA) about an Cenovis vitamin yeast produced in Switzerland. In the same year, the Australian trademark Cenovis was established.\nSwiss manufacturing.\nCenovis is popular in Switzerland (particularly Romandie). It was developed in Rheinfelden in 1931, on the initiative of a master brewer named Alex Villinger. Since 1935, they have been producing Cenovis extract alongside brewer's yeast and other by-products. In 1955, Cenovis became part of the Swiss Army's survival ration. In 1965, Vitamin-Hefe AG acquired all of the word marks and manufacturing processes from Cenovis-Werke GmbH in Munich. The foreign trademark rights were sold to the H\u00fcgli Group in Steinach SG. The Heirler Cenovis GmbH that emerged from it has a similar range of products as the Munich Cenovis of the time.\nRevival.\nCenovis yeast extract was developed during times of economic crisis, aimed at replacing meat products like sausages. It is economical, long-lasting without refrigeration, and shares similarities with the Australian spread Vegemite. However, unlike Vegemite, which has become a staple in the harsh environment of the Australian outback, Cenovis has seen a decline in sales in Switzerland. In German-speaking Switzerland, it remains popular among the older generation, while in French-speaking Switzerland, it only gained traction after being relaunched by Michel Yagchi in 1999, with the help of Didier Fischer and Frank Guemara, who applied modern marketing techniques to rejuvenate the brand.\nOn 29 February 2008, Michel Yagchi transferred the brand, acquired in 1999, to Gustav Gerig AG, an Aargau company, and the product thereby returned to its canton of origin.\nCenovis has been manufactured by Sonaris AG in Arisdorf BL since 2008. Sonaris AG was founded in Rheinfelden AG in 1997 as the successor company to Leiber Vitamin-Hefe AG. From then on, the production rights for the production of the Cenovis extract were held by the company Sonaris AG, which relocated its headquarters from Rheinfelden to Arisdorf in 2003. In 2008, Cenovis' Swiss trademark rights were bought back by Sonaris AG. International distribution, notably in France, uses the Sonaris brand instead. In 2013, the two companies Cenovis AG and Sonaris AG merged to form today's Cenovis AG, based in Arisdorf.\nThe company presents the following story behind Cenovis:\n\"In 1931, a brewer recycled the yeast used for the fermentation of beer: vegetal substances very rich in vitamin B1.

These are believed by followers to be supernatural graces that individual Christians need to fulfill the mission of the Church. In the narrowest sense, it is a theological term for the extraordinary graces given to individual Christians for the good of others and is distinguished from the graces given for personal sanctification, such as the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit and the fruit of the Holy Spirit.\nThese abilities, often termed \"charismatic gifts\", are the word of knowledge, increased faith, the gifts of healing, the gift of miracles, prophecy, the discernment of spirits, and speaking in tongues. To these are added the gifts of apostles, prophets, teachers, helps (connected to service of the poor and sick), and governments (or leadership ability) which are connected with certain offices in the Church. These gifts are given by the Holy Spirit to individuals, but their purpose is to build up the entire Church. They are described in the New Testament, primarily in 1 Corinthians 12, 13 and 14, Romans 12, and Ephesians 4. 1 Peter 4 also touches on the spiritual gifts.\nThe gifts are related to both seemingly \"natural\" abilities and seemingly more \"miraculous\" abilities, empowered by the Holy Spirit. The two major opposing theological positions on their nature are that they ceased long ago or that they continue, which is the dispute of cessationism versus continuationism.\nBiblical and theological overview.\nThe New Testament contains several lists of spiritual gifts, most in the Pauline epistles. While each list is unique, there is overlap.\nChristians believe that the \"charismata\" were foretold in the Book of Joel () and promised by Christ (Gospel of Mark ). This promise was fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost and elsewhere as the church spread. In order to correct abuses concerning the spiritual gifts at Corinth, Paul devoted much attention to spiritual gifts in his First Epistle to the Corinthians (chapters 12\u201314).\nIn 1 Corinthians 12, two Greek terms are translated as \"spiritual gifts\". In verse 1, the word \"pneumatika\" (\"spirituals\" or \"things of the Spirit\") is used. In verse 4, \"charisma\" is used. This word is derived from the word \"charis\", which means \"grace\". In verses 5 and 6, the words \"diakonia\" (translated \"administrations\", \"ministries\", or \"service\") and \"energemata\" (\"operations\" or \"inworkings\") are used in describing the nature of the spiritual gifts. In verse 7, the term \"manifestation (\"phanerosis\") of the Spirit\" is used.\nFrom these scriptural passages, Christians understand the spiritual gifts to be enablements or capacities that are divinely bestowed upon individuals. Because they are freely given by God, these cannot be earned or merited. Though worked through individuals, these are operations or manifestations of the Holy Spirit\u2014not of the gifted person. They are to be used for the benefit of others, and in a sense they are granted to the church as a whole more than they are given to individuals. There is diversity in their distribution\u2014an individual will not possess all of the gifts. The purpose of the spiritual gifts is to edify (build up), exhort (encourage), and comfort the church.\nIt is generally acknowledged that Paul did not list all of the gifts of the Spirit, and many believe that there are as many gifts as there are needs in the body of Christ. The gifts have at times been organized into distinct categories based on their similarities and differences to other gifts. Some divide them into three categories using Old Testament offices. \"Prophetic\" gifts include any gift involving teaching, encouraging, or rebuking others. \"Priestly\" gifts include showing mercy and care for the needy or involve intercession before God. \"Kingly\" gifts are those involving church administration or government. Others categorize them into \"gifts of knowledge\" (word of wisdom, word of knowledge, distinguishing between spirits), \"gifts of speech\" (tongues, interpretation, prophecy), and \"gifts of power\" (faith, healing, miracles). The gifts have also been categorized as those that promote the inner growth of the church (apostle, prophecy, distinguishing between spirits, teaching, word of wisdom/knowledge, helps, and administration) and those that promote the church's outer development (faith, miracles, healing, tongues, interpretation of tongues).\nProponents of cessationism distinguish between the \"extraordinary\", \"miraculous\", or \"sign\" gifts (such as prophecy, tongues, and healing) and the other gifts. Cessationism is held by some Protestants, especially from the Calvinist tradition, who believe that miraculous gifts and their operations were limited to early Christianity and \"ceased\" afterward. Other Protestants, including Lutheran, Methodist, Pentecostals and charismatics, adhere to the continuationist position, believing that all the spiritual gifts are distributed among Christians by the Holy Spirit and that they are normative in contemporary Christendom. In addition, Roman Catholicism\nand the Eastern Orthodox Church also continue to believe in and make use of all of the spiritual gifts.\nDescriptions.\nApostle: The title apostle comes from the Greek word \"apostolos\" which means \"a messenger, one sent forth with orders\". It refers to one who has been delegated authority by another in a foreign land. Apostles were the first leaders of the Church; they were commissioned by Jesus to initiate and direct the preaching of the gospel. While many Christians agree that the title of apostle is reserved for those among the first generation of Christians, many Christian denominations continue in one way or another to recognize a continuing apostolic ministry. Many churches, such as the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Anglican Church believe in the doctrine of apostolic succession, which holds that properly ordained bishops are the successors to the apostles. Only bishops have the charism certain of the truth (in Latin: \"charisma veritatis certum\"), which is the faculty to establish undoubtedly a truth in matter of faith or morality or concerning the Holy Scripture. Other Christian groups, such as classical Pentecostals, consider the role of a missionary to be fulfilling an apostolic ministry. There are some Christians, however, who advocate restoring the Fivefold ministry, including the formal recognition of the office of apostle. Others would say that the office no longer exists.\nProphet: In the New Testament, the office of prophet is to equip the saints for the work of service through exhortation, edification, and consolation (1 Corinthians 12:28; 1 Corinthians 14:3 Ephesians 4:11). The prophet's corresponding gift is prophecy. Prophecy is \"reporting something that God spontaneously brings to your mind\". Many, particularly Pentecostals and charismatics, distinguish between the \"office of prophet\" and the \"gift of prophecy\", believing that a Christian can possess the gift of prophecy without holding the prophetic office.\nProphecy has been addressed to the human understanding \u201che who prophesies speaks to men,\u201d Cor 14:1-25. The prophet \u201cedifies the church\u201d (14:4).\nEvangelist: An evangelist is one who devotes himself to preaching the gospel. In the New Testament, evangelists preached from city to city, church to church.\nPastor: This term derives from a Greek word for \"shepherd\". In theory pastors are gifted to lead, guide, and set an example for other Christians. The grammatical structure of Ephesians 4:11 leads many to conclude that teacher and pastor should be considered one term (pastor-teacher). Even so, the two terms are not interchangeable; while all pastors are teachers, not all teachers are pastors. Pastoral Gifts include integrity and compassion.\nTeacher: Someone who devotes his or her life to preaching and teaching the Christian faith. When teaching is provided for the Church by God, two gifts are actually given\u2014to the Church is given a teacher and along with the teacher comes a divine capacity to teach.\nService: The word translated as \"ministry\" is \"diakonia\", which can also be translated \"service\". Since there are many types of ministries and service to the Church, this then describes a broad array of gifts rather than a single gift.\nExhortation: The ability to motivate Christians \"to patient endurance, brotherly love, and good works\".\nGiving: Those with this gift share their own possessions with others with extraordinary generosity. While all Christians should be givers, those possessing this gift will go beyond this normal giving.\nLeading: This gift speaks to the various leadership roles found in the Church. While many think of roles such as administration, management of funds, strategy planning, etc. as functions outside of the supernatural realm, in reality individuals in these positions are just as in need of supernatural empowerment as are ministers of the gospel. Some writers consider the gifts of governments and leading to be the same gift, but others consider them closely related yet different.\nMercy: Possibly identical to the gift of helps, the mercy-shower possesses a ministry of visitation, prayer, and compassion to the poor and sick.\nWord of wisdom: An utterance or message of wisdom supernaturally granted to an individual. For Paul, wisdom refers to \"the knowledge of the great Christian mysteries: the Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection of Christ, and the indwelling in the believer of the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2; Ephesians 1:17)\".\nWord of knowledge: The knowledge referred to is often said to relate to understanding Christian doctrine or scriptural truth. It is sometimes said to be connected with the ministry of teachers.\nFaith: This refers to that strong or special faith \"which removes mountains, casts out devils (Matthew 17:19\u201320), and faces the most cruel martyrdom without flinching\". It is distinguished from the \"saving\" and \"normal\" Christian faith.\nGifts of healings: The ability to supernaturally minister healing to others. The plural indicates the variety of sickness healed and the many forms the gift takes, such as healing by anointing with oil, by the laying on of hands, by saying the name of Jesus or by the sign of the cross.\nWorking of miracles: The performance of deeds beyond ordinary human ability by the power of the Holy Spirit.\nVisions. An outpouring of this gift is prophesied in Joel 2:28 and Acts 2:17 shows that early Christians believed this prophecy was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost. Visions tend to be more private experiences than the other gifts. Some researchers expand the definition of visions to include a strongly felt presence.\nDiscerning of spirits: The capacity to discern, distinguish, or to discriminate the source of a spiritual manifestation\u2014whether it emanates from a good or evil spirit. It seemed to have been particularly associated with prophecy as it would be necessary to know whether a prophetic utterance was truly inspired by God.\nTongues: The supernatural ability of speaking an unlearned language. Paul seems to have distinguished between the public use of the gift (which must always be interpreted) and the private use which was for the spiritual strengthening of oneself. Currently among Christians there is a dispute as to whether tongues were/are always xenoglossy (speaking an unlearned human language) or whether it also included/includes glossolalia (speaking an unlearned and allegedly non-human language of heavenly or angelic origin).\nInterpretation of tongues: This gift ought always follow the public exercise of the gift of tongues. In 1 Corinthians 14, the Apostle Paul required that all speech in Christian worship should be intelligible. This required that speech given in an unknown tongue be interpreted in the common language of the gathered Christians.\nHelps: This gift has to do with service to the sick and the poor. Possessors of this gift have a \"spiritual burden and a God-given love for the needy and afflicted\".\nAdministration: Also called the gift of governing, the Greek word translated \"governments\" is \"kubernesis\", the verb form of which means \"to steer\" or \"to be a helmsman\". This gift then refers to the God-given capacity to lead or guide the Church through storms and difficult seas.\nOther spiritual gifts.\nWhile not specifically defined as spiritual gifts in the Bible, other abilities and capacities have been considered as spiritual gifts by some Christians. Some are found in the New Testament such as:\nOthers are found in the Old Testament such as:\nSocial meaning.\nThe word is also used in secular circumstances within social psychology. In that context, charism is defined as personal influence on other people individually or as a group.\nReligious orders (including Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran and Methodist) use the word \"charism\" to describe their spiritual orientation and any special characteristics of their mission or values that might be exhibited as a result of the vows that they have taken and the orientation of the order to which they belong. An example might be the works of a teaching order compared to that of a missionary order or one devoted to the care of the poor or the sick and those in need of help.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During its remarkably long production run it underwent only minor modifications.\nThe Syrena was produced in various models: 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, while the most popular model was the 105. All were two-door sedans with two-stroke engines, initially of two cylinders. In 1965 the Syrena received a larger three-cylinder engine.\nFrom 1968 a prototype model named laminat was produced. A van called Bosto and a pick-up called the R20 were also produced. A coup\u00e9 Syrena Sport and a hatchback Syrena 110 (in 1966) remained prototypes only.\nA Siren is a mermaid who, according to the legend, protects the river Vistula and the Polish capital city, Warsaw. She is featured on the city's coat of arms. Also a diminutive name Syrenka (little siren) is commonly used for the car in Poland.\nHistory.\nAt first, Polish engineers wanted Syrena to have a four-stroke air-cooled engine and a self-supporting chassis. But due to a lack of deep-drawn metal parts and cost reductions, the first Syrena 100 cars were supposed to have a wooden bodywork covered with leather-like material. The cars were powered by 2-stroke engines designed by engineer Fryderyk Bluemke. The first two prototypes of Syrena were made in December 1953. One \u2013 with a wooden framework, was constructed by Stanis\u0142aw Panczakiewicz, while the second, steel-bodied car was made by Stanis\u0142aw \u0141ukaszewicz. They met halfway by combining the first car's design with the steel bodywork of the second one (with one exception \u2013 the roof remained wooden). By March 1955 FSO had built 5 prototypes of Syrena 100.\nIn September all of the prototypes took part in an experimental rally covering a distance of 5600\u00a0km. One of the cars, driven by Karol Pionnier, crashed, revealing the weak structure of the roof. As a result, the engineers decided to use steel instead of wood for this part of the car. One of the prototypes was exhibited at the Pozna\u0144 Trade Fair in autumn 1955. On 20 March 1957 the mass production of Syrena 100 started.\nSyrena 100.\nSyrena 100 was designed by engineers Stanislaw Lukasiewicz, Stanis\u0142aw Panczakiewicz and Fryderyk Bluemke. The chassis and running gear was copied from the DKW. It was introduced to the public in June 1955 at the 24th Pozna\u0144 Trade Fair. The car aroused much interest, which prompted the government to put it into production. At first, the production rate was to be 10,000 cars a year. Because of financial reasons, Syrena 100 and the much larger Warszawa automobile shared many parts. As a result, the Syrena was much heavier than intended (950\u00a0kg).\nSyrena 101.\nIn 1960 Syrena underwent a first, minor modernisation. The improved car had a pneumatic fuel pump and a different type of carburetor. It also received new twin windscreen wipers and a better suspension.\nSyrena 102.\nThe Syrena 102, produced in 1962 and 1963, had slightly different body details. The \"S\" version of this model shared an engine with Wartburg 312. Around 150 examples of Syrena 102S were produced.\nSyrena 103.\nSyrena 103 (1963\u201366) had a restyled front and a different engine.\nSyrena 104.\nThe next model lasted from 1966 to 1972. It had a new, three-cylinder engine, a synchronized gearbox and restyled tail lights.\nSyrena 105.\nThe 105 was the last Syrena design. It was produced from 1972 to 1983 by the FSM factory and was badged accordingly. Unlike its predecessors it had regular front doors instead of \"suicide\" ones. The \"Lux\" version, produced from 1974, had the gear lever and handbrake between the front seats. The 105 served as a basis for two other models \u2013 Syrena R-20, which was a pick-up and a van \u2013 Bosto.\nA 1983 FSM Syrena 105L finished in yellow was featured in series 10 episode 10 of the British television program \"Wheeler Dealers\". Presenter Mike Brewer purchased the car in Poland for z\u01427,000 (the equivalent of \u00a31,400) and drove it back to the show's UK-based workshop where it underwent repairs and upgrades by mechanic Edd China. The colour was changed to red and white in homage to the Polish flag. Other work included upgrades to the steering box, refurbishing the drum brakes, replacing the dynamo with an alternator and replacing the radio. The total cost of procuring and upgrading the car reached \u00a35454. The completed car was driven to the Polish embassy where ambassador Witold Sobk\u00f3w took a ride with them. The car was later sold for \u00a38,000 to the bubble car museum in Lincolnshire.\nSyrena Bosto.\nThe Syrena Bosto panel van and its pickup truck sister, the Syrena R-20, were first introduced to the 104 models of the Syrena. The name is an acronym of \"Bielski Osobowo-Towarowy\", or \"Passenger-Cargo [car] of Bielsko.\" The first model of the Bosto was revealed in December 1971, at the newly constructed FSM factory in Bielsko-Biala in southern Poland. The final model finished production 30 April 1983. Overall, approximately 135,000 Bostos were built.\nThe Bosto 104B started official production in 1972, and was available as a four-seater van, capable of carrying 200\u00a0kg of freight, or as a two-seater cab with a 350\u00a0kg load rating. The second edition, Syrena Bosto 105B, replaced the 104 in 1976. Essentially the same vehicle stylistically, the differences were in construction. Uprated semi-elliptical springs from the FSO Warszawa, an increased fuel tank borrowed from the FSO 125p, and the handbrake moved to the \"standard\" position between the front seats were the main modifications. As with the Syrena saloon the 3-cylinder, 2-stroke engine was mounted longitudinally in front of the front axle and powered the front wheels through a gearbox with driveshafts coming sideways out of it.\nThe driver's compartment was separated from the rear load space by a single sheet bulkhead, and additional roof-fixed netting. Because the Bosto was designed for heavy loads, as opposed to the sedan version of the Syrena, the suspension underneath was modified. An extended chassis held a rear trailing axle on leaf suspension, each with a hydraulic suspension damper. This allowed a lower floor level, and in turn allowed FSM to borrow directly parts from the Zuk A05/A06.\nDimensions.\nWeight: 950\u00a0kg\nWheelbase: 2300mm\nLength: 39650mm\nRear Compartment: H-1600\u00a0mm x W-1470\u00a0mm\nSyrena Sport.\nIn 1960 a prototype Syrena Sport was produced with a fibreglass body and a four-stroke two-cylinder engine. However, this model was not put into production.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contains 10 to 20 species that are native to Africa and Eurasia from the Canary Islands, all of Africa, and southern Europe, warm and semidesert areas across Asia, and North America from Guatemala to Mexico, as well as southern Texas.\nDescription.\n\"Pistacia\" plants are shrubs and small trees growing to tall. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and can be either evergreen or deciduous depending on species. All species are dioecious, but monoecious individuals of \"Pistacia atlantica\" have been noted. The genus is estimated to be about 80 million years old.\nIt is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Anacardiaceae. The plants are dioecious, and have male and female trees independently; a viable population should have both sexes.\nWell-known species in the genus \"Pistacia\" include \"P. vera\", the pistachio, grown for its edible seeds; \"P.\u00a0terebinthus\", from which terebinth resin, a turpentine, is produced; \"P.\u00a0lentiscus\", source of the plant resin mastic; and \"P.\u00a0chinensis\", the Chinese pistache, cultivated as an ornamental tree.\n\"P. vera\" genome.\nScientists from Iran and China assembled a draft genome of pistachio and resequenced 107 whole genomes, including 93 domestic and 14 wild individuals of \"P.\u00a0vera\" and 35 other genomes from different wild \"Pistacia\" species. Integrating genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed expanded gene families (e.g., cytochrome P450 and chitinase) and the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthetic pathway that are likely involved in stress adaptation. Comparative population genomic analyses revealed that pistachio was domesticated about\u20098000\u2009years ago, and that likely key genes for domestication are those involved in tree and seed size, which experienced artificial selection.\nSpecies.\n\"Bursera simaruba\" was formerly classified as \"P. simaruba\" \nEcology.\nThe \"Pistacia\" species are vicarious Anacardiaceae with few species outside the Old World, and are mostly more adapted to water shortage and alkaline soil.\nMany plant species are adapted to desert or summer drought typical of Mediterranean climate, so have a high tolerance to saline soil. They grow well in water containing up to 0.3 to 0.4% of soluble salts. They are quite resilient in their ecological requirements, and can survive in temperatures ranging from \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C in winter to 45\u00a0\u00b0C in summer. They prefer places oriented toward the sun and well-drained soil, but grow well in the bottom of ravines. Though very hardy and drought resistant, \"Pistacia\" species grow slowly and only begin to bear fruit after about 7\u201310 years from planting, obtaining full development only after 15\u201320 years. The fruit ripens in the Mediterranean from August; only female trees have fruit.\nAlthough some species prefer moderate humidity, they do not grow well in high-humidity conditions. They are susceptible to root rot, molds, and fungi, and parasites attack if they receive too much water and the soil has insufficient drainage. They require a period of drought each year for proper development.\nTheir leaves are intensely bright green and leathery, with three to nine leaflets. The leaves are alternate, compound, and paripinnate.\nThe flowers are unisexual, apetalous, and grouped in clusters. The flowers range from purple to green. The fruit is a drupe, generally unpalatable to humans, the size of a pea, and red to brown in color, depending on the degree of maturation. The seeds do not have endosperm.\nThe seeds are eaten and dispersed by birds, for which they are a valuable resource because of the scarcity of food in some important times of year, as the time of breeding, migration, or the dry season. The commercial species of pistachio has larger fruits and is edible.\nThe plants emit a bitter, resinous, or medicative smell, which in some species is very intense and aromatic. Some species develop \"galls\" that occur in the leaves and leaflets after the bite of insects. Although marred by the presence of galls, they are very vigorous and resistant plants that survive in degraded areas where other species have been eliminated. They multiply by seeds, stolons, and root shoots. Various species hybridize easily between them, and hybrid plants are difficult to identify.\nSome tree species (e.g. \"Pistacia aethiopica\", \"Pistacia atlantica\") can exist as small bushes and shrubs due to the extremes of their habitat, adverse conditions, or the excessive consumption by wildlife or livestock that hinders growth.\n\"Pistacia lentiscus\" is a very common plant related to \"P.\u00a0terebinthus\" with which it hybridizes. \"P.\u00a0terebinthus\" is more abundant in the mountains and inland in the Iberian Peninsula, and mastic is usually found more frequently in areas where the Mediterranean influence of the sea prevents or moderates frost. Some species with very small ranges cover only one or a group of islands in the Mediterranean. \"P.\u00a0terebinthus\" is also found on the east coast of the Mediterranean, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, filling the same ecological niche of these species. On the west coast of the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands, and the Middle East, it can be confused with \"Pistacia atlantica\".\n\"Pistacia\" species are used as food plants by the larvae (caterpillars) of some species of Lepidoptera including the emperor moth.\nCultivation and uses.\nBest known as the pistachio, \"P. vera\" is a small tree native to Iran, grown for its edible seeds. The seeds of the other species were also eaten in prehistory, but are too small to have commercial value today. Records of \"Pistacia\" from preclassical archaeological sites, and mentions in preclassical texts, always refer to one of these other species (often \"P.\u00a0terebinthus\").\n\"P. terebinthus\" (the terebinth), also a native of Iran, and the western Mediterranean countries, is tapped for turpentine. It is also common in the eastern Mediterranean countries. Because terebinths have the ability to kill certain bacteria, terebinth resin was widely used as a preservative in ancient wine. In the Zagros Mountains of Iran, in one of the earliest examples of winemaking, archaeologists discovered terebinth resin deposits from 5400 to 5000\u00a0BC in jars that also contained grape-juice residue.\n\"P. lentiscus\", an evergreen shrub or small tree of the Mediterranean region, supplies a resin called mastic.\n\"P. chinensis\" (Chinese pistache), the most frost-tolerant species in the genus, is grown as an ornamental tree, valued for its bright red autumn leaf colour.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Data related to at Wikispecies"}

{"id": "69209", "revid": "39029752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69209", "title": "Semivowel", "text": "Transitional phoneme produced like a vowel but used like a syllable boundary\nIn phonetics and phonology, a semivowel, glide or semiconsonant is a sound that is phonetically similar to a vowel sound but functions as the syllable boundary, rather than as the nucleus of a syllable. Examples of semivowels in English are \"y\" and \"w\" in \"yes\" and \"west\", respectively. Written in IPA, \"y\" and \"w\" are near to the vowels \"ee\" and \"oo\" in \"seen\" and \"moon,\" written in IPA. The term \"glide\" may alternatively refer to any type of transitional sound, not necessarily a semivowel.\nClassification.\nSemivowels form a subclass of approximants. Although \"semivowel\" and \"approximant\" are sometimes treated as synonymous, most authors use the term \"semivowel\" for a more restricted set; there is no universally agreed-upon definition, and the exact details may vary from author to author. For example, do not consider the labiodental approximant to be a semivowel.\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet, the diacritic attached to non-syllabic vowel letters is an inverted breve placed below the symbol representing the vowel: . When there is no room for the inverted breve under a symbol, it may be written above, using . Before 1989, non-syllabicity was represented by , which now stands for extra-shortness.\nAdditionally, there are dedicated symbols for four semivowels that correspond to the four close cardinal vowel sounds:\nSome authors argue for the recognition of additional semivowels:\nContrast with vowels.\nSemivowels, by definition, contrast with vowels by being non-syllabic. In addition, they are usually shorter than vowels. In languages such as Amharic, Yoruba, and Zuni, semivowels are produced with a narrower constriction in the vocal tract than their corresponding vowels. Nevertheless, semivowels may be phonemically equivalent with vowels. For example, the English word \"fly\" can be considered either as an open syllable ending in a diphthong or as a closed syllable ending in a consonant .\nIt is unusual for a language to contrast a semivowel and a diphthong containing an equivalent vowel, but Romanian contrasts the diphthong with , a perceptually similar approximant-vowel sequence. The diphthong is analyzed as a single segment, and the approximant-vowel sequence is analyzed as two separate segments.\nIn addition to phonological justifications for the distinction (such as the diphthong alternating with in singular-plural pairs), there are phonetic differences between the pair:\nAlthough a phonological parallel exists between and , the production and perception of phonetic contrasts between the two is much weaker, likely because of lower lexical load for , which is limited largely to loanwords from French, and speakers' difficulty in maintaining contrasts between two back rounded semivowels in comparison to front ones.\nContrast with fricatives/spirant approximants.\nAccording to the standard definitions, semivowels (such as ) contrast with fricatives (such as ) in that fricatives produce turbulence, but semivowels do not. In discussing Spanish, Mart\u00ednez Celdr\u00e1n suggests setting up a third category of \"spirant approximant\", contrasting both with semivowel approximants and with fricatives. Though the spirant approximant is more constricted (having a lower F2 amplitude), longer, and unspecified for rounding ( 'widow' vs. 'help'), the distributional overlap is limited. The spirant approximant can only appear in the syllable onset (including word-initially, where the semivowel never appears). The two overlap in distribution after and : ('to plaster') vs. 'flood', and although there is dialectal and idiolectal variation, speakers may also exhibit other near-minimal pairs like 'abject' vs. 'opened'. One potential minimal pair (depending on dialect) is 'already seen' vs. 'and he has seen'.\nAgain, it is not present in all dialects. Other dialects differ in either merging the two or enhancing the contrast by moving the former to another place of articulation (), like in Rioplatense Spanish.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are also variously called Gradual Psalms, Fifteen Psalms, Songs of Degrees, Songs of Steps, songs for going up to worship or Pilgrim Songs.\nFour of them (Psalms 122, 124, 131, and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one (127) to Solomon. Three of them (Psalms 131, 133, and 134) have only three verses. The longest is Psalm 132 (18 verses).\nA chiastic structure is seen by many in these Psalms with Psalm 127 a Psalm of Solomon as center. Preceded and succeeded by seven Psalms of ascent, each side adorned with 24 occurrences of 'Yahweh,' a numerical symmetry evoking divine significance.\n12 of the 15 Psalms, excluding Psalm 127, echo phrases from the priestly blessing, 'The Lord keep you and bless you; may His face shine upon you,' except for the unusual omission of 'make His face shine upon you'.\nThe centrality of Psalm 127, attributed to Solomon, the builder of God's 'house,' resonates as pilgrims sing these Psalms on their journey to the sacred dwelling. The pilgrimage begins with references to locations north and south of Israel, depicting distance from the temple in Psalm 120, concluding with a blessing for temple night-shift servants in Psalm 134. This nuanced symphony of balance, priestly blessings, and geographical references invites scholarly contemplation.\nHistory.\nMany scholars believe the title indicates that these psalms were sung by worshippers as they ascended the road to Jerusalem to attend the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (). Others think they were sung by the Levite singers as they ascended the fifteen steps to minister at the Temple in Jerusalem. One view says the Levites first sang the Songs at the dedication of Solomon's temple during the night of the fifteenth of Tishri 959 BC. Another study suggests that they were composed for a celebration after Nehemiah's rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls in 445 BC. Others consider that they may originally have been individual poems which were later collected together and given the title linking them to pilgrimage after the Babylonian captivity.\nThey were well suited for being sung by their poetic form and the sentiments they express. \"They are characterized by brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora [\"i.e.\", repetition], and by their epigrammatic style... More than half of them are cheerful, and all of them hopeful.\" As a collection, they contain a number of repeated formulaic phrases, as well as an emphasis on Zion.\nThe Great Psalms Scroll (11Q5), one of the Dead Sea Scrolls written between \u00a0CE, contains a set of psalms partially coincident with the canonical Psalms. Most of the canonical psalms it contains are in a different order than in Psalms, but the Songs of Ascents are included in full in their canonical order.\nJudaism.\nHistorical.\nThere are two references to the Songs of Ascents in the Mishnah, noting the correspondence between the fifteen songs and the temple's fifteen steps between the Israelite's court and the women's court. Rashi refers to a Talmudic legend that King David composed or sang the fifteen songs to calm rising waters at the foundation of the temple.\nPresent day.\nPsalm 126, eponymously called \"Shir Hamaalot\" due to its common use, is traditionally recited by Ashkenazim before the Grace After Meals on Shabbat, Jewish holidays, and other festive occasions in keeping with its themes of joy and redemption. The psalm is sung to a wide variety of tunes both liturgical and secular.\nIt is traditional for some Jews to place a copy of Psalm 121 in the labor and delivery room to promote an easy labor by asking God for mercy. As well, it is placed on the baby's carriage and in the baby's room to protect the child and surround them in learning and with holy objects.\nThe 15 chapter are recited in some communities following Mincha on Shabbat afternoon in the winter.\nPsalm 128 is recited in some communities in Maariv at the conclusion of the Sabbath.\nChristian liturgy.\nThe liturgical use of these psalms came into Christianity through its Jewish roots. The form of the Hebrew Bible used in early Christianity was primarily the Septuagint. In the Septuagint, these psalms are numbered 119\u2013133.\nMany early hermits observed the practice of reciting the entire Psalter daily, cenobites communities would chant the entire Psalter in a week, so these psalms would be said regularly, during the canonical hours.\nEastern Christianity.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, the Songs of Degrees (Greek: \"anabathmoi\") make up the Eighteenth Kathisma (division of the Psalter), and are read on Friday evenings at Vespers throughout the liturgical year. The Kathisma is divided into three sections (called \"stases\") of five psalms each.\nDuring Great Lent the Eighteenth Kathisma is read every weekday (Monday through Friday evening) at Vespers, and on Monday through Wednesday of Holy Week. In the Slavic usage this Kathisma is also read from the apodosis of the Exaltation of the Cross up to the forefeast of the Nativity of Christ, and from the apodosis of Theophany up to the Sunday of the Prodigal Son. The reason for this is that the nights are longer in winter, especially in the northern latitudes, so during this season three Kathismata will be chanted at Matins instead of two, so in order to still have a reading from the Psalter at Vespers, the Eighteenth Kathisma is repeated.\nAnabathmoi.\nAt Matins on Sundays and feast days throughout the year, special hymns called \"anabathmoi\" (, from \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, 'step'; Slavonic: \"step\u00e9nny\") are chanted immediately before the prokeimenon and Matins Gospel. These anabathmoi are compositions based upon the Songs of Ascents, and are written in the eight tones of Byzantine chant. The Anabathmoi for each tone consists of three \"stases\" or sets of verses (sometimes called antiphons), except for Tone 8 which has four stases. On Sundays, the anabathmoi are chanted according to the tone of the week; on feast days which do not fall on Sunday, the Anabathmoi almost always consist of the first stasis in Tone 4 (based on Psalm 128).\nSymbolically, the anabathmoi are chanted as a reminder that Christians are ascending to the Heavenly Jerusalem, and that the spiritual intensity of the service is rising as they approach the reading of the Gospel.\nWestern Christianity.\nThe Western Daily Office was strongly influenced by the Rule of Saint Benedict, where these psalms are assigned to Terce, Sext and Nones on weekdays. Over the centuries, however, various schedules have been used for reciting the psalms. Among the laity, the devotion of the Fifteen Psalms was adopted within primer prayer books.\nIn the arrangement used in the Roman Rite until 1911, Psalms 119\u2013132 are said at Vespers, from Monday to Thursday, and Psalm 133 was one of the four Psalms said every day at Compline. After the reform by Pope Pius X in 1911, and continuing in the later reform by Pope John XXIII in 1960, these psalms remained at Vespers, but not always on the same day as previously. Psalm 133 was said at Compline only on Sundays and major feasts. The 1960 reform is still in use as the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite.\nIn the modern Liturgy of the Hours of the Catholic Church, the Gradual Psalms are used in several ways:\nText.\n\"(1) A Song of Ascents. I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come? (2) My help cometh from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth. (3) He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; He that keepeth thee will not slumber. (4) Behold, He that keepeth Israel Doth neither slumber nor sleep. (5) The LORD is thy keeper; The LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. (6) The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night. (7) The LORD shall keep thee from all evil; He shall keep thy soul. (8) The LORD shall guard thy going out and thy coming in, From this time forth and for ever.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Headquartered in Redmond, Washington, with assembly facilities in Petropavl, Kazakhstan, Ural is the oldest and one of the world's largest manufacturers of sidecar-equipped motorcycles. \nHistory.\nIMZ-Ural's origins are linked to developments in the Eastern Front during World War II as the Soviet Union was preparing to repel possible military action by Nazi Germany. Mobility was especially stressed after the Soviet Union had witnessed the effect of the blitzkrieg on Poland, and a small, rugged, multi-purpose vehicle that could handle Russia's underdeveloped road network and pockmarked battlefields was a priority.\nPre-war and the Nazi Invasion.\nA meeting was held at the People's Commissariat of Defense of the USSR at the end of 30s to devise a motorcycle that would be suitable for the Red Army, and the Nazi Wehrmacht's BMW R71 motorcycle was found to closely match the Red Army's requirements. Five units were covertly purchased through Sweden and handed over to Moscow Motorcycle Plant, recently organized in a retooled bicycle factory. Soviet engineers dismantled the BMWs and reverse engineered the bike's design in every detail. Molds and dies were made to produce engines, gearboxes and other components. The production of these new military sidecar motorcycles, designated M-72 by the Red Army, started in August 1941.\nThe suspected military offensive occurred in the summer of 1941, as the Nazis executed Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Soviet Union. The opening stages of the attack were so swift and so effective, that Soviet strategists worried that Moscow would quickly be in range of Luftwaffe bombers. On October 21, 1941, the decision was made to move the motorcycle plant east, out of bombing range and into the resource-rich Ural mountain region. The site chosen was the town of Irbit, located on the fringes of Siberia in the Ural Mountains.\nIrbit was chosen because it had been an important trade center throughout Russian history and was the site of the country's second largest fair before the Revolution of 1917. The only available building large enough to contain the factory was a brewery outside of town, beyond the railway line. This brewery became the Irbit Motorcycle Factory, or IMZ (Russian \u0418\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434; Romanized Irbitsky Motosikletny Zavod), and quickly began cranking out motorcycles for the war effort. On February 25, 1942, the first batch of motorcycles\u2014assembled from the parts brought from Moscow\u2014went to the front. During WWII a total of 9,799 M-72 motorcycles were delivered for reconnaissance detachments and mobile troops.\nPost-war Developments.\nAfter the war, the IMZ factory was expanded and updated, which including construction of frame and body parts shops, an aluminum foundry, and other shops to produce various motorcycle components. Throughout the 1950s, the motorcycles produced by IMZ were for military use only. By the end of the decade, however, military production was moved to a sister plant in Kyiv, Ukraine, (KMZ) while IMZ focused on producing bikes for the domestic market. During this time, the IMZ facility grew into a massive, Soviet-style collective factory that produced nearly every component used to build its motorcycles. The factory's various shops produced everything from rubber and plastic parts to shock absorbers, brake components, and control cables. Nearly 10,000 people worked at the massive factory, and at its peak it produced around 130,000 motorcycles annually\u2014primarily for the Russian domestic market as a cheap alternative to automobiles.\nUral Exports.\nIMZ began exporting motorcycles in 1953, mostly to Soviet states and allies in the Global South. Over the next five decades, Ural motorcycles were exported to every corner of the Soviet Union and could be found as far afield as Western Europe, Southeast Asia, India, and even the U.S. In the 1970s, UK company Satra Motors imported Urals to sell under the Cossack Motorcycles brand. In 1994, an independent distributor called Ural-America began selling Urals in the United States. This set the foundations of Ural's presence in America and led directly to the formation of the current IMZ-Ural company.\nAs of 2023, Ural Motorcycles are sold all over the world through a network of over 190 dealerships and service centers. Ural's main market is the United States, but the company's bikes are popular in Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and throughout the European Union.\nModern-day products.\nUral's main product is a heavy-duty, sidecar-equipped adventure motorcycle called the Gear Up. Available in three trim levels\u2014Base, Standard, and Expedition\u2014the Gear Up is powered by Ural's 749cc, air-cooled, four-stroke, fuel injected, overhead-valve, two-cylinder boxer engine that produces 41 horsepower at 5,500 RPM and 42-foot-pounds of torque at 4,300 RPM. Power is transmitted to the rear wheel through a four-speed (plus reverse) gearbox with a dual-disc dry clutch and a shaft final drive. In addition, all Gear Ups feature an on-demand two-wheel drive system that powers the sidecar wheel via a CV driveshaft connected to the rear drive hub.\nDespite its classic looks, and rumors to the contrary, the Gear Up is a thoroughly modern, if simple, motorcycle equipped with high-end parts from numerous international parts suppliers. The brakes are a combination of Brembo two-piston calipers and floating rotors by NG Brakes on all three wheels, suspension is by Sachs, and the rugged tires are by Heidenau Tires. Other parts are supplied by Denso (electrics), Keihin (throttle bodies), J. Juan (parking brake), and Italcerchio (wheels), among others. \nAlong with being fully integrated into the modern global supply chain, Ural and its products are in compliance with all applicable environmental and safety standards and protocols, including Euro 5.\nCorporate information.\nIn November 1992, the state-owned IMZ transformed into a privatized entity owned 40 percent by management and employees through grant, 38 percent by auction with privatization vouchers (mostly management and employees also), with 22 percent retained by the government.\nAt the beginning of 1998, the business was bought by Russian-Georgian statesmen and businessman Kakha Bendukidze. By that time, IMZ had almost completely lost the domestic market as Russians started buying used Western cars instead of sidecar motorcycles. In 1998 IMZ produced fewer than 2,000 units but the factory still employed nearly 4,000 people. To fix this problem, Bendukidze brought in new management and mandated new ideas. Investments were made to develop a two-wheeled motorcycle, the chopper-styled Ural Wolf. Unfortunately, the Wolf's price was too high and its quality was too low and the company couldn't sell enough bikes to stay afloat.\nIn October 2000, the factory had to halt production as it wasn't able to pay its bills and Bendukidze was unwilling to invest more money into the dying company. That December, Bendukidze sold the factory to three individuals\u2014including the company's current CEO and majority shareholder, the Russian-born American businessman Ilya Khait\u2014in a process of management buyout. The new owners immediately began reorganizing the factory by selling off assets, reducing the workforce by two-thirds, and consolidating production in the facility's smaller buildings. The new owners also decided to focus mainly on export markets and to do what the factory did best\u2014produce sidecar-equipped motorcycles. Motorcycle production restarted in the spring of 2001.\nThe next year, in 2002, the new owners decided to consolidate the disparate distribution networks under company control. The American distribution arm, Irbit Motorworks of America, Inc., was incorporated in Redmond, WA. Ural Motorcycles GmbH, the European distribution arm, was formed in Austria in 2003. Corporate headquarters was moved to the United States in 2006 with the formation of the holding company IMZ-Ural Group, Inc. in Redmond, WA. Besides the manufacturing entities, IMZ-Ural Group, Inc. currently owns distribution companies in the US, Australia, Japan, Spain, and the Czech Republic.\nDuring the opening rounds of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, IMZ-Ural released a statement unequivocally condemning the invasion and calling for a peaceful resolution. In March of that year, Ural production ground to a halt due to inability to import components and export bikes out of Russia caused by international sanctions laid on the country. \nIn light of these issues, the company decided to open a new assembly facility in Petropavl, Kazakhstan. Petropavl, a city roughly 373 miles (600 kilometers) south-east from Irbit, was chosen because it had an established industrial infrastructure and a sizeable Russian-speaking populace.\nProduction at the new factory, IMZ-Kazakhstan, began in August 2022, and shipment of new motorcycles started soon thereafter. Since then, all new Ural Gear Ups have been built in Kazakhstan using parts supplied from all over the world.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Members of the Anacardiaceae bear fruits that are drupes and in some cases produce urushiol, an irritant. The Anacardiaceae include numerous genera, several of which are economically important, notably cashew (in the type genus \"Anacardium\"), mango, Chinese lacquer tree, yellow mombin, Peruvian pepper, sumac, smoke tree, marula and cuachalalate. The genus \"Pistacia\" (which includes the pistachio and mastic tree) is now included, but was previously placed in its own family, the Pistaciaceae.\nThe cashew family is more abundant in warm or tropical regions with only a few species living in the temperate zones. Mostly native to tropical Americas, Africa and India. \"Pistacia\" and some species of \"Rhus\" can be found in southern Europe, \"Rhus\" species can be found in much of North America and \"Schinus\" inhabits South America exclusively.\nDescription.\nTrees or shrubs, each has inconspicuous flowers and resinous or milky sap that may be highly poisonous, as in black poisonwood and sometimes foul-smelling.\nResin canals located in the inner fibrous bark of the fibrovascular system found in the plant's stems, roots, and leaves are characteristic of all members of this family; resin canals located in the pith are characteristic of many of the cashew family species and several species have them located in the primary cortex or the regular bark. Tannin sacs are also widespread among the family.\nThe wood of the Anacardiaceae has the frequent occurrence of simple small holes in the vessels, occasionally in some species side by side with scalariform holes (in \"Campnosperma\", \"Micronychia\", and \"Heeria argentea\" (\"Anaphrenium argenteum\"). The simple pits are located along the vessel wall and in contact with the parenchyma.\nLeaves are deciduous or evergreen, usually alternate (rarely opposite), estipulate (without stipule) and imparipinnate (rarely paripinnate or bipinnate), usually with opposite leaflets (rarely alternate), while others are trifoliolate or simple or unifoliolate (very rarely simple leaves are palmate). Leaf architecture is very diverse. Primary venation is pinnate (rarely palmate). Secondary venation is eucamptodromous, brochidodromous, craspedodromous or cladodromous (rarely reticulodromous) Cladodromous venation, if present is considered diagnostic for Anacardiaceae.\nFlowers grow at the end of a branch or stem or at an angle from where the leaf joins the stem and have bracts.\nOften with this family, bisexual and male flowers occur on some plants, and bisexual and female flowers are on others, or flowers have both stamens and pistils (perfect). A calyx with three to seven cleft sepals and the same number of petals, occasionally no petals, overlap each other in the bud. Stamens are twice as many or equal to the number of petals, inserted at the base of the fleshy ring or cup-shaped disk, and inserted below the pistil(s).\nStamen stalks are separate, and anthers are able to move.\nFlowers have the ovary free, but the petals and stamen are borne on the calyx.\nIn the stamenate flowers, ovaries are single-celled. In the pistillate flowers, ovaries are single or sometimes quadri- or quinticelled. One to three styles and one ovule occur in each cavity.\nFruits rarely open at maturity\nand are most often drupes.\nSeed coats are very thin or are crust-like. Little or no endosperm is present. Cotyledons are fleshy.\nSeeds are solitary with no albumen around the embryo.\nTaxonomy.\nHistory.\nIn 1759, Bernard de Jussieu arranged the plants in the royal garden of the Trianon at Versailles, according to his own scheme. That classification included a description of an order called the Terebintace\u00e6, which contained a suborder that included \"Cassuvium\" (\"Anacardium\"), \"Anacardium\" (\"Semecarpus\"), \"Mangifera\", \"Connarus\", \"Rhus\", and \"Rourea\". In 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, nephew of Bernard de Jussieu, published that classification scheme.\nRobert Brown described a subset of the Terebintaceae called Cassuvl\u00e6 or Anacarde\u00e6 in 1818, using the herbarium that was collected by Christen Smith during a fated expedition headed by James Hingston Tuckey to explore the River Congo. The name and genera were based on the order with the same name that had been described by de Jussieu in 1759. The herbarium from that expedition contained only one genus from the family, \"Rhus\".\nAugustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1824, used Robert Brown's name Cassuvl\u00e6 or Anacarde\u00e6, wrote another description of the group, and filled it with the genera \"Anacardium\", \"Semecarpus\", \"Holigarna\", \"Mangifera\", \"Buchanania\", \"Pistacia\", \"Astronium\", \"Comocladia\", and \"Picramnia\".\nJohn Lindley described the \"essential character\" of the Anacardiace\u00e6, the \"Cashew Tribe\" in 1831, adopting the order that was described by de Jussieu, but abandoning the name Terebintace\u00e6. He includes the genera that were found in de Candolle's Anacardie\u00e6 and Sumachine\u00e6: \"Anacardium\", \"Holigarna\", \"Mangifera\", \"Rhus\", and \"Mauria\".\nPhylogeny.\nThe genus \"Pistacia\" has sometimes been separated into its own family, the Pistaciaceae, based on the reduced flower structure, differences in pollen, and the feathery style of the flowers.The nature of its ovary, though, does suggest it belongs in the Anacardiaceae, a position supported by morphological and molecular studies, and recent classifications have included \"Pistacia\" in the Anacardiaceae.

Pell's (2008) molecular analysis reinstated the two subfamilies without further division into tribes (Pell 2004).

In the indefinite form (\"son of Adam\", \"son of man\", \"like a man\") used in the Hebrew Bible, it is a form of address; or it contrasts humans with God and the angels; or it contrasts foreign nations (like the Sasanian Empire and Babylon), which are often represented as animals in apocalyptic writings (bear, goat, or ram), with Israel which is represented as human (a \"son of man\"); or it signifies an eschatological human figure.\nThe phrase is used in its indefinite form in the Septuagint, Biblical apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. The Greek New Testament uses the earlier indefinite form while introducing a novel definite form, \"the son of man.\"\nHistory.\nJewish Bible.\nThe Hebrew expression \"son of man\" () appears 107 times in the Hebrew Bible, the majority (93 times) in the Book of Ezekiel. It is used in three main ways: as a form of address (Ezekiel); to contrast the lowly status of humanity against the permanence and exalted dignity of God and the angels (, ); and as a future eschatological figure whose coming will signal the end of history and the time of God's judgment ().\nDaniel 7 tells of a vision given to Daniel in which four \"beasts,\" representing pagan nations, oppress the people of Israel until judged by God. describes how the \"Ancient of Days\" (God) gives dominion over the earth to \"one \"like a son of man\" ( [])\". The passage in Daniel 7:13 occurs in Biblical Aramaic.\nLater, in chapter 7, it is explained that \"one like a man\" certainly implies a \"human being\" and also stands for \"the saints of the Most High\" (7:18, 21\u201322) and \"the people of the saints of the Most High\" (7:27). The \"saints\" and \"people of the saints,\" in turn, probably stand for the Israelites \u2013 the vision sees it that God will take dominion over the world away from the beast-like pagan \"nations\" and give it to human-like Israel.\nApocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.\nAlthough Daniel's 7:13 \"like a son of man\" has been interpreted as standing for the Messiah (e.g. in Rashi's \"Commentary on the Tanakh\"), this interpretation was probably introduced by later apocryphal and deuterocanonical works such as the Similitudes (or Parables) of Enoch and 4 Ezra. Whether these messianic \"Son of Man\" references are genuinely Jewish or the result of Christian interpolation is disputed. An example of a disputed section is that of The Similitudes (1 Enoch 37\u201371) which uses Daniel 7 to produce an unparalleled messianic Son of Man, pre-existent and hidden yet ultimately revealed, functioning as judge, vindicator of righteousness, and universal ruler. The Enochic messianic figure is an individual representing a group (the Righteous One who represents the righteous, the Elect One representing the elect), but in (also called 2 Esdras) he becomes an individual man.\nNew Testament.\nThe New Testament features the indefinite \"a son of man\" in (citing ), and \"one like the son of man\" in (referencing Daniel 7:13's \"one like a son of man\"). The Gospels introduce a new definite form, , literally 'the son of the man,' an awkward and ambiguous expression in Greek. It functions as an emphatic equivalent of the first-person pronoun I/me/my, and in all four gospels it is used only by Jesus (except once in the Gospel of John, when the crowd asks what Jesus means by it). German theologian Rudolf Bultmann sees the phrase not as one genuinely used by Jesus but as one inserted by the early Church, but theologian C. F. D. Moule argues that the phrase, \"so far from being a title evolved from current apocalyptic thought by the early Church and put by it onto the lips of Jesus, is among the most important symbols used by Jesus himself to describe his vocation and that of those whom he summoned to be with him.\"\nThe title \"Son of Man\" is the most frequently used designation for Jesus in the Gospels, particularly in his own self-references. Outside the Gospels, however, \"Christ\" (Messiah) becomes the dominant title, especially in the writings of Paul and the broader New Testament epistles.\nIn the New Testament, Jesus combines the titles \"Son of Man\" and \"Son of God\" in key theological moments. In his conversation with Nicodemus, he unites both titles while speaking of his divine mission and salvation. At his trial before the Sanhedrin, he affirms his identity by linking them again. Other instances include his discourse on resurrection and judgment, Peter\u2019s confession at Caesarea Philippi, and Martha\u2019s confession before the raising of Lazarus.\nThe term in the source languages.\nThe exact words used for \"son of man\" vary, depending on the source language.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The group initially lived under Tuyuhun authority, but later submitted to the Tang dynasty. After the collapse of Tang dynasty, the Tanguts established the Western Xia. They spoke the Tangut language, which was previously believed to be one of the Qiangic languages or Yi languages of the Tibeto-Burman family.\" Phylogenetic and historical linguistic accounts revealed that Tangut belonged to the Gyalrongic branch of the Qiangic group. The Western Xia was annihilated by the Mongol Empire in 1227, and most of its written records and architecture were destroyed. Today the Tangut language and its unique script are extinct; only fragments of Tangut literature remain.\nLanguage.\nThe Tangut language, otherwise known as \"Fan\", belongs to the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Like many other Sino-Tibetan languages, it is a tonal language with predominantly mono-syllabic roots, but it shares certain grammatical traits central to the Tibeto-Burman branch. It used to be debated as to whether Tangut belonged to the Yi or Qiangic subdivision of Tibeto-Burman. The Tanguts, called the Dangxiang () in Chinese, are typically regarded by Chinese scholars to be synonymous with or at least related to the Qiang people. Historically, \"Qiang\" was a collective term for the multiple ethnic groups who lived on the western borderlands of China, including the modern Qiang people (Rma). The name Tangut first appears in the Orkhon inscriptions of 735. In their own Tangut language, the Tanguts called themselves \"Mi-niah\" (Mi\u00f1ak). Until the 19th century, the term Minjak was still used to refer to the area inhabited by Qiang people in today's Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture. Speakers of the Qiangic Muya language in western Kangding calls themselves Minyak. Geographic names such as Min river and Min county (Gansu) are pointed to this root.\nAppearance.\nAccording to William of Rubruck, who travelled to various parts of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, the Tanguts were valiant and had big swarthy men among them, in contrast to the Uyghurs, who were \"of medium size, like us\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Tangut people I saw were tall but swarthy. The Iugurs are of medium build like our own people.\u2014\u200a\nOrigin.\nThe early Tanguts inhabited the steppes and mountains of southeast Qinghai and northwest Sichuan. Their home originally was in the highlands of western Sichuan. These regions correspond to the Amdo and Kham regions of the Tibetan plateau. At some point their leader Tuoba Chici, who was likely of mixed Xianbei and Qiang heritage, submitted to Tang China rule and was bestowed the title of Captain General of Western-Rong and the surname \"Li\". In the early 8th century, increasing pressure from the Tibetan Empire had forced the Tanguts to migrate north from their homelands in northeastern Tibet to the eastern Ordos region. By the time of the An Lushan Rebellion (755\u2013763), the Tanguts were the predominant local power in what is now eastern Gansu, Ningxia, and northern Shaanxi.\nHistory.\nIn 881 the Tanguts, who were subjects of Tang China, assisted Tang in suppressing the Huang Chao rebellion. As a reward the Tang central government granted the Tangut general Li Sigong the three prefectures of Xia (, Tangut: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Tangut/fonts.css\"/&gt;\ud821\udc82\ud81c\ude54), Sui (, Tangut: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Tangut/fonts.css\"/&gt;\ud81c\ude62\ud81c\ude54), and Yin (, Tangut: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Tangut/fonts.css\"/&gt;\ud821\udf70\ud81c\ude54) as hereditary titles under the Dingnan Jiedushi. After the collapse of Tang China, multiple warlords started to form new states in the former territories of Tang China. The Tanguts expanded their realm southwest towards their old homelands. In 1002 they conquered Ling Prefecture and set up their first capital there under the name of Xiping. By 1036 they had annexed the Guiyi Circuit and the Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom, even pushing into Tibetan territory and conquering Xining. The state of Western Xia was proclaimed in 1038.\nBeing subjects of Tang China previously for two centuries, the Tangut people adopted many Han/Tang Chinese culture, but also maintained their own customs, as is proven by the vast amount of literature which survived the Tangut state itself.\nThe Western Xia founder Li Deming's son, Li Yuanhao, enthroned as Emperor Jingzong, sought to differentiate the Tangut state from that of its rival Han-led Song China and started to nurture a national Tangut identity by ordering the creation of an official Tangut script and by instituting laws that reinforced traditional Tangut customs. One of the laws he mandated called for citizens to wear traditional ethnic apparel and another required men to wear their hair short or shaved as opposed to the Chinese custom of wearing hair long and knotted. Abandoning the royal Chinese surnames of \"Li\", previously bestowed by the Tang dynasty Li royal family, and \"Zhao\", subsequently bestowed by the Song dynasty Zhao royal family, he adopted a Tangut surname &lt;templatestyles src=\"Tangut/fonts.css\"/&gt;\ud81f\udf28\ud81c\udd9f, rendered in Chinese as \"Weiming\" (). He made Xingqing (, modern Yinchuan) his capital city.\nIn the thirteenth century, Genghis Khan unified the northern grasslands of Mongolia and led his troops in six rounds of attacks against the Western Xia over a period of twenty-two years (1205, 1207, 1209\u201310, 1211\u201313, 1214\u201319, 1225\u201327). During the last spate of the Mongol attacks, Genghis died in Western Xia territory. The official Mongol history attributes his death to illness, whereas legends claim that he died from a wound inflicted in these battles.\nIn 1227, the capital of Western Xia was overrun by the Mongols, who devastated its buildings and written records: all was burnt to the ground except its monastery. The last emperor was killed and tens of thousands of civilians massacred. However, many Tangut families joined the Mongol Empire. Some of them led Mongol armies, e.g. Cha'an, into the conquest of China. After the Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368) was established, the Tangut troops were incorporated into the Mongol army in their subsequent military conquests in central and southern China. The Tangut were considered Semu under the Yuan class system, thus separating them from the North Chinese. As late as the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), there was evidence of small Tangut communities in Anhui and Henan provinces. The people including members of the royal clan emigrated to western Sichuan, northern Tibet, even possibly northeast India, in some instances becoming local rulers. The Tangut people living in Central China preserved their language until at least the 16th century.\nCulture.\nTangut society was divided into two classes: the \"Red Faced\" and the \"Black Headed\". The Red Faced Tanguts were seen as commoners while the Black Headed Tanguts made up the elite priestly caste. Although Buddhism was extremely popular among the Tangut people, many Tangut herdsmen continued to practice a kind of shamanism known as Root West (Melie). The black caps worn by Root West shamans give the Black Headed caste its name. According to Tangut myth, the ancestor of the Black Headed Tanguts was a heavenly white crane, while the ancestor of the Red Faced Tanguts was a monkey. Tangut kings went by the title of Wuzu.\nAccording to sources in the Tangut language, the Tangut state known now as the Western Xia was named &lt;templatestyles src=\"Tangut/fonts.css\"/&gt;\ud81f\udd02\ud81f\ude6d\ud81c\udca7\ud821\udf36 translated as \"Great State of White and Lofty\" (\"ph\u00f4n\u00b9 mb\u0131n\u00b2 lhi\u032f\u0259 tha\u00b2\"). Although the Chinese translation of this name () was occasionally used in Tangut sources, the state was most commonly referred to as the \"Great Xia\" (\u5927\u590f) in Chinese-language sources of the Tangut or as the \"Xia State\" () to the Song. In later historiography and in modern Chinese the Tangut state is referred to as the \"Western Xia\" (\"X\u012b Xi\u00e0\" \u897f\u590f). The Mongols and other steppe tribes referred to the Tangut kingdom as \"Qashi\" or \"Qashin\", which was derived from the Middle Chinese name for Hexi, the region the Tanguts controlled ().\nReligion.\nThe Tanguts were primarily Buddhists. Tangut Buddhism was influenced by external elements. The entire Chinese Buddhist canon was translated into the Tangut language over a span of 50 years and published around 1090 in about 3700 fascicles. Buddhism in the Tangut state is believed to be an amalgamation of Tibetan and Chinese traditions, among which the Huayan-Chan tradition of Guifeng Zongmi (Chinese: \u572d\u5cf0\u5b97\u5bc6, 780\u2013841) and his master Huayan Chengguan was the most influential. A number of texts previously believed to be of native Tangut origin turned out to be translations of Khitan source texts. The degree of Tibetan impact on the formation of Tangut Buddhism still remains unexplored, especially in the light of new discoveries showing that Tangut Buddhism owed more to the local culture in North China than to pure Tibetan or Chinese influences. Texts belonging to the Tibetan Mahamudra tradition demonstrate that Tangut Buddhism initially evolved along the Karma Kagyu rather than Sakya lines of Buddhist transmission.\nA number of Tangut Buddhist institutions, such as \"Imperial Preceptor\" survived the Tangut State itself and could be found during the Yuan dynasty. One of the more definite sources of Tangut Buddhism was Mount Wutai, where both Huayan and Chinese Esoteric Buddhism flourished from the late Tang dynasty up to the time of the Mongol conquest.\nSolonin (2005: unpaginated) links the Tanguts, the Helan Mountains and the Chan teachings of both Kim Hwasang and Baotang Wuzhu:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The origins of the Tangut Chan can also be traced deeper than previously believed: information on Bao-tang Wu-zhu (\u4fdd\u5510\u65e0\u4f4f720\uff5e794) travels in North-Western China from the \"Notes on Transmitting the Dharma Treasure through Generations\" implies that at the period of 760's some sort of Buddhism was spread in the region of Helanshan, where the Tangut were already residing.\u3000Concerning the late 8th century Helanshan Buddhism, little can be said: the doctrines of the lu (\u5f8b) school and the teaching of Sichuan Chan of Rev. Kim (\u91d1\u548c\u5c1a) seem to be known there.\nWorship of Confucianism also existed in the Western Xia, which has led to some claims that the Tangut religion was rooted in Confucianism, but this was incomparable with the degree of popularity of Buddhism. Tangut literature is dominated by Buddhist scriptures while secular teachings including the Chinese classics were rarely available in the Tangut language.\nThe Tangut state enforced strict laws pertaining to the teaching of religious beliefs and rigorously screened potential teachers. Before he was allowed to teach, a newcomer entering the state from Tibet or India first had to seek the approval of local authorities. Doctrines taught and methods used were carefully supervised to ensure there was no possibility that the Tangut people might misunderstand the teachings. Anyone found to be a fortune-teller or charlatan faced immediate persecution. Deeming it contrary to Buddhist ethical beliefs, the Tangut state strictly forbade religious teachers from accepting compensation or reward for their teaching services.\nAlthough the state did not support an official school of Buddhism, it did protect all religious sites and objects within the country's boundaries.\nAs in China, becoming a Buddhist monk required government approval and anyone found to have taken the vows of a monk without such government oversight faced severe punishment. Remarkably for the time, women played a role in Tangut religious practices by serving as nuns, a position that could only be held by a woman who had been widowed or who was an unmarried virgin.\nSuchan (1998) traces the influence of the first several Karmapas upon the Yuan and Ming courts as well as the Western Xia, and mentions D\u00fcsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first several Karmapas are distinguished by their important status at the Yuan and Ming courts of China where they served as the spiritual guides to princes and emperors. Their influence also extended to the court of the Tangut Xia Kingdom where a disciple of Dusum Khyenpa was given the title \"Supreme Teacher\" by a Tangut Xixia King[.]\nAfter the fall of the Western Xia, the influx of refugees into Tibet led to the adoption of the Pehar deity into Tibetan Buddhism, eventually in the important role as the state oracle, the Nechung Oracle.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69217", "revid": "41160426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69217", "title": "Gouache", "text": "Type of paint\nGouache (; ), body color, or opaque watercolor is a water-medium paint consisting of natural pigment, water, a binding agent (usually gum arabic or dextrin), and sometimes additional inert material. Gouache is designed to be opaque. Gouache has a long history, having been used for at least twelve centuries. It is used most consistently by commercial artists for posters, illustrations, comics, and other design work.\nGouache is similar to watercolor in that it can be rewetted and dried to a matte finish, and the paint can become infused into its paper support. It is similar to acrylic or oil paints in that it is normally used in an opaque painting style and it can form a superficial layer. Many manufacturers of watercolor paints also produce gouache, and the two can easily be used together.\nDescription.\nGouache paint is similar to watercolor, but it is modified to make it opaque. Just as in watercolor, the binding agent has traditionally been gum arabic but since the late nineteenth century cheaper varieties use yellow dextrin. When the paint is sold as a paste, e.g. in tubes, the dextrin has usually been mixed with an equal volume of water. To improve the adhesive and hygroscopic qualities of the paint, as well as the flexibility of the rather brittle paint layer after drying, propylene glycol is often added. Gouache differs from watercolor in that the particles are typically larger, the ratio of pigment to binder is much higher, and an additional white filler such as chalk\u2014a \"body\"\u2014may be part of the paint. This makes gouache heavier and more opaque than watercolor, and endows it with greater reflective qualities.\nGouache generally dries to a value that differs from the one it has when wet (lighter tones generally dry darker and darker tones tend to dry lighter), which can make it difficult to match colors over multiple painting sessions. Its quick coverage and total hiding power mean that gouache lends itself to more direct painting techniques than watercolor. \"En plein air\" paintings take advantage of this, as do the works of J. M. W. Turner.\nGouache is today much used by commercial artists for works such as posters, illustrations, comics, and for other design work. Most 20th-century animations used it to create an opaque color on a cel with watercolor paint used for the backgrounds. Using gouache as \"poster paint\" is desirable for its speed as the paint layer dries completely by the relatively quick evaporation of the water.\nThe use of gouache is not restricted to the basic opaque painting techniques using a brush and watercolor paper. It is often applied with an airbrush. As with all types of paint, gouache has been used on unusual surfaces from Braille paper to cardboard. A variation of traditional application is the method used in the \"gouaches d\u00e9coup\u00e9es\" (cut collages) created by Henri Matisse. His \"Blue Nudes\" series is a good example of the technique. A new variation in the formula of the paint is \"acrylic gouache\".\nHistory.\nA form of gouache, with honey or tragacanth gum as a binder, was used in Ancient Egyptian painting. It was also used in European illuminated manuscripts, as well as Persian miniatures. Although they are often described as \"watercolor\", Persian miniatures and Mughal miniatures are predominantly examples of gouache. The term gouache, derived from the Italian \"guazzo\", also refers to paintings using this opaque method. \"Guazzo\", Italian for \"mud\", was originally a term applied to the early 16th-century practice of applying oil paint over a tempera base, which could give a matted effect. In the 18th century in France, the term \"gouache\" was applied to opaque watermedia.\nDuring the eighteenth century gouache was often used in a mixed technique, for adding fine details in pastel paintings. Gouache was typically made by mixing watercolours based on gum arabic with an opaque white pigment. In the nineteenth century, watercolours began to be industrially produced in tubes and a \"Chinese white\" tube was added to boxes for this purpose. Gouache tends to be used in conjunction with watercolor, and often ink or pencil, in 19th-century paintings.\nLater that century, for decorative uses \"poster paint\" (as it is known in the U.S.), was mass-produced, based on the much cheaper dextrin binder. It was sold in cans or as a powder to be mixed with water. The dextrin replaced older paint types based on hide glue or size. During the twentieth century, gouache began to be specially manufactured in tubes for more refined artistic purposes. Initially, gum arabic was used as a binder but soon cheaper brands were based on dextrin, as is most paint for children.\nAcrylic gouache.\nA relatively new variation in the formula of the paint is \"acrylic gouache\". Its highly concentrated pigment is similar to traditional gouache, but it is mixed with an acrylic-based binder, unlike traditional gouache, which is mixed with gum arabic. It is water-soluble when wet and dries to a matte, opaque, and water-resistant surface when dry. Acrylic gouache differs from acrylic paint because it contains additives to ensure the matte finish.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The team competes in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system.\nFounded in 1884 as Belmont Football Club, they adopted their current name in 1885. Tranmere's regular kit is an all-white strip with blue, or occasionally blue and green trim which have been their main colours since 1962. The club moved to its current home, Prenton Park, in 1912. In 1995, the ground had a major redevelopment in response to the Taylor Report. It now seats 16,567 in four stands: the Main Stand, the Kop, the Johnny King Stand and the Cowshed.\nTranmere played in regional leagues until they were invited to become a founder member of Football League Third Division North in 1921. They finished as champions for the 1937\u201338 season, though were relegated out of the Second Division the following year. They dropped into the Fourth Division in 1961, before winning promotion back to the third tier at the end of the 1966\u201367 season. Relegation in 1975 was followed by an immediate promotion in 1975\u201376 under the stewardship of manager John King, and this time they survived for just three seasons in the third tier until being relegated once again in 1979. During the 1980s, they were beset by financial problems and, in 1987, went into administration. However John King returned to manage the club for a second spell and guided Rovers to promotion in 1988\u201389, which they followed up by winning the Associate Members' Cup in 1990 and then promotion out of the play-offs in 1991.\nThe 1990s would prove to be the most successful period in the club's history as Tranmere remained in the second tier, and came close to reaching the Premier League with three consecutive play-off campaigns at the start of the decade. Under King's successor, John Aldridge, Tranmere experienced a number of cup runs, most notably reaching the 2000 League Cup final. They were finally relegated in 2001 and then spent 13 seasons in the third tier, before back-to-back relegations saw them drop out of the Football League after an 94-year stay. Tranmere spent three seasons in the National League and then returned to the third tier of the Football League via successive play-off campaigns in 2018 and 2019. They were demoted from League One in 2020 after clubs voted to end the season early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHistory.\nFormative years.\n \n 1889\u20131904 kit\nTranmere Rovers were, initially, formed as Belmont Football Club when the football arms of two cricket clubs\u00a0\u2013 Lyndhurst Wanderers and Belmont\u00a0\u2013 came together in 1884. On 15 November 1884, they won their first game 4\u20130 against Brunswick Rovers. This was a friendly match, as there were no leagues until 1888. With James McGaul as their president, the team completed their inaugural season, losing only one of their fifteen matches. An unrelated, disbanded side had played under the name \"Tranmere Rovers Cricket Club (Association football section)\" in 1881\u201382. On 16 September 1885, before their second season began, Belmont F.C. adopted this name Tranmere Rovers. Tranmere was historically a large township that was subsumed within the later expansion of the town of Birkenhead.\nTranmere played their first matches at Steeles Field in Birkenhead. In 1887, they bought Ravenshaws Field from Tranmere Rugby Club. In 1895, their ground was renamed Prenton Park, although it was 25 years later that the team moved into the current stadium of the same name. Tranmere first wore a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks. In 1889 they adopted orange and maroon shirts, but in 1904 returned to wearing their original kit.\nIn 1886, Tranmere entered their first competition: the Liverpool and District Challenge Cup; in 1889, they entered the West Lancashire League. They joined the Combination, a much stronger league, in 1897, and won the championship in 1908. In 1910, continuing their movement through the leagues, they entered the Lancashire Combination and in 1912 moved to the present Prenton Park site, with an 800-seat stand. Tranmere won the Lancashire Combination Championship in 1914, and Stan Rowlands became the first Tranmere player to receive an international cap when he was selected to play for Wales.\nRovers continued to play throughout the First World War, although their players were criticised for avoiding military service, despite being employed in the local shipyards.\nInter-war years.\n 1921\u201337 kit\nFollowing the expulsion of Leeds City Reserves in 1919, Tranmere were able to enter the Central League. Their timing was excellent as the following season, four Central League clubs\u00a0\u2013 including Tranmere\u00a0\u2013 were invited to join the new Division Three North. On 27 August 1921, they won their first Football League match 4\u20131 against Crewe Alexandra at Prenton Park. At this time the team were managed by Bert Cooke, who did so for 23 years in total, the club record for longest serving manager.\nIn 1924, local boy Dixie Dean made his debut aged 16 years 355 days. He played 30 games for Rovers, scoring 27 goals, before being transferred to Everton for \u00a33,000. In the 1927\u201328 season, Dean scored a record 60 League goals for Everton. After Dean's departure, several talented young players also left for Division One clubs, leading to Cooke's reputation as a shrewd businessman. Among those sold was Pongo Waring who\u00a0\u2013 having scored six goals in the 11\u20131 victory over Durham City\u00a0\u2013 went to Aston Villa for \u00a34,700. As of 2010, Waring retains the record of scoring most goals for Villa in a single season.\nIn 1934, an FA Cup tie between Rovers and Liverpool was watched at Anfield by 61,036 fans, a then-record crowd for Tranmere. A year later, Bunny Bell netted 40 goals during the 1935\u201336 season, including nine goals in the 13\u20134 Boxing Day 1935 victory over Oldham Athletic. As of 2011, the aggregate of 17 goals in one game remained a league record.\nDuring this same period, Tranmere made several appearances in the Welsh Cup, reaching the final on two occasions. In 1934, they lost 3\u20130 to Bristol City in a replay, after a 1\u20131 draw. The following season, they went one better by beating local rivals Chester 1\u20130.\nRovers won their first championship in the Football League in 1938, with victory in Division Three North, earning promotion to Division Two for the first time. As of 2025, this remains Rovers's only championship in the Football League. However, they were relegated the next season, winning only six matches\u00a0\u2013 the record for the worst performance of any team in Division Two.\nCreation of the Superwhites.\n \n 1962\u201363 kit\nWhile the Borough Road stand received some damage, Prenton Park emerged from the Second World War largely unscathed. Tranmere rejoined the peacetime Football League in Division Three North, and stayed there until the 1958 restructuring of the football league's lower divisions. Manager Peter Farrell led Tranmere to finish 11th in the final season of the Northern Section, securing a place in the new national Division Three, where they were, again, founder members. The final match against Wrexham, also fighting for a place in the higher league, attracted a crowd of 19,615, which, as of 2010, remained the highest ever attendance at a Prenton Park league match.\nIn 1961, Tranmere's inspirational captain Harold Bell left the club. Bell had been picked in the first game after the Second World War in the 1946 season, and did not miss a match until he was dropped on 30 August 1955, a total of 459 consecutive appearances for a British team, a record he still holds. Rovers certainly missed their captain, and were relegated to Division Four for the first time in 1961.\nThe club brought in Dave Russell as manager, and Russell made some changes. Tranmere had worn a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks since 1904\u00a0\u2013 the same colours as local rivals, Division One club Everton. Russell introduced an all-white strip to set the teams apart, and white has remained the primary colour on Tranmere's shirts ever since. Russell also developed a successful youth policy, with future England international Roy McFarland among its graduates. Russell guided Rovers back to Division Three in 1967, a year before a new 4,000-seater main stand was opened, and Rovers reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time. Three years later the club's record attendance at Prenton Park was established, with 24,424 supporters watching the Rovers draw 2\u20132 with Stoke City in the FA Cup.\nIn 1972, Ron Yeats was installed as player-manager. He strengthened Tranmere's connections with local rivals Liverpool by recruiting several former teammates such as Ian St John, and bringing in Bill Shankly in a consultancy role. This team saw one of the most memorable Rovers results of all time when, in a League Cup tie in 1973, Tranmere beat First Division Arsenal 1\u20130 at their former Highbury home. However, Tranmere returned to the Fourth Division in 1975. The following decade was among the bleakest times in the club's history, with the team usually in the lower reaches of the Fourth Division, beset by financial problems, and attaining crowds of less than 2,000.\nIn 1979, Steve Mungall joined Tranmere from Motherwell. He went on to make more than 600 appearances for Rovers over a 17-year period. This spell saw Rovers rise up the league and make several appearances at Wembley. He remained with the club, on the coaching staff, until October 2000, when he left to pursue business interests.\n \n 1981\u201382 kit\nAnother relegation to Division Four in 1979 put the club in financial difficulties. Debts mounted throughout the 1980s, with insolvency forestalled through a series of friendly fixtures, contributions from fans and a \u00a3200,000 loan from Wirral Council. The partnership with Wirral Council proved an enduring one, with their logo appearing on the shirts until 2013. In July 1984, the club was sold to a Californian attorney, making Tranmere one of the first English clubs to be bought by a foreign owner. However, in 1987, the club become the first English football team to enter administration.\nJohnny King era.\nLocal businessman Peter Johnson took over the club. This proved to be a turning point in Tranmere's history, the club under his ownership experiencing by far the most successful period in its history, in which manager John King took the team from the bottom of Division Four to the brink of English football's top league. King's first task was to avoid the team finishing bottom of Division Four, which would have resulted in their relegation from the football league. Safety was guaranteed in the last game of the season, with a 1\u20130 home win over Exeter City on the last day of the season.\nThe first full season (1987\u201388) of King's second managerial spell in charge saw Tranmere make their first appearance at Wembley Stadium, when a good mid-season run of form saw them qualify for the Football League Centenary Tournament. Tranmere defeated Division One clubs Wimbledon and Newcastle United, before losing on penalties to eventual winner Nottingham Forest. The following season, King guided Tranmere to promotion as Division Four runner-up. Their final game played to secure promotion was against Crewe Alexandra, with both teams needing a point to gain promotion. The first half was contested as usual, but, in the second half, with the score at 1\u20131, neither team targeted the goal of the other, leading to combined celebrations when the game had concluded. Earlier that season, they had won several games in the League Cup, including against Division One Middlesbrough, in between wins against fellow Division Four club Stockport County and Division 3 club Blackpool, ultimately losing to Bristol City of Division 3.\nAt the end their first season in Division Three, Tranmere almost secured promotion to Division 2, losing 2\u20130 in the play-off final to Notts County, a week after a 2\u20131 victory over Bristol Rovers at Wembley Stadium in the final of the Leyland DAF Trophy had secured the club's first major trophy. The form of striker Ian Muir was key to Tranmere's success during this period. He joined the club in 1985, and scored 180 goals in eleven seasons. He became the club's record scorer, and, in 2012, the first inductee to their hall of fame. Fellow hall of fame member John Morrissey joined the club in 1985. The winger spent 14 seasons at the club, making 585 appearances.\n \n 1999\u20132000 kit\nIn the 1990\u201391 season, Tranmere won promotion to Division Two for the first time since the 1930s, with a 1\u20130 play-off win over local rivals Bolton Wanderers. Once again, Rovers made an appearance in the Leyland DAF Trophy final, this time losing 3\u20132 to Birmingham City. This made the play-off victory over Bolton Wanderers Tranmere's fourth appearance in a Wembley Stadium final in just over a year.\nIn summer 1991, former Liverpool player John Aldridge joined Tranmere Rovers, signing from Spanish club Real Sociedad for a fee of \u00a3250,000; he would remain on the club's payroll for the next 10 years, scoring 170 times to put him behind only Ian Muir in the all-time scoring charts. Aldridge also received 30 caps for the Republic of Ireland, and was the first Tranmere player to score at a World Cup. In 1992, Scotland international Pat Nevin joined the team, forming a four-man attack alongside Aldridge, Chris Malkin and Morrissey. In three successive seasons, Tranmere reached the play-off semi-finals, missing out on promotion to the newly formed Premier League through defeat to Swindon Town in 1993, Leicester City in 1994, and Reading in 1995. 1994 also saw Tranmere progress to the League Cup semi-final, where they faced Aston Villa over two legs. The home leg was won 3\u20131 by Tranmere, with Villa scoring their only goal in the 94th minute. The score in the away leg was 2\u20131 in favour of Villa until the 88th minute when Villa scored again to win the game 3\u20131, so the match went to extra-time and penalties. With Tranmere one kick away from the final, Mark Bosnich saved Liam O'Brien's sudden death penalty, and Tranmere eventually lost 5\u20134.\nA reconstructed Prenton Park was opened in March 1995, with the all-seater stadium then holding just under 17,000 supporters. In April 1996, with Rovers struggling for form in the league, chairman Frank Corfe appointed John Aldridge as player-manager, and King was \"moved upstairs\" to become Director of football. They finished the 1995\u201396 campaign in 13th position.\n2000 and beyond.\n \n 2011\u20132012 kit\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, victories over Premiership sides including West Ham United and Sunderland, and First Division club Fulham led, not only to a place in the sixth round of the FA Cup, but also a place in the 2000 Football League Cup final against Leicester City\u00a0\u2013 the first time in the club's history that Rovers had reached the final of one of England's two most important trophies. Matt Elliott scored Leicester's opening goal, before Tranmere's Clint Hill was sent off for a second bookable offence. Despite being reduced to ten men, David Kelly equalised; however, Elliot scored Leicester's second goal three minutes later, and Tranmere lost the match 2\u20131. This was the last League Cup game held at the original Wembley stadium.\nIn 2000, Tranmere Rovers had another cup competition run, beating local Premier League rival Everton 3\u20130 at Goodison Park, then Southampton 4\u20133 (after being 0\u20133 down), before exiting after a loss to another local rival, Premier League club Liverpool. However, despite their cup success, Rovers struggled in the league. Aldridge quit as manager before Tranmere's relegation to Division Two, which ended a spell of ten years in Division One.\nThe club hired Brian Little as manager in 2003. He took Rovers to a play-off semi-final in 2004\u201305, and equaled their greatest ever FA Cup performance, losing to eventual finalists Millwall in a sixth round replay. At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, Little left the club and was replaced by former player Ronnie Moore. In Moore's three seasons in charge, the club finished 9th, 11th and 7th, narrowly missing out on qualification for in the play-offs in his final season. Moore was sacked in 2009, with former England winger John Barnes, whose only previous domestic managerial experience was with Celtic 10 years earlier, replacing him. It was during Barnes's time as manager that long-serving kitman, Mark Trevor, ended his 12-year \"Labour of Love\", washing the kit of his local team. Having been at the club since 1997, he washed his last kit in August 2009, ahead of the club's home game against Charlton Athletic. Barnes's term as manager lasted considerably less time, and it was a five months before long-serving club physiotherapist Les Parry was given temporary charge. Rovers finished the season in 19th place in League One, avoiding relegation on the final day of the season, thanks to a 3\u20130 victory at Stockport County. In June 2010, Parry was given the manager's job on a permanent basis. He was sacked on 4 March 2012, after a 1\u20130 defeat by Chesterfield left the club only one point above the relegation zone, and replaced by Ronnie Moore for the remainder of the season. Moore won six of his thirteen games in charge at the end of the season, guiding Tranmere to a mid-table position, as they finished the season in the top half for the first time since his initial departure. In April 2012, Moore signed a new one-year deal with Tranmere, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2012\u201313 season.\nTowards the end of the 2013\u201314 season, Moore admitted breaking the Football Association's betting rules, and Tranmere sacked him when the club were just clear of the relegation zone. Assistant John McMahon took over as caretaker manager, but Tranmere were relegated to League Two in the final game of the season on the final day of the season. Rob Edwards was subsequently appointed as new manager.\nOn 11 August 2014, it was announced that former player and Football Association chief executive Mark Palios and his wife Nicola were taking a controlling interest in the club from outgoing chairman Peter Johnson. Mark Palios would become executive chairman of the club, with Johnson becoming its honorary president.\nAfter a poor start to the season, a home loss to Plymouth Argyle on 11 October 2014 saw Tranmere in last place in the Football League. Edwards was sacked as manager on 13 October. Mickey Adams took over a week later, with the aim of saving the club from relegation to the Conference. However, on 25 April 2015, after another defeat to Plymouth Argyle in the reverse fixture, Tranmere were relegated, ending their 94-year stay in the Football League.\nNon-League years.\nGary Brabin was appointed as manager on 5 May 2015. It was a season of ups and downs, with poorer home form than away form. It took a while for Rovers to adjust to life in the non-league, with erratic form during the season. Tranmere finished sixth, one place outside the play-off zone, in Gary Brabin's first season.\nTranmere started the 2016\u201317 season well, sitting at the top of the non-league table at the end of August, after which Brabin received an award for manager of the month. Form later dipped, with the club scoring only one goal scored in the next four games. Following a 1\u20130 defeat to Sutton United, Brabin left his role as manager on 18 September 2016. Assistant manager, ex-Southport boss Paul Carden took over on an interim basis. On 6 October 2016, former Tranmere player Micky Mellon was appointed permanent manager. His first game in charge was against cross-border rivals Wrexham, and ended with a 2\u20130 victory for Tranmere. Despite a 2nd-place finish and a 95-point haul, this still was not enough to gain automatic promotion back to the league. Tranmere faced Aldershot Town in the play-offs. A goal from James Norwood and a brace from Cole Stockton in the first leg away at the Recreation Ground saw Rovers take a 3\u20130 lead back to Prenton Park for the second leg, which ended in a 2\u20132 draw, Norwood and Stockton once again on the scoresheet. This gave Tranmere a 5\u20132 aggregate win and their first Wembley appearance in 17 years. However, they were beaten 3\u20131 in the 2017 National League play-off final by Forest Green Rovers.\nTranmere's 2017\u201318 season got off to a poor start, with 3 wins from the first 12 games. Tranmere slipped to 18th in the table, their lowest ever league position. A spectacular winter turnaround saw Tranmere move into the play-off spots, where they remained for the rest of the season. This turnaround included a record-breaking run of 9 consecutive home league wins, which was ended in February with a 4\u20131 defeat to eventual title winner Macclesfield Town. Tranmere responded to this defeat by winning 8 out of their next 9 games, finishing the season as National League runners-up for the second time in as many years, qualifying for the play-offs. In the play-off semi-final, Tranmere met Ebbsfleet United at home. Tranmere came from behind twice to take the game to extra time before prevailing 4\u20132 after extra time, a result which sent Tranmere to Wembley Stadium for the National League play-off final. On 12 May 2018, a crowd of 16,306 were at Wembley for the final against Boreham Wood. Tranmere were 2\u20131 victors, their first trophy in 27 years, and were promoted back to the Football League.\nReturn to the Football League.\nUnder the chairmanship of Mark Palios and the management of Micky Mellon, Tranmere played in League Two for the 2018\u201319 season, finishing 6th and thereby reaching the play-offs. On 25 May 2019, Tranmere secured back-to-back promotions, beating Newport County 1\u20130 at Wembley Stadium. They did so with a goal from Connor Jennings in the 119th minute, thus securing their spot in League One for the 2019\u201320 season.\nBy March 2020, the team were within the relegation zone, but with a game in hand on their nearest rivals and on a run of three successive victories. The cancellation of fixtures due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the season could not be completed, and a vote was taken by League One clubs on 9 June to resolve promotion and relegation issues on a points per game (PPG) basis. This meant that Tranmere would be demoted to League Two for the 2020\u201321 season. Club chairman Mark Palios said that the decision was unfair and that he was considering legal action as a result. He also announced that 20 members of staff would have to be made redundant.\nWith the team back in League Two, Mike Jackson was named as manager of Tranmere on 18 July 2020. He was sacked on 31 October 2020. Keith Hill succeeded temporary manager Ian Dawes on 21 November 2020. He was sacked on 11 May 2021, after the side reached the play-offs, but before the play-off matches had started. Morecambe defeated Tranmere in the play-off semi-final. At the end of May 2021, Tranmere announced that Micky Mellon was returning to the club as manager, having spent the season apart in charge of Dundee United. Despite a strong start to the season, Tranmere sacked Mellon on 19 March 2023, following results that included a total of six wins since mid-October 2022. Dawes oversaw seven games as caretaker manager before being appointed the permanent manager, but Tranmere sacked him in early September 2023 after six consecutive defeats; Tranmere appointed their technical director Nigel Adkins as interim manager. Adkins was appointed permanent manager on 2 November 2023, signing a contract until the end of 2025\u201326 season. On 26 February 2025, Adkins left Tranmere by mutual agreement following a ten-game winless run in the league which culminated in a home defeat to Accrington Stanley which left Tranmere two points above the relegation zone. He was replaced by assistant manager Andy Crosby until the end of the season.\nColours and crest.\nBelmont F.C., the forerunners of today's Rovers, wore blue shirts and white shorts, as did the early Rovers, until a radical change in 1889, when a combination of maroon and orange shirts and navy blue shorts was introduced to \"dazzle\" their opponents in the West Lancashire League. These were abandoned in 1904 in favour of the earlier blue and white colours which have, in some form or other, remained until the present day. In 1962, Dave Russell introduced a white strip with blue trim, saying \"Tranmere Rovers should have a specific identity of its own, so on Merseyside there's now Liverpool's red, Everton's blue and Tranmere's white\". Since then, the team have worn varying combinations of blue and white, moving back towards a more predominantly white kit in 2000. The team's colours are reflected in their nickname of the \"Superwhites\".\nTranmere first introduced a badge on their shirt in 1962, wearing the coat of arms of the borough of Birkenhead, along with adopting their motto \"Ubi fides ibi lux et robur\", meaning \"Where there is faith there is light and strength\". The crest was replaced in 1972 by a monogram, and, in 1981, by a simplified blue and white shield. In 1987, a complex heraldic crest was introduced, adapting the Birkenhead crest through the inclusion of a football and a TRFC logo. The simpler badge was adopted in 1997, and modified slightly in 2009 to mark the club's 125-year anniversary. The blue and white crest incorporated simplified elements of the Birkenhead civic coat of arms: the crosier and lion originally formed part of the Birkenhead Priory seal; the oak tree was a symbol of the Tranmere Local Board; the star or starfish represents Bebington; the two lions represent Oxton; and the crescents may represent the Laird family.\nFor the 2021\u201322 season, Tranmere reverted to their pre-1997 badge.\nStadium.\nRovers played their first matches at Steeles Field in Birkenhead but, in 1887, they bought a new site from Tranmere Rugby Club. The ground was variously referred to as the \"Borough Road Enclosure\", \"Ravenshaw's Field\" and \"South Road\". The name \"Prenton Park\" was adopted in 1895 as a result of a suggestion in the letters page of the Football Echo. Because the land was required for housing and a school, Tranmere were forced to move and the name went with them. The present Prenton Park was opened on 9 March 1912. There were stands (also known as bleachers) on both sides of the pitch, a paddock and three open terraces, the general format which remained until 1994.\nMany improvements to the ground were driven by changes in legislation. The biggest change of all took place during 1994 and 1995. The Taylor Report suggested that all stadia in the top two divisions of English football should no longer permit standing. The club's response was to redevelop three sides of the ground with entirely new all-seater stands created\u00a0\u2013 the Borough Road Stand (now the Johnny King Stand), the Cowshed and the new Kop, with the existing Main Stand remaining. Capacity in the ground thus increased from 14,200 to the 16,567 of today. On 11 March 1995, having been built at a cost of \u00a33.1 million, the new ground was officially opened.\nAttendances at the ground have fluctuated over its hundred-year history. Around 8,000 visitors watched the first game at the stadium, as Tranmere beat Lancaster Town 8\u20130. Prenton Park's largest-ever crowd was 24,424 for a 1972 FA Cup match between Tranmere and Stoke City. Average attendances since the renovation range from just above 5000 in the early 2010s and the Non-League years, to the upper 8000s in the 90s, during the First Division years. In the 2020s, attendances have remained mostly in the low to mid 6000s.\nSupporters and rivalries.\nTranmere Rovers had an average home attendance of 6,398 during the 2024\u201325 season, making them the 10th best supported club in League Two. The club has a number of supporters' groups, including the Tranmere Rovers Supporters Trust and the Tranmere Rovers Official Supporters Club. In 2010, the trust raised \u00a312,500 for the club to sign Andy Robinson on loan. Tranmere Rovers have been the subject of an independent supporters' fanzine \"Give Us an R\" since the 1990s.\nDespite being geographically closest to Everton and Liverpool, Tranmere's time in the lower leagues has meant that they have rarely met either club and have built up traditional rivalries with near neighbours Wrexham and Chester. According to a survey entitled 'The League of Love and Hate' conducted in August 2019, Tranmere fans listed the more distant Bolton Wanderers and Oldham Athletic as their biggest rivals, followed by Everton, Liverpool and Crewe Alexandra, although the census did not contain non-league clubs (Chester and, and that time, Wrexham). Tranmere also had a fierce rivalry with Wallasey-based near neighbour New Brighton, until that club failed to be re-elected to the Football League in 1951.\nAs of the end of the 2022\u201323 season, Tranmere had met the following teams most times in the Football League:\nTranmere Rovers Ladies.\nTranmere Rovers Ladies Football Club were founded in 1990. Based on the Wirral, they are affiliated with the men's team and play most of their home games at Ellesmere Port Sports Village. Between 1996 and 2004 they competed in the FA Premier League National Division, then the top tier of the English women's football pyramid. As of 2025, they play in the North West Regional League, Premier Division.\n \"As of 11 October 2025\"\nPlayers.\nFirst-team squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFormer players.\nAs part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations in 2010, a hall of fame was announced, initially honouring seven former players and managers: Ian Muir, John Aldridge, John King, Ray Mathias, Steve Mungall, John Morrissey, and Pat Nevin. Harold Bell holds the record for the most consecutive league appearances for a British team. He was picked for the first game after the Second World War in the 1946\u201347 season and did not miss a match until 30 August 1955, a total of 401 consecutive matches in the Third Division North.\n \"As of 26 February 2025\"\nOfficials.\nManagers.\nBy the start of the 2024\u201325 season, the club had employed 40 managers. The first man to hold this position was Bert Cooke, appointed in 1912. He oversaw the club's entry into the Football League, and remained in charge for 23 years, the longest spell of any manager at the club. Major changes were not seen until businessman Dave Russell took over in 1961. His introductions included the team's current all-white kit and regularly arranged floodlit home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. Rock band and Tranmere fans Half Man Half Biscuit described the practice in their song \"Friday Night And The Gates Are Low\".\nTranmere's most successful period came at the end of the twentieth century. John King returned for his third spell at the club in 1987, having previously both played for and managed the team. He led them to a victory in the League Trophy, and from the bottom of the Fourth Division to, on three occasions, reach the semi-finals in play-offs that had as their prize a promotion to the Premier League. Under King's replacement, John Aldridge, Tranmere appeared in the 2000 Football League Cup final. From 2009, they were managed by former club physiotherapist, Les Parry, until he was sacked on 4 March 2012, and replaced by Ronnie Moore. In February 2014, media reports suggested Moore was under investigation by The Football Association, for breaching its rules against betting on competitions in which his club were involved. Three days later, Tranmere suspended Moore, and then sacked him on 9 April 2014, after he conceded that the FA's charges were valid.\nOn 27 May 2014, the club announced that Rob Edwards had been appointed as their new manager. Tranmere sacked Edwards on 13 October 2014. Moving quickly to arrest the decline which had seen Tranmere slump to the bottom of League Two, Tranmere announced former Port Vale manager Micky Adams's appointment as Edwards's successor on 16 October 2014. He left the club by mutual consent on 19 April 2015, when the club were bottom of the league with two matches remaining. Gary Brabin, whose contract was in turn ended in September 2016, replaced Adams. Tranmere appointed Micky Mellon as manager the following month, and he led the team to a pair of consecutive play-off final victories in the 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319 seasons, the last of which brought a return to League One for the club. After four years at Tranmere, Mellon moved to Dundee United on 6 July 2020.\nOn 18 July 2020, Mellon's former assistant manager Mike Jackson was appointed as manager, however his tenure was short-lived. After only two league wins in his first 10 games Jackson was sacked on 31 October 2020 following a 1\u20130 home defeat to Morecambe. Keith Hill replaced Jackson as first team manager on 21 November. Hill's first game ended in a 1\u20130 victory against Carlisle United. His side were top of the form table (after 20 games) in February, the team's spine spearheaded by Scott Davies, Peter Clarke, Manny Month\u00e9, Jay Spearing, Paul Lewis and James Vaughan.

It contains trees, shrubs and woody vines, including poison ivy, poison oak, and the lacquer tree. The best-known members of the genus in North America are eastern poison ivy (\"T.\u00a0radicans\") and western poison oak (\"T.\u00a0diversilobum\"), both ubiquitous throughout much of their respective region.\nAll members of the genus produce the skin-irritating oil urushiol, which can cause a severe allergic reaction known as urushiol-induced contact dermatitis. The resins of certain species native to Japan, China and other Asian countries, such as lacquer tree (\"T.\u00a0vernicifluum\") and wax tree (\"T.\u00a0succedaneum\"), are used to make lacquer, and, as a byproduct of lacquer manufacture, their berries are used to make japan wax.\nDescription.\nPlants in the genus have pinnately compound, alternate leaves and whitish or grayish drupes. They are quite variable in appearance. The leaves may have smooth, toothed, or lobed edges, and all three types of leaf edges may be present in a single plant. The plants grow as creeping vines, climbing vines, shrubs, or, in the case of lacquer tree (\"T.\u00a0vernicifluum\") and poison sumac (\"T.\u00a0vernix\"), as trees. While leaves of poison ivy and poison oaks usually have three leaflets, sometimes there are five or, occasionally, even seven leaflets. Leaves of poison sumac have 7\u201313 leaflets, and of Lacquer Tree, 7\u201319 leaflets.\nTaxonomy.\nIt was published by Philip Miller in 1754. The lectotype species is \"Toxicodendron pubescens\" Mill. The genus is a member of the \"Rhus\" complex, and has at various times been categorized as being either its own genus or a sub-genus of \"Rhus.\" There is evidence which points to keeping \"Toxicodendron\" as a separate monophyletic genus, but researchers have stated that the \"Toxicodendron\" and \"Rhus\" groups are complex and require more study to be fully understood.\nThe common names come from similar appearances to other species that are not closely related and to the allergic response to the urushiol. Poison oak is not an oak (\"Quercus\", family Fagaceae), but this common name comes from the leaves' resemblance to white oak (\"Quercus alba\") leaves, while poison ivy is not an ivy (\"Hedera\", family Araliaceae), but has a superficially similar growth form. Technically, the plants do not contain a poison; they contain a potent allergen.\nSpecies.\n29 species are accepted (as of November 2024).\nEtymology.\nThe genus name is derived from Ancient Greek \u03c4\u03bf\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (\"toxik\u00f3s\"), meaning \"poison\", and \u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (\"d\u00e9ndron\"), meaning \"tree\".\nToxicity.\nAll members of the genus produce the skin-irritating oil urushiol, which can cause a severe allergic reaction known as urushiol-induced contact dermatitis. \nUses.\nIn East Asia, in particular in Japan, traditional candle fuel was produced from \"Toxicodendron vernicifluum\" and \"Toxicodendron succedaneum\", among other sumac plants in the genus \"Toxicodendron\", rather than beeswax or animal fats. The sumac wax was a byproduct of traditional Japanese lacquer manufacture. The conical rousoku candles produced from sumac wax burn with smokeless flame and were favored in many respects over candles made from lard or beeswax during the Tokugawa shogunate. Japan wax is not a true wax but a solid fat that contains 10-15% palmitin, stearin, and olein with about 1% japanic acid (1,21-heneicosanedioic acid). It is still used in many tropical and subtropical countries in the production of wax match sticks.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After being defeated by the forces of the Israelite tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali under the command of Barak and Deborah, Sisera was killed by Jael, who hammered a tent peg into his temple while he slept.\nThe etymology of Sisera's name is unclear. Sisera's name has been variously identified as Philistine, Hittite, Hurrian, or Egyptian (Ses-Ra, \"servant of Ra\"). The Israeli scholar and archaeologist Adam Zertal identifies Sisera with the Sea People called Sherden, arguing that Sisera came from the island of Sardinia.\nBiblical account.\nAccording to the biblical book of Judges, Jabin, King of Hazor, oppressed the Israelites for twenty years. His general was Sisera, who commanded nine hundred iron chariots from Harosheth Haggoyim, a fortified cavalry base. After the prophetess Deborah persuaded Barak to face Sisera in battle, they, with an Israelite force of ten thousand, defeated him at the Battle of Mount Tabor at Jezreel Valley. Judges 5:20 says that \"the stars in their courses fought against Sisera\", and the following verse implies that the army was swept away by the Kishon River. Following the battle, there was peace for forty years.\nAfter the battle, Sisera fled on foot until he came to the campsite of Heber the Kenite in the plain of Zaanaim, where he was received by Jael, Heber's wife. Jael brought him into her tent with apparent hospitality and gave him milk. Jael promised to hide Sisera and covered him with a rug, but after he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg through his temple with a mallet, her blow being so forceful that the peg pinned his head to the ground.\nLater, during his farewell address, the prophet Samuel referred to the Israelites' subjection to Sisera as a consequence of their \"forgetting the LORD their God\".\nArchaeological information.\nThe etymology of Sisera's name is unclear. Sisera's name has been variously identified as Philistine, Hittite, Hurrian, or Egyptian (Ses-Ra, \"servant of Ra\"). The Israeli scholar and archaeologist Adam Zertal identifies Sisera with the Sea People called Sherden, arguing that Sisera came from the island of Sardinia.\nZertal and Oren Cohen proposed that the excavation at Ahwat between Harish and the Wadi Ara is the site of Harosheth Haggoyim, Sisera's military base. However, consensus has not been reached regarding the site of Harosheth Haggoyim. Niditch suggests that its association with the term \"haroset\" might indicate its placement at any number of wooded places.\nSisera in later Jewish tradition.\nThe Jewish Encyclopedia reports that possibly his father was Shamgar. According to Jewish legend, because Sisera's mother cried a hundred cries when he did not return home, a hundred blasts are blown on the shofar on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. The Talmud states that the descendants of Sisera studied Torah in Jerusalem and even taught children there. A direct descendant of Sisera was Rabbi Akiva.\nAccording to the Talmud, Jael engaged in sexual intercourse with Sisera seven times, but because she was attempting to exhaust him in order to kill him, her sin was for Heaven's sake and therefore praiseworthy. The significance of that exact number of coituses and the meaning of the multicoital nature of Jael and Sisera's encounter has been discussed in the scholarship, along with an alternate view in rabbinic literature that asserts to the contrary that Jael never engaged in sex with Sisera.\nAlso according to the Midrash, Sisera had previously conquered every country against which he had fought. His voice was so strong that, when he called loudly, the most solid wall would shake and the wildest animal would fall dead. Deborah was the only one who could withstand his voice and not be stirred from her place. Sisera caught enough fish in his beard when bathing in the Kishon to provision his whole army, and thirty-one kings followed Sisera merely for the opportunity of drinking, or otherwise using, the waters of Israel.\nSisera in artistic works.\nSisera's murder by Jael was frequently depicted in historical European art. Lucas van Leyden, a Dutch engraver and painter during the Renaissance period, created a woodcut of the scene.\nPietro Alessandro Guglielmi (1728\u20131804) wrote an oratorio, \"Debora e Sisera\", for the Lenten season of 1788 at the Teatro di San Carlo, Naples, which was said to have been \"almost universally regarded as one of the most sublime works of the late 18th century.\"\nGerman composer Simon Mayr wrote an oratorio (1793) on the story of Sisera for the church of San Lazzaro dei Mendicanti in Venice.\nIn Geoffrey Household's 1939 spy thriller \"Rogue Male\", the protagonist muses: \"Behold, Sisera lay dead and the nail was in his temples.\"\nIn a half-hour radio drama, \"Butter in a Lordly Dish\" (1948), Agatha Christie has her protagonist drug a lawyer's coffee; after revealing her true identity, she hammers a nail into his head.\nThe central image of Aritha van Herk's novel 'The Tent Peg' refers to Sisera.\nIn Anthony Trollope's novel \"The Last Chronicle of Barset\", artist Conway Dalrymple paints the heiress Clara Van Siever as Jael driving a nail through the head of Sisera.\nThe story of Jael and Sisera has been the subject of many paintings, including those by Artemisia Gentileschi, Gregorio Lazzarini, James Northcote, Gustave Dor\u00e9 and James Tissot.\nIn Shelby Foote's \"Stars in Their Courses\" (1994), about the Battle of Gettysburg, the author reflects on the defeat of General Robert E. Lee.\n\"The Stars in Their Courses\" is the title of a chapter about the Battle of Gettysburg in the novel \"Lone Star Preacher\" (1941) by John Thomason. The quotation from Judges 5:20 appears at the end of the chapter.\nIn the \"Law &amp; Order\" episode \"Pro Se\", the schizophrenic James Smith suffers from the delusion that (among other things) he is General Sisera and various women are trying to poison him.\nIn Waking the Dead s4ep1 \"In Sight of The Lord\" a series of murders are committed with a large nail through the head fixing the victim to the floor.

It has numerous subtaxons and forms both vines and shrubs. Despite its common name, it is not a true ivy, but rather a member of the cashew and sumac family, Anacardiaceae. It is different from western poison ivy, \"Toxicodendron rydbergii\", and resembles a number of species.\nThe species is found in North America. Although commonly eaten by animals, with birds consuming the seeds, \"T.\u00a0radicans\" is considered a noxious weed. As a poison ivy, it causes urushiol-induced contact dermatitis in most people who touch it, producing an itchy, irritating, and sometimes painful rash.\nDescription.\nNumerous subspecies and/or varieties of \"T. radicans\" are known. They can be found growing in any of the following forms, all having woody stems:\nThe deciduous leaves of \"T.\u00a0radicans\" are trifoliate with three almond-shaped leaflets. The leaf color ranges from light green (usually when young) to dark green (in maturity), turning red, orange or yellow in fall; some sources say the leaves are also reddish when expanding (before becoming dark green). The leaflets are long, rarely up to , and somewhat shiny in maturity. Each leaflet has a few or no teeth along its edge, and the leaf surface is smooth. Leaflet clusters are alternate on the vine, and the plant has no thorns. Vines growing on the trunk of a tree become firmly attached through numerous aerial rootlets. The vines develop adventitious roots, or the plant can spread from rhizomes or root crowns. The milky sap of poison ivy darkens after exposure to the air.\n\"T. radicans\" spreads either vegetatively or sexually. It is dioecious; flowering occurs from May to July. The yellowish- or greenish-white flowers are typically inconspicuous and are located in clusters up to above the leaves. The berry-like fruit, a drupe, mature by August to November with a grayish-white colour.\nIdentification.\nThese four characteristics are sufficient to identify poison ivy in most situations: (a) clusters of three leaflets, (b) alternate leaf arrangement, (c) lack of thorns, and (d) each group of three leaflets grows on its own stem, which connects to the main vine, the middle stem is longer. The appearance of poison ivy can vary greatly among environments, and even within a large area. Identification by experienced people is often made difficult by leaf damage, the plant's leafless condition during winter, and unusual growth forms due to environmental or genetic factors. Various mnemonic rhymes describe the characteristic appearance of poison ivy:\nTaxonomy.\n\"Caquistle\" or \"caxuistle\" is the Nahuatl term for the species.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"T. radicans\" grows throughout much of North America, including the Canadian Maritime provinces, Quebec, Ontario, and all US states east of the Rocky Mountains, as well as in the mountainous areas of Mexico up to around . It is normally found in wooded areas, especially along edge areas where the tree line breaks and allows sunshine to filter through. It also grows in exposed rocky areas, open fields, and disturbed areas.\nIt may grow as a forest understory plant, although it is only somewhat shade-tolerant. The plant is extremely common in suburban and exurban areas of New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Southeastern United States. The similar species \"T.\u00a0diversilobum\" (western poison oak) and \"T.\u00a0rydbergii\" (western poison ivy) are found in western North America, and \"T.\u00a0orientale\" in Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Sakhalin.\n\"T. radicans\" rarely grows at altitudes above , although the altitude limit varies in different locations. The plants can grow as a shrub up to about tall, as a groundcover high, or as a climbing vine on various supports. Older vines on substantial supports send out lateral branches that may be mistaken for tree limbs at first glance.\nIt grows in a wide variety of soil types, and soil pH from 6.0 (acidic) to 7.9 (moderately alkaline). It is not particularly sensitive to soil moisture, although it does not grow in desert or arid conditions. It can grow in areas subject to seasonal flooding or brackish water.\nIt is more common now than when Europeans first arrived in North America. The development of real estate adjacent to wild, undeveloped land has engendered \"edge effects\", enabling poison ivy to form vast, lush colonies in these areas. It is listed as a noxious weed in the US states of Minnesota and Michigan and in the Canadian province of Ontario.\nPoison ivy is particularly sensitive to carbon dioxide levels, greatly benefiting from higher concentrations in the atmosphere. Higher carbon dioxide levels increase the rate of plant growth, and cause them to produce more unsaturated urushiol, which causes stronger reactions in humans. Poison ivy's growth and potency has already doubled since the 1960s, and it could double again once carbon dioxide levels reach 560 ppm.\nEcology.\nThe fruits are a favorite winter food of some birds and other animals, including wild turkeys. Seeds are spread mainly by animals and remain viable after passing through the digestive tract. Birds may spread the seeds by regurgitation.\nToxicity.\nUrushiol-induced contact dermatitis is the allergic reaction caused by poison ivy. In extreme cases, a reaction can progress to anaphylaxis. Around 15 to 25 percent of people have no allergic reaction to urushiol, but most people have a greater reaction with repeated or more concentrated exposure. Typically, the rash from the urushiol oil lasts about five to twelve days, but in extreme cases, it can last a month or more.\nOver 350,000 people are affected by urushiol annually in the US.\nThe pentadecyl catechols of the oleoresin within the sap of poison ivy and related plants causes the allergic reaction; the plants produce a mixture of pentadecylcatechols, which collectively is called urushiol. After injury, the sap leaks to the surface of the plant where the urushiol becomes a blackish lacquer after contact with oxygen.\nUrushiol binds to the skin on contact, where it causes severe itching that develops into reddish inflammation or uncoloured bumps, and then blistering. These lesions may be treated with Calamine lotion, Burow's solution compresses, dedicated commercial poison ivy itch creams, or baths to relieve discomfort, though recent studies have shown some traditional medicines to be ineffective.\nOver-the-counter products to ease itching\u2014or simply oatmeal baths and baking soda\u2014are recommended by dermatologists for the treatment of poison ivy.\nA plant-based remedy cited to counter urushiol-induced contact dermatitis is jewelweed, though jewelweed extracts had no positive effect in clinical studies. Others argue that prevention of lesions is easy if one practices effective washing, using plain soap, scrubbing with a washcloth, and rinsing three times within 2\u20138 hours of exposure.\nThe oozing fluids released by scratching blisters do not spread the poison. The fluid in the blisters is produced by the body and it is not urushiol itself. The appearance of a spreading rash indicates that some areas received more of the poison and reacted sooner than other areas or that contamination is still occurring from contact with objects to which the original poison was spread. Those affected can unknowingly spread the urushiol inside the house, on phones, doorknobs, couches, counters, desks, and so on, thus in fact repeatedly coming into contact with poison ivy and extending the length of time of the rash. If this has happened, wipe down the surfaces with bleach or a commercial urushiol removal agent. The blisters and oozing result from blood vessels that develop gaps and leak fluid through the skin; if the skin is cooled, the vessels constrict and leak less. If plant material with urushiol is burned and the smoke then inhaled, this rash will appear on the lining of the lungs, causing extreme pain and possibly fatal respiratory difficulty. If poison ivy is eaten, the mucous lining of the mouth and digestive tract can be damaged. An urushiol rash usually develops within a week of exposure and can last 1\u20134 weeks, depending on severity and treatment. In rare cases, urushiol reactions may require hospitalization.\nUrushiol oil can remain active for several years, so handling dead leaves or vines can cause a reaction. In addition, oil transferred from the plant to other objects (such as pet fur) can cause the rash if it comes into contact with the skin. Clothing, tools, and other objects that have been exposed to oil should be washed to prevent further reactions.\nTreatment.\nImmediate washing with soap and cold water or rubbing alcohol may help prevent a reaction. During a reaction, Calamine lotion or diphenhydramine may help mitigate symptoms. Corticosteroids, either applied to the skin or taken by mouth, may be appropriate in extreme cases. An astringent containing aluminum acetate (such as Burow's solution) may also provide relief and soothe the uncomfortable symptoms of the rash.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, it is \"Rhus coriaria\" that is most commonly used for culinary purposes. Sumac is prized as a spice\u2014especially in Iranian cuisine, and other Eastern cuisines\u2014and used as a dye and holistic remedy. The plants grow in subtropical and temperate regions, on nearly every continent except Antarctica and South America.\nNative to Persia, it holds cultural significance as a symbolic item on the \"Haft-sin\" table during \"Nowruz\", the Persian New Year.\nDescription.\nSumacs are dioecious shrubs and small trees that can reach a height of . The leaves of its type species are pinnately compound, though some species have trifoliate or simple leaves. The flowers are in dense panicles or spikes long, each flower very small, greenish, creamy white or red, with five petals. The fruits are reddish, thin-fleshed drupes covered in varying levels of hairs at maturity and form dense clusters at branch tips, sometimes called sumac bobs.\nSumacs propagate both by seed (spread by birds and other animals through their droppings), and by new shoots from rhizomes, forming large clonal colonies.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"sumac\" traces its etymology from Old French \"sumac\" (13th century), from Mediaeval Latin \"sumach\", from Arabic ', from Syriac \u0723\u0718\u0721\u0729\u0710 ' meaning \"red\".\nTaxonomy.\nThe generic name \"Rhus\" derives from Ancient Greek \u1fe5\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \"rhous\" referring to the type species \"R. coriaria\", of unknown etymology; the suggestion that it is connected with the verb \u1fe5\u03ad\u03c9 \"rhe\u014d\" \"to flow\" is now rejected by scholars. The taxonomy of \"Rhus\" has a long history, with de Candolle proposing a subgeneric classification with 5 sections in 1825. At its largest circumscription, \"Rhus\", with over 250 species, has been the largest genus in the family Anacardiaceae.\nOther authors used subgenera and placed some species in separate genera, hence the use of \"Rhus\" \"sensu lato\" and \"Rhus\" \"sensu stricto\" (\"s.s.\"). One classification uses two subgenera, \"Rhus\" (about 10\u00a0spp.) and \"Lobadium\" (about 25\u00a0spp.), while at the same time \"Cotinus\", \"Duckera\", \"Malosma\", \"Metopium\", \"Searsia\" and \"Toxicodendron\" segregated to create \"Rhus\" \"s.s.\". Other genera that have been segregated include \"Actinocheita\" and \"Baronia\". As defined, \"Rhus\" \"s.s.\" appears monophyletic by molecular phylogeny research. However, the subgenera do not appear to be monophyletic. The larger subgenus, \"Lobadium\", has been divided further into sections, \"Lobadium\", \"Terebinthifolia\", and \"Styphonia\" (two subsections).\nAccepted species by continent.\nAs of November 2024, Plants of the World Online accepts 54 species.\nAsia, North Africa and southern Europe\nAustralia, Pacific\nNorth America\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCultivation and uses.\nSpecies including the fragrant sumac (\"R. aromatica\"), the littleleaf sumac (\"R. microphylla\"), the smooth sumac (\"R. glabra\"), and the staghorn sumac (\"R. typhina\") are grown for ornament, either as the wild types or as cultivars.\nIn food.\nThe dried fruits of some species are ground to produce a tangy, crimson spice popular in many countries. Fruits are also used to make a traditional \"pink lemonade\" beverage by steeping them in water, straining to remove the hairs that may irritate the mouth or throat, sometimes adding sweeteners such as honey or sugar. Sumac's tart flavor comes from high amounts of malic acid.\nThe fruits (drupes) of \"Rhus coriaria\" are ground into a reddish-purple powder used as a spice in many different cuisines to add a tart, lemony taste to salads or meat. In Arab cuisine, it is used as a garnish on \"meze\" dishes such as hummus and \"tashi\", it is also commonly added to falafel. Syria uses the spice also, it is one of the main ingredients of Kubah Sumakieh in Aleppo of Syria, it is added to salads in the Levant, as well as being one of the main ingredients in the Palestinian dish \"musakhan\". In Afghan, Armenian, Iraqi, Iranian and Mizrahi cuisines, sumac is added to rice and grilled meats. In Armenian, Azerbaijani, Central Asian, Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian, Palestinian, Lebanese, Turkish and Kurdish cuisines, it is added to salads, and \"lahmajoun\". \"Rhus coriaria\" is used in the Levantine spice mixture \"za'atar\".\nDuring medieval times, primarily from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, sumac appeared in cookbooks frequently used by the affluent in Western Europe. One dish in particular called \"sum\u0101qiyya\", a stew made from sumac, was frequently rendered as \"somacchia\" by Europeans.\nIn North America, the smooth sumac (\"R. glabra\"), three-leaf sumac (\"R. trilobata\"), and staghorn sumac (\"R. typhina\") are sometimes used to make a beverage termed \"sumac-ade\", \"Indian lemonade\", or \"rhus juice\". This drink is made by soaking the drupes in cool water, rubbing them to extract the essence, straining the liquid through a cotton cloth, and sweetening it. Native Americans also use the leaves and drupes of these sumacs combined with tobacco in traditional smoking mixtures.\nDye and tanning agent.\nThe leaves and bark of most sumac species contain high levels of tannins and have been used in the manufacturing of leather by many cultures around the world. The Hebrew name \"og ha-bursaka'im\" means \"tanner's sumac\", as does the Latin name of \"R. coriaria\". The leaves of certain sumacs yield tannin (mostly pyrogallol-type), a substance used in vegetable tanning. Notable sources include the leaves of \"R. coriaria\", Chinese gall on \"R. chinensis\", and wood and roots of \"R. pentaphylla\". Leather tanned with sumac is flexible, light in weight, and light in color. One type of leather made with sumac tannins is morocco leather.\nThe dyeing property of sumac needed to be considered when it was shipped as a fine floury substance in sacks as a light cargo accompanying heavy cargoes such as marble. Sumac was especially dangerous to marble: \"When sumac dust settles on white marble, the result is not immediately apparent, but if it once becomes wet, or even damp, it becomes a powerful purple dye, which penetrates the marble to an extraordinary depth.\"\nIbn Badis describes a formula for making red ink out of leeched sumac mixed with gum.\n was used for only the outerwear of the Emperor of Japan, thus being one of the forbidden \u0441olors.\nTraditional medicinal use.\nSumac was used as a treatment for several different ailments in medieval medicine, primarily in West, Central and South Asian countries (where sumac was more readily available than in Europe). An 11th-century shipwreck off the coast of Rhodes, excavated by archeologists in the 1970s, contained commercial quantities of sumac drupes. These could have been intended for use as medicine, as a culinary spice, or as a dye. A clinical study showed that dietary sumac decreases the blood pressure in patients with hypertension and can be used as adjunctive treatment.\nOther uses.\nSome beekeepers use dried sumac bobs as a source of fuel for their smokers.\nSumac stems also have a soft pith in the center that is easily removed to make them useful in traditional Native American pipemaking. They were commonly used as pipe stems in the northern United States.\nDried sumac wood fluoresces under long-wave ultraviolet radiation.\nToxicity and control.\nSome species formerly recognized in \"Rhus\", such as poison ivy (\"Toxicodendron radicans\", syn. \"Rhus toxicodendron\"), poison oak (\"Toxicodendron diversilobum\", syn. \"Rhus diversiloba\"), and poison sumac (\"Toxicodendron vernix\", syn. \"Rhus vernix\"), produce the allergen urushiol and can cause severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Poison sumac may be identified by its white drupes, which are quite different from the red drupes of true \"Rhus\" species.\nMowing of sumac is not a good control measure, since the wood is springy, resulting in jagged, sharp-pointed stumps when mown. The plant will quickly recover with new growth after mowing. Goats have long been considered an efficient and quick removal method, as they eat the bark, which helps prevent new shoots. Sumac propagates by rhizome. Small shoots will be found growing near a more mature sumac tree via a shallow running root quite some distance from the primary tree.

A sin offering also occurs in 2 Chronicles 29:21 where seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs and seven he-goats were sacrificed on the command of King Hezekiah for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. \nLike all types of sacrifices offered on the altar, the flour had to be unscented and the animal had to be completely unblemished. This offered sacrifice accompanied the important required core means of atonement for the committing of an \"unintentional\" transgression of a prohibition, that either has brought guilt upon the 'community of Israel' or the individual. This offering is brought during or after atonement for those transgressions that had been committed inadvertently, or in ignorance: intentional transgressions could only be absolved by other forms of atonement, or in severe cases kareth. It was distinct from the biblical guilt offering.\nEtymology.\nThe Hebrew noun \"\u1e25atat\" (\"sin\") comes from the verb \u1e25ata (\u05d7\u05b8\u05d8\u05b8\u05d0) basically meaning \"to miss the mark, to err\". The first use is in the sentence \"(..) Sin couches at the door; Its urge is toward you, Yet you can be its master\" to Cain in Genesis 4:7. The noun \"\u1e25atat\" can mean \"sin,\" or also by metonymy in phrases such as \"the bullock ... it is sin,\" or \"a bullock for a sin, for atonement\": it can also stand for purification offering. The high priest was instructed to \"...lay his hand upon the head of the purification offering [\"rosh ha-\u1e25atat\" \u05e8\u05b9\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d4\u05b7\u05bd\u05d7\u05b7\u05d8\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0\u05ea], and the purification offering shall be slaughtered at the place of the burnt offering\" (Leviticus 4:29). To avoid confusion, the more explanatory term \"korban \u1e25atat\" (\"a sacrifice of sin\"; Hebrew: \u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\u05df \u05d7\u05d8\u05d0\u05ea) is found in rabbinical commentaries.\nIn the Jewish Bible.\nChapters 4.1-5.13 of the Book of Leviticus presents the first of three speeches of God to Moses that outlines laws concerning the \"\u1e25ata't\" or purification offering. Besides other types of offerings, it appears in the 24th (weekly) parsha Vayikra, a section of the Torah in the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh (Jewish Bible) A sin offering also occurs in 2 Chronicles 29:21 where seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs and seven he-goats were sacrificed on the command of King Hezekiah for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah.\nThe end of the 37th weekly Torah portion Shlach Lecha (Num. 15.22-31) again, deals with sacrifices for inadvertent violations: they are applicable for all laws, apply to both Israelites and alien residents, but exclude expiation of defiant, willful violations of ritual law (cf. \"Kareth\").\nIn the Greek Old Testament.\nIn the Greek Old Testament, the Hebrew term for \"sin\" (\"\u1e25atat\") is sometimes directly translated as \"sin\" - either by the Greek feminine noun \"hamartia\" (\"sin\" \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1), or less commonly by the neuter noun \"hamartemata\" (\"result of sin,\" \"sinful thing\" \u1f01\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1) thereby duplicating the metonymy in the Hebrew text. More often the Greek paraphrases the Hebrew with expressions such as \"that which is for sin\" (\"peri hamartias\" \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) or \"for sins\" (\"hyper hamartion\" \u1f51\u03c0\u1f72\u03c1 \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9\u1ff6\u03bd) - since the Greek noun \"hamartia\" does not have the double meaning of the noun \"\u1e25atat\" in Hebrew.\nChapter 4 of the Book of Leviticus in the Old Testament of Christian biblical canons provides Moses' instructions from God regarding the purification offering and chapter 15 of the Book of Numbers partially repeats them.\nChoice of sacrifice.\nThe sacrificial animal required for a \"sin offering\" depended on the status of the sinner offering the sacrifice; \nLike all types of sacrifices offered on the altar, the animal had to be completely unblemished.\nApart from such general offerings for an unintended sin, these offerings were made:\nRitual.\nThe ritual of the purification offering began with the offerer confessing his/her unintentional transgression while placing his/her hands and pushing his/her full weight over the head of the animal. In the case of community offerings the elders performed this function, in the case of Yom Kippur, the high priest performed this task. The animal would then be slaughtered by a Shochet (\"ritual butcher\"), the blood carefully collected by the Kohen (\"priest\") in an earthen vessel and sprayed/thrown on the two outer corners of the Mizbeach (\"altar\"), while the fat, liver, kidneys, and caul, were burnt on the roof of the altar.\nOn Yom Kippur\u2014the Day of Atonement\u2014some of the blood would be sprinkled in front of the veil covering the entrance to the Holy of Holies when the blood would be sprinkled in front of the mercy seat; this was done seven times. The remainder of the blood was poured out at the base of the altar, and the earthen vessel that had contained it would be smashed.\nThe remaining flesh of the animal (in later rabbinical interpretation as one of the twenty-four kohanic gifts) was later consumed by the Kohen and his family, except when the priest himself was the offerer (such as in community offerings, and in the case of the Day of Atonement), when it would be burnt at a ritually clean location outside the Temple sanctuary. Leviticus 6:26 stipulates that \"the priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of meeting\", a point repeated at Leviticus 7:7, whereas Leviticus 6:29 allows that \"all the males among the priests may eat it\", suggesting that the proceeds of sin offerings could be shared within the kohanic community. The sharing of grain offerings within the kohanic community was more clearly endorsed by Leviticus 7:10 - \"Every grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to one as much as the other\".\nWhen the sacrificial animal was a bird, the ritual was quite different. The bird was slaughtered by a thumb being pushed into its neck, and the head being wrung off. A second bird would then be burnt on the altar as a \"whole sacrifice\", completely immolated by fire.\nTextual criticism.\nAccording to 19th century textual scholars, these rules originate from two different layers in the priestly source, thought by scholars to be one of the source texts of the Torah; the priestly code within the priestly source is believed to be a series of additions to the text, from Aaronid editors, over a long period. The earlier source is thought to be the one referring to the flesh being consumed by the priests, the latter part of Leviticus 6 falls into this source, while the later source, which Leviticus 4 falls within, reflects a development where the flesh from sin offerings was seen as insufficiently holy and thus needing to be disposed of elsewhere. In the Book of Hosea, a reference to the earlier form (Hosea 4:7-8) suggests a possible reason for the change - the priests were accused of rejoicing in the people's wickedness as they were living off the \"sin offerings\". Although known as \"sin offerings\", it is more likely that such offerings began as offerings made for unintentionally breaking a taboo (here meaning something which is seen as sacred but simultaneously prohibited).\nThe other sin offerings are considered by scholars to be gradual developments; from being offered after contact with unclean animals, which is more of a taboo, to being offered for ritual uncleanliness in general, and finally to being offered for arbitrary sins. The gradations, according to which the type of sacrificial animal depends on the social status of the sinner, are considered by textual scholars to also be a later development.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "69236", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69236", "title": "Oswald Mosley", "text": "British fascist politician (1896\u20131980)\nSir Oswald Ernald Mosley, 6th Baronet (16 November 1896 \u2013 3 December 1980), was a British politician who rose to fame during the 1920s and 1930s when, disillusioned with mainstream politics, he turned to fascism. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Harrow from 1918 to 1924 and for Smethwick from 1926 to 1931. He founded the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in 1932 and led it until its forced disbandment in 1940.\nAfter military service during the First World War, Mosley became the youngest sitting member of Parliament, representing Harrow from 1918, first as a member of the Conservative Party, then an independent, and finally joining the Labour Party. At the 1924 general election he stood in Birmingham Ladywood against the future Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, coming within 100 votes of defeating him. Mosley returned to Parliament as the Labour MP for Smethwick at a by-election in 1926 and served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the Labour government of 1929\u20131931. In 1928 he succeeded his father as the sixth Mosley baronet, a title in his family for over a century. Some considered Mosley a rising star and a possible future prime minister. He resigned in 1930 over discord with the government's unemployment policies. He chose not to defend his Smethwick constituency at the 1931 general election, instead unsuccessfully standing in Stoke-on-Trent.\nMosley's New Party became the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in 1932. As its leader he publicly espoused antisemitism and sought alliances with Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Fascist violence under Mosley's leadership culminated in the Battle of Cable Street in 1936, during which anti-fascist demonstrators including trade unionists, liberals, socialists, communists, anarchists and British Jews prevented the BUF from marching through the East End of London. Mosley subsequently held a series of rallies around London, and the BUF increased its membership there.\nIn 1939 Mosley was implicated in a fascist conspiracy organised by the Right Club against the British government by Archibald Maule Ramsay, albeit all evidence indicates that he soon distanced himself from them, viewing the group and its aims as too extreme.\nIn May 1940, after the outbreak of the Second World War, Mosley was imprisoned and the BUF was made illegal. He was released in 1943 and, politically disgraced by his association with fascism, moved abroad in 1951, spending most of the remainder of his life in France and Ireland. He stood for Parliament during the post-war era but received relatively little support. During this period he was an advocate of pan-European nationalism, developing the Europe a Nation ideology, and was an early proponent of conspiracy theories concerning Holocaust-denial.\nEarly life.\nChildhood and education.\nMosley was born on 16 November 1896 at 47 Hill Street, Mayfair, London. He was the eldest of the three sons of Sir Oswald Mosley, 5th Baronet (1873\u20131928), and Katharine Maud Edwards-Heathcote (1873\u20131948), daughter of Captain Justinian Edwards-Heathcote, of Apedale Hall, Staffordshire; they had been married the year before. He had two younger brothers: Edward Heathcote Mosley (1899\u20131980) and John Arthur Noel Mosley (1901\u20131973). His father was a third cousin to Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, making Mosley a fourth cousin to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\nThe progenitor, and earliest-attested ancestor, of the Mosley family was Ernald de Mosley (fl. 12th century), Lord of the Manor of Moseley, Staffordshire, during the reign of King John. Nicholas Mosley was a wealthy salesman in the 16th century, and was important in the development of Manchester, before eventually becoming Mayor of London; the family took a violent part in the Peterloo Massacre. Two branches of the Mosley family existed \u2013 a significant cotton trading family who lived in Lancashire, and a farming family who lived in Rolleston; Oswald was descended from the former. The family were prominent landholders in Staffordshire and seated at Rolleston Hall, near Burton upon Trent. Three baronetcies were created, two of which are now extinct (see Mosley baronets for further history of the family); a barony was created for Tonman Mosley, brother of the 4th Baronet, but also became extinct. By the 19th century, reformers had taken control of the Manchester Court leet, which formerly belonged to the family, and the Mosleys had little influence by the latter half of the century. Oswald's grandfather Sir Oswald Mosley, 4th Baronet, was a campaigner against Jewish emancipation. Oswald noted in his autobiography \"My Life\" that he was glad to have come from an 'old English family'.\nHis mother wrote in her diary that his birth took 18 hours after he began to arrive at 6:00am, her own mother staying by her side for the whole duration. The family doctor, Sir John Williams, gave her chloroform and the baby was delivered at 11:40pm. Her husband, who was addicted to both gambling and alcohol, wrote a large number of letters to relatives about the event, and celebrated at the Epsom Derby; he was mostly an absent husband.\nIn childhood, Mosley moved from what he described as a \"wayside house\" to Rolleston Hall, which had been inherited in 1879 by the 4th Baronet. The Hall was a large building maintained by gardeners and servants. Biographer Stephen Dorril has suggested that the treatment of the workers at the mansion, who laboured with no possibility to become more successful, may have impressed itself on Mosley's worldview and such treatment came to be part of his fascism.\nMosley loved his mother, toward whom he felt protective; in the 1970s, he burned her diaries to avoid investigative authors depicting her negatively, using them as evidence, although he kept the entries for the first four years of his own life, and for his mother's birthday, 2 January. Likewise, she celebrated Mosley and developed his ego. His father \u2013 nicknamed \"Waldie\" \u2013 was an amateur boxer, a Tory and a womaniser. Mosley's father gained the image of a scoundrel, although Mosley did not find the description to be accurate. Nonetheless, \"Waldie\" acted aggressively towards his wife and child, which led to Mosley idolising his mother instead. In 1901, when Mosley was aged five and while his mother was pregnant with her third child, the couple split over his womanising \u2013 Edwards-Heathcote had discovered letters revealing that her husband was saying and gifting the same things to his other lovers as to her.\nAfter Mosley's parents separated, he was raised by his mother, who went to live at Betton Hall near Market Drayton, and his paternal grandfather, Sir Oswald Mosley, 4th Baronet. His mother had a small alimony, and was impoverished by comparison to the rest of the family. Mosley rarely being able to see his father, his mother became more attached to him. His grandfather took the role of a male parental figure in Mosley's life; Likewise, his grandfather disliked his father, and saw Mosley as a substitute son; the 4th Baronet was seen as a masculine figure by Mosley, and developed his own masculine image based on his grandfather, alongside various pop-cultural ideas.\nMosley studied at West Downs School in Winchester from 1906 onward, eventually joined by Edward, where Oswald developed a reputation as a debater. He then joined Winchester College in 1909 at the age of 12, a year early, and found school both hard and boring; he did not socialise. During this period he hunted extensively, shooting 50 partridges, 18 pheasants, 11 rabbits and 10 hares over the winter from 1909 to 1910, as well as fishing at Rolleston. He also became a boxer by age 15, winning a light-weight championship, and attempted to enter the Public Schools' boxing championship, but was forbidden to do so by his headmaster; Mosley then took up fencing instead. He was a fencing champion in his school days, winning titles in both foil and sabre, and becoming the first boy to win both and the youngest to win either at the Public Schools' championship. He retained an enthusiasm for the sport throughout his life.\nMilitary service.\nMosley left college in 1912, briefly staying in Brest, France in summer 1913, where he competed in fencing. After returning to England, he became keen on entering the army, entering the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in January 1914. He considered his period at the military college to be \u2018one of the happiest times of [his] entire life\u201d, but was expelled in June for a \"riotous act of retaliation\" against a fellow student. John Masters made a claim that Mosley was thrown out of a window by other cadets; according to Dorril, he had actually slipped and fallen while recruiting for the retaliation against a group of cadets who had attacked him. He was sent away from the college that weekend.\nDuring the First World War, he was commissioned into the British cavalry unit the 16th The Queen's Lancers and fought in France on the Western Front. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as a pilot and an air observer, but while demonstrating in front of his mother and sister he crashed, which left him with a permanent limp, as well as a reputation for being brave and somewhat reckless. He returned to the Lancers, but was invalided out with an injured leg. He spent the remainder of the war at desk jobs in the Ministry of Munitions and in the Foreign Office.\nMarriage to Lady Cynthia Curzon.\nOn 11 May 1920, Mosley married Lady Cynthia \"Cimmie\" Curzon, the second daughter of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, the Foreign Secretary and former Viceroy of India, and Lord Curzon's first wife, the American mercantile heiress Mary Leiter. It was later alleged by Arnold Leese, a political rival of Mosley's in the early 1930s who founded the Imperial Fascist League and considered the BUF to be insufficiently antisemitic, that Cynthia had been \"of Jewish descent\", and falsely claimed that she \"had had a Jewish grandfather.\" In March 1920, Mosley met Lord Curzon to inform him about the marriage and request his approval; ironically, in a letter written afterwards to his American-born second wife, Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston, his future father-in-law made the casually antisemitic remark that Mosley possessed a \"rather a Jewish appearance.\"\nLord Curzon had to be persuaded that Mosley was a suitable husband, as he suspected Mosley was largely motivated by social advancement in Conservative Party politics and Cynthia's inheritance. The wedding took place in the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace in London. The hundreds of guests included King George V and Queen Mary, as well as foreign royalty such as the Duke and Duchess of Brabant (later King Leopold III and Queen Astrid of Belgium).\nDuring his marriage to Cynthia, Mosley engaged in an extended affair with his wife's younger sister, Lady Alexandra Metcalfe, while also carrying on a separate affair with their stepmother Grace, who had been a widow since her husband's death in 1925. He succeeded to the Mosley baronetcy of Ancoats upon his father's death in 1928.\nEntering Westminster as a Conservative.\nMosley was first encouraged to enter politics by F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead. By the end of the First World War Mosley, aged 21, had decided to go into politics as a member of Parliament, as he had no university education or practical experience because of the war. He was driven by, and in Parliament spoke of, a passionate conviction to avoid any future war, and this seemingly motivated his career. Uninterested in party labels, Mosley primarily identified himself as a representative of the \"war generation\" who would aim to create a \"land fit for heroes.\" Largely because of his family background and war service, local Conservative and Liberal associations made appeals to Mosley in several constituencies.\nMosley considered contesting the constituency of Stone in his home county of Staffordshire, but ultimately chose the Conservative stronghold of Harrow, for it was closer to London and, as Mosley claimed, a seat that he sought to win on his own merits, free from family connections. On 23 July 1918 Mosley competed with three other candidates for the Conservative nomination at the upcoming general election. Though his 15-minute speech \"fell flat,\" Mosley won over the 43 delegates with the \"lucid and trenchant manner\" in which he answered their questions. Mosley's opponent in the parliamentary election was an independent, A. R. Chamberlayne, an elderly solicitor who complained that the well-connected, wealthy Mosley was \"a creature of the party machine\" and too young to serve as a member of Parliament. Mosley retorted that many of Britain's greatest politicians entered Parliament between the ages of 19 to 25, such as Charles James Fox, William Pitt the Younger, William Ewart Gladstone, Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston and Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury. Mosley chose red as his campaign colour rather than the traditional blue associated with conservatism. Mosley easily defeated Chamberlayne with a majority of nearly 11,000.\nHe was the youngest member of the House of Commons to take his seat, although Joseph Sweeney, a Sinn F\u00e9in member, and therefore an abstentionist, was seven months younger. He soon distinguished himself as an orator and political player, one marked by confidence, and made a point of speaking in the Commons without notes.\nMosley was an early supporter of the economist John Maynard Keynes. Mosley's economic programme, which he coined \"socialistic imperialism,\" advocated for improved industrial wages and hours, the nationalisation of electricity and transportation, slum-clearance, the protection of \"essential industries\" from \"unfair competition,\" and higher government investment in education, child-welfare, and health services.\nCrossing the floor.\nMosley was at this time falling out with the Conservatives over their Irish policy, and condemned the operations of the Black and Tans against civilians during the Irish War of Independence. He was secretary of the Peace with Ireland Council. As secretary of the council, he proposed sending a commission to Ireland to examine on-the-spot reprisals by the Black and Tans. T. P. O'Connor, a prominent MP of the Irish Parliamentary Party, later wrote to Mosley's wife Cynthia, \"I regard him as the man who really began the break-up of the Black and Tan savagery.\" Mosley's initial speeches in parliament about the issue were moderate, and \"he betrayed no sympathy for the IRA\"; he even declared that \"in the present state of Ireland one certainly cannot deny the right to shoot a man who, when challenged, refuses to hold up his hands. Anything of that sort is perfectly legitimate.\" However, as the conflict worsened and reports of atrocities committed by British forces increased, Mosley became more radical in his denunciations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In his memoir, \"My Life\", published in 1968, Mosley recalled that the war in Ireland had \u2018evoked intense moral feeling\u2019. With each atrocity committed by the Black and Tans he felt \u2018that the name of Britain was being disgraced, every rule of good soldierly conduct disregarded, and every decent instinct of humanity outraged\u2019.\nMosley became \"one of a small handful of MPs who pursued\" then Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Sir Hamar Greenwood, \"over the unacknowledged policy of reprisals.\" However, \"[t]he root of Mosley\u2019s case against the Black and Tans was that their behaviour undermined the superiority of British imperial rule.\"\nIn mid-1920, Mosley issued a memorandum proposing that Britain's governance over Ireland should mirror the policy of the United States towards Cuba, in effect granting Ireland internal autonomy while retaining British oversight regarding defence and foreign policy matters. In November 1920, he questioned Greenwood directly in Parliament on the case of Eileen Quinn, a young pregnant mother who was shot and killed in County Galway by the Black and Tans.\nIn late 1920, Mosley crossed the floor to sit as an independent MP on the opposition side of the House of Commons. Having built up a following in his constituency, he retained it against a Conservative challenge in the 1922 and 1923 general elections.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Liberal \"Westminster Gazette\" wrote that Mosley was \"the most polished literary speaker in the Commons, words flow from him in graceful epigrammatic phrases that have a sting in them for the government and the Conservatives. To listen to him is an education in the English language, also in the art of delicate but deadly repartee. He has human sympathies, courage and brains.\"\nJoining Labour.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"We have made the acquaintance of the most brilliant man in the House of Commons - Oswald Mosley. 'Here is the perfect politician who is also a perfect gentleman,' said I to myself as he entered the room...He is also an accomplished orator in the old grand style, and an assiduous worker in the modern manner - keeps two secretaries at work supplying himself with information but realizes that he himself has to do the thinking! So much perfection argues rottenness somewhere...he seems to combine great personal charm with solid qualities of character, aristocratic refinement with democratic opinions.\"\n \u2014 Beatrice Webb, 8 June 1923\nBy now Mosley was drifting to the political left and gaining the attention of both the Liberals and Labour for his foreign policy polemics, which advocated for a strong League of Nations and isolationism (i.e. Britain should only go to war if it or the British Empire were attacked). Mosley was growing increasingly attracted to the Labour Party, which had recently formed its first government (under Ramsay MacDonald) after the 1923 general election. On 27 March 1924 Mosley applied for party membership. Shortly thereafter he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). MacDonald, who believed that aristocratic members gave Labour an air of respectability, was congratulated by \"The Manchester Guardian\" on \"the fine new recruit he has secured.\"\nUnsuccessfully challenging Chamberlain.\nWhen the government fell in October, Mosley had to choose a new seat, as he believed that Harrow would not re-elect him as a Labour candidate. He therefore decided to oppose Neville Chamberlain in Birmingham Ladywood. Mosley campaigned aggressively in Ladywood, and accused Chamberlain of being a \"landlords' hireling\" in reference to Chamberlain's controversial Rent Act of 1923. Chamberlain, outraged, demanded Mosley to retract the claim \"as a gentleman\". Mosley, whom Stanley Baldwin described as \"a cad and a wrong 'un\", refused to withdraw the allegation. Mosley was noted for bringing excitement and energy to the campaign. Leslie Hore-Belisha, then a Liberal politician who later became a senior Conservative, recorded his impressions of Mosley as a platform orator at this time:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Dark, aquiline, flashing: tall, thin, assured; defiance in his eye, contempt in his forward chin.\"\nTogether, Oswald and Cynthia Mosley proved an alluring couple, and many members of the working class in Birmingham succumbed to their charm for, as the historian Martin Pugh described, \"a link with powerful, wealthy and glamorous men and women appealed strongly to those who endured humdrum and deprived lives\". It took several re-counts before Chamberlain was declared the winner by 77\u00a0votes. Mosley blamed poor weather for the result. His period outside Parliament was used to develop a new economic policy for the ILP, which eventually became known as the Birmingham Proposals; they continued to form the basis of Mosley's economics until the end of his political career.\nMosley was critical of Sir Winston Churchill's policy as Chancellor of the Exchequer. After Churchill returned Britain to the gold standard, Mosley claimed that, \"faced with the alternative of saying goodbye to the gold standard, and therefore to his own employment, and goodbye to other people's employment, Mr. Churchill characteristically selected the latter course.\"\nIndia and Gandhi.\nAmong his many travels, Mosley travelled to British India accompanied by Lady Cynthia in the winter of 1924, which he would later characterise as \"a land of contrast, of ineffable beauty and of darkest sorrow, a jewel of the world, which challenges mankind to save it.\" His father-in-law's past as Viceroy of India allowed for the acquaintance of various personalities along the journey. They travelled by ship and stopped briefly in Cairo in the Kingdom of Egypt.\nHaving initially arrived in Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), the journey then continued through mainland India. They spent these initial days in the government house of Ceylon, followed by Madras and then Calcutta, where the governor at the time was Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton. During this journey Mosley came in contact with many prominent activists, including Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Chittaranjan Das and Motilal Nehru.\nMosley met Mahatma Gandhi through Charles Freer Andrews, a clergyman and an intimate friend of the \"Indian Saint\", as Mosley described him. They met in Kadda, where Gandhi was quick to invite him to a private conference in which Gandhi was chairman. Mosley later called Gandhi a \"sympathetic personality of subtle intelligence\". \nReturn to Parliament.\nOn 22 November 1926 the Labour-held seat of Smethwick fell vacant upon the resignation of John Davison, and Mosley was confident that this seat would return him to Westminster (having lost against Chamberlain in 1924). In his autobiography Mosley felt that the campaign was dominated by Conservative attacks on him for being too rich, including claims that he was covering up his wealth. In fact, during this campaign, the \"Daily Mail\" frequently attacked \"Mr. Silver Spoon Mosley\" for preaching socialism \"in a twenty guineas Savile Row suit\" while Lady Cynthia wore a \"charming dress glittering with diamonds.\" As the historian Robert Skidelsky writes, \"The papers were full of gossipy items about the wealthy socialist couple frolicking on the Riviera, spending thousands of pounds in renovating their 'mansion' and generally living a debauched aristocratic life.\" The recurring accusation against Mosley was that he was a \"champagne socialist\" who \"never did a day's work in his life.\" Mosley, in response, told his Smethwick supporters, \"While I am being abused by the Capitalist Press I know I am doing effective work for the Labour cause.\" At the by-election's polling day (21 December), Mosley was victorious with a majority of 6,582 over the Conservative candidate, M. J. Pike.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"This is not a by-election, it is history. The result of this election sends out a message to every worker in the land. You have met and beaten the Press of reaction...Tonight all Britain looks to you and thanks you. My wonderful friends of Smethwick, by your heroic battle against a whole world in arms, I believe you have introduced a new era for British democracy.\"\n\u2014 Oswald Mosley, election victory speech, 21 December 1926\nIn 1927, he mocked the British Fascists as \"black-shirted buffoons, making a cheap imitation of ice-cream sellers\". The ILP elected him to Labour's National Executive Committee.\nMosley and Cynthia were committed Fabians in the 1920s and at the start of the 1930s. Mosley appears in a list of names of Fabians from \"Fabian News\" and the \"Fabian Society Annual Report 1929\u201331\". He was Kingsway Hall lecturer in 1924 and Livingstone Hall lecturer in 1931.\nOffice.\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.\nMosley then made a bold bid for political advancement within the Labour Party. He was close to Ramsay MacDonald and hoped for one of the Great Offices of State, but when Labour won the 1929 general election he was appointed only to the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a position without portfolio. He was given responsibility for solving the unemployment problem, but found that his radical proposals were blocked either by Lord Privy Seal James Henry Thomas or by the Cabinet.\nMosley Memorandum.\nRealising the economic uncertainty that was facing the nation because of the death of its domestic industry, Mosley put forward a scheme in the \"Mosley Memorandum\" that called for high tariffs to protect British industries from international finance and transform the British Empire into an autarkic trading bloc, for state nationalisation of main industries, for higher school-leaving ages and pensions to reduce the labour surplus, and for a programme of public works to solve interwar poverty and unemployment. Furthermore, the memorandum laid out the foundations of the corporate state (not to be confused with corporatocracy) which intended to combine businesses, workers and the government into one body as a way to \"Obliterate class conflict and make the British economy healthy again\".\nMosley published this memorandum because of his dissatisfaction with the laissez-faire attitudes held by both Labour and the Conservative party, and their passivity towards the ever-increasing globalisation of the world, and thus looked to a modern solution to fix a modern problem. But it was rejected by the Cabinet and by the Parliamentary Labour Party, and in May 1930 Mosley resigned from his ministerial position. At the time, according to Lady Mosley's autobiography, the weekly Liberal-leaning paper \"The Nation and Athenaeum\" wrote: \"The resignation of Sir Oswald Mosley is an event of capital importance in domestic politics... We feel that Sir Oswald has acted rightly\u2014as he has certainly acted courageously in declining to share any longer in the responsibility for inertia.\" In October he attempted to persuade the Labour Party Conference to accept the Memorandum, but was defeated again.\nThe Mosley Memorandum won the support of the economist John Maynard Keynes, who stated that \"it was a very able document and illuminating\". Keynes also wrote, \"I like the spirit which informs the document. A scheme of national economic planning to achieve a right, or at least a better, balance of our industries between the old and the new, between agriculture and manufacture, between home development and foreign investment; and wide executive powers to carry out the details of such a scheme. That is what it amounts to. ... [The] manifesto offers us a starting point for thought and action. ... It will shock\u2014it must do so\u2014the many good citizens of this country... who have laissez-faire in their craniums, their consciences, and their bones ... But how anyone professing and calling himself a socialist can keep away from the manifesto is a more obscure matter.\"\nAccording to Lady Mosley's autobiography, thirty years later, in 1961, Richard Crossman wrote: \"this brilliant memorandum was a whole generation ahead of Labour thinking.\" As his book, \"The Greater Britain\", focused on the issues of free trade, the criticisms against globalisation that he formulated can be found in critiques of contemporary globalisation. He warns nations that buying cheaper goods from other nations may seem appealing but ultimately ravage domestic industry and lead to large unemployment, as seen in the 1930s. He argues that trying to \"challenge the 50-year-old system of free trade... exposes industry in the home market to the chaos of world conditions, such as price fluctuation, dumping, and the competition of sweated labour, which result in the lowering of wages and industrial decay.\"\nIn a newspaper feature, Mosley was described as \"a strange blend of J.M. Keynes and Major Douglas of credit fame\". From July 1930 he began to demand that government must be turned from a \"talk-shop\" into a \"workshop.\"\nIn 1992 Prime Minister John Major, examined Mosley's ideas to find an unorthodox solution to the aftermath of the 1990\u201391 economic recession.\nNew Party.\nDissatisfied with the Labour Party, Mosley and six other Labour MPs (two of whom resigned after one day) founded the New Party.\nIts early parliamentary contests, in the 1931 Ashton-under-Lyne by-election and subsequent by-elections, arguably had a spoiler effect in splitting the left-wing vote and allowing Conservative candidates to win. Despite this, the organisation gained support among many Labour and Conservative politicians who agreed with his corporatist economic policy, and among these were Aneurin Bevan and the future prime minister Harold Macmillan. Mosley's corporatism was complemented by Keynesianism, with Robert Skidelsky stating, \"Keynesianism was his great contribution to fascism.\"\nThe New Party increasingly inclined to fascist policies, but Mosley was denied the opportunity to establish his party when during the Great Depression the 1931 general election was suddenly called. The party's candidates, including Mosley himself running in Stoke which had been held by his wife, lost the seats they held and won none. As the New Party gradually became more radical and authoritarian, many previous supporters defected from it. According to Lady Mosley's autobiography, shortly after the 1931 election Mosley was described by \"The Manchester Guardian\":\nWhen Sir Oswald Mosley sat down after his Free Trade Hall speech in Manchester and the audience, stirred as an audience rarely is, rose and swept a storm of applause towards the platform\u2014who could doubt that here was one of those root-and-branch men who have been thrown up from time to time in the religious, political and business story of England. First that gripping audience is arrested, then stirred and finally, as we have said, swept off its feet by a tornado of peroration yelled at the defiant high pitch of a tremendous voice.\nHarold Nicolson, editor of the New Party's newspaper, \"Action\", recorded in his diary that Mosley personally decided to pursue fascism and the formation of a \"trained and disciplined force\" on 21 September 1931, following a recent Communist-organised disturbance at a public meeting attended by 20,000 people in Glasgow Green. Approximately four weeks before the general election, Mosley was approached by Neville Chamberlain to ally with the newly-formed National Government coalition led by Baldwin and MacDonald, with Nicolson writing that \"the Tories are anxious to get some of us in and are prepared to do a secret deal.\" Throughout early 1932 David Margesson, the chief whip of the Conservatives, continually attempted to persuade Mosley to rejoin the party. Meanwhile, Mosley was also approached by right-wing \"die hards\" who opposed the National Government and Baldwin's \"centrist\" leadership of the Conservative Party. This group included Winston Churchill, who \"[promised] to come out in his support\" should Mosley contest a by-election, and Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, the owner of the \"Daily Mail\" and the \"Daily Mirror\". In addition, Nicolson noted that Mosley was being courted by Joseph Kenworthy to \"lead the Labour Party.\" In the end, however, Mosley refused to return to the \"machine\" of the \"old parties.\" Convinced that fascism was the necessary path for Britain, the New Party was dissolved in April 1932.\nFascism.\nAfter his election failure in 1931, Mosley went on a study tour of the \"new movements\" of Italy's \"Duce\" Benito Mussolini and other fascists, and returned convinced, particularly by Fascist Italy's economic programme, that it was the way forward for Britain. He was determined to unite the existing fascist movements and created the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in 1932.\nThe British historian Matthew Worley argues that Mosley's adoption of fascism stemmed from three key factors. First, Mosley interpreted the Great Slump as proof that Britain's economy, which had historically favoured liberal capitalism, required a fundamental overhaul to survive the rise of cheap, global competition. Second, as a result of his experience as a Labour minister, Mosley grew to resent the apparent gridlock inherent in parliamentary democracy (see criticism of democracy). Mosley believed that party politics, parliamentary debate, and the formalities of bill passage hindered effective action in addressing the pressing economic issues of the post-war world. Finally, Mosley became convinced that the Labour Party was not an effective vehicle for the promulgation of \"the radical measures that he believed were necessary to prevent Britain\u2019s decline.\" As Worley notes about Mosley, \"Cast adrift from the political mainstream, he saw two alternative futures. One was the 'slow and almost imperceptible decline' of Britain to the 'level of a Spain'...[and the other] a deepening sense of crisis opening the way for a 'constructive alternative' to take the place of both liberal capitalism and parliamentary democracy.\" Mosley believed that Britain was in danger of a Communist revolution, of which only fascism could effectively combat.\nThe BUF was protectionist, strongly anti-communist and nationalistic to the point of advocating authoritarianism. He claimed that the Labour Party was pursuing policies of \"international socialism\", while fascism's aim was \"national socialism\". It claimed membership as high as 50,000, and had the \"Daily Mail\" and \"Daily Mirror\" among its earliest supporters. The \"Mirror\" piece was a guest article by the \"Daily Mail\" owner Viscount Rothermere and an apparent one-off; despite these briefly warm words for the BUF, the paper was so vitriolic in its condemnation of European fascism that Nazi Germany added the paper's directors to a hit list in the event of a successful Operation Sea Lion. The \"Mail\" continued to support the BUF until the Olympia rally in June 1934.\nMosley's supporters at this time included the novelist Henry Williamson, the military theorist J. F. C. Fuller, and the future \"Lord Haw Haw\", William Joyce.\nMosley had found problems with disruption of New Party meetings, and instituted a corps of black-uniformed paramilitary stewards, the Fascist Defence Force, nicknamed \"Blackshirts\", like the Italian fascist Voluntary Militia for National Security they were emulating. The party was frequently involved in violent confrontations and riots, particularly with communist and Jewish groups and especially in London. At a large Mosley rally at Olympia on 7 June 1934, his bodyguards' violence caused bad publicity. This and the Night of the Long Knives in Germany led to the loss of most of the BUF's mass support. Nevertheless, Mosley continued espousing antisemitism. At one of his New Party meetings in Leicester in April 1935, he said, \"For the first time I openly and publicly challenge the Jewish interests of this country, commanding commerce, commanding the Press, commanding the cinema, dominating the City of London, killing industry with their sweat-shops. These great interests are not intimidating, and will not intimidate, the Fascist movement of the modern age.\" The party was unable to fight the 1935 general election.\nIn October 1936, Mosley and the BUF tried to march through an East London area with a high proportion of Jewish residents. Violence, now called the Battle of Cable Street, resulted between protesters trying to block the march and police trying to force it through. Sir Philip Game, the police commissioner, stopped the march from proceeding and the BUF abandoned it.\nMosley continued to organise marches policed by the Blackshirts, and the government was sufficiently concerned to pass the Public Order Act 1936, which came into effect on 1 January 1937 and, amongst other things, banned political uniforms and quasi-military style organisations. In the London County Council elections in 1937, the BUF stood in three wards in East London (some former New Party seats), its strongest areas, polling up to a quarter of the vote. Mosley made most of the Blackshirt employees redundant, some of whom then defected from the party with William Joyce.\nIn October 1937 in Liverpool, he was knocked unconscious by two stones thrown by crowd members after he made a fascist salute to 8,000 people from the top of a van in Walton.\nAs the European situation moved towards war, the BUF began to nominate parliamentary by-election candidates and launched campaigns on the theme of \"Mind Britain's Business\". Mosley remained popular as late as summer 1939. His \"Britain First\" rally at the Earls Court Exhibition Hall on 16 July 1939 was the biggest indoor political rally in British history, with a reported 30,000 attendees.\nAfter the outbreak of war, Mosley led the campaign for a negotiated peace, but after the Fall of France and the start of aerial bombardment during the Battle of Britain overall public opinion of him became hostile. In mid-May 1940, he was nearly wounded by an assault.\nMarriage to Diana Mitford.\nCynthia died of peritonitis in 1933, after which Mosley married his mistress Diana Guinness, \"n\u00e9e\" Mitford (1910\u20132003). They married in secret in Nazi Germany on 6 October 1936 in the Berlin home of Germany's Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. Adolf Hitler was their guest of honour.\nMosley spent large amounts of his private fortune on the British Union of Fascists (BUF) and tried to establish it on a firm financial footing by various means including an attempt to negotiate, through Diana, with Hitler for permission to broadcast commercial radio to Britain from Germany. Mosley reportedly made a deal in 1937 with Francis Beaumont, heir to the Seigneurage of Sark, to set up a privately owned radio station on Sark.\nInvolvement in fascist plot.\nIn 1939, MI5 uncovered Mosley's ties to a fascist conspiracy initiated by Archibald Maule Ramsay and the Right Club, known as the Kensington Conspiracy. The coup would have taken place after the German invasion of Britain. Evidence indicates that he soon distanced himself from them, viewing the group and its aims as too extreme.\nInternment.\nMosley did not know that MI5 and Special Branch had deeply penetrated the BUF and were also monitoring him through listening devices. Beginning in 1934, they were increasingly worried that Mosley's noted oratory skills would convince the public to provide financial support to the BUF, enabling it to challenge the political establishment. American journalist and writer John Gunther described Mosley in 1940 as \"strikingly handsome. He is probably the best orator in England. His personal magnetism is very great\". His agitation was officially tolerated until the events of the Battle of France in May 1940 made the government consider him too dangerous. Mosley, who at that time was focused on pleading for the British to accept Hitler's peace offer of October 1939, was detained on 23 May 1940, less than a fortnight after Winston Churchill became prime minister. Mosley was interrogated for 16 hours by Lord Birkett but was never formally charged with a crime, and was instead interned under Defence Regulation 18B. Most other active fascists in Britain met the same fate, resulting in the BUF's practical removal at an organised level from the United Kingdom's political stage. Mosley's wife, Diana, was also interned in June, shortly after the birth of their son Max Mosley; the Mosleys lived together for most of the war in a house in the grounds of Holloway prison. The BUF was proscribed by the British government later that year.\nMosley used the time in confinement to read extensively in classics, particularly regarding politics and war, with a focus upon key historical figures. He refused visits from most BUF members, but on 18 March 1943, Dudley and Norah Elam (who had been released by then) accompanied Unity Mitford to see her sister Diana. Mosley agreed to be present because he mistakenly believed that it was Lady Redesdale, Diana and Unity's mother, who was accompanying Unity. The internment, particularly that of Lady Mosley, resulted in significant public debate in the press, although most of the public supported the government's actions. Others demanded a trial, either in the hope it would end the detention or in the hope of a conviction. During his internment he developed what would become a lifelong friendship with his fellow-prisoner Cahir Healy, a Catholic Irish nationalist MP for the Northern Irish Parliament.\nIn November 1943, the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, ordered the release of the Mosleys. After a fierce debate in the House of Commons, Morrison's action was upheld by a vote of 327\u201326. Mosley, who was suffering with phlebitis, spent the rest of the war confined under house arrest and police supervision. On his release from prison, he first stayed with his sister-in-law Pamela Mitford, followed shortly by a stay at the Shaven Crown Hotel in Shipton-under-Wychwood. He then purchased Crux Easton House, near Newbury, with Diana. He and his wife remained the subject of much press attention.\nPost-war politics.\nAfter the Second World War, Mosley was contacted by former supporters and persuaded to return to participation in politics. In 1948 he formed the Union Movement, which called for a single nation-state to cover the continent of Europe (known as Europe a Nation) and in 1962 attempted to launch a National Party of Europe to this end. He had connections with the Italian neo-fascist political party, Movimento Sociale Italiano, and contributed to a weekly Roman magazine, (Ace of Clubs, published from 1948 to 1957), which was supported by his Europe a Nation. \"The New European\" has described Mosley as an \"avowed Europhile\". The Union Movement's meetings were often physically disrupted, as Mosley's meetings had been before the war, and largely by the same opponents. This may have contributed to his decision, in 1951, to leave Britain and live in Ireland. He responded to criticism of his abandoning his supporters in a hostile Britain for a life abroad by saying, \"You don't clear up a dungheap from underneath it.\" In the 1950s, Mosley advocated that Africa be divided into black and white areas, but the decolonisation of the 1960s put an end to this proposal.\nMosley was a pioneer in the emergence of Holocaust-denial. While not denying the existence of Nazi concentration camps, he claimed that they were a necessity to hold \"a considerable disaffected population\", where problems were caused by lack of supplies due to \"incessant bombing\" by the Allies, with bodies burned in gas chambers due to typhus outbreaks, rather than being created by the Nazis to exterminate people. He sought to discredit pictures taken in places like Buchenwald and Belsen. He also claimed that the Holocaust was to be blamed on the Jews and that Adolf Hitler knew nothing about it. He criticised the Nuremberg trials as \"a zoo and a peep show\".\nIn the wake of the 1958 Notting Hill race riots, Mosley briefly returned to Britain to stand in the 1959 general election at Kensington North. He led his campaign stridently on an anti-immigration platform, calling for forced repatriation of Caribbean immigrants as well as a prohibition upon mixed marriages. Mosley's final share of the vote, within the Kensington North constituency, was just 8.1%. Shortly after his failed election campaign, Mosley permanently moved to Orsay, outside Paris.\nIn 1961, he took part in a debate at University College London about Commonwealth immigration, seconded by a young David Irving. He returned to politics one last time, contesting the 1966 general election at Shoreditch and Finsbury, and received 4.6% of the vote. After this, he retired and moved back to France, where he wrote his autobiography, \"My Life\" (1968). In 1968, he remarked in a letter to \"The Times\", \"I am not, and never have been, a man of the right. My position was on the left and is now in the centre of politics.\"\nIn 1977, Mosley was nominated as a candidate for Rector of the University of Glasgow. He polled over 100 votes and finished last.\nMosley's political thought is believed to have influenced some early proponents of the organic farming movement in Great Britain. The agricultural writer and ruralist Henry Williamson put the theories of \"blood and soil\" into practice, which, in effect, acted as a demonstration farm for Mosley's ideas for the BUF. In \"The Story of a Norfolk Farm\" (1941) Williamson recounts the physical and philosophical journey he undertook in turning the farm's worn-out soil back into fertile land. The tone contained in this text is more politically overt than in his nature works. Throughout the book, Williamson makes references to regular meetings he had held with his \"Leader\" (Mosley) and a group of like-minded agrarian thinkers. Lady Eve Balfour, a founder of the Soil Association, supported Mosley's proposals to abolish Church of England tithes on agricultural land (Mosley's blackshirts \"protected\" a number of East Anglian farms in the 1930s from the bailiffs authorised to extract payments to the Church). Jorian Jenks, another early member of the Soil Association, was active within the Blackshirts and served as Mosley's agricultural adviser.\nPersonal life.\nMosley had three children with his first wife Lady Cynthia Curzon.\nIn 1924, Lady Cynthia joined the Labour Party, and was elected as the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent in the 1929 United Kingdom general election. She later joined Oswald's New Party and lost the 1931 election in Stoke. She died in 1933 at 34 after an operation for peritonitis following acute appendicitis, in London.\nHabitually unfaithful, Mosley would have affairs with friends of his wife as well as Alexandra and Irene Curzon, two of Cynthia's sisters, and with their step-mother Grace Duggan. Others included the actresses Maxine Elliott, Catherine d'Erlanger, Margaret Montagu, Paula Gellibrand, Mary Taviner, Georgia Sitwell, the wife of the writer Sacheverell Sitwell, and the socialite Sylvia Ashley.\nMosley had two children with his second wife, Diana Mitford (1910\u20132003):\nSince 2022 Mosley's grandson, Louis Mosley, has been head of the UK division of US tech firm Palantir Technologies.\nDeath and funeral.\nMosley died on 3 December 1980 at Orsay. His body was cremated in a ceremony held at the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, and his ashes were scattered on the pond at Orsay. His son Alexander stated that they had received many messages of condolence but no abusive words. \"All that was a very long time ago,\" he said."}

Anielewicz inspired further rebellions in both ghettos and extermination camps with his leadership. His character was engraved as a symbol of courage and sacrifice, and was a major figure of Jewish resistance during the Holocaust.\nBiography.\nMordechai () Anielewicz was born to a Polish-Jewish family of Abraham (Avraham) and Cyryl (Cirel) n\u00e9e Zaltman, in the town of Wyszk\u00f3w near Warsaw where they met during the reconstitution of sovereign Poland. Shortly after Mordechai's birth, his family moved to Warsaw. Mordechai had a brother and two sisters: Pinchas, Hava and Frida. He finished Tarbut elementary with Hebrew instructions in 1933, at the age of 14. Mordechai was a member of the Betar youth movement from 1933 until 1935. He completed the private Jewish Laor Gimnazjum (also La Or, approved by the Ministry of Education). He later switched over to the left-leaning Hashomer Hatzair. At the age of 18 he went to a pre-military Polish training camp.\nFleeing Occupied Poland.\nOn 7 September 1939, a week after the German invasion of Poland, Anielewicz traveled with a group from Warsaw to the east of the country in the hopes that the Polish Army would slow down the German advance. When the Soviet Red Army invaded and then occupied Eastern Poland in accordance with the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Anielewicz heard that Jewish refugees, other youth movement members and political groups had flocked to Wilno, which was then under Soviet control.\nAnielewicz travelled to Wilno and attempted to convince his colleagues to send people back to other Polish occupied territories to continue the fight against the Germans. He then attempted to cross the Romanian border to open a route for young Jews to get to the Mandate of Palestine, but was caught and thrown into the Soviet jail. He was released a short time later and returned to Warsaw in January 1940 with his girlfriend, Mira Fuchrer. While there Anielewicz saw his father for the last time, who was pressed into forced labor.\nInitial resistance.\nAfter returning to Warsaw, Anielewicz organized groups, meetings, seminars, secretly attended resistance groups in other cities, and founded the underground newspaper \"Neged ha-zerem\" (, literally \"Counter-current\"). At the beginning of April 1940, the construction of the Warsaw Ghetto began. It stretched over an area of 3.4\u00a0km2, and gradually a 3 m high wall with barbed wire was built around it. In mid-October, it was officially established, and by mid-November, the Germans had driven the Jews from the rest of Warsaw and its surroundings. An estimated 400,000 Jews, representing about 30% of the city's population, were pushed into an area which took up approximately 2.4% of the city's area. On top of extreme overcrowding, inadequate food supply and disease caused tens of thousands of deaths before deportation even began. In October 1941, the German occupation administration in Poland issued a decree that every Jew, captured outside the ghetto without a valid permit, would be executed.\nAfter the first reports of the mass murder of the Jews spread at the end of 1941, Anielewicz began immediately to organize defensive Jewish groups in the Warsaw Ghetto. His first attempt to join the Polish resistance, subject to the Polish exile government in London, ended in failure. In March 1942, Anielewicz was among the founders of the anti-fascist group. Even it did not have a long duration and eventually, it was dissolved.\nIn the summer of 1942, he visited the southwest region of Poland\u00a0\u2013 annexed to Germany\u00a0\u2013 attempting to organize armed resistance. At the same time, German authorities launched an operation which aimed at the liquidation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto into extermination camps. It was announced that 6,000 Jews were to be dispatched each day, irrespective of gender or age, to leave for labor camps to the east in the resettlement program. The first one set off on 22 July 1942, the eve of the Jewish holiday of Tisha B'Av, which is the saddest day of Jewish history. By 12 September 1942, German authorities from the Warsaw Ghetto deported 300,000 Jews. A total of 265,000 of them went to Treblinka where they were murdered. More than 10,000 Jews were murdered by the Germans during deportations and 11,850 Jews were sent by authorities to forced labor camps. After the first wave of deportations in mid-September 1942, roughly 55 to 60 thousand Jews remained in the ghetto.\nWarsaw Ghetto uprising.\nIn October 1942, the Jewish resistance managed to establish contact with the Polish Home Army, which was able to smuggle a small number of weapons and explosives into the ghetto. Since the end of September 1942, the Jews started building fortified bunkers and shelters in the Warsaw Ghetto, and there were 600 by January 1943. Each fighter had a gun and several hand grenades (many of them home-made) or Molotov cocktails. There was however a lack of ammunition and heavier weapons\u00a0\u2013 only a few rifles, ground mines, and one machine gun were available.\nOn 18 January 1943, the Germans resumed deportation. Anielewicz, together with other members of \u017bOB and \u017bZW, decided to act. They were armed with five revolvers, five grenades, Molotov cocktails, crowbars and clubs.Twelve of them joined a group of evacuated Jews and attacked the German soldiers on the contracted signal. The fighters joined the line of hundreds of prisoners concentrated on Mila Street. As they reached the corner of Zamenhof and Niska, they attacked, each member of the unit targeting a German soldier. In the subsequent confusion, part of the deported Jews managed to escape. Most of the resistance in the attack died. Towards the end Anielewicz, surrounded by several gendarmes, was saved by Yitzhak Suknik throwing two grenades at the SS officers who were pursuing him, one grenade killing two Germans whilst the others ran away, allowing Anielewicz to escape. This first case of armed resistance was of great importance. Among other things, it led to the greater willingness of the Polish underground to provide weapons to the Jewish resistance. Not all weapons, however, came from underground groups. Some of them \u017bOB bought from arms dealers. The beginning of the revolt was a prelude to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising that began on 19 April. During these three months, Anielewicz's leadership underwent intensive preparations for the further clashes with the Germans. He decided to use the guerrilla way of fighting with a vast network of tunnels, bunkers, roofs and surprise moments. He believed that enough Jews could withstand the ghetto for months. A day after the Germans suspended deportations, he wrote an open letter to the people of the ghetto under the name of the Jewish Battle Organization:\nTo the Jewish Masses in the Ghetto &lt;br&gt;On January 22, 1943, six months will have passed since the deportations from Warsaw began. We all remember well the days of terror during which 300,000 of our brothers and sisters were cruelly put to death in the death camp of Treblinka. Six months have passed of life in constant fear of death, not knowing what the next day may bring. We have received information from all sides about the destruction of the Jews in the Government-General, in Germany, in the occupied territories. When we listen to this bitter news we wait for our own hour to come, every day and every moment. Today we must understand that the Nazi murderers have let us live only because they want to make use of our capacity to work to our last drop of blood and sweat, to our last breath. We are slaves, and when slaves are no longer profitable, they are killed. Everyone among us must understand that, and everyone among us must remember it always.\nThe final destruction of the ghetto and deportation of the remaining Jews began on 19 April, at 6\u00a0am, the day before Adolf Hitler's birthday and Passover. SS functionary Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg sent 850 soldiers (German and Ukrainian) to Warsaw with sixteen officers who accompanied a light tank and two armored cars. Members of Jewish resistance groups attacked groups of German soldiers with pistols, grenades, and Molotov cocktails from roofs, balconies, windows, doors and adjoining courtyards. Although the Germans had military superiority, they were not prepared whatsoever for the guerrilla way of fighting they had encountered. On the contrary, Jews had a perfect knowledge of the environment, relied on a number of hiding places, and were difficult to target because of the interconnection of individual houses. After two hours of intense fighting, the Germans withdrew. \nAt 11:00 the next morning, soldiers under the command of SS General J\u00fcrgen Stroop entered the ghetto, where again they encountered hard resistance from approximately 750 Jewish defenders. Stroop set up artillery and sent soldiers to look for the hiding Jews. In the afternoon of the same day, there was a symbolic event where two Jewish boys climbed to the roof of one of the houses where they put Polish and Jewish flags. Both of them were in the eye of not only to Stroop, but also Himmler. On the evening of the first day, Stroop withdrew his men.\nDuring the following days, the Germans broke the tough resistance with the use of artillery and flame throwers. The smoke and heat from the fire forced a number of Jews to leave their shelters, and some chose to commit suicide by jumping from the windows of burning houses, or they escaped through the sewage lines that were still connected to the Gentile part of the city after the construction of the ghetto. On the third day of the collision, Stroop changed tactics and tried to avoid direct confrontation to reduce the number of German losses. After over four days of fighting, the Jewish headquarters in Muran\u00f3w fell. Most of the defenders were dead or wounded, and many escaped outside the ghetto.\nOn 23 April, a bunker was built under the house on Mi\u0142a Street. Until 25 April, the Germans captured 25,500 Jews. At the end of the month, many bunkers and hiding places were exposed and most homes were burned to the ground. On 7 May, a group led by Zivia Lubetkin set out from the Command Bunkhouse under the Mi\u0142a Street through a complex sewer system to find an escape route from the ghetto. The same day, however, the bunker was discovered by the Germans\u00a0\u2013 at that time, there were two hundred people, including Anielewicz and his girlfriend. On 7 May Stroop reported the discovery of the bunker of inner 'party leadership' to Kr\u00fcger, and the following day, he reported to the high command that Nazi forces had breached the bunker and the \"deputy head of the Jewish military organization ZWZ\" (presumably Anielewicz) had successfully been \"captured and liquidated\". With no surviving eyewitnesses to confirm Stroop's claims, the fate of Anielewicz is unknown; it is assumed that he died on 8 May 1943, alongside his girlfriend and advisors, at the surrounded \u017bOB command post at 18 Mi\u0142a Street. His body was never found and it is believed that it was buried in the ruins of the bunker (covered by the debris of Mila Street) \u2013 a site memorialized today as a gravesite \u2013 or carried off to nearby crematoria among the dead. The Germans had fired into the fortified headquarters with gas hoses to expel the hiding Jewish fighters to the surface. Countless had fought to their last breaths amid pure chaos, many succumbing to poison gas or taking their own lives to avoid capture. From the bunker, only a handful of them managed to penetrate the sewer network.\nSeveral days before the final suppression of the rebellion and shortly after the destruction of the Command Bunker, a rescue operation was carried out, during which about eighty Jewish fighters were transferred to a so-called Aryan section of the city and taken to safety. The event was organized by Yitzhak Zuckerman and Simcha Rotem. Although the Germans planned to destroy the ghetto within three days, the struggles lasted for four weeks and they didn't suppress them definitively until 16 May 1943, when Operation Commander J\u00fcrgen Stroop symbolically ended the explosion of the Great Synagogue in Warsaw. Yet, after many months, the remaining surviving Jews were attacking German patrols. Most of those who managed to escape from the ghetto became guerrillas but were often shot or committed suicide to avoid capture. Many of them later fought alongside the Poles during the Warsaw uprising in 1944. According to an official German report, written by Stroop, the German army captured 57,065 Jews and destroyed 631 bunkers. He estimated that 7,000 Jews died during the rebellion, and another 7,000 German authorities deported to Treblinka. The remaining Jews, around 42,000, were deported to Majdanek, Poniatowa, Trawniki, Budzy\u0144, and Kra\u015bnik camps. With the exception of several thousand prisoners in the Budzy\u0144 and Krasnik camps, the remaining Warsaw Jews from other camps were murdered in November 1943, during Aktion Erntefest.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He ruled the Papal States from June 1800 to 17 May 1809 and again from 1814 to his death. Chiaramonti was also a monk of the Order of Saint Benedict in addition to being a well-known theologian and bishop.\nChiaramonti was made Bishop of Tivoli in 1782, and resigned that position upon his appointment as Bishop of Imola in 1785. That same year, he was made a cardinal. In 1789, the French Revolution took place, and as a result a series of anti-clerical governments came into power in the country. In 1798, during the French Revolutionary Wars, French troops under Louis-Alexandre Berthier invaded Rome and captured Pope Pius VI, taking him as a prisoner to France, where he died in 1799. The following year, after a \"sede vacante\" period lasting approximately six months, Chiaramonti was elected to the papacy, taking the name Pius VII.\nPius at first attempted to take a cautious approach in dealing with Napoleon. With him he signed the Concordat of 1801, through which he succeeded in guaranteeing religious freedom for Catholics living in France, and was present at his coronation as Emperor of the French in 1804. In 1809, however, during the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon once again invaded the Papal States, resulting in his excommunication through the papal bull \"Quum memoranda\". Pius VII was taken prisoner and transported to France. He remained there until 1814 when, after the French were defeated, he was permitted to return to Italy, where he was greeted warmly as a hero and defender of the faith.\nPius lived the remainder of his life in relative peace. His papacy saw a significant growth of the Catholic Church in the United States, where Pius established several new dioceses. Pius VII died in 1823 at age 81.\nIn 2007, Pope Benedict XVI began the process towards canonizing him as a saint, and he was granted the title Servant of God.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBarnaba Niccol\u00f2 Maria Luigi Chiaramonti was born in Cesena in 1742, the youngest son of Count Scipione Chiaramonti (30 April 1698 \u2013 13 September 1750). His mother, Giovanna Coronata (? - 22 November 1777), was the daughter of the Marquess Ghini. Though his family was of noble status, they were not wealthy but rather, were of middle-class stock.\nBarnaba attended the Collegio dei Nobili in Ravenna but decided to join the Order of Saint Benedict at the age of 14 on 2 October 1756 as a novice at the Abbey of Santa Maria del Monte in Cesena. Two years after this on 20 August 1758, he became a professed member and assumed the name of \"Gregorio\". He taught at Benedictine colleges in Parma and Rome, and was ordained a priest on 21 September 1765.\nEpiscopate and cardinalate.\nA series of promotions resulted after his relative, Giovanni Angelo Braschi, was elected Pope Pius VI (1775\u201399). A few years before this election occurred, in 1773, Chiaramonti became the personal confessor to Braschi. In 1776, Pius VI appointed the 34-year-old Dom Gregory, who had been teaching at the Monastery of Sant'Anselmo in Rome, as honorary abbot \"in commendam\" of his monastery. Although this was an ancient practice, it drew complaints from the monks of the community, as monastic communities generally felt it was not in keeping with the Rule of St. Benedict. He served as librarian at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.\nIn December 1782, the pope appointed Dom Gregory as the Bishop of Tivoli, near Rome. Pius VI soon named him, in February 1785, the Cardinal-Priest of San Callisto, and as the Bishop of Imola, an office he held until 1816.\nWhen the French Revolutionary Army invaded Italy in 1797, Cardinal Chiaramonti counseled temperance and submission to the newly created Cisalpine Republic. In a letter that he addressed to the people of his diocese, Chiaramonti asked them to comply \"...\u00a0in the current circumstances of change of government (...)\" to the authority of the victorious general Commander-in-Chief of the French army. In his Christmas homily that year, he asserted that there was no opposition between a democratic form of government and being a good Catholic: \"Christian virtue makes men good democrats... Equality is not an idea of philosophers but of Christ...and do not believe that the Catholic religion is against democracy.\"\nPapacy.\nElection.\nFollowing the death of Pope Pius VI, by then virtually France's prisoner, at Valence in 1799, the conclave to elect his successor met on 30 November 1799 in the Benedictine San Giorgio Monastery in Venice. There were three main candidates, two of whom proved to be unacceptable to the Habsburgs, whose candidate, Alessandro Mattei, could not secure sufficient votes. However, Carlo Bellisomi also was a candidate, though not favoured by Austrian cardinals; a \"virtual veto\" was imposed against him in the name of Francis II and carried out by Cardinal Franziskus Herzan von Harras.\nAfter several months of stalemate, Ercole Consalvi proposed Chiaramonti as a compromise candidate. On 14 March 1800, Chiaramonti was elected pope, certainly not the choice of die-hard opponents of the French Revolution, and took as his pontifical name Pius VII in honour of his immediate predecessor. He was crowned on 21 March\u2014in the adjacent monastery church as Emperor Francis II was not pleased by the choice of the cardinal electors and did not allow them to use San Marco Basilica for the ceremony\u2014by means of a rather unusual ceremony, wearing a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 papal tiara\u2014the French had seized the tiaras held by the Holy See when occupying Rome and forcing Pius VI into exile. The new pope then left for Rome, sailing on a barely seaworthy Austrian ship, the \"Bellona\", which lacked even a galley. The twelve-day voyage ended at Pesaro and he proceeded to Rome.\nConcordat of 1801.\nOne of Pius VII's first acts was appointing the minor cleric Ercole Consalvi, who had performed so ably as secretary to the recent conclave, to the College of Cardinals and to the office of Cardinal Secretary of State. Consalvi immediately left for France, where he was able to negotiate the Concordat of 1801 with the First Consul Napoleon. While not effecting a return to the old Christian order, the treaty did provide certain civil guarantees to the Church, acknowledging \"the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion\" as that of the \"majority of French citizens\".\nThe main terms of the concordat between France and the pope included:\nAs pope, he followed a policy of cooperation with the French Republic and subsequently Empire. He was present at the coronation of Napoleon in 1804.\nExile.\nDue to a reluctance to align the Papal States with the Continental System, France occupied and annexed the Papal States in 1809 and exiled Pius VII to Savona. On 15 November 1809 Pius VII consecrated the church at La Voglina, Valenza, Piedmont with the intention of the Villa La Voglina becoming his spiritual base whilst in exile. His residency was short lived once Napoleon became aware of his intentions of establishing a permanent base and he was soon exiled to France. Despite this, the pope continued to refer to Napoleon as \"my dear son\" but added that he was \"a somewhat stubborn son, but a son still\".\nThis exile ended only when Pius VII signed the Concordat of Fontainebleau in 1813. One result of this new treaty was the release of the exiled cardinals, including Consalvi, who, upon re-joining the papal retinue, persuaded Pius VII to revoke the concessions he had made in it. This Pius VII began to do in March 1814, which led the French authorities to re-arrest many of the opposing prelates. Their confinement, however, lasted only a matter of weeks, as Napoleon abdicated on 11 April of that year. As soon as Pius VII returned to Rome, he immediately revived the Inquisition and the \"Index of Condemned Books\".\nCardinal Bartolomeo Pacca, who was kidnapped along with Pope Pius VII, took the office of Pro-Secretary of State in 1808 and maintained his memoirs during his exile. His memoirs, written originally in Italian, have been translated into English (two volumes) and describe the ups and down of their exile and the triumphant return to Rome in 1814.\nPius VII's imprisonment did in fact come with one bright side for him. It gave him an aura that recognized him as a living martyr, so that when he arrived back in Rome in May 1814, he was greeted most warmly by the Italians as a hero.\nRelationship with Napoleon I.\nFrom the time of his election as pope to the fall of Napoleon in 1815, Pius VII's reign was completely taken up in dealing with France.\nHe and the Emperor were continually in conflict, often involving the French military leader's wishes for concessions to his demands. Pius VII wanted his own release from exile as well as the return of the Papal States, and, later on, the release of the 13 \"Black Cardinals\", i.e., the cardinals, including Consalvi, who had snubbed the marriage of Napoleon to Marie Louise, believing that his previous marriage was still valid, and had been exiled and impoverished in consequence of their stand, along with several exiled or imprisoned prelates, priests, monks, nuns and other various supporters.\nRestoration of the Jesuits.\nOn 7 March 1801, Pius VII issued the brief \"Catholicae fidei\" that approved the existence of the Society of Jesus in the Russian Empire and appointed its first superior general as Franciszek Kareu. This was the first step in the restoration of the order. On 31 July 1814, he signed the papal bull \"Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum\" which universally restored the Society of Jesus to its previous provinces, and the Jesuits began to resume their work in those countries. He appointed Tadeusz Brzozowski as the Superior General of the order.\nOpposition to slavery.\nPius VII joined the declaration of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, represented by Cardinal Secretary of State Ercole Consalvi, and urged the suppression of the Atlantic slave trade. This pertained particularly to places such as Spain and Portugal where slavery was economically very important. The pope wrote a letter to King Louis XVIII of France dated 20 September 1814 and to King John VI of Portugal in 1823 to urge the end of slavery. He condemned the slave trade and defined the sale of people as an injustice to the dignity of the human person. In his letter to the king of Portugal, he wrote: \"the pope regrets that this trade in blacks, that he believed having ceased, is still exercised in some regions and even more cruel way. He begs and begs the King of Portugal that it implement all its authority and wisdom to extirpate this unholy and abominable shame.\"\nReinstitution of Jewish Ghetto.\nUnder Napoleonic rule, the Jewish Roman Ghetto had been abolished and Jews were free to live and move where they would. Following the restoration of Papal rule, Pius VII re-instituted the confinement of Jews to the Ghetto, having the doors closed at nighttime.\nOther activities.\nPius VII issued an encyclical \"Diu satis\" in order to advocate a return to the values of the Gospel and universalized the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows for 15 September. He condemned Freemasonry and the movement of the Carbonari in the papal bull \"Ecclesiam a Jesu Christo\" in 1821. Pius VII asserted that Freemasons must be excommunicated and it linked them with the Carbonari, an anti-clerical revolutionary group in Italy. All members of the Carbonari were also excommunicated.\nHis concerns about the work of non-Catholic bible societies were acknowledged by Pope Gregory XVI in the latter's 1844 encyclical letter \"Inter Praecipuas\".\nPius VII was multilingual and had the ability to speak Italian, French, English and Latin.\nCultural innovations.\nPius VII was a man of culture and attempted to reinvigorate Rome with archaeological excavations in Ostia which revealed ruins and icons from ancient times. He also had walls and other buildings rebuilt and restored the Arch of Titus. He ordered the construction of fountains and piazzas and erected the obelisk on the Pincian Hill.\nThe pope also made sure Rome was a place for artists and the leading artists of the time like Antonio Canova and Peter von Cornelius. He also enriched the Vatican Library with numerous manuscripts and books. It was Pius VII who adopted the yellow and white flag of the Holy See as a response to the Napoleonic invasion of 1809.\nCanonizations and beatifications.\nThroughout his pontificate, Pius VII canonized a total of five saints. On 24 May 1807, Pius VII canonized Angela Merici, Benedict the Moor, Colette Boylet, Francis Caracciolo and Hyacintha Mariscotti. He beatified a total of 27 individuals including Joseph Oriol, Berardo dei Marsi, Giuseppe Maria Tomasi and Crispin of Viterbo.\nConsistories.\nPius VII created 99 cardinals in nineteen consistories including notable ecclesial figures of that time such as Ercole Consalvi, Bartolomeo Pacca, and Carlo Odescalchi. The Pope also named his two immediate successors as cardinals: Annibale della Genga and Francesco Saverio Castiglioni (the latter of whom it is said Pius VII and his successor would refer to as \"Pius VIII\").\nIn addition, Pius VII named 12 cardinals whom he reserved \"in pectore\". One died before his nomination could ever be published (he was originally nominated in the 1804 consistory), Marino Carafa di Belvedere resigned his cardinalate on 24 August 1807 upon citing a lack of family descendance, and Carlo Odescalchi resigned the cardinalate on 21 November 1838 to enter the Society of Jesus.\nIn 1801, according to Remigius Ritzler, Pius VII nominated Paolo Luigi Silva as a cardinal \"in pectore\", however, he died before his name could be published. As a result, Pius VII added the Archbishop of Palermo Domenico Pignatelli di Belmonte in his place. In the March 1816 consistory, the former bishop of Saint-Malo Gabriel Cortois de Pressigny was among the cardinals created \"in pectore\" in the consistory, though he declined the promotion. Similarly, Giovanni Alliata declined the pope's offer for elevation in the same consistory. According to Niccol\u00f2 del Re, the Vice-Camerlengo Tiberio Pacca would have been created a cardinal either in the March 1823 consistory, or a future one held by the pope. However, he suggests that a series of controversies beginning in 1820 prevented the pope from naming him to the Sacred College.\nThe possible miracle of Pius VII.\nOn 15 August 1811 - the Feast of the Assumption - it is recorded that the pope celebrated Mass and was said to have entered a trance and began to levitate in a manner that drew him to the altar. This particular episode aroused great wonder and awe among attendants which included the French soldiers guarding him who were in disbelief of what had occurred.\nRelationship with the United States.\nOn the United States' undertaking of the First Barbary War to suppress the Muslim Barbary pirates along the southern Mediterranean coast, ending their kidnapping of Europeans for ransom and slavery, Pius VII declared that the United States \"had done more for the cause of Christianity than the most powerful nations of Christendom have done for ages.\"\nFor the United States, he established several new dioceses in 1808 for Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Bardstown. In 1821, he also established the dioceses of Charleston, Richmond and Cincinnati.\nCondemnation of heresy.\nOn 3 June 1816, Pius VII condemned the works of Melkite bishop Germanos Adam. Adam's writings supported conciliarism, the view that the authority of ecumenical councils was greater than that of the papacy.\nDeath and burial.\nIn 1822, Pius VII reached his 80th birthday and his health was visibly declining. On 6 July 1823, he fractured his hip in a fall in the papal apartments and was bedridden from that point onward. In his final weeks he would often lose consciousness and would mutter the names of the cities that he had been ferried away to by the French forces. With the Cardinal Secretary of State Ercole Consalvi at his side, Pius VII died on 20 August at 5 a.m.\nHe was briefly interred in the Vatican Grottoes but was later buried in a monument in St. Peter's Basilica after his funeral on 25 August.\nBeatification process.\nAn application to commence beatification proceedings were lodged to the Holy See on 10 July 2006 and received the approval of Cardinal Camillo Ruini (the Vicar of Rome) who transferred the request to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The Congregation - on 24 February 2007 - approved the opening of the cause responding to the call of the Ligurian bishops.\nOn 15 August 2007, the Holy See contacted the diocese of Savona-Noli with the news that Pope Benedict XVI had declared \"nihil obstat\" (nothing stands against) the cause of beatification of the late pontiff, thus opening the diocesan process for this pope's beatification. He now has the title of Servant of God. The official text declaring the opening of the cause was: \"Summus Pontifex Benedictus XVI declarat, ex parte Sanctae Sedis, nihil obstare quominus in Causa Beatificationis et Canonizationis Servi Dei Pii Barnabae Gregorii VII Chiaramonti\". Work on the cause commenced the following month in gathering documentation on the late pope.\nHe has since been elected as the patron of the Diocese of Savona and the patron of prisoners.\nIn late 2018 the Bishop of Savona announced that the cause for Pius VII would continue following the completion of initial preparation and investigation. The bishop named a new postulator and a diocesan tribunal which would begin work into the cause. The formal introduction to the cause (a diocesan investigation into the late pontiff's life) was held at a Mass celebrated in the Savona diocese on 31 October 2021.\nThe first postulator for the cause was Father Giovanni Farris (2007\u201318) and the current postulator since 2018 is Fr. Giovanni Margara.\nMonuments.\nPope Pius VII's monument (1831) in St. Peter's Basilica, adorning his tomb, was created by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "69259", "revid": "160367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69259", "title": "In Flanders Fields", "text": "First World War poem by John McCrae\n\"In Flanders Fields\" is a war poem in the form of a rondeau, written during the First World War by Canadian physician Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae. He was inspired to write it on May 3, 1915, after presiding over the funeral of friend and fellow soldier Lieutenant Alexis Helmer, who died in the Second Battle of Ypres. According to legend, fellow soldiers retrieved the poem after McCrae, initially dissatisfied with his work, discarded it. \"In Flanders Fields\" was first published on December 8 of that year in the London magazine \"Punch\". Flanders Fields is a common English name of the World War I battlefields in Belgium and France.\nIt is one of the most quoted poems from the war. As a result of its immediate popularity, parts of the poem were used in efforts and appeals to recruit soldiers and raise money selling war bonds. Its references to the red poppies that grew over the graves of fallen soldiers resulted in the remembrance poppy becoming one of the world's most recognized memorial symbols for soldiers who have died in conflict. The poem and poppy are prominent Remembrance Day symbols throughout the Commonwealth of Nations, particularly in Canada, where \"In Flanders Fields\" is one of the nation's best-known literary works. The poem is also widely known in the United States, where it is associated with Veterans Day and Memorial Day.\nBackground.\nJohn McCrae was a poet and physician from Guelph, Ontario. He developed an interest in poetry at a young age and wrote throughout his life. His earliest works were published in the mid-1890s in Canadian magazines and newspapers. McCrae's poetry often focused on death and the peace that followed.\nAt the age of 41, McCrae enrolled with the Canadian Expeditionary Force following the outbreak of the First World War. He had the option of joining the medical corps because of his training and age but he volunteered instead to join a fighting unit as a gunner and medical officer. It was his second tour of duty in the Canadian military; he had previously fought with a volunteer force in the Second Boer War. He considered himself a soldier first; his father was a military leader in Guelph and McCrae grew up believing in the duty of fighting for his country and empire.\nMcCrae fought in the Second Battle of Ypres in the Flanders region of Belgium, where the German army launched one of the first chemical attacks in the history of war. They attacked French positions north of the Canadians with chlorine gas on April 22, 1915, but were unable to break through the Canadian line, which held for over two weeks. In a letter written to his mother, McCrae described the battle as a \"nightmare\",\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For seventeen days and seventeen nights none of us have had our clothes off, nor our boots even, except occasionally. In all that time while I was awake, gunfire and rifle fire never ceased for sixty seconds\u00a0... And behind it all was the constant background of the sights of the dead, the wounded, the maimed, and a terrible anxiety lest the line should give way.\u2014\u200a\nAlexis Helmer, a close friend, was killed during the battle on May 2. McCrae performed the burial service himself, where he noticed how poppies quickly grew around the graves of those who died at Ypres. The next day, he composed the poem while sitting in the back of an ambulance at an Advanced Dressing Station outside Ypres. This place has since become known as the John McCrae Memorial Site.\nPoem.\n\"In Flanders Fields and Other Poems\", a 1919 collection of McCrae's works, contains two versions of the poem:\na as below and a where the first line ends with \"grow\" instead of \"blow\", as discussed under \"Publication\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs with his earlier poems, \"In Flanders Fields\" continues McCrae's preoccupation with death and how it stands as the transition between the struggle of life and the peace that follows. It is written from the point of view of the dead. It speaks of their sacrifice and serves as their command to the living to press on. As with many of the most popular works of the First World War, it was written early in the conflict, before the romanticism of war turned to bitterness and disillusion for soldiers and civilians alike.\nAn article by Veteran's Administration Canada provides this account of the writing of \"In Flanders Fields\":The day before he wrote his famous poem, one of McCrae's closest friends was killed in the fighting and buried in a makeshift grave with a simple wooden cross. Wild poppies were already beginning to bloom between the crosses marking the many graves. Unable to help his friend or any of the others who had died, John McCrae gave them a voice through his poem. It was the second last poem he was to write.\nPublication.\nCyril Allinson was a sergeant major in McCrae's unit. While delivering the brigade's mail, he watched McCrae as he worked on the poem, noting that McCrae's eyes periodically returned to Helmer's grave as he wrote. When handed the notepad, Allinson read the poem and was so moved he immediately committed it to memory. He described it as being \"almost an exact description of the scene in front of us both\". According to legend, McCrae was not satisfied with his work. It is said he crumpled the paper and threw it away. It was retrieved by a fellow member of his unit, either Edward Morrison or J. M. Elder, or Allinson. McCrae was convinced to submit the poem for publication. An early copy of the poem is found in the diary of Clare Gass, who was serving with McCrae as a battlefield nurse, in an entry dated October 30, 1915\u2014nearly six weeks before the poem's first publication in the magazine \"Punch\" on December 8, 1915.\nAnother story of the poem's origin claimed that Helmer's funeral was held on the morning of May 2, after which McCrae wrote the poem in 20 minutes. A third claim, by Morrison, was that McCrae worked on the poem as time allowed between arrivals of wounded soldiers in need of medical attention. Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on the poem for months before considering it ready for publication. He submitted it to \"The Spectator\" in London but it was rejected. It was then sent to \"Punch\", where it was published on December 8, 1915. It was published anonymously, but \"Punch\" attributed the poem to McCrae in its year-end index.\nThe word that ends the first line of the poem has been disputed. According to Allinson, the poem began with \"In Flanders Fields the poppies grow\" when first written. McCrae ended the second-to-last line with \"grow\", \"Punch\" received permission to change the wording of the opening line to end with \"blow\". McCrae used either word when making handwritten copies for friends and family. Questions over how the first line should end have endured since publication. Most recently, the Bank of Canada was inundated with queries and complaints from those who believed the first line should end with \"grow\", when a design for the ten-dollar bill was released in 2001, with the first stanza of \"In Flanders Fields\", ending the first line with \"blow\".\nPopularity.\nAccording to historian Paul Fussell, \"In Flanders Fields\" was the most popular poem of its era. McCrae received numerous letters and telegrams praising his work when he was revealed as the author. The poem was republished throughout the world, rapidly becoming synonymous with the sacrifice of the soldiers who died in the First World War. It was translated into so many languages that McCrae himself quipped \"it needs only Chinese now, surely\". Its appeal was nearly universal. Soldiers took encouragement from it as a statement of their duty to those who died while people on the home front viewed it as defining the cause for which their brothers and sons were fighting.\nIt was often used for propaganda, particularly in Canada by the Unionist Party during the 1917 federal election amidst the Conscription Crisis. French Canadians in Quebec were strongly opposed to the possibility of conscription but English Canadians voted overwhelmingly to support Prime Minister Robert Borden and the Unionist government. \"In Flanders Fields\" was said to have done more to \"make this Dominion persevere in the duty of fighting for the world's ultimate peace than all the political speeches of the recent campaign\". McCrae, a staunch supporter of the empire and the war effort, was pleased with the effect his poem had on the election. He stated in a letter: \"I hope I stabbed a [French] Canadian with my vote\".\nThe poem was a popular motivational tool in Great Britain, where it was used to encourage soldiers fighting against Germany, and in the United States where it was reprinted across the country. It was one of the most quoted works during the war, used in many places as part of campaigns to sell war bonds, during recruiting efforts and to criticize pacifists and those who sought to profit from the war. At least 55 composers in the United States set the poem \"In Flanders Fields\" to music by 1920, including Charles Ives, Arthur Foote, and John Philip Sousa. The setting by Ives, which premiered in early 1917, is perhaps the earliest American setting. Fussell criticized the poem in his work \"The Great War and Modern Memory\" (1975). He noted the distinction between the pastoral tone of the first nine lines and the \"recruiting-poster rhetoric\" of the third stanza. Describing it as \"vicious\" and \"stupid\", Fussell called the final lines a \"propaganda argument against a negotiated peace\".\nLegacy.\nMcCrae was moved to the medical corps and stationed in Boulogne, France, in June 1915 where he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and placed in charge of medicine at the Number 3 Canadian General Hospital. He was promoted to the acting rank of colonel on January 13, 1918, and named Consulting Physician to the British Armies in France. The years of war had worn McCrae down; he contracted pneumonia that day and later came down with cerebral meningitis. On January 28, 1918, he died at the military hospital in Wimereux and was buried there with full military honours. A book of his works, featuring \"In Flanders Fields\", was published the following year.\n\"In Flanders Fields\" is very popular in Canada, where it is a staple of Remembrance Day ceremonies and may be the best-known literary piece among English Canadians. It has an official French adaptation, entitled , written by Jean Pariseau and used by the Canadian government in French and bilingual ceremonies. With an excerpted appearance on the ten-dollar bill from 2001 to 2013, the Royal Canadian Mint has released poppy-themed quarters on several occasions. A version minted in 2004 featured a red poppy in the centre and is considered the first multi-coloured circulation coin in the world. To mark the poem's centennial in 2015, a coloured and uncoloured poppy quarter and a \"toonie\" ($2 coin) were issued as circulation coins, as well as other collector coins. Among its uses in popular culture, the lines \"to you from failing hands we throw / the torch, be yours to hold it high\" has served as a motto for the Montreal Canadiens hockey club since 1940.\nCanada Post honoured the 50th anniversary of John McCrae's death with a stamp in 1968 and marked the centennial of his famous poem in 2015. Other Canadian stamps have featured the poppy, including ones in 1975, 2001, 2009, 2013 and 2014. Other postal authorities have employed the poppy as a symbol of remembrance, including those of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom.\nMcCrae's birthplace in Guelph, Ontario has been converted into a museum dedicated to his life and the war. McCrae was named a National Historic Person in 1946, and his house was listed as a National Historic Site in 1966.\nIn Belgium, the In Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres, named after the poem and devoted to the First World War, is situated in one of Flanders' largest tourist areas. A monument commemorating the writing of the poem is located at Essex Farm Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, which is thought to have been the location of Helmer's burial and lies within the John McCrae Memorial Site.\nDespite its fame, \"In Flanders Fields\" is often ignored by academics teaching and discussing Canadian literature. The poem is sometimes viewed as an anachronism; it spoke of glory and honour in a war that has since become synonymous with the futility of trench warfare and the slaughter produced by 20th-century weaponry. Nancy Holmes, professor at the University of British Columbia, speculated that its patriotic nature and use as a tool for propaganda may have led literary critics to view it as a national symbol or anthem rather than a poem.\nRemembrance poppies.\nThe red poppies that McCrae referred to had been associated with conflict since the Napoleonic Wars when a writer of that time first noted how the poppies grew over the graves of soldiers. The damage done to the landscape in Flanders during the battle greatly increased the lime content in the surface soil, leaving the poppy as one of the few plants able to grow in the region.\nInspired by \"In Flanders Fields\", American professor Moina Michael resolved at the war's conclusion in 1918 to wear a red poppy year-round to honour the soldiers who had died in the war. She also wrote a poem in response called \"We Shall Keep the Faith\". She distributed silk poppies to her peers and campaigned to have them adopted as an official symbol of remembrance by the American Legion. Madame E. Gu\u00e9rin attended the 1920 convention where the Legion supported Michael's proposal and was inspired to sell poppies in her native France to raise money for the war's orphans. In 1921, Gu\u00e9rin sent poppy sellers to London ahead of Armistice Day, attracting the attention of Field Marshal Douglas Haig. A co-founder of The Royal British Legion, Haig supported and encouraged the sale. The practice quickly spread throughout the British Empire. The wearing of poppies in the days leading up to Remembrance Day remains popular in many areas of the Commonwealth of Nations, particularly United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa and in the days leading up to ANZAC Day in Australia and New Zealand.\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This concept is found in Judaism from Talmudic literature.\nThe word \"shekhinah\" is found in the Bible only in \"Shechaniah\", a masculine proper name. The triliteral Hebrew root \"sh-k-n\" appears in numerous conjugations; it can be found 128 times.\nIt also appears in the Mishnah, the Talmud, and Midrash.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"shekhinah\" is first encountered in the rabbinic literature.\nThe Semitic root from which \"shekhinah\" is derived, \"\u0161-k-n\", means \"to settle, inhabit, or dwell\". In the verb form, it is often used to refer to the dwelling of a person or animal in a place, or to the dwelling of God. Nouns derived from the root included \"shachen\" (\"neighbor\") and \"mishkan\" (a dwelling-place, whether a secular home or a holy site such as the Tabernacle).\nIn Judaism.\nIn classic Jewish thought, the shekhinah refers to a dwelling or settling in a special sense, a dwelling or settling of divine presence, to the effect that, while in proximity to the shekhinah, the connection to God is more readily perceivable. While \"shekhinah\" is a feminine word in Hebrew, it primarily seemed to be featured in masculine or androgynous contexts referring to a divine manifestation of the presence of God, based especially on readings of the Talmud. Contemporary interpretations of the term \"shekhinah\" commonly see it as the divine feminine principle in Judaism.\nManifestation.\nThe prophets made numerous references to visions of the presence of God, particularly in the context of the Tabernacle or Temple, with figures such as thrones or robes filling the Sanctuary.\nThe shekhinah is referred to as manifest in the Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem throughout rabbinic literature.\nIt is also reported as being present in other contexts:\nThe Talmud states that \"the Shekhinah rests on man neither through gloom, nor through sloth, nor through frivolity, nor through levity, nor through talk, nor through idle chatter, but only through a matter of joy in connection with a mitzvah.\"\nThere is no occurrence of the word \"shekhinah\" in pre-rabbinic literature such as the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is only afterwards in the targums and rabbinic literature that the Hebrew term \"shekhinah\", or Aramaic equivalent \"shekinta\", is found, and then becomes extremely common. Martin McNamara (see notes) considers that the absence might lead to the conclusion that the term only originated after the destruction of the temple in 70 CE, but notes 2 Maccabees 14:35 \"a temple for your habitation\", where the Greek text () suggests a possible parallel understanding, and where \u03c3\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \"sk\u0113n\u014dsis\" \"a tent-building\", a variation on an early loanword from Phoenician ( \"sk\u0113n\u0113\" \"tent\"), is deliberately used to represent the original Hebrew or Aramaic term.\nTargum.\nIn the Targum the addition of the noun term shekhinah paraphrases Hebrew verb phrases such as Exodus 34:9 \"let the Lord go among us\" (a verbal expression of presence) which Targum paraphrases with God's \"shekhinah\" (a noun form). In the post-temple era usage of the term shekhinah may provide a solution to the problem of God being omnipresent and thus not dwelling in any one place. In the Hebrew text of Exodus 33:20, as another example, Moses is told \"You will not be able to see my face, for no human can see Me and live.\" Once again, using of the term shekhinah provides a solution to the corporeal idiom, so Targum Onkelos reads: \"You will not be able to see the face of my shekhinah...\"\nJewish prayers.\nThe 17th blessing of the daily \"Amidah\" prayer concludes with the line \"[Blessed are You, God,] who returns His Presence (\"shekhinato\") to Zion\" (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05b7\u05bc\u05d7\u05b2\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05db\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05b8\u05ea\u05d5\u05b9 \u05dc\u05b0\u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05df\u200e).\nThe Liberal Jewish prayer-book for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (\"Machzor Ruach Chadashah\") contains a creative prayer based on Avinu Malkeinu, in which the feminine noun \"shekhinah\" is used in the interests of gender neutrality.\nRelationship to the Holy Spirit.\nThe concept of shekhinah is also associated with the concept of the Holy Spirit in Judaism (\"ruach ha-kodesh\").\nKabbalah.\nSabbath Bride.\nThe theme of the shekhinah as the Sabbath Bride recurs in the writings and songs of 16th century Kabbalist, Isaac Luria. The \"Azamer Bishvachin\" song, written in Aramaic by Luria (his name appears as an acrostic of each line) and sung at the evening meal of Shabbat is an example of this. The song appears in particular in many siddurs in the section following Friday night prayers and in some Shabbat song books:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nLet us invite the Shechinah with a newly-laid table\nand with a well-lit menorah that casts light on all heads.\nThree preceding days to the right, three succeeding days to the left,\nand amid them the Sabbath bride with adornments she goes, vessels and robes\nMay the Shechinah become a crown through the six loaves on each side\nthrough the doubled-six may our table be bound with the profound Temple services\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nA paragraph in the Zohar starts: \"One must prepare a comfortable seat with several cushions and embroidered covers, from all that is found in the house, like one who prepares a canopy for a bride. For the Shabbat is a queen and a bride. This is why the masters of the Mishna used to go out on the eve of Shabbat to receive her on the road, and used to say: \"'Come, O bride, come, O bride!' And one must sing and rejoice at the table in her honor\u00a0... one must receive the Lady with many lighted candles, many enjoyments, beautiful clothes, and a house embellished with many fine appointments\u00a0...\"\nThe tradition of the shekhinah as the Shabbat Bride, the \"Shabbat Kallah\", continues to this day.\nAs feminine aspect.\nKabbalah associates the shekhinah with the female. According to Gershom Scholem, \"The introduction of this idea was one of the most important and lasting innovations of Kabbalism. ...no other element of Kabbalism won such a degree of popular approval.\" The \"feminine Jewish divine presence, the shekhinah, distinguishes Kabbalistic literature from earlier Jewish literature.\"\n\"In the imagery of the Kabbalah the shekhinah is the most overtly female \"sefirah\", the last of the ten sefirot, referred to imaginatively as 'the daughter of God'. ... The harmonious relationship between the female shekhinah and the six sefirot which precede her causes the world itself to be sustained by the flow of divine energy. She is like the moon reflecting the divine light into the world.\"\nNativity and life of Moses.\nThe \"Zohar\", a foundation book of kabbalah, presents the shekhinah as playing an essential role in the conception and birth of Moses. Later during the Exodus on the \"third new moon\" in the desert, \"\"Shekhinah\" revealed Herself and rested upon him before the eyes of all.\"\nThe Tenth \"Sefirah\".\nIn Kabbalah, the shekhinah is identified with the tenth \"sefirah\" (Malkuth), and the source of life for humans on earth below the sefirotic realm. The Shekhinah is seen as the feminine divine presence of God descended to transform the world, Moses is considered to have risen to shekhinah into the sefirotic realm, and transcended the world as the bridegroom of the shekhinah.\nIn Christianity.\nThe concept is similar to that in the Gospel of Matthew 18:20, \"Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in their midst.\" Some Christian theologians have connected the concept of shekhinah to the Greek term \"parousia\", \"presence\" or \"arrival,\" which is used in the New Testament in a similar way for \"divine presence\".\nBranch Davidians.\nLois Roden, whom the original Branch Davidian acknowledged as their teacher/prophet from 1978 to 1986, laid heavy emphasis on women's spirituality and the feminine aspect of God. She published a magazine, \"Shekinah\", often rendered \"SHEkinah\", in which she explored the concept that the shekhinah is the Holy Spirit. Articles from \"Shekinah\" are reprinted online at the Branch Davidian website.\nIn Islam.\nIn the Quran.\n\"Sak\u012bnah\" () signifies the \"presence or peace of God\". As \"support and reassurance\" it was \"sent by God into the hearts\" of Muslims and Muhammad, according to John Esposito. A modern translator of the Quran, N. J. Dawood, states that \"tranquility\" is the English word for the Arabic meaning of \"sak\u012bnah\", yet it could be \"an echo of the Hebrew \"shekeenah\" (the Holy Presence).\" Another scholar states that the Arabic \"sak\u012bnah\" derives from the Hebrew/Aramaic shekhinah. In the Quran, the Sak\u012bnah is mentioned six times, in surah \"al-Baqara\", \"at-Tawba\" and \"al-Fath\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Their prophet further told them, \u201cThe sign of Saul\u2019s kingship is that the Ark will come to you\u2014containing reassurance from your Lord and relics of the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, which will be carried by the angels. Surely in this is a sign for you, if you \u02f9truly\u02fa believe.\u201d.\nSak\u012bnah means \"tranquility\", \"peace\". \"calm\", from the Arabic root \"sakana\": \"to be quiet\", \"to abate\", \"to dwell\". In Islam, \"Sak\u012bnah\" \"designates a special peace, the \"Peace of God\". Although related to Hebrew \"shekhinah\", the spiritual state is not an \"indwelling of the Divine Presence\" The ordinary Arabic use of the word's root is \"the sense of abiding or dwelling in a place\". A story in Tafsir and Isra'iliyyat literature relates how Ibrahim and Isma'il, when looking for the spot to build the Kaaba found sak\u012bnah. Newby writes that it was like a breeze \"with a face that could talk\", saying \"build over me.\" \"Associated with piety and moments of divine inspiration, \"sakinah\" in Islamic mysticism signifies an interior spiritual illumination.\"\nComments regarding Sakina.\n\"Sakina\" in the Quran can refer to God's blessing of solace and succour upon both the Children of Israel and Muhammad. Al-Qurtubi mentions in his exegesis, in explanation of the above-mentioned verse [2:248], that according to Wahb ibn Munabbih, sakinah is a spirit from God that speaks, and, in the case of the Israelites, where people disagreed on some issue, this spirit came to clarify the situation, and used to be a cause of victory for them in wars. According to Ali, \"Sakinah is a sweet breeze/wind, whose face is like the face of a human\". Mujahid mentions that \"when Sakinah glanced at an enemy, they were defeated\", and ibn Atiyyah mentions about the Ark of the Covenant (\"at-Tabut\"), to which the sakina was associated, that souls found therein peace, warmth, companionship and strength.\nIn Gnosticism.\n\"Shekhinah\", often in plural, is also present in some gnostic writings written in Aramaic, such as the writings of the Manichaeans and the Mandaeans, as well as others. In these writings, \"shekinas\" are described as hidden aspects of God, somewhat resembling the \"Amahr\u0101spandan\" of the Zoroastrians.\nIn Mandaeism, a \"\u0161kina\" () is a celestial dwelling where uthra, or benevolent celestial beings, live in the World of Light (\"alma d-nh\u016bra\"). In Mandaean priest initiation ceremonies, a \"\u0161kina\" refers to an initiation hut where a novice and his initiator stay for seven days without sleeping. The hut is called a \"\u0161kina\" since priests are considered to be the earthly manifestations of uthras, and the initiation hut represents the abode of the uthra on earth.\nAnthropological views.\nRaphael Patai.\nIn the work by anthropologist Raphael Patai entitled \"The Hebrew Goddess\", the author argues that the term \"shekhinah\" refers to a goddess by comparing and contrasting scriptural and medieval Jewish Kabbalistic source materials. Patai draws a historic distinction between the \"shekhinah\" and the Matronit. In his book Patai also discusses the Hebrew goddesses Asherah and Anat-Yahu.\nGustav Davidson.\nAmerican poet Gustav Davidson listed shekhinah as an entry in his reference work \"A Dictionary of Angels, Including the Fallen Angels\" (1967), stating that she is the female incarnation of Metatron.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

First introduced in 1999 as an Individual Special Savings Account (ISSA), the accounts have favourable tax status: they are exempt from income tax and capital gains tax on the investment returns, and no tax is payable on money withdrawn from the scheme. \nCash and a broad range of investments can be held within the arrangement, and there is no restriction on when or how much money can be withdrawn. Since 2017, there have been four types of account: cash ISA, stocks &amp; shares ISA, innovative finance ISA (IFISA) and lifetime ISA (LISA). Each taxpayer has an annual investment limit (\u00a320,000 since 2020\u201321[ [update]]) which can be split among the four types as desired. Additionally, children under 18 may hold a junior ISA, with a different annual limit.\nUntil the lifetime ISA was introduced in 2017, ISAs were not a specific retirement investment, but the accounts can be useful tools for retirement planning alongside pensions.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nISAs were introduced on 6 April 1999, replacing the earlier personal equity plans (PEPs; very similar to a Stocks and Shares ISA) and tax-exempt special savings accounts (TESSAs; very similar to a Cash ISA). Other tax-advantaged savings that predate ISAs include many offered by National Savings and Investments, a state-owned institution which has in the past offered a range of other tax-free accounts, in addition to its own ISAs.\nJunior ISAs, introduced in 2011, replaced the Child Trust Fund.\nWith a few exceptions, such as from an employee share ownership plan, all investor contributions must be in cash, not kind. Adult ISAs are available to UK residents aged over 16, provided that they have a National Insurance number, but individuals between 16 and 18 are only permitted to use the adult cash component or can use a Junior ISA.\nThere are four broad types of adult ISA: cash, stocks and shares, innovative finance (including peer-to-peer lending) and lifetime.\n1999 Transition from older types of ISA.\nPEPs became stocks and shares ISAs, with an exemption that allowed them to continue to hold investments that could not be held in a stocks and shares ISA, provided that the investment met the pre-2001 PEP rules.\nFor some time there were Mini ISAs, Maxi ISAs and TESSA-only ISAs. A Mini ISA could hold cash OR stocks, potentially many if operated by a fund house or platform, while a Maxi ISA could hold cash AND stocks. Any UK resident individual aged 18 or over could invest in one 'maxi' ISA per year, with both components provided by a single financial institution. Alternatively, a person could invest in two 'mini' ISAs, one for each component. The two mini ISAs could be with two different providers if the investor wished.\nThe TESSA-only ISA was a type of cash ISA funded from a TESSA, another predecessor of the ISA. New TESSAs could not be created after 5 April 1999, so the required five-year term of all TESSAs ended by 5 April 2004. TOISAs were created to allow the original capital (excluding interest) invested in a TESSA (up to \u00a39,000) to be reinvested in a tax-free form.\nCAT standards 1999-2005.\nIn April 1999, the Government introduced a voluntary \"CAT\" standard for ISAs (standing for \"Charges, Access, and Terms\") to make them easier for inexperienced customers to understand and with the intention that lower costs would attract more investors. The standard does not guarantee the investment performance or that investors would buy or be sold the right type of investment.\nMany equity funds also meet the CAT standards, but the restriction on costs generally means that these funds are index funds, which require little management and simply follow a given index, such as the FTSE 100 Index.\nCAT standards were discontinued by the Treasury on 6 April 2005 following the introduction of the stakeholder product suite, although existing CAT standard ISAs continued on the same terms and conditions.\n2007/8/9 limit changes.\nIn the March 2007 Budget the limits for the 2008/9 tax year were increased. From tax year 2008/2009 the distinction between a Mini and Maxi ISA was abolished.\nAn insurance component was available in both Maxi and Mini ISAs until the 2005/06 tax year. Collective investment funds that once qualified for this component were reclassified as qualifying for either the Cash or Stocks &amp; Shares component.\nPast subscription limits.\nIn the March 2010 Budget the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that in future years the limits would rise annually with inflation, rounded to the nearest \u00a3120, to ease the arithmetic for those using monthly payment schemes. From 2013 to 2014 the inflation index used was changed from RPI to CPI.\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced in the March 2014 Budget that the adult ISA limit would be increased to \u00a315,000 from 1 July 2014, and the Junior ISA limit to \u00a34,000. From that date savers were allowed to invest the full amount as cash or stocks and shares, or a mix of both. Savers are also able to switch stocks and shares ISAs to cash ISAs.\nRestrictions removed from July 2014.\nMany restrictions were significantly relaxed from 1 July 2014 and the branding \"New ISA\" was introduced for this batch of changes:\nTypes.\nCash ISA.\nAn account which enjoys tax-free status, usually deposit accounts with \u00a385,000 Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protection (but client money with \u00a350,000 protection or unprotected money is also permitted; the providers are required to make the protection clear). These are normally offered by banks and building societies but investment firms can also offer them. It is mandatory that money held in a cash ISA be made available on request within 15 days but it is permitted to have a loss-of-interest penalty for this, and this is how term deposits are typically made available.\nHelp to buy ISA.\nA help to buy ISA, introduced in 2015, is a form of cash ISA that receives a government bonus if the money is used in paying the deposit on a first home purchase. The usual rule that any number of accounts can be held with the same ISA manager applies, and many providers offered the ability to hold both HTB and other cash ISA accounts with current year money in them. However, only one HTB ISA in total can be held, so if one wishes to put current year money into the HTB ISA, any other cash ISA current year money will also have to be paid into a cash ISA with the same provider.\nThe Lifetime ISA, announced in March 2016, replaces the HTB ISA. HTB accounts could be opened until 30 November 2019 and contributions can continue until 30 November 2029. An account holder can also have a Lifetime ISA, although the government bonus from only one of the accounts per person can be used for a purchase. Transfers from HTB to Lifetime ISA were allowed from the 2017-18 tax year, with transitional arrangements for that year only.\nHelp to buy ISAs have been criticised:\nStocks and shares ISA.\nInvestors' money is invested in 'qualifying investments', which are:\nIt is mandatory that money held in a stocks and shares ISA be made available on request within 30 days but it is permitted to have a loss-of-interest penalty for this.\nInnovative finance ISA.\nInnovative finance ISAs (IF ISAs or IFISAs) became available from 6 April 2016. They are similar to cash and S&amp;S ISAs but designed to be used for peer-to-peer lending investments, which were not previously eligible to be held in an ISA. Only platforms with full FCA authorisation (and ISA manager status) are eligible to offer IF ISAs; at launch this barred all major existing platforms because they were awaiting authorisation, leaving just eight at the time relatively minor platforms available and 86 awaiting approval. Equity-based crowdfunding, although similar to peer-to-peer lending, is not included in the eligible products for this type of ISA.\nFrom 1 November 2016 many transferable debentures including debt securities and bonds became eligible for inclusion provided they are issued by a company or charity. They can be included whether offered via a P2P platform or not.\nThe same rules with respect to subscription limits and transfers are applicable to the IF ISA as other adult ISAs, including the restrictions of current year money going to only one ISA manager, and an unrestricted number of managers for past year money.\nLifetime ISA.\nIn the 2016 Budget it was announced that a lifetime ISA (LISA) would be introduced from 6 April 2017 as a more flexible way to save for both home purchase and retirement. Only those aged 18 to 40 can open an account, and at the end of the tax year (or when used for purchase) a 25% bonus on contributions of up to \u00a34,000 a year will be paid. The \u00a34,000 is part of the overall ISA annual allowance, not in addition to it. On reaching age 50, no more money can be added to the account and eligibility for the 25% bonus ceases, but the account will still earn interest or investment returns. The accounts have the same inheritance tax treatment as other ISAs.\nPermitted investments are as for cash or S&amp;S ISAs, and as for them any number of accounts is allowed, but only one account can hold current year money. After the account has been open for at least 12 months, the money can be used for a first home purchased with a mortgage and priced up to \u00a3450,000; the money is paid to the conveyancer and can be returned to the ISA if the sale does not complete. There are restrictions in place to avoid abuse of the scheme, for instance those who purchase a home with a LISA are barred from renting the property out. If you and a partner buy a house together, you can both save into a LISA and both put your LISA towards the home.\nMoney can also be withdrawn after reaching age 60. A person who is diagnosed with a medical condition giving a life expectancy of under one year can withdraw the full amount including bonus without penalty at any age, using the definition in the similar pension law. Any other withdrawal, including transfers to another type of ISA, incurs a 25% charge. Although the bonus and penalty are both 25%, those who withdraw funds for purposes not listed above will suffer a loss, for example:\n\u00a31,000 paid in + government bonus at 25% = \u00a31,250 - penalty charge at 25% = \u00a3937.50 = net loss of \u00a362.50\nHowever, the government have created a precedent where this penalty charge may be reduced during periods of poor economic outlook and the LISA can effectively be used as a rainy day fund. Penalty charges were reduced from 25% to 20% on withdrawals between 6 March 2020 and 5 April 2021 during the recession arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduction ensured that savers making withdrawals received the full amount they had deposited.\n\u00a31.5 billion was held in LISA savings in 2022, and the 2022 cost of living crisis fuelled in part by rising inflation led to calls to introduce a temporary penalty-free period to allow access to these savings.\nJunior ISAs.\nJunior ISAs were introduced on 1 November 2011 with an initial subscription limit of \u00a33,600, which was increased to \u00a39,000 by the time of the 2020-21 tax year. At age 18 the JISA converts to an adult ISA. Like adult ISAs, JISAs are available in both cash and stocks and shares types. Money cannot be withdrawn until age 18 unless a terminal illness claim is agreed or following closure of the account after the death of the child. A child can open their own account from age 16, otherwise a person with parental responsibility can do it. They are available to those who are:\nUnlike an adult ISA a child can only hold a total of one cash ISA and one stocks and shares ISA, including for all money from past years, but transfers of these two accounts can be carried out between providers as for adult accounts. Up to the full JISA limit can be used for any combination of cash and stocks and shares ISA subscriptions. An additional adult cash ISA can be held between 16 and 18. In the year in which a child becomes 18 the full adult and child ISA limits can both be used. Unlike adult ISAs a JISA allows transfers from the S&amp;S form to the cash form.\nEach child ISA has a single registered contact, a person with parental responsibility. From age 16 a child can register to be their own contact and this registration cannot normally be reversed. Except in that case and adoptive parents registering, the previous registered contact will be contacted to obtain their consent to a change of contact.\nBritish ISA.\nA British ISA was announced by the government in its Spring Budget 2024 with an annual allowance of \u00a35,000 to be used only towards investment in UK companies. It is expected that the \u00a35,000 annual subscription will be in addition to the current \u00a320,000 ISA allowance. The aim of the British ISA is to encourage investment in UK companies, so a number of bespoke rules may be created which will differentiate it from current ISAs, including on transfers and holding cash. \nThe government launched a consultation on how a British ISA will work, lasting until June 2024. It is not expected to be available until 2025.\nSubscription limits.\nThere are restrictions on investing in ISAs in each tax year (6 April to the following 5 April) which affect the type of ISA that may be opened and the cumulative amount of investment during the course of that year. The key restrictions are:\nThese restrictions only apply to money paid in during the current tax year. For adult ISAs an unlimited number of ISA managers' accounts can hold money from past years and it can be freely moved between managers using ISA transfer requests.\nTransfer rules.\nTransfers between providers are allowed. A transfer from a Cash ISA to another Cash ISA must usually be completed within 15 business days. Any other type of account transfer must usually be completed within 30 days. There are a range of restrictions and workarounds:\nFlexible ISA Features.\nThe Flexible ISA Features are optional add-on feature introduced from 6 April 2016 for any adult ISA type that allow withdrawing cash and redepositing it in the same tax year. Providers are not required to implement the flexibility features and do not have to implement them all if they allow some. A person can withdraw an unlimited amount of money from an account and return up to that amount within the same tax year without it counting against the annual subscription limit. A person with \u00a3100,000 of past year money could withdraw say \u00a390,000 on 15 April and redeposit it as desired within the tax year. If a transfer is done the firm receiving the transfer is told only the amount of current year allowance available to be used, if any.\nIf current year money is withdrawn, that money can be used to subscribe to a different type of ISA in the current year without having to replace it into the flexible ISA it was withdrawn from. This is particularly useful if both current and past year money were withdrawn from the same account. Otherwise all past year money would have to be replaced before any current year money would count as being replaced, due to the rules that current year money is the first withdrawn and last replaced. Past year money does have to be replaced before being transferred in the usual ISA transfer way, it must not be directly placed into the new account or it would count as a new current year subscription instead of a replacement.\nTax treatment.\nInterest on cash held in an ISA, including stocks and shares ISAs, is not subject to income tax.\nDividends are not subject to additional tax, interest on bonds is not taxed, and capital gains are not taxed (nor may capital losses be used to offset other gains).\nThere is no need to report interest or other income, capital gains, or trades to HMRC as it is not taxable income. This is a considerable paperwork reduction for active traders or those who may otherwise be required to report their trades because they have total sales value exceeding four times the annual CGT allowance, which outside a tax wrapper would require that all trades be reported even if there is no capital gains tax to pay.\nSince the income is not taxable it did not count for age-related personal income tax allowance reduction when that extra allowance existed.\nDeath of investor.\nCash or investments held in ISAs are ordinarily subject to Inheritance Tax when the account holder dies, if their estate is valued above the IHT nil-rate band. Since August 2013 it became possible to hold AIM-listed shares in a stocks and shares ISA, some of which qualify for business relief; in this way a stocks and shares ISA portfolio consisting of these securities can be gifted without being subject to Inheritance Tax, provided the qualifying securities have been held for at least two years upon death.\nFor deaths of ISA investors on or after 3 December 2014, the surviving spouse or civil partner can apply for an increased ISA allowance in the form of an Additional Permitted Subscription. This allowance is separate from the normal annual allowance, and is based on the value of the deceased's ISA; it is available whether or not the surviving spouse or civil partner inherited the ISA assets.\nFund supermarkets and self-select ISA providers.\nThere is no legal distinction between a fund supermarket and a self-select ISA provider. These are merely marketing terms used by stocks and shares ISA providers to distinguish the type of business that they tend to seek. Firms favouring collective investment business will often call themselves fund supermarkets, while firms who focus on share dealing will often call themselves self-select ISA providers. A firm can freely offer all types of permitted investment, regardless of its name, and many do. Others choose to offer only collective investment funds. An individual may not be the provider for their own ISA.\nExcept for fund houses, it is usual for providers to offer the facility to hold funds managed by many different organisations.\nPrior to the effect of the Retail Distribution Review it was normal for S&amp;S providers to be paid by fund managers out of their usual charges, though some may have both explicit dealing charges and collect the commission while others may make charges and refund all commission. This is now prohibited for new customers who must be charged a fee instead. In the current transition period existing customers may be able to hold a mixture of commission paying investments and the \"clean\" versions that do not pay commission, perhaps paying a platform fee only for the clean portion. Some providers have chosen to be clean only. Some commission may be rebated to customers but this is not required.\nCharges.\nThe ISA cash component normally has no disclosed charges. The company can make money from the differences between its deposit and lending rates, fees, differences between wholesale and retail deposit rates or other means. For example, Hargreaves Lansdown quoted a 0.8% profit margin on cash held in its Vantage platform in spring 2014. Some providers charge a fee for transferring to another provider.\nThe built-in annual \"re-registering\" of an ISA may attract a fee which may be automatically extracted from an account, though this is normally done only by firms specialising in share deals, not those using funds or both funds and shares.\nStocks and shares ISA fund supermarkets often reduce some or all of the initial and annual charges made by fund houses to below the level paid when purchasing direct from the fund provider, often to zero initial charge. Some providers levy dealing charges even for fund transactions, typically firms desiring direct share investments more than fund investments. Dealing charges for shares are normal even from providers that do not charge for fund transactions. Firms that primarily focus on fund transactions tend to have higher share dealing charges than providers specialising in share transactions.\nSimilar schemes in other countries.\nNon-pension products:\nPensions:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69270", "revid": "45929875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69270", "title": "Sheba", "text": "Ancient South Arabian kingdom\nSheba, or Saba, was an ancient South Arabian kingdom that existed in Yemen before 275 BCE. It likely began to exist between c. 1000 BCE and c. 800 BCE. Its inhabitants were the Sabaeans, who, as a people, were indissociable from the kingdom itself for much of the 1st millennium BCE. Modern historians agree that the heartland of the Sabaean civilization was located in the region around Marib and Sirwah. In some periods, they expanded to much of modern Yemen and even parts of the Horn of Africa, particularly Eritrea and Ethiopia. The kingdom's native language was Sabaic, which was a variety of Old South Arabian.\nAmong South Arabians and Abyssinians, Sheba's name carried prestige, as it was widely considered to be the birthplace of South Arabian civilization as a whole. The first Sabaean kingdom lasted from the 8th century BCE to the 1st century BCE: this kingdom can be divided into the \"mukarrib\" period, where it reigned supreme over all of South Arabia; and the \"kingly\" period, a long period of decline to the neighbouring kingdoms of Ma'in, Hadhramaut, and Qataban, ultimately ending when a newer neighbour, Himyar, annexed them. Sheba was originally confined to the region of Marib (its capital city) and its surroundings. At its height, it encompassed much of the southwestern parts of the Arabian Peninsula before eventually declining to the regions of Marib. However, it re-emerged from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE. During this time, a secondary capital was founded at Sanaa, which is also the capital city of modern Yemen. Around 275 CE, the Sabaean civilization came to a permanent end in the aftermath of another Himyarite annexation.\nThe Sabaeans, like the other South Arabian kingdoms of their time, took part in the extremely lucrative spice trade, especially including frankincense and myrrh. They left behind many inscriptions in the monumental Ancient South Arabian script, as well as numerous documents in the related cursive Zab\u016br script. Their interaction with African societies in the Horn is attested by numerous traces, including inscriptions and temples dating back to the Sabaean presence in Africa.\nThe Hebrew Bible references the kingdom in an account describing the interactions between King Solomon of Israel and a figure identified as the Queen of Sheba. The Hebrew Bible's account is considered legendary. A similar narrative is also found in the Quran (Sheba is distinct from the Sabians). Traditions concerning the legacy of the Queen of Sheba feature extensively in Ethiopian Christianity, particularly Orthodox Tewahedo, and among Yemenis today. She is left unnamed in Jewish tradition, but is known as \"Makeda\" in Ethiopian tradition and as \"Bilqis\" in Arab and Islamic tradition. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Sheba was the home of Princess Tharbis, a Cushite who is said to have been the wife of Moses before he married Zipporah. Some Quranic exegetes identified Sheba with the People of Tubba.\nSources.\nThe Sabaic language was written down in the Sabaic script as early as the 11th or 10th centuries BCE. The Sabaic tradition has left behind a sizable epigraphic record. Of the 12,000 corresponding Ancient South Arabian inscriptions, 6,500 are in Sabaic. The region first sees a continuous record of epigraphic documentation in the 8th century BCE, which lasts until the 9th century CE, long after the fall of the Sabaean kingdom and covering a time range of about a millennium and a half and constituting the main source of information about the Sabaeans. South Arabian civilization may be the only civilization that can be reconstructed from epigraphic evidence.\nExternal information about the Sabaeans comes first from Akkadian cuneiform texts starting in the 8th century BCE. Less important are brief reports from the Bible about correspondence between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. The story is considered legendary as early first-millennium\u202fBC epigraphic sources show no evidence of diplomatic missions or women rulers. Knowledge of the Sabaeans as merchant peoples indicates that some level of trade between the regions was underway in this time. After the campaigns of Alexander the Great, South Arabia became a hub of trade routes linking the broader geopolitical realm with India. As such, information about the region begins to appear among Greco-Roman observers and information becomes more concrete. The most important accounts about South Arabia are from Eratosthenes, Strabo, Theophrastus, Pliny the Elder, an anonymous first-century seafarming manual called the \"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\" concerning the politics and topography of South Arabian coasts, the \"Ecclesiastical History\" by Philostorgius, and Procopius.\nScholars have noted that Sheba and ancient Judah/Palestine maintained trade, linguistic, and cultural contacts during antiquity.\nHistory.\nFormative period.\nThe formative phase of the Sabaeans, or the period prior to the emergence of urban cultures in South Arabia, can be placed the latter part of the 2nd millennium BCE, and was completed by the 10th century BCE, where a fully developed script appears in combination with the technological prowess to construct complex architectural complexes and cities. There is some debate as to the degree to which the movement out of the formative phase was channeled by endogenous processes, or the transfer or technologies from other centers, perhaps via trade and immigration.\nOriginally, the Sabaeans were part of \"communities\" (called \"sha\u02bfbs\") on the edge of the Sayhad desert. Very early, at the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, the political leaders of this tribal community managed to create a huge commonwealth of sha\u02bfbs occupying most of South Arabian territory and took on the title \"Mukarrib of the Sabaeans\".\nEmergence.\nThe origin of the Sabaean Kingdom is uncertain and is a point of disagreement among scholars, with estimates placing it around 1200 BCE, by the 10th century BCE at the latest, or a period of flourishing that only begins from the 8th century BCE onwards. Once the polity had been established, Sabaean kings referred to themselves by the title Mukarrib.\nFirst Sabaean kingdom (8th \u2013 1st centuries BCE).\nEra of the \"mukarribs\".\nThe first major phase of the Sabaean civilization lasted between the 8th and 1st centuries BCE. For centuries, Saba dominated the political landscape in South Arabia. The 8th century is when the first stone inscriptions appear, and when leaders are already being called by the title Mukarrib (\"federator\"). Due to this convention, this era can also be called the \"Mukarrib period\". The title \"mukarrib\" was more prestigious than that of \"mlk\" (\"king\") and was used to refer to someone that extended hegemony over other tribes and kingdoms.\nSaba reached the height of its powers between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. In particular, the great conquests of Karib'il Watar extended their territory to Najran in the north, the Gulf of Aden in the southwest, and eastward from that point along the coast until the western foothills of the Hadhramaut plateau. Saba reigned supreme over South Arabia, and Karib'il established diplomatic contacts with the Assyrian emperor Sennacherib. This territorial range by a South Arabian kingdom would not be seen again until Himyar achieved it over 1,100 years later. Karib'il's success is reflected by the dynastic succession of four rulers from his lineage, including sons, grandson, and great-grandons, a rare occurrence in the face of the rarity of dynastic succession in ancient South Arabian culture. The next time this would be seen was six centuries later in Qataban.\nEra of the kings.\nAfter the 6th century BCE, Saba was unable to maintain its supremacy over South Arabia in the face of the expanding adjacent powers of Qataban and Hadhramaut militarily, and Ma'in economically, leading it contract back to its core territory around Marib and Sirwah. Sabaean leaders reverted to use of the title \"malik\" (\"king\") instead of \"mukarrib\". This decline began soon after the end of the reign of Karib'il Watar. While Karib'il established hegemony over the Jawf, his immediate successors only consolidated their power over some of its former city-states (including Nashq and Manhayat) whereas others (like Yathill and the towns of Wadhi Raghwan) were absorbed into Ma'in. Qataban expanded into the Southern Highlands, formerly under Sabaean rule.\nEconomically, the first Sabaean period was dominated by a caravan economy that had market ties with the rest of the Near East. Its first major trading partners were at Khindanu and the Middle Euphrates. Later, this moved to Gaza during the Persian period, and finally, to Petra in Hellenistic times. The South Arabian deserts gave rise to important aromatics which were exported in trade, especially frankincense and myrrh. It also acted as an intermediary for overland trade with neighbours in Africa and further off from India.\nBy the end of the 1st millennium BCE, several factors came together and brought about the decline of the Sabaean state and civilization. The biggest challenge came from the expansion of the Roman Republic. The Republic conquered Syria in 63 BCE and Egypt in 30 BCE, diverting Saba's overland trade network. The Romans then attempted to conquer Saba around 26/25 BCE with an army sent out under the command of the governor Aelius Gallus, setting Marib to siege. Due to heat exhaustion, the siege had to be quickly given up. However, after conquering Egypt, the overland trade network was redirected to maritime routes, with an intermediary port chosen with Bir Ali (then called Qani). This port was part of the Kingdom of Hadhramaut, far from Sabaean territory. Greatly economically weakened, the Kingdom of Saba was soon annexed by the Himyarite Kingdom, bringing this period to a close.\nSecond Sabaean kingdom (1st \u2013 3rd centuries CE).\nAfter the disintegration of the first Himyarite Kingdom, the Sabaean Kingdom reappeared and began to vigorously campaign against the Himyarites, and it flourished for another century and a half. This resurgent kingdom was different from the earlier one in many important respects. The most significant change with the earlier Sabaean period is that local power dynamics had shifted from the oasis cities on the desert margin, like Marib, to the highland tribes. The Almaqah temple at Marib returned to being a religious center. Saba inaugurated a new coinage and the remarkable Ghumdan Palace was built at Sanaa which, in this period, had its status elevated to that of a secondary capital next to Marib.\nDespite liberating itself from Himyar by around 100 CE, leaders of Himyar continued calling themselves the \"king of Saba\", as they had been doing during the period in which they ruled the region, to assert their legitimacy over the territory. The Kingdom fell after a long but sporadic civil war between several Yemenite dynasties claiming kingship, and the late Himyarite Kingdom rose as victorious. Sabaean kingdom was finally permanently conquered by the \u1e24imyarites around 275 CE. Saba lost its royal status and reverted to a normal tribe, limited to the citizens of Marib, who are named in the last time in South Arabian sources in CIH 541 in requesting assistance from the king in repairing a rupture in the Marib Dam.\nConquests.\nConquests of Karib'il Watar.\nThe major conquests in Saba were driven by the exploits of Karib'il Watar. Karib'il conquered all surrounding neighbours, including the Awsan, Qataban, and Hadhramaut. Karib'il's exploits largely unified Yemen.The conquests of Karib'il are documented in two lengthy inscriptions (RES 3945\u20133946) discovered at the Temple of Almaqah at Sirwah. These inscriptions describe a series of eight campaigns to show how Karib'il ultimately brought South Arabia under the control of Saba. The first campaign took place in the highlands west of Marib, where Karib'il declares that he had captured 8,000 and killed 3,000 enemies. The second campaign concerned the Kingdom of Awsan, which flourished in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. Up until the reign of Karib'il, it was a significant regional competitor with the Kingdom of Saba. However, Karib'il's campaign brought about the obliteration of the Kingdom of Awsan. The tribal elite leading Awsan were slaughtered, and the palace of Muratta\u02bf was destroyed, as well as their temples and inscriptions. The wadi was depopulated, which is reflected in the abandonment of the wadi. Sabaean inscriptions claim that 16,000 were killed and 40,000 prisoners were taken. This may not have been a significant exaggeration, as the Awsan kingdom disappeared as a political entity from the historical record for five or six centuries. The third and fourth campaigns involve attacks against tribes living in low-lying hills that geographically face the Gulf of Aden. The fifth and sixth campaigns were against Nashshan. Nashshan was, like Awsan, one of Saba's most powerful competitors. However, against Karib'il, combined with the destruction of several towns and buildings and the imposition of a tribute on its people. Any dissidents were killed and the cult of Almaqah was imposed onto Nashshan, with Nashshan's leaders being required to build a temple for him. The final two campaigns were against the Tihamah coastal region and the Najran region.\nHorn of Africa.\nThe role played by Sabaeans in the formation of D\u02bfmt (Di'amat), located in modern-day Ethiopia's Tigray Region and founded c. 800 BCE, continues to be debated by scholars. Evidence of strong Sabaean influence includes Sabaic inscriptions and Sabaean temples. Scholars of South Arabian archaeology and epigraphy tend to favour a migration and/or colonisation, while scholars of African archaeology tend to stress an indigenous origin. Sabaean populations migrated to maintain the new polity, and link it with the mother country, including through managing trade between the two (ivory might have especially been a driver of the expansion). The capital of the new kingdom was Yeha, where a great temple was built for Almaqah, the national god of Saba. Four other Almaqah temples are also known from Di'amat (including the Temple of Meqaber Ga\u02bfewa), and other inscriptions mention the complete remainder of the known Sabaean deities. The great Yeha temple was modelled by Sabaean masons off of the Almaqah Temple at Sirwah (a major urban center of Saba). Besides religion, Sabaean culture also diffused into Di'amat through the use of objects, architectural techniques, artistic styles, institutions, paleographical styles for writings inscriptions, and the use of abstract symbols. Leaders in Di'amat used the classical South Arabian title, the \"mukarrib\", and one particular title that is seen is the \"Mukarrib of Di\u02bfamat and Saba\" (\"mkrb D\u02bfmt s-S1b\u02be\"). The exact timing of the collapse of Di'amat is not known: it happened around the mid-1st millennium BCE and involved a destruction of Yeha along with a number of adjacent sites. This also happened when Saba was beginning to lose its grip on power over South Arabia.\nIn 2019 Sabaean inscriptions were found in Somaliland and Puntland, as well as a Sabaean temple whose inscriptions say its construction was ordered by the admiral of Sheba's fleet.\nIn 2025 Alfredo Gonz\u00e1lez-Ruibal said \"we can perhaps discern two different models: a proper colonialist one along the northern Somali seaboard, with direct intervention of the state and aimed at the extraction of resources, and a diasporic model in the northern Horn [where D\u02bfmt was located], led by \u00e9lites who soon mixed with local people, while maintaining ties with their ancestral homeland\".\nMilitary warfare continued between Saba, Ethiopia, and Himyar during the second Sabaean period, with a dynamic and shifting array of alliances. Recently discovered evidence shows that these encounters took place, not only on the peninsula, but also on Ethiopian territory during expeditions launched by the Sabaeans.\nUrban centers.\nMarib.\nIn the Kingdom of Saba, Marib was an oasis and one of the main urban centers of the kingdom. It was by far the largest ancient city from ancient South Arabia, if not its only real city. Marib was located at the precise point that the wadi (of Wadi Dhana) emerges from the Yemeni highlands. It was located along what was called the Sayhad desert by medieval Arab geographers, but is now known as Ramlat al-Sab'atayn. The city lies 135\u00a0km east of Sanaa, which is the capital of Yemen today, found in the Wadi Dana delta, in the northwestern central Yemeni highlands. The oasis is about 10,000 hectares and the course of the wadi divides it into two: a northern and a southern half, which was already spoken of in records from the 8th century BCE, and this prominent feature may have been remembered as late as in the time of the Quran (34:15). A wall was built around Marib, and 4\u00a0km of that wall is still standing today. The wall, in some places, can be as much as 14 m thick. The wall encloses a 100-hectare area shaped like a trapezoid, and the settlement appears to have been created in the late second millennium BCE. Archaeological inquiries have uncovered a settlement plan that allocated different areas for different tasks. There is one residential division to the city. Another division containing sacred buildings but no residential development was probably a storage area for trade caravans and the shipment of goods. Immediately to the west was the great city temple Harun, dedicated to the national Sabaean god, Almaqah.\nA processional road, known from inscriptions but not yet discovered, led from the Harun temple to the Temple of Awwam, 3.5\u00a0km to the southeast of Marib, which is both the main temple for the god Almaqah in the Kingdom of Saba and the largest temple complex known from South Arabia. Hundreds of inscriptions are known from the Awwam Temple, and these documents form the basis from which the political history of South Arabia thus far reconstructable from in the first few centuries of the Christian era. The enclosure was built in the 7th century BCE according to a monumental inscription from the time of Yada'il Darih. South of the temple wall is a 1.5-hectare necropolis, in which it is estimated that about 20,000 people have been buried over a time period covering about a millennium.\nShortly west of the Awwam Temple is another major temple in the southern oasis dedicated to Almaqah, which has been fully excavated and is the best studied temple to date from South Arabia: the Barran Temple. It is evident that predecessors to the Barran Temple went back to the 10th century BCE. The construction history is properly documented by inscriptions in the area. The temple was destroyed shortly before the beginning of the Christian eraddea. The exact cause is unknown, but it may have been linked to an (ultimately unsuccessful) siege of South Arabia by the Romans, under the leadership of the governor Aelius Gallus in 25/24 BCE. Inscriptions attest other temples dedicated to other gods but these have not yet been discovered archaeologically.\nThe Marib Dam was one of the most well-known architectural complexes from Yemen, and was even mentioned in the Quran (34:16), and this construction made it possible to irrigate the 10,000 hectares of the Marib oasis. The dam is located 10\u00a0km west of the main settlement. The dam successfully delegates and distributes water from the biannual monsoon rains into two main channels, which move away from the wadi and into fields through a highly dispersive system. This allowed the region to convert alluvial loads into fertile soils and so cultivate various crops. It took until the 6th century BCE for the full closure to be accomplished. The system required constant maintenance, and two major dam failures are reported from 454/455 and 547 CE. However, as political authority weakened over the course of the 6th century CE, maintenance efforts could not be sustained. The dam was therefore breached and the oasis was temporarily abandoned by the early seventh century.\nSirwah.\nThe second Sabaean urban center was Sirwah. The two cities are connected by an ancient road. A wall had been built around Sirwah by the 10th century BCE. Much smaller than Marib, the city of Sirwah is 3.8 hectares in size, but it is archaeologically well-understood. The main buildings at the site are administrative and sacred buildings. Some buildings demonstrate that Sirwah acted as a transshipment point for trade goods. Legal documents show that Sirwah engaged in trade with Qataban to the southeast and the highlands around Sanaa to the west. Despite the urban area being limited, a significant portion of the space was allocated to sacred buildings. This has led some people to think that Sirwah acted as a religious center. The Great Temple of Almaqah is the most notable one, besides which, four other sacred buildings are known. One of these buildings was probably devoted to the female deity Atarsamain. Yada'il Darih, already a temple builder at the Awwam Temple in Marib, also fundamentally remodelled the Alwaqah Temple in the mid-7th century BCE. Inside the temple, in the area that is most cultically important, stands two parallel monumental inscriptions recording the lifetime achievements of two rulers: Yatha' Amar Watar and Karib'il Watar, who reigned in the late 8th and early 7th centuries BCE. The description in these records begins with comments on sacrifices made to the Sabaean deities, and then mostly delve into military campaigns in meticulous detail. At the end, the inscriptions record purchases of cities, landscapes, and fields.\nSociety.\nThe gods.\nLimitations in the available evidence prevent a full reconstruction of the full religious world in Ancient South Arabian kingdoms. While many of the known inscriptions speak about gods, most only hand down the name of the divinity without describing its nature, function, or cult. It is not known, for example, if these kingdoms had a god of war or a god of the underworld. Familial relationships between the gods are frequently mentioned, however.\nSaba had five gods of its pantheon: Almaqah, Athtar, Haubas, Dhat-Himyam, and Dhat-Badan. The first three are male, and the last two are female. The high god of the pantheon, and the national god of Saba, was Almaqah, whose worship was centered at the Temple of Awwam. Military victory helped spread this cult, such as when a temple to Almaqah was built in Nashshan after being conquered by Saba. The mention of Almaqah in the Jawf also indicates the political role played by Saba in that valley. The nature of the god is not entirely clear, but Almaqah has been hypothesized to be a moon god by some researchers.\nAthtar was not limited to Saba, but was instead the common god of the South Arabian pantheon during its polytheistic era. Athtar was also once the great god of the Sabaean pantheon, before being supplanted by Almaqah. Generally however, South Arabian deities are region-specific and lack parallel elsewhere in the Near East.\nAnthropomorphic representations of the gods are lacking entirely from the Old Sabaean period, and only begin to appear with the onset of Hellenistic and Roman influences at the turn of the Christian era.\nThe king.\nAncient South Arabian kings built great public works, had special ties with the gods legitimated through rites only they could perform, and led their armies during battle. They are represented as brave warriors, pious worshippers, and active builders. The fathers of the king is rarely attested independently. The function of the king was distinct from the role of the \"sheikh\". The \"Geographica\" by Strabo claims that in the region, the succession of kings was not familial, a claim that is partly confirmed by inscriptions. South Arabian kings did not appeal to their genealogy or the accomplishments of their fathers to legitimate their own rule. Only late in Sabaean history, from the second half of the 2nd century CE, did a real dynastic succession from father to son appear, and it only lasted for two generations.\nThe Sabaean king was called the \"mukarrib\" (\"federator\") more often than the \"malik\" (\"king\") between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE, to indicate their hegemony over their neighbours. When Saba declined after the 6th centuries BCE and Sabaean territory contracted to what it was prior to the conquests of Karib'il Watar, the title \"mukarrib\" is replaced by that of \"malik\".\nIn the early centuries of Saba, the title of the king was a combination of a name and an epithet. All titles were chosen from a combination of six possible names (Dhamar'ali, Karib'il, Sumhu'alay, Yada\"il, Yakrubmalik and Yitha'amar) and four possible epithets (Bayan, Dharih, Watar and Yanu). The repetitiveness of names has caused difficulties for historians trying to determine the relative succession of kings (even when they are attested) and raises questions about what the personal names were of each king. A similar practice took place in the neighbouring Kingdom of Hadhramaut. In the centuries leading up to the Christian era, this changed, kings began identifying with their real name, and reconstructions of Sabaean chronology become simpler.\nAccession to the Sabaean throne required the consent of \"the Sabaeans, the \"qayls\" and the army\" in one inscription. The legislative body extended beyond the king, including other functionaries. The Sabaean monarchs did not implement taxes but derived their wealth from royal lands, war boody, and rent from clients. Military service could be compelled and financial requests could be made for the purpose of funding construction work. Any tithes on temple lands went to the temples themselves, not the monarch.\nThe king of Saba was not deified. The only known case of deification from ancient South Arabian cultures is from the Kingdom of Awsan during its resurgent phase.\nThe tribe.\nIn the South Arabian tribal system, a fictitious shared ancestor was created and members of the tribe are referred to as the sons of the national god (in the case of Saba, they are \"sons of Almaqah\"). Allied states and tribes are called \"brothers\". Tribes were divided into lineages and sub-lineages, reflected by the names of members. The individual proper name appears along with the patronymic, the lineage name, and the name of the tribe, with the exception of funerary inscriptions, where the individual name is attested alone. In areas closer to the desert, the family name was more privileged and commonly mentioned, with the tribal name becoming less mentioned. Personal identity only went back to the name of the father, unlike in North Arabia in the same time period or the later Islamic period where a long sequence of ancestors is used to identify a figure. Identity was also in reference to the kingdom that one belonged to (Sabaeans, Qatabanians), not to a broader geographical construct (like \"South Arabian\").\nCulture.\nLanguage.\nSabaic was the spoken language of the Kingdom of Saba. Geographically, Sabaic was spoken in Saba, just as Qatabanic was spoken in Qataban and Hadraumitic was spoken in Hadhramaut. The only exception to this is Minaic, which is attested well-beyond the geographical territory of its corresponding kingdom, Ma'in. These four languages share and are distinguished by a number of linguistic features. The documentation for Sabaic is the best of any language of Ancient South Arabian, attested in all phases of the history of Saba.\nWriting schools.\nThe South Arabian kingdoms had writing schools with a common cultural background, although each school also had distinct practices.\nLegacy.\nBible.\nSaba appears in the Hebrew Bible, also the first place that the Sabaeans are mentioned by an external source. Most famously, Saba is presented as, through its female monarch the Queen of Sheba, engaging in trade with Solomon in goods of aromatics and gold. Historians have subjected this story to questions concerning its historicity. The Hebrew Bible links the Sabaean caravan trading network with other cities including Dedan, Tayma, and Ra'mah.\nIslamic tradition.\nThe story of the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon is discussed in Quran 27:15\u201344.\nThe name of Saba' is mentioned in the Qur'an in Surah 5:69, Surah 27:15-44 and Surah 34:15-17. Surah 34 is named \"Saba\u02be\". Their mention in Surah 5 refers to the area in the context of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, whereas their mention in Surah 34 refers to the Flood of the Dam, in which the dam was ruined by flooding. There is also an epithet, \"Qawm Tubba\u02bf\" or \"People of Tubba\u02bf\" (Surah 44:37, Surah 50:12-14) that some exegetes have identified as a reference to the kings of Saba'.\nMuslim commentators such as al-Tabari, al-Zamakhshari, al-Baydawi supplement the story at various points. The Queen's name is given as \"Bilqis\", probably derived from Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03c2 or the Hebraised \"pilegesh\", \"concubine\". According to some he then married the Queen, while other traditions assert that he gave her in marriage to a tubba of Hamdan. According to the Islamic tradition as represented by al-Hamdani, the queen of Sheba was the daughter of Ilsharah Yahdib, the Himyarite king of Najran.\nAlthough the Quran and its commentators have preserved the earliest literary reflection of the complete Bilqis legend, there is little doubt among scholars that the narrative is derived from a Jewish Midrash.\nBible stories of the Queen of Sheba and the ships of Ophir served as a basis for legends about the Israelites traveling in the Queen of Sheba's entourage when she returned to her country to bring up her child by Solomon. There is a Muslim tradition that the first Jews arrived in Yemen at the time of King Solomon, following the politico-economic alliance between him and the Queen of Sheba.\nThe Ottoman scholar Mahmud al-Alusi compared the religious practices of South Arabia to Islam in his \"Bulugh al-'Arab fi Ahwal al-'Arab\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Arabs during the pre-Islamic period used to practice certain things that were included in the Islamic Sharia. They, for example, did not marry both a mother and her daughter. They considered marrying two sisters simultaneously to be the most heinous crime. They also censured anyone who married his stepmother, and called him dhaizan. They made the major hajj and the minor umra pilgrimage to the Ka'ba, performed the circumambulation around the Ka'ba tawaf, ran seven times between Mounts Safa and Marwa sa'y, threw rocks and washed themselves after sexual intercourse. They also gargled, sniffed water up into their noses, clipped their fingernails, removed all pubic hair and performed ritual circumcision. Likewise, they cut off the right hand of a thief and stoned Adulterers.\nAccording to the medieval religious scholar al-Shahrastani, Sabaeans accepted both the sensible and intelligible world. They did not follow religious laws but centered their worship on spiritual entities.\nEthiopian and Yemenite tradition.\nIn the medieval Ethiopian cultural work called the Kebra Nagast, Sheba was located in Ethiopia. Some scholars therefore point to a region in the northern Tigray and Eritrea which was once called Saba (later called Meroe), as a possible link with the biblical Sheba. Donald N. Levine links Sheba with Shewa (the province where modern Addis Ababa is located) in Ethiopia.\nTraditional Yemenite genealogies also mention Saba, son of Qahtan; Early Islamic historians identified Qahtan with the Yoqtan (Joktan) son of Eber (H\u016bd) in the Hebrew Bible (Gen. 10:25-29). James A. Montgomery finds it difficult to believe that Qahtan was the biblical Joktan based on etymology.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name occurs twice:\nUnlike the descriptions of Biblical Judges, the first reference to Shamgar has no introduction, conclusion, or reference to the length of reign, and it is not said that he judged Israel. The subsequent text follows on directly from the previous narrative. In several ancient manuscripts this reference to Shamgar occurs after the accounts of Samson rather than immediately after the account of Ehud, in a way that is more narratively consistent; some scholars believe that this latter position is more likely to be the passage's original location.\nThe act of this Shamgar is similar to that of \"Shammah, son of Agee\", mentioned in the \"appendix\" of the Books of Samuel as being one of \"The Three\", a distinct group of warriors associated with King David. Scholars are not certain as to whether the same individual was originally meant, and that the passage in the book of Judges was later moved to its present location, or whether each of the two figures were different heroes. Scholars also believe that the name of the individual may originally have been \"Shammah\", and became corrupted under the influence of the \"Shamgar\" in the Song of Deborah. The term usually translated as \"oxgoad\" is a biblical hapax legomenon, the translation into English being made on the basis of the Septuagint's translation into Greek.\nThe other mention of Shamgar, that in the Song of Deborah, connects Shamgar with a low period of Israelite society.\n\"The Jewish Encyclopedia\" suspects him of having been a foreign oppressor of the Israelites, rather than an Israelite ruler. From the form of the name, it is suspected that Shamgar may actually have been a Hittite, a similar name occurring with Sangara, a Hittite king of Carchemish; more recent scholars hold that the name is of Hurrian origin and may well be \"\u0160imig-ari\".\nThe Bible also indicates that he was the \"son\" of \"Anath\" (the name of a Canaanite deity). In recent years, arrowheads bearing the names \"ben-anat\" and Aramaic \"bar anat\", dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC, have been discovered. This has led several recent scholars to theorize that the expression \"son of Anath\" probably designates a warrior title.\nReferences and citations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His family prepared him for a clerical career. In 1236, his brother William was able to use his influence with Henry III of England to get Philip positions in the churches of Hillingdon, Oxney, and Geddington. In 1240, he was elected Bishop of Lausanne with the support of his brother Peter, but had to resign. Instead, he became Bishop of Valence in 1241.

This so cheered the besieged king that he lavished further gifts on the bishop.\nIn 1244, Pope Innocent IV fled from Rome, and Philip convinced his brother, Count Amadeus IV of Savoy, to let the pope pass through Savoy. Philip escorted the Pope to Lyon, and then remained with him to ensure his safety. Pope Innocent ensured Philip's election as Archbishop of Lyon in 1245.\nWhile there, Philip continued his family's policies of governing through trade. In 1248 he negotiated with Aymar III of Valentinois to reduce the taxes that traders would pay on foods travelling through his lands, and over the next few years, he granted charters to towns throughout the area.\nReign.\nWhen, against expectations, Philip became the next heir for the County of Savoy, he gave his church offices up and married Countess Adelaide of Burgundy, on 12 June 1267. He became Count of Savoy in 1268, and in 1272 he also acquired the County of Bresse. While he was at first successful in extending the power of Savoy, in 1282 he was opposed by a coalition of King Rudolph I, Charles of Anjou (who was also count of Provence), the dauphin of Viennois, and the counts of Geneva.\nHis will appointed his niece Queen Eleanor of Provence and her son King Edward I of England as adjudicators of his estate; they appointed his nephew, Amadeus, as his successor.

Echolocating animals emit calls and listen to the echoes of those calls that return from various objects near them. They use these echoes to locate and identify the objects. Echolocation is used for navigation, foraging, and hunting prey.\nEcholocation calls can be frequency modulated (FM, varying in pitch during the call) or constant frequency (CF). FM offers precise range discrimination to localize the prey, at the cost of reduced operational range. CF allows both the prey's velocity and its movements to be detected by means of the Doppler effect. FM may be best for close, cluttered environments, while CF may be better in open environments or for hunting while perched.\nEcholocating animals include mammals, especially odontocetes (toothed whales) and some bat species, and, using simpler forms, species in other groups such as shrews. A few bird species in two cave-dwelling bird groups echolocate, namely cave swiftlets and the oilbird.\nSome prey animals that are hunted by echolocating bats take active countermeasures to avoid capture. These include predator avoidance, attack deflection, and the use of ultrasonic clicks, which have evolved multiple functions including aposematism, mimicry of chemically defended species, and echolocation jamming.\nEarly research.\nThe term \"echolocation\" had been coined by 1944 by the American zoologist Donald Griffin, who, with Robert Galambos, first demonstrated the phenomenon in bats. As Griffin described in his book, the 18th century Italian scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani had, by means of a series of elaborate experiments, concluded that when bats fly at night, they rely on some sense besides vision, but he did not discover that the other sense was hearing. The Swiss physician and naturalist Louis Jurine repeated Spallanzani's experiments (using different species of bat), and concluded that when bats hunt at night, they rely on hearing. In 1908, Walter Louis Hahn confirmed Spallanzani's and Jurine's findings.\nIn 1912, the inventor Hiram Maxim independently proposed that bats used sound below the human auditory range to avoid obstacles. In 1920, the English physiologist Hamilton Hartridge correctly proposed instead that bats used frequencies above the range of human hearing.\nEcholocation in odontocetes (toothed whales) was not properly described until two decades after Griffin and Galambos' work, by Schevill and McBride in 1956. However, in 1953, Jacques Yves Cousteau suggested in his first book, \"\", that porpoises had something like sonar, judging by their navigational abilities.\nPrinciples.\nEcholocation is active sonar, using sounds made by the animal itself. Ranging is achieved by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment. The relative intensity of sound received at each ear, as well as the time delay between arrival at the two ears, provide information about the horizontal angle (azimuth) from which the reflected sound waves arrive.\nUnlike some human-made sonars that rely on many extremely narrow beams and many receivers to localize a target (multibeam sonar), animal echolocation has only one transmitter and two receivers (the ears) positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the ears arrive at different times and at different intensities, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to perceive distance and direction. With echolocation, the bat or other animal can tell, not only where it is going, but also how big another animal is, what kind of animal it is, and other features.\nAcoustic features.\nDescribing the diversity of echolocation calls requires examination of the frequency and temporal features of the calls. It is the variations in these aspects that produce echolocation calls suited for different acoustic environments and hunting behaviors. The calls of bats have been most intensively researched, but the principles apply to all echolocation calls.\nBat call frequencies range from as low as 11\u00a0kHz to as high as 212\u00a0kHz. Insectivorous aerial-hawking bats, those that chase prey in the open air, have a call frequency between 20\u00a0kHz and 60\u00a0kHz, because it is the frequency that gives the best range and image acuity and makes them less conspicuous to insects. However, low frequencies are adaptive for some species with different prey and environments. \"Euderma maculatum\", a bat species that feeds on moths, uses a particularly low frequency of 12.7\u00a0kHz that cannot be heard by moths.\nEcholocation calls can be composed of two different types of frequency structure: frequency modulated (FM) sweeps, and constant frequency (CF) tones. A particular call can consist of one, the other, or both structures. An FM sweep is a broadband signal \u2013 that is, it contains a downward sweep through a range of frequencies. A CF tone is a narrowband signal: the sound stays constant at one frequency throughout its duration.\nEcholocation calls in bats have been measured at intensities anywhere between 60 and 140 decibels. Certain bat species can modify their call intensity mid-call, lowering the intensity as they approach objects that reflect sound strongly. This prevents the returning echo from deafening the bat. High-intensity calls such as those from aerial-hawking bats (133\u00a0dB) are adaptive to hunting in open skies. Their high intensity calls are necessary to even have moderate detection of surroundings because air has a high absorption of ultrasound and because insects' size only provide a small target for sound reflection. Additionally, the so-called \"whispering bats\" have adapted low-amplitude echolocation so that their prey, moths, which are able to hear echolocation calls, are less able to detect and avoid an oncoming bat.\nA single echolocation call (a call being a single continuous trace on a sound spectrogram, and a series of calls comprising a sequence or pass) can last anywhere from less than 3 to over 50 milliseconds in duration. Pulse duration is around 3 milliseconds in FM bats such as Phyllostomidae and some Vespertilionidae; between 7 and 16 milliseconds in Quasi-constant-frequency (QCF) bats such as other Vespertilionidae, Emballonuridae, and Molossidae; and between 11 milliseconds (Hipposideridae) and 52 milliseconds (Rhinolophidae) in CF bats.\nDuration depends also on the stage of prey-catching behavior that the bat is engaged in, usually decreasing when the bat is in the final stages of prey capture \u2013 this enables the bat to call more rapidly without overlap of call and echo. Reducing duration comes at the cost of having less total sound available for reflecting off objects and being heard by the bat.\nThe time interval between subsequent echolocation calls (or pulses) determines two aspects of a bat's perception. First, it establishes how quickly the bat's auditory scene information is updated. For example, bats increase the repetition rate of their calls (that is, decrease the pulse interval) as they home in on a target. This allows the bat to get new information regarding the target's location at a faster rate when it needs it most. Secondly, the pulse interval determines the maximum range that bats can detect objects. This is because bats can only keep track of the echoes from one call at a time; as soon as they make another call they stop listening for echoes from the previously made call. For example, a pulse interval of 100 ms (typical of a bat searching for insects) allows sound to travel in air roughly 34 meters so a bat can only detect objects as far away as 17 meters (the sound has to travel out and back). With a pulse interval of 5 ms (typical of a bat in the final moments of a capture attempt), the bat can only detect objects up to 85\u00a0cm away. Therefore, the bat constantly has to make a choice between getting new information updated quickly and detecting objects far away.\nTradeoff between FM and CF.\nFM signal advantages.\nThe major advantage conferred by an FM signal is extremely precise range discrimination, or localization, of the target. J. A. Simmons demonstrated this effect with a series of experiments that showed how bats using FM signals could distinguish between two separate targets even when the targets were less than half a millimeter apart. This ability is due to the broadband sweep of the signal, which allows for better resolution of the time delay between the call and the returning echo, thereby improving the cross correlation of the two. If harmonic frequencies are added to the FM signal, then this localization becomes even more precise.\nOne possible disadvantage of the FM signal is a decreased operational range of the call. Because the energy of the call is spread out among many frequencies, the distance at which the FM-bat can detect targets is limited. This is in part because any echo returning at a particular frequency can only be evaluated for a brief fraction of a millisecond, as the fast downward sweep of the call does not remain at any one frequency for long.\nCF signal advantages.\nThe structure of a CF signal is adaptive in that it allows the CF-bat to detect both the velocity of a target, and the fluttering of a target's wings as Doppler shifted frequencies. A Doppler shift is an alteration in sound wave frequency, and is produced in two relevant situations: when the bat and its target are moving relative to each other, and when the target's wings are oscillating back and forth. CF-bats must compensate for Doppler shifts, lowering the frequency of their call in response to echoes of elevated frequency \u2013 this ensures that the returning echo remains at the frequency to which the ears of the bat are most finely tuned. The oscillation of a target's wings also produces amplitude shifts, which gives a CF-bat additional help in distinguishing a flying target from a stationary one. The horseshoe bats hunt in this way.\nAdditionally, because the signal energy of a CF call is concentrated into a narrow frequency band, the operational range of the call is much greater than that of an FM signal. This relies on the fact that echoes returning within the narrow frequency band can be summed over the entire length of the call, which maintains a constant frequency for up to 100 milliseconds.\nAcoustic environments of FM and CF signals.\nAn FM component is excellent for hunting prey while flying in close, cluttered environments. Two aspects of the FM signal account for this fact: the precise target localization conferred by the broadband signal, and the short duration of the call. The first of these is essential because in a cluttered environment, the bats must be able to resolve their prey from large amounts of background noise. The 3D localization abilities of the broadband signal enable the bat to do exactly that, providing it with what Simmons and Stein (1980) call a \"clutter rejection strategy\". This strategy is further improved by the use of harmonics, which, as previously stated, enhance the localization properties of the call. The short duration of the FM call is also best in close, cluttered environments because it enables the bat to emit many calls extremely rapidly without overlap. This means that the bat can get an almost continuous stream of information \u2013 essential when objects are close, because they will pass by quickly \u2013 without confusing which echo corresponds to which call.\nA CF component is often used by bats hunting for prey while flying in open, clutter-free environments, or by bats that wait on perches for their prey to appear. The success of the former strategy is due to two aspects of the CF call, both of which confer excellent prey-detection abilities. First, the greater working range of the call allows bats to detect targets present at great distances \u2013 a common situation in open environments. Second, the length of the call is also suited for targets at great distances: in this case, there is a decreased chance that the long call will overlap with the returning echo. The latter strategy is made possible by the fact that the long, narrowband call allows the bat to detect Doppler shifts, which would be produced by an insect moving either towards or away from a perched bat.\nTaxonomic range.\nEcholocation occurs in a variety of mammals and birds as described below. It evolved repeatedly, an example of convergent evolution.\nBats.\nEcholocating bats use echolocation to navigate and forage, often in total darkness. They generally emerge from their roosts in caves, attics, or trees at dusk and hunt for insects into the night. Using echolocation, bats can determine how far away an object is, the object's size, shape and density, and the direction (if any) that an object is moving. Their use of echolocation, along with powered flight, allows them to occupy a niche where there are often many insects (that come out at night since there are fewer predators then), less competition for food, and fewer species that may prey on the bats themselves.\nEcholocating bats generate ultrasound via the larynx and emit the sound through the open mouth or, much more rarely, the nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (\"Rhinolophus spp.\"). Bat echolocation calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000\u00a0Hz, mostly beyond the range of the human ear (typical human hearing range is considered to be from 20\u00a0Hz to 20,000\u00a0Hz). Bats may estimate the elevation of targets by interpreting the interference patterns caused by the echoes reflecting from the tragus, a flap of skin in the external ear.\nIndividual bat species echolocate within specific frequency ranges that suit their environment and prey types. This has sometimes been used by researchers to identify bats flying in an area simply by recording their calls with ultrasonic recorders known as \"bat detectors\". However, echolocation calls are not always species specific and some bats overlap in the type of calls they use so recordings of echolocation calls cannot be used to identify all bats. Researchers in several countries have developed \"bat call libraries\" that contain \"reference call\" recordings of local bat species to assist with identification.\nWhen searching for prey they produce sounds at a low rate (10\u201320 clicks/second). During the search phase the sound emission is coupled to respiration, which is again coupled to the wingbeat. This coupling appears to dramatically conserve energy as there is little to no additional energetic cost of echolocation to flying bats. After detecting a potential prey item, echolocating bats increase the rate of pulses, ending with the terminal buzz, at rates as high as 200 clicks/second. During approach to a detected target, the duration of the sounds is gradually decreased, as is the energy of the sound.\nBat evolution.\nBats evolved at the start of the Eocene epoch, around 64 mya. The Yangochiroptera appeared some 55 mya, and the Rhinolophoidea some 52 mya.\nThere are two hypotheses about the evolution of echolocation in bats. The first suggests that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice, or more, in Chiroptera, at least once in the Yangochiroptera and at least once in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae):\nThe second proposes that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in Chiroptera, i.e. that it was basal to the group, and was subsequently lost in the family Pteropodidae. Later, the genus \"Rousettus\" in the Pteropodidae family evolved a different mechanism of echolocation using a system of tongue-clicking:\nCalls and ecology.\nEcholocating bats occupy a diverse set of ecological conditions; they can be found living in environments as different as Europe and Madagascar, and hunting for food sources as different as insects, frogs, nectar, fruit, and blood. The characteristics of an echolocation call are adapted to the particular environment, hunting behavior, and food source of the particular bat. The adaptation of echolocation calls to ecological factors is constrained by the phylogenetic relationship of the bats, leading to a process known as descent with modification, and resulting in the diversity of the Chiroptera today. Bats can inadvertently jam each other, and in some situations they may stop calling to avoid jamming.\nFlying insects are a common source of food for echolocating bats and some insects (moths in particular) can hear the calls of predatory bats. However the evolution of hearing organs in moths predates the origins of bats, so while many moths do listen for approaching bat echolocation their ears did not originally evolve in response to selective pressures from bats. These moth adaptations provide selective pressure for bats to improve their insect-hunting systems and this cycle culminates in a moth-bat \"evolutionary arms race\".\nNeural mechanisms.\nBecause bats use echolocation to orient themselves and to locate objects, their auditory systems are adapted for this purpose, highly specialized for sensing and interpreting the stereotyped echolocation calls characteristic of their own species. This specialization is evident from the inner ear up to the highest levels of information processing in the auditory cortex.\nInner ear and primary sensory neurons.\nBoth CF and FM bats have specialized inner ears which allow them to hear sounds in the ultrasonic range, far outside the range of human hearing. Although in most other aspects, the bat's auditory organs are similar to those of most other mammals, certain bats (horseshoe bats, \"Rhinolophus spp.\" and the moustached bat, \"Pteronotus parnelii\") with a constant frequency (CF) component to their call (known as high duty cycle bats) do have a few additional adaptations for detecting the predominant frequency (and harmonics) of the CF vocalization. These include a narrow frequency \"tuning\" of the inner ear organs, with an especially large area responding to the frequency of the bat's returning echoes.\nThe basilar membrane within the cochlea contains the first of these specializations for echo information processing. In bats that use CF signals, the section of the membrane that responds to the frequency of returning echoes is much larger than the region of response for any other frequency. For example, in the greater horseshoe bat, \"Rhinolophus ferrumequinum\", there is a disproportionately lengthened and thickened section of the membrane that responds to sounds around 83\u00a0kHz, the constant frequency of the echo produced by the bat's call. This area of high sensitivity to a specific, narrow range of frequency is known as an \"acoustic fovea\".\nEcholocating bats have cochlear hairs that are especially resistant to intense noise. Cochlear hair cells are essential for hearing sensitivity, and can be damaged by intense noise. As bats are regularly exposed to intense noise through echolocation, resistance to degradation by intense noise is necessary.\nFurther along the auditory pathway, the movement of the basilar membrane results in the stimulation of primary auditory neurons. Many of these neurons are specifically \"tuned\" (respond most strongly) to the narrow frequency range of returning echoes of CF calls. Because of the large size of the acoustic fovea, the number of neurons responding to this region, and thus to the echo frequency, is especially high.\nInferior colliculus.\nIn the Inferior colliculus, a structure in the bat's midbrain, information from lower in the auditory processing pathway is integrated and sent on to the auditory cortex. As George Pollak and others showed in a series of papers in 1977, the interneurons in this region have a very high level of sensitivity to time differences, since the time delay between a call and the returning echo tells the bat its distance from the target object. While most neurons respond more quickly to stronger stimuli, collicular neurons maintain their timing accuracy even as signal intensity changes. These interneurons are specialized for time sensitivity in several ways. First, when activated, they generally respond with only one or two action potentials. This short duration of response allows their action potentials to give a specific indication of the moment when the stimulus arrived, and to respond accurately to stimuli that occur close in time to one another. The neurons have a very low threshold of activation \u2013 they respond quickly even to weak stimuli. Finally, for FM signals, each interneuron is tuned to a specific frequency within the sweep, as well as to that same frequency in the following echo. There is specialization for the CF component of the call at this level as well. The high proportion of neurons responding to the frequency of the acoustic fovea actually increases at this level.\nAuditory cortex.\nThe auditory cortex in bats is quite large in comparison with other mammals. Various characteristics of sound are processed by different regions of the cortex, each providing different information about the location or movement of a target object. Most of the existing studies on information processing in the auditory cortex of the bat have been done by Nobuo Suga on the mustached bat, \"Pteronotus parnellii\". This bat's call has both CF tone and FM sweep components.\nSuga and his colleagues have shown that the cortex contains a series of \"maps\" of auditory information, each of which is organized systematically based on characteristics of sound such as frequency and amplitude. The neurons in these areas respond only to a specific combination of frequency and timing (sound-echo delay), and are known as combination-sensitive neurons.\nThe systematically organized maps in the auditory cortex respond to various aspects of the echo signal, such as its delay and its velocity. These regions are composed of \"combination sensitive\" neurons that require at least two specific stimuli to elicit a response. The neurons vary systematically across the maps, which are organized by acoustic features of the sound and can be two dimensional. The different features of the call and its echo are used by the bat to determine important characteristics of their prey. The maps include:\nWhales.\nBiosonar is valuable to both toothed whales (suborder Odontoceti), including dolphins, porpoises, river dolphins, killer whales and sperm whales, and baleen whales (suborder Mysticeti), including right, bowhead, pygmy right, and gray whales and rorquals, because they live in an underwater habitat that has favourable acoustic characteristics and where vision is often extremely limited in range due to absorption or turbidity. Odontocetes are generally able to hear sounds at ultrasonic frequencies while mysticetes hear sounds within the infrasonic frequency regime.\nWhale evolution.\nCetacean evolution consisted of three main radiations. Throughout the middle and late Eocene periods (49\u201331.5 million years ago), archaeocetes, primitive toothed Cetacea that arose from terrestrial mammals, were the only cetaceans. They did not echolocate, but had slightly adapted underwater hearing. By the late middle Eocene, acoustically isolated ear bones had evolved to give basilosaurid archaeocetes directional underwater hearing at low to mid frequencies. With the extinction of archaeocetes at the onset of the Oligocene (33.9\u201323 million years ago), two new lineages evolved in a second radiation. Early mysticetes (baleen whales) and odontocetes appeared in the middle Oligocene in New Zealand. Extant odontocetes are monophyletic (a single evolutionary group), but echolocation evolved twice, convergently: once in \"Xenorophus\", an Oligocene stem odontocete, and once in the crown odontocetes.\nPhysical restructuring of the oceans has played a role in the evolution of echolocation. Global cooling at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary caused a change from a greenhouse to an icehouse world. Tectonic openings created the Southern Ocean with a free flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current. These events encouraged selection for the ability to locate and capture prey in turbid river waters, which enabled the odontocetes to invade and feed at depths below the photic zone. In particular, echolocation below the photic zone could have been a predation adaptation to diel migrating cephalopods. The family Delphinidae (dolphins) diversified in the Neogene (23\u20132.6 million years ago), evolving extremely specialized echolocation.\nFour proteins play a major role in toothed whale echolocation. Prestin, a motor protein of the outer hair cells of the inner ear of the mammalian cochlea, is associated with hearing sensitivity. It has undergone two clear episodes of accelerated evolution in cetaceans. The first is connected to odontocete divergence, when echolocation first developed, and the second with the increase in echolocation frequency among dolphins. Tmc1 and Pjvk are proteins related to hearing sensitivity: Tmc1 is associated with hair cell development and high-frequency hearing, and Pjvk with hair cell function. Molecular evolution of Tmc1 and Pjvk indicates positive selection for echolocation in odontocetes. Cldn14, a member of the tight junction proteins which form barriers between inner ear cells, shows the same evolutionary pattern as Prestin. The two events of protein evolution, for Prestin and Cldn14, occurred at the same times as the tectonic opening of the Drake Passage (34\u201331 Ma) and Antarctic ice growth at the Middle Miocene climate transition (14 Ma), with the divergence of odontocetes and mysticetes occurring with the former, and the speciation of Delphinidae with the latter.\nThe evolution of two cranial structures may be linked to echolocation. Cranial telescoping (overlap between frontal and maxillary bones, and rearwards displacement of the nostrils) developed first in xenorophids. It evolved further in stem odontocetes, arriving at full cranial telescoping in the crown odontocetes. Movement of the nostrils may have allowed for a larger nasal apparatus and melon for echolocation. This change occurred after the divergence of the neocetes from the basilosaurids. The first shift towards cranial asymmetry occurred in the Early Oligocene, prior to the xenorophids. A xenorophid fossil (\"Cotylocara macei\") has cranial asymmetry, and shows other indicators of echolocation. However, basal xenorophids lack cranial asymmetry, indicating that this likely evolved twice. Extant odontocetes have asymmetric nasofacial regions; generally, the median plane is shifted to the left and structures on the right are larger. Both cranial telescoping and asymmetry likely relate to sound production for echolocation.\nMechanism.\nThirteen species of extant odontocetes convergently evolved narrow-band high-frequency (NBHF) echolocation in four separate events. These species include the families Kogiidae (pygmy sperm whales) and Phocoenidae (porpoises), as well as some species of the genus \"Lagenorhynchus\", all of \"Cephalorhynchus\", and the La Plata dolphin. NBHF is thought to have evolved as a means of predator evasion; NBHF-producing species are small relative to other odontocetes, making them viable prey to large species such as the orca. However, because three of the groups developed NBHF prior to the emergence of the orca, predation by other ancient raptorial odontocetes must have been the driving force for the development of NBHF, not predation by the orca. Orcas, and, presumably ancient raptorial odontocetes such as \"Acrophyseter\", are unable to hear frequencies above 100\u00a0kHz.\nAnother reason for variation in echolocation is habitat. For all sonar systems, the limiting factor deciding whether a returning echo is detected is the echo-to-noise ratio (ENR). The ENR is given by the emitted source level (SL) plus the target strength, minus the two-way transmission loss (absorption and spreading) and the received noise. Animals will adapt either to maximize range under noise-limited conditions (increase source level) or to reduce noise clutter in a shallow and/or littered habitat (decrease source level). In cluttered habitats, such as coastal areas, prey ranges are smaller, and species such as Commerson's dolphin (\"Cephalorhynchus commersonii\") have lowered source levels to better suit their environment.\nToothed whales emit a focused beam of high-frequency clicks in the direction that their head is pointing. Sounds are generated by passing air from the bony nares through the phonic lips. These sounds are reflected by the dense concave bone of the cranium and an air sac at its base. The focused beam is modulated by a large fatty organ known as the melon. This acts like an acoustic lens because it is composed of lipids of differing densities. Most toothed whales use clicks in a series, or click train, for echolocation, while the sperm whale may produce clicks individually. Toothed whale whistles do not appear to be used in echolocation. Different rates of click production in a click train give rise to the familiar barks, squeals and growls of the bottlenose dolphin. A click train with a repetition rate over 600 per second is called a burst pulse. In bottlenose dolphins, the auditory brain response resolves individual clicks up to 600 per second, but yields a graded response for higher repetition rates.\nIt has been suggested that the arrangement of the teeth of some smaller toothed whales may be an adaptation for echolocation. The teeth of a bottlenose dolphin, for example, are not arranged symmetrically when seen from a vertical plane. This asymmetry could possibly be an aid in sensing if echoes from its biosonar are coming from one side or the other; but this has not been tested experimentally.\nEchoes are received using complex fatty structures around the lower jaw as the primary reception path, from where they are transmitted to the middle ear via a continuous fat body. Lateral sound may be received through fatty lobes surrounding the ears with a similar density to water. Some researchers believe that when they approach the object of interest, they protect themselves against the louder echo by quietening the emitted sound. In bats this is known to happen, but here the hearing sensitivity is also reduced close to a target.\nOilbirds and swiftlets.\nOilbirds and some species of swiftlet are known to use a relatively crude form of echolocation compared to that of bats and dolphins. These nocturnal birds emit calls while flying and use the calls to navigate through trees and caves where they live.\nTerrestrial mammals.\nTerrestrial mammals other than bats known or thought to echolocate include shrews, the tenrecs of Madagascar, Chinese pygmy dormice, and solenodons. Shrew sounds, unlike those of bats, are low amplitude, broadband, multi-harmonic and frequency modulated. They contain no echolocation clicks with reverberations, and appear to be used for simple, close range spatial orientation. In contrast to bats, shrews use echolocation only to investigate their habitat rather than to pinpoint food. There is evidence that blinded laboratory rats can use echolocation to navigate mazes.\nCountermeasures.\nSome insects that are predated by bats have anti-predator adaptations, including predator avoidance, attack deflection, and ultrasonic clicks which appear to function as warnings rather than echolocation jamming.\nTiger moths (Arctiidae) of different species (two thirds of the species tested) respond to simulated attack by echolocating bats by producing an accelerating series of clicks. The species \"Bertholdia trigona\" has been shown to jam bat echolocation: when pit against na\u00efve big brown bats, ultrasound was immediately and consistently effective at preventing bat attack. Bats came in contact with silent control moths 400% more often than with \"B. trigona\".\nMoth ultrasound can also function to startle the bat (a bluffing tactic), warn the bat that the moth is distasteful (honest signalling, aposematism), or mimic chemically defended species. Both aposematism and mimicry have been shown to confer a survival advantage against bat attack.\nThe greater wax moth (\"Galleria mellonella\") takes predator avoidance actions such as dropping, looping, and freezing when it detects ultrasound waves, indicating that it can both detect and differentiate between ultrasound frequencies used by predators and signals from other members of their species. Some members of the \"Saturniidae\" moth family, which includes giant silk moths, have long tails on the hindwings, especially those in the Attacini and Arsenurinae subgroups. The tails oscillate in flight, creating echoes which deflect the hunting bat's attack from the moth's body to the tails. The species \"Argema mimosae\" (the African moon moth), which has especially long tails, was the most likely to evade capture.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "69279", "revid": "19349497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69279", "title": "Angioplasty", "text": "Procedure to widen narrow arteries or veins\nAngioplasty, also known as balloon angioplasty and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, is a minimally invasive endovascular procedure used to widen narrowed or obstructed arteries or veins, typically to treat arterial atherosclerosis.\nA deflated balloon attached to a catheter (a balloon catheter) is passed over a guide-wire into the narrowed vessel and then inflated to a fixed size. The balloon forces expansion of the blood vessel and the surrounding muscular wall, allowing an improved blood flow. A stent may be inserted at the time of ballooning to ensure the vessel remains open, and the balloon is then deflated and withdrawn. Angioplasty has come to include all manner of vascular interventions that are typically performed percutaneously.\nUses and indications.\nCoronary angioplasty.\nA coronary angioplasty is a therapeutic procedure to treat the stenotic (narrowed) coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary heart disease. These stenotic segments of the coronary arteries arise due to the buildup of cholesterol-laden plaques that form in a condition known as atherosclerosis. A percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary angioplasty with stenting, is a non-surgical procedure used to improve the blood flow to the heart.\nCoronary angioplasty is indicated for coronary artery diseases such as unstable angina, NSTEMI, STEMI and spontaneous coronary artery perforation. Percutaneous coronary intervention for stable coronary disease has been shown to significantly relieve symptoms such as angina, or chest pain, thereby improving functional limitations and quality of life.\nPeripheral angioplasty.\nPeripheral angioplasty refers to the use of a balloon to open a blood vessel outside the coronary arteries. It is most commonly done to treat atherosclerotic narrowings of the abdomen, leg and renal arteries caused by peripheral artery disease. Often, peripheral angioplasty is used in conjunction with guide wire, peripheral stenting and an atherectomy.\nChronic limb-threatening ischemia.\nAngioplasty can be used to treat advanced peripheral artery disease to relieve the claudication, or leg pain, that is classically associated with the condition.\nThe bypass versus angioplasty in a study of severe ischemia of the leg investigated infrainguinal bypass surgery first compared to angioplasty first in select patients with severe lower limb ischemia who were candidates for either procedure. In this study, angioplasty was associated with less short term morbidity compared with bypass surgery; however, long term outcomes favor bypass surgery.\nBased on this study, the ACCF/AHA guidelines recommend balloon angioplasty only for patients with a life expectancy of 2 years or less or those who do not have an autogenous vein available. For patients with a life expectancy greater than 2 of years life, or who have an autogenous vein, a bypass surgery could be performed first.\nRenal artery angioplasty.\nRenal artery stenosis is associated with hypertension and loss of renal function. Atherosclerotic obstruction of the renal artery can be treated with angioplasty with or without stenting of the renal artery. There is a weak recommendation for renal artery angioplasty in patients with renal artery stenosis and flash edema or congestive heart failure.\nCarotid angioplasty.\nCarotid artery stenosis can be treated with angioplasty and carotid stenting for patients at high risk for undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Although carotid endarterectomy is typically preferred over carotid artery stenting, stenting is indicated in select patients with radiation-induced stenosis or a carotid lesion not suitable for surgery.\nVenous angioplasty.\nAngioplasty is used to treat venous stenosis affecting dialysis access, with drug-coated balloon angioplasty proving to have better 6 month and 12 month patency than conventional balloon angioplasty. Angioplasty is occasionally used to treat residual subclavian vein stenosis following decompression surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. There is a weak recommendation for deep venous stenting to treat obstructive chronic venous disease.\nContraindications.\nAngioplasty requires an access vessel, typically the femoral or radial artery or femoral vein, to permit access to the vascular system for the wires and catheters used. If no access vessel of sufficient size and quality is available, angioplasty is contraindicated. A small vessel diameter, the presence of posterior calcification, occlusion, hematoma, or an earlier placement of a bypass origin, may make access to the vascular system too difficult.\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is contraindicated in patients with left main coronary artery disease, due to the risk of spasm of the left main coronary artery during the procedure. It is also not recommended if there is less than 70% stenosis of the coronary arteries, as stenosis is not hemodynamically significant below this level.\nTechnique.\nAccess to the vascular system is typically gained percutaneously (through the skin, without a large surgical incision). An introducer sheath is inserted into the blood vessel via the Seldinger technique. Fluoroscopic guidance uses magnetic resonance or X-ray fluoroscopy and radiopaque contrast dye to guide angled wires and catheters to the region of the body to be treated in real time. Tapered guidewire is chosen for small occlusion, followed by intermediate type guidewires for tortuous arteries and difficulty passing through extremely narrow channels, and stiff wires for hard, dense, and blunt occlusions.\nTo treat a narrowing in a blood vessel, a wire is passed through the stenosis in the vessel and a balloon on a catheter is passed over the wire (= OTW) and into the desired position. The positioning is verified by fluoroscopy and the balloon is inflated using water mixed with contrast dye to 75 to 500 times normal blood pressure (6 to 20 atmospheres), with most coronary angioplasties requiring less than 10 atmospheres. A stent may or may not also be placed.\nAt the conclusion of the procedure, the balloons, wires and catheters are removed and the vessel puncture site is treated either with direct pressure or a vascular closure device.\nTransradial artery access and transfemoral artery access are two techniques for percutaneous coronary intervention. Transradial artery access is the technique of choice for management of acute coronary syndrome as it has significantly lower incidence of bleeding and vascular complications compared with the transfemoral artery approach. It also has a mortality benefit for high risk patients with acute coronary syndrome and who are at high risk of bleeding. Transradial artery access was also found to yield improved quality of life, as well as decreased healthcare costs and resources.\nRisks and complications.\nRelative to surgery, angioplasty is a lower-risk option for the treatment of the conditions for which it is used, but there are unique and potentially dangerous risks and complications associated with angioplasty:\nAngioplasty may also provide a less durable treatment for atherosclerosis and be more prone to restenosis relative to vascular bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting. Drug-eluting balloon angioplasty has significantly less restenosis, late lumen loss and target lesion revascularization at both short term and midterm follow-up compared to uncoated balloon angioplasty for femoropopliteal arterial occlusive disease. Although angioplasty of the femoropopliteal artery with paclitaxel coated stents and balloons significantly reduces rates of vessel restenosis and target lesion revascularization, it was also found to have increased risk of death.\nAdjunctive therapy.\nRotational Atherectomy, or \"rotablation\", is a technique used to treat heavily calcified coronary artery lesions by ablating plaque with a diamond-encrusted burr rotating at high speeds. It improve vessel lumens for balloon dilation and stent implantation. While effective for complex cases like calcification of nodules and tortuous vessels, its use is limited by procedural complexity, lack of training, and a need for specialized equipment. High procedural success rates are reported, especially with skilled operators, but careful patient selection is crucial to minimize complications. Studies show RA's efficacy in comparison to alternative techniques, particularly for challenging lesions.\nAtherectomy is an adjunctive therapy used for lesion preparation of calcified plaque before percutaneous coronary intervention. The goal of lesion preparation with atherectomy is to modify calcified plaque, which changes the lesion compliance and allows for adequate balloon and stent expansion in segments with heavily calcified lesions.\nAtherectomy techniques.\nRotational Atherectomy.\nRotational atherectomy modifies plaque through rotational ablation using a diamond-tipped burr that spins concentrically on the wire. This technique is particularly useful for heavily calcified lesions that are resistant to balloon angioplasty.\nOrbital Atherectomy.\nOrbital atherectomy employs an eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown that orbits within the vessel, sanding down calcified deposits. This method has a reduced risk of burr entrapment compared to rotational atherectomy.\nExcimer Laser Coronary Angioplasty.\nExcimer laser coronary angioplasty uses pulsatile ultraviolet laser energy to precisely ablate plaque tissue. It is effective in modifying undilatable and uncrossable lesions, facilitating subsequent balloon angioplasty and stent deployment.\nAtherectomy is a valuable adjunctive therapy for patients with coronary artery disease, particularly those with severely calcified lesions where traditional balloon angioplasty and stenting may be insufficient. Its success depends on the selection of appropriate devices and the operator's expertise in managing the technical nuances to minimize complications. Studies have demonstrated that atherectomy can enhance procedural success rates and long-term outcomes in complex cases. However, further research and standardized protocols are needed to address challenges and expand its clinical applications effectively.\nRecovery.\nAfter angioplasty, most patients are monitored overnight in the hospital, but if there are no complications, patients are sent home the following day.\nThe catheter site is checked for bleeding and swelling and the heart rate and blood pressure are monitored to detect late rupture and hemorrhage. Post-procedure protocol also involves monitoring urinary output, cardiac symptoms, pain and other signs of systemic problems. Usually, patients receive medication that will relax them to protect the arteries against spasms. Patients are typically able to walk within two to six hours following the procedure and return to their normal routine by the following week.\nAngioplasty recovery consists of avoiding physical activity for several days after the procedure. Patients are advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for a week. Patients will need to avoid physical stress or prolonged sport activities for a maximum of two weeks after a delicate balloon angioplasty.\nAfter the initial two week recovery phase, most angioplasty patients can begin to safely return to low-level exercise. A graduated exercise program is recommended whereby patients initially perform several short bouts of exercise each day, progressively increasing to one or two longer bouts of exercise. As a precaution, all structured exercise should be cleared by a cardiologist before commencing. Exercise-based rehabilitation following percutaneous coronary intervention has shown improvement in recurrent angina, total exercise time, ST-segment decline, and maximum exercise tolerance.\nPatients who experience swelling, bleeding or pain at the insertion site, develop fever, feel faint or weak, notice a change in temperature or color in the arm or leg that was used or have shortness of breath or chest pain should immediately seek medical advice.\nPatients with stents are usually prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy which consists of a P2Y12 inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, which is taken at the same time as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended for 1 month following bare metal stent placement, for 3 months following a second generation drug-eluting stent placement, and for 6\u201312 months following a first generation drug-eluting stent placement. Dual antiplatelet therapy's properties are intended to prevent blood clots; however, they increase the risk of bleeding, so it is important to consider each patient's preferences, cardiac conditions, and bleeding risk when determining the duration of its treatment. Another important consideration is that concomitant use of clopidogrel and proton-pump inhibitors following coronary angiography is associated with significantly higher adverse cardiovascular complications such as major adverse cardiovascular events, stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction.\nHistory.\nAngioplasty was first described by the US interventional radiologist Charles Dotter in 1964. Dotter pioneered modern medicine with the invention of angioplasty and the catheter-delivered stent, which were first used to treat peripheral arterial disease. On January 16, 1964, Dotter percutaneously dilated a tight, localized stenosis of the subsartorial artery in an 82-year-old woman with painful leg ischemia and gangrene who refused leg amputation. After successful dilation of the stenosis with a guide wire and coaxial Teflon catheters, the circulation returned to her leg. The dilated artery stayed open until her death from pneumonia two and a half years later. Charles Dotter is commonly known as the \"Father of Interventional Radiology\" and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1978.\nThe first percutaneous coronary angioplasty on an awake patient was performed in Zurich by the German cardiologist Andreas Gruentzig on September 16, 1977.\nThe first percutaneous coronary angioplasties in the United States were performed on the same day (March 1, 1978) by Simon H. Stertzer at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York and Richard K. Myler at St. Mary's Hospital in San Francisco. During the previous year, also at St. Mary's Hospital in San Francisco, Myler and Gruentzig had performed dilatations in the setting of bypass surgery to test the catheter concept before Gruentzig performed the first percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in his catheterization lab in Zurich.\nThe initial form of angioplasty was 'plain old balloon angioplasty' without stenting, until the invention of bare metal stents in the mid-1980s to prevent the abrupt closure that sometimes occurred plain old balloon angioplasty.\nBare metal stents were found to cause in-stent restenosis as a result of neointimal hyperplasia and stent thrombosis, which led to the invention of drug-eluting stents with anti-proliferative drugs to combat in-stent restenosis.\nThe first coronary angioplasty with a drug delivery stent system was performed by Stertzer and Luis de la Fuente, at the Instituto Argentino de Diagn\u00f3stico y Tratamiento (English: Argentina Institute of Diagnosis and Treatment) in Buenos Aires, in 1999.\nIngemar Henry Lundquist invented the over-the-wire balloon catheter that is now used in the majority of angioplasty procedures in the world.\nA subset of angioplasty, known as excimer laser coronary angioplasty, uses excimer lasers to remove small amounts of tissue, including undilatable and uncrossable lesions, in the artery in order to allow the balloon to more effectively compress plaque into the artery walls. Such work was first developed in 1984 following earlier work in 1980\u20131983, when Rangaswamy Srinivasan, Samuel Blum and James J. Wynne at IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center observed the effect of the ultraviolet excimer laser on biological materials. Intrigued, they investigated further, finding that the laser made clean, precise cuts that would be ideal for delicate surgeries. This resulted in a fundamental patent and Srinivasan, Blum and Wynne were elected to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2012, the team members were honored with National Medal of Technology and Innovation by the President Barack Obama for their work related to the excimer laser. Robert Ginsburg deployed the first used of excimer laser coronary angioplasty in 1984 on a patient with severe stenosis of the deep femoral artery and a threatened limb.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He appears in Acts 13:6-12, where in Paphos, Paul, accompanied by Barnabas and John Mark, overcame the attempts of Elymas \"to turn the proconsul away from the faith\" and converted Sergius to Christianity.\nArchaeology.\nA boundary stone of Claudius mentioning Sergius was discovered at Rome in 1887. It records the appointment (AD 47) of the Curators of the banks and the channel of the river Tiber, one of whom was Sergius. Since Paul's journey to Cyprus is usually dated to the first half of the 40s (and some scholars date his visit even earlier), it is thought Sergius may have first served three years as Proconsul at Cyprus, then returned to Rome, where he was appointed curator of the Tiber. Another inscription was discovered in 1887 at Soli, Cyprus, by Luigi Palma di Cesnola which mentions a proconsul Paulus. This inscription was dated to the middle of the 1st century by D. G. Hogarth. Terence Mitford noted that based on epigraphic grounds the inscription cannot be dated earlier than this and is probably considerably later. As he is not greeted in Paul's Epistle to the Romans, it is possible he died before it was written.\nContext.\nWriting in the 4th century, Jerome speculated that Saul of Tarsus had been renamed Paul (\"Paulus\") because he had converted Sergius Paulus to Christianity: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"For as Scipio assumed the name of Africanus for himself when Africa was subjugated...so also Saulus, who was sent to preach to the nations, brought back from the initial spoils of the church, the proconsul Sergius Paulus, the trophy of his victory, and he raised a standard so that he was called Paulus.\"\nSome medieval legends misidentified Sergius Paullus as Paul of Narbonne.\nSergius Paulus may have been the first of several successive senators named Lucius Sergius Paullus, of Antioch, Pisidia, including one who was consul suffectus c.\u200970, and another who was twice consul, Lucius Sergius Paullus, the father of Sergia Paulla, who married Quintus Anicius Faustus, Legate of Numidia in 198, and had Quintus Anicius Faustus Paulinus, governor of Moesia Inferior between 229 and 232.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In recognition of his service to the Holy Roman Empire, he was granted the titles of \"Imperial Count\" and \"Imperial Vicar of Lombardy\", along with lordship over Asti and Ivrea.\nA prominent medieval ruler, he played a pivotal role in expanding and consolidating the House of Savoy's influence across regions that today form parts of France, Italy, and Switzerland.\nLife.\nAmadeus was the son of Thomas II of Savoy and Beatrice Fieschi. Through his mother he was a grandnephew of Pope Innocent IV. Following his marriage to Sybille of B\u00e2g\u00e9 in 1272, Amadeus began life in the service of his cousin, King Edward I of England, as a household knight, serving in the First Welsh War of 1277. During the Second Welsh War of 1282, he was in command of Edward's forces at Chester that relieved the siege of Rhuddlan Castle.\nHis childless paternal uncle, Count Philip I of Savoy, died in 1285. Meanwhile, earlier, in 1282, his elder brother, Thomas III of Piedmont, had accidentally died in 1282. Philip's will charged his niece Eleanor of Provence and her son Edward I of England with the inheritance of Savoy. Amadeus was awarded the County of Savoy, and in order to diminish family rivalry, his younger brother Louis was awarded the new Barony of Vaud, becoming Louis I of Vaud.\nThrough his marriage to Sybilla, Countess of Bugey and Bresse, he was able to incorporate these Burgundian districts into his states. Later expansion saw his dominions further increased. On 1 October 1285, Amadeus was declared protector of Geneva after negotiations with the Bishop of Geneva. The hereditary title belonged to Amadeus II, Count of Geneva, who was in conflict with the Bishop.\nIn 1287, Amadeus besieged the castle of Ile in the Rh\u00f4ne near Geneva and captured it after fourteen weeks. In 1295, Amadeus acquired the fortress at Chamb\u00e9ry from its previous owner Hugh of La Rochette. He brought Georges de Aquila, a student of Giotto from Florence, to his court. Georges decorated the castle with paintings, carved wood, and frescoes. He worked there for the Savoyards until he died in 1348.\nMilitary victories over the Amadeus II of Geneva and Humbert I Dauphin of Viennois, leading to the occupation of the city of Geneva in June 1287, led to the Treaty of Annemasse signed on 18 November 1287, whereby they submitted themselves as his vassals. During the 1294\u20131303 Gascon War, he acted as an agent of King EdwardI of England in the negotiations that led to the 1299 Treaty of Montreuil and the 1303 Treaty of Paris; separately, he arranged for the marriage of EdwardI with Margaret of France. In 1301, Amadeus also settled his dispute over control of Valais with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sion. His reign, however, also saw friction between the County of Savoy and the Duchy of Austria. He pursued an alliance with the Kingdom of France and received Maul\u00e9vrier in Normandy as a result of initial good relations.\nThe eventual recovery of Lyon by the kings of France alerted Amadeus to their expansionistic tendencies towards the regions by the Alps. He sought a powerful ally against potential hostility in the German king Henry VII, who was married to Margaret of Brabant, the sister-in-law of Amadeus. Amadeus accompanied Henry in his Italian campaign of 1310\u20131313, which culminated in Henry's coronation as Holy Roman Emperor on 29 June 1312. As a reward for his service, Amadeus received the title of Imperial Count, imperial vicar of Lombardy, and the lordships of Asti and Ivrea. Henry also elevated Aosta and Chablais to duchies, though they remained a part of the realm of Savoy.\nIn 1315, Amadeus assisted the Knights Hospitaller in the defense of Rhodes against the Turks. He died in Avignon on 16 October 1323.\nFamily and children.\nHe first married Sybille de Baug\u00e9, daughter of Guy I Damas de Baug\u00e9, Baron of Couzan (c.1230\u20131269) and Dauphine de Lavieu, and had eight children by her:\nIn 1297, he married, secondly, Marie of Brabant, who was a daughter of John I, Duke of Brabant and Margaret of Flanders. Her maternal grandparents were Guy of Dampierre and his first wife, Matilda of Bethune.

He was a member of the House of Savoy, a prominent European noble family.\nEarly life.\nAymon was born in Chamb\u00e9ry. His father was Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, and he was the younger brother of Edward, Count of Savoy.\nCareer.\nIn 1321, Aymon oversaw the siege engines at the siege of Corbi\u00e8res. On the death of Amadeus V in 1323, Aymon was lord of Bresse under Edward.\nAs a younger son of a noble family, Aymon had planned on a life in the church. When Edward died in 1329, Aymon was in Avignon at the court of Pope John XXII.\nIn 1329, shortly after becoming count, Aymon established a committee to settle the territorial disputes with his cousin, Amadeus III of Geneva. These disputes had been an ongoing feud between the families for generations, but they were able to resolve them through years of negotiations without resorting back to war. This was how Aymon earned his nickname of 'The Peaceful'.\nHe contested the title Count of Savoy with his niece, Joan of Savoy since Savoy operated under Salic law and had never had a female ruler. Joan with the support of her husband, John III, Duke of Brittany defended Joan's claim. John and Joan had no issue. Eventually, a settlement was reached whereby Aymon obtained the Countship in return for providing a monetary payment to Joan.\nHe spent much of his first few years as count at war with the Dauphin, Guigues VIII of Viennois, continuing a feud which went back for generations in their families. After Guigues was killed besieging La Perri\u00e8re in 1333, Philip VI of France was able to broker a truce between Aymon and the new Dauphin, Humbert II of Viennois, brother of Guigues.\nIn August 1334, in the buildup to the Hundred Years' War, Edward III of England sent an embassy to Aymon to convince him to join the impending conflict on the side of the English. Aymon declined to commit, as he held lands both in England and in Normandy, so was technically a subject of both kings. In April 1337, Philip sent similar messages on the other side. Aymon replied that he could not go abroad to fight as he still had territorial disputes with the Dauphin\u00e9. Philip quickly settled a more lasting peace, as Humbert was trying to sell the Dauphin\u00e9. Aymon then led his forces as part of the French war effort from 1339 to 1342. He often fought alongside Amadeus III of Geneva.\nIn 1330, Aymon established a chancellor's office to manage official documents. He financed the expansion of a burial chapel at the Hautecombe Abbey which was constructed from 1331 to 1342. In 1340, he set up judges to specifically handle appeals at a level between the castellans and himself, to ease his workload in such cases.\nMarriage and Children.\nPrior to his marriage, Aymon also fathered several illegitimate children, who were raised in his household, even after his marriage. These included:\nIn 1330, Aymon married Yolande Palaeologina of Montferrato granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and had 5 children, only 2 lived to adulthood:\nYolande died on 24 December 1342, in childbirth. Aymon became ill in the following months and died on 22 June 1343. He was buried alongside his wife in a chapel of Hautecombe Abbey.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The custom lapsed a millennium, however, before re-emerging in the earliest Israelite tombs, dating to the 9th century BCE in Jerusalem. The use of rock-cut tombs reached its peak in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, before rapidly declining and eventually falling out of use in the 6th century BCE in some regions. It reappeared during the Second Temple period and continued into the Late Roman and Byzantine periods.\nUse of the tombs has been recorded as recently as the late Roman period around the 3rd century CE.\nRock-cut tombs were a form of burial and interment chamber used in ancient Israel. Cut into the landscapes surrounding ancient Judean cities, their design ranges from single chambered, with simple square or rectangular layouts, to multi-chambered with more complex designs. Almost all burial chambers contain a platform for primary burial and an ossuary or other receptacle for secondary burial. There is debate on if these tombs were originally intended for secondary burials, or if that practice arose later.\nThe use of such tombs was generally reserved for the middle- and upper-classes, and each typically belonged to a single nuclear or extended family.\nIn the Hebrew Bible.\nGenesis.\nA number of rock-cut tombs are mentioned in the Bible. Possibly the first, called \"Cave of Machpelah\", was purchased by Abraham for Sarah from Ephron the Hittite (). Traditionally, this tomb, which may have been either a rock-cut or a natural cave, is identified with the Cave of the Patriarchs in modern Hebron. According to very old traditions, Abraham, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah were also buried there (). The New Testament reaffirms this tradition: \"Their (Jacob and his family) bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money\" ().\nJudges through Kings.\nRock-cut tombs are also mentioned in the Book of Judges (), the Second Book of Samuel (), and the Second Books of Kings ().\nBronze Age precursors: Early Canaanite tombs.\nEarly Canaanite I (3100\u20132900 BCE) period tombs are the earliest rock-cut tombs yet discovered in Israel; several have been found beneath the Ophel in Jerusalem. The custom had lapsed by the second millennium.\nIron Age: First Temple period.\nJerusalem.\nRock-cut tombs from the late First Temple period have been discovered in several locations in Jerusalem, the capital city of the Kingdom of Judah. These include the Silwan necropolis, Ketef Hinnom, the Garden Tomb, and St. Etienne.\nSilwan Necropolis.\nThe Silwan necropolis, the most important cemetery of the First Temple period, is located in the Kidron Valley across from the City of David, in the lower part of the ridge where the village of Silwan now stands. Assumed to have been used by the highest-ranking officials residing in Jerusalem, its tombs were cut between the 9th and 7th centuries BCE.\nDavid Ussishkin wrote that the architecture of the tombs and the manner of burial is different \"from anything known from contemporary Palestine. Elements such as entrances located high above the surface, gabled ceilings, straight ceilings with a cornice, trough-shaped resting-places with pillows, above-ground tombs, and inscriptions engraved on the facade appear only here.\" The stone benches on which bodies were laid out and the small square entrance doors are similar to those found elsewhere in Judah. Ussishkin believes that the architectural similarity to building styles of the Phoenician cities validates the Biblical description of Phoenician influence on the Israelite kingdoms.\nThere are three different types of tombs in the Silwan necropolis, each type concentrated in one specific area. Seven of the tombs feature gabled ceilings and extremely fine stonework. Ussishkin described them as \"among the most beautifully rock-cut tombs known in the Jerusalem area even when compared with tombs of later periods.\" In contrast with the extensive family tombs of later periods, these are for single or double burials, with only one of the seven having room for three bodies. Later destruction has effaced the original doorways. A second tomb type described by Ussishkin has flat ceilings and one, two, or three chambers of well-dressed stone carefully squared into spacious rooms. One features a rear chamber of especially \"impressive\" scale and quality. There are tombs combining characteristics of the two described here above. The third type consists of just three \"magnificent\" monolith tombs, now located in the northern part of the village. These have been carved out of the cliff to create free-standing buildings above the underground burial chambers. Hebrew inscriptions survive on these three tombs; these are the only ancient inscriptions that survive in Silwan.\nSecond Temple period.\nRock-cut tombs, which had been absent from Judea since the First Temple period, made a comeback during the Hasmonean era of the Second Temple period, but they were only used by the elites.\nPrimary burials.\nAt the beginning of the Hasmonean period, under the influence of Hellenistic burial customs from Marisa, members of the elite were buried in wooden coffins inside shafts known in Latin as \"loculi\" and in Hebrew as \"kokhim\". Later, in the area of Jerusalem, primary burials took place either in \"kokhim\", or in arched niches known in Latin as \"arcosolia\".\nHowever, the regular type of burial during the Early Roman period (c. 63 BCE \u2013 70 CE), used by the non-elite population, was done in trenches. Trench burials were quite varied, with one or two bodies, either in primary or secondary burial, with even a case of an infant buried in a jar coming to light. If such a simple grave was hewn into the rock, archaeologists speak of a cist tomb (Keddie 2019, p.\u00a0227).\nSome support the theory that in the Galilee, rock-cut tombs only had a comeback after the destruction of Jerusalem and the influx of refugees from Judaea after 70 CE (Keddie 2019, p.\u00a0237).\nSecondary burials.\nElite burials happened in two phases, the second burial consisting in collecting the bones after the decomposition of the body and placing them in specific places within the tomb \u2013 a procedure known as \"ossilegium\". During the early Hasmonean period at Jericho, the bones were placed back in the primary burial niches or on benches. Around 20\u201315 BCE, Judaean elites started using ossuaries made of limestone, a custom that continued in the Jerusalem area until little after 70 CE (Keddie 2019, p.\u00a0230). The very large, monumental tombs of elite families from the Late Hellenistic period, often capped by pyramids or accompanied by impressive markers known as \"nefesh\", are giving way in the Early Roman period to such enhanced by elaborate and refined facade relief decorations (Keddie 2019, p.\u00a0229).\nJerusalem.\nDuring the Second Temple period, Jerusalem was encircled by a belt of rock-cut tombs, which were built outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem in every direction, but predominantly to the north and south of the city. The tombs extend as far as 7\u00a0km from the city walls, with the more prestigious tombs located close to the city. This necropolis was established during the Hellenistic period but underwent significant growth during the Herodian period. Poor people's graves, which were likely just simple graves excavated in the dirt, have not been preserved, and the roughly 800 tombs that have been preserved to this day belonged to aristocratic and middle-class families.\nThe most elaborate group of tombs was in the Kidron Valley across from the Temple Mount. These include the Tomb of Benei Hezir, that belonged to a priestly family also known from the Hebrew Bible, with the adjacent so-called Tomb of Zechariah monument (actually not a tomb), and the Tomb of Absalom along with the Cave of Jehoshaphat located behind it.\nAmong the notable tombs are the Jason's Tomb, a large, elaborate, family tomb with multiple chambers and inscriptions in both Hebrew and Greek and the impressive sepulcher monument popularly known as the Tombs of the Kings, which is actually the tomb of Queen Helena of Adiabene and her relatives. Constructed circa 50 CE, this is the only funeral monument that can be positively recognized which was recorded by ancient writers, such as Josephus, Pausanias, Eusebius, and Jerome.\nThe elaborate Tombs of the Sanhedrin lie to the north of the city. They were so called by later generations because the largest of them contains 70 chambers with burial benches, and the Sanhedrin had seventy members. Each of the three tombs would actually have contained the burials of a single, multi-generational, wealthy family. They were constructed between the reign of Herod and 70 CE.\nThe cruciform, 5-chamber, so-called \"Herod's Family Tomb\", a burial cave complex located behind King David Hotel on King David Street in a park in the general area of Yemin Moshe, is built of perfectly cut and joined Herodian-type ashlars and was found to still contain two \"in situ\" decorated sarcophagi, all dated to the first century BCE. Its popular name stuck in spite of another tomb near the Damascus Gate being long considered as the actual funerary tower of Herod's family, which again was contradicted by the finds at Herodium.\nThe Church of the Holy Sepulchre contains remains of at least seven 2nd Temple-period tombs, including the one considered by Christian tradition to be that of Jesus, and a relatively well-preserved kochim tomb opening from the western apse of the Constantinian Rotunda.\nSamaria and the Hebron Hills.\nElaborate rock-cut tombs with designs resembling those found in Jerusalem of the late Second Temple period were discovered in multiple sites in Western Samaria, including Khirbet Kurkush, Deir ed-Darb and Mokata 'Aboud, and in the Western Hebron Hills, including Khirbat al-Simia, Rujm el-Fihjeh and Khirbet el Jof. The great similarity between these tombs and the Jerusalem tombs, and the lack of a local Hellenistic prototype, have led the researchers to the assumption that the decorated tombs in western Samaria and western Hebron Hills are not the result of an internal development of the burial system there but rather the result of a deliberate copying of the Jerusalem tombs, at the special request of local, affluent families.\nMost researchers concur that these tombs date from the same period as the Jerusalem tombs that were served as a model for replication, however, Magen thinks otherwise: in his opinion, the visible difference in the quality of the design and carving between the tombs indicates a chronological gap between them, and therefore he suggests dating the tombs of West Samaria and the Western Hebron Hills later than the Jerusalem tombs, at the end of the first century or the beginning of the second century. Magen also raised the possibility that their hewing is connected to the flight of Jewish craftsmen to Samaria and the Hebron Hills with the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem and perhaps even a little earlier, when the construction enterprises in the city began to dwindle and many quarrymen were left without employment.\nPeleg-Barkat distincts between the rock-cut tombs of western Samaria and those of the western Hebron Hills. She asserts that while the tombs in western Samaria mimic the Jerusalem style, the tombs in the Hebron Hills show both Judean and Nabataean influences at once and do not attempt to copy the facade decorations of the Jerusalem tombs. She dates the tombs to the period before the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, although it's possible that the practice of construction in the Jerusalem style continued after that. The occurrence suggests that the elaborate tombs of the elite in Jerusalem had an effect on the local elites in the towns and rural villages of early Roman Judaea.\nTomb of Jesus: Gospels and archaeology.\nThe Gospel of Matthew mentions the newly rock-cut tomb of Joseph of Arimathea ().\nProposed candidates for the tomb include the rock-cut chamber inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Talpiot Tomb, and the Garden Tomb.\nLate Roman and Byzantine periods.\nBeit She'arim.\nThe ruins of Beit She'arim (Sheikh Abrekh in Arabic) in the Galilee preserve a vast necropolis with catacombs containing a large number of rock-cut Jewish tombs from the late 2nd to 6th centuries CE. The ancient city of Besara, today known as Beit She'arim, was located near what is now the modern town of Tiv'on. According to various sources, it was one of the most highly desired burial places for Jews in the ancient world, second only to the Mount of Olives in its desirability. This prestige is attributed to Beit She'arim being named as the burial place of Yehuda HaNasi (Judah the Prince).\nLayout.\nSecond Temple through Late Roman periods.\nTombs included a \"dromos\", or entry-way, through which the tomb was accessed via a descending staircase. Some tombs possess elaborate facades, with the tombs of Be'it She'arim being well known for this feature. Others, such as those outside of Jericho, had simple exteriors with a rectangular blocking stone or mudbrick. The simplest tombs feature a single, square chamber with a recess in the center with benches along its edges to allow space for visitors to stand. Into the surrounding walls, save for the side of the \"dromos\", were carved \"loculi\" approximately 2 meters in length. In more complex tombs, an interment room followed the entrance, in which the deceased's remains were laid on stone benches to decompose. A repository served as an ossuary and secondary burial site to house the remains of the newly deceased with those of ancestors past. The repository also served to receive offerings to the deceased. The chambers of common rock-tombs were about 2.5\u2009m \u00d7 3\u2009m and laid out sequentially; however some had a more complex architecture of clustered and adjoining chambers \u2013 with the level of complexity relating to social status.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was taken by a king of Assyria, probably Sargon II, cited in the Hebrew Bible in 2 Kings 17:24, 31; 18:34; 19:13; and Isaiah 37:13). It was a double city, and received the common name Sepharvaim, i.e., \"the two Sipparas\", or \"the two booktowns\".\nThe Sippar on the east bank of the Euphrates is now called Abu-Habba; that on the other bank was Akkad, the old capital of Sargon I, where he established a great library. The recent discovery of cuneiform inscriptions at Amarna in Egypt, consisting of official despatches to Pharaoh Amenophis IV. and his predecessor from their agents in Canaan, leads some Egyptologists to conclude that an active literary intercourse was carried on between these nations, and that the medium of the correspondence was the Akkadian language and script. (See Kirjath Sepher.)\nSepharvaim was the center of the worship of the god Adrammelech. They also worshipped the god Anammelech. After the deportation of the Israelites to Assyria, at least some of the residents of this city were brought to Samaria to repopulate it with other Gentile settlers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution.\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}
{"id": "69297", "revid": "4770293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69297", "title": "Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy", "text": "Count of Savoy from 1343 to 1383\nAmadeus VI (4 January 1334 \u2013 1 March 1383), nicknamed the Green Count () was Count of Savoy from 1343 to 1383. He was the eldest son of Aymon, Count of Savoy and Yolande Palaeologina of Montferrat. Though he began his rule under a regency, Amadeus quickly proved to be a decisive and capable leader, further advancing Savoy's rise as a political and military force in Europe. His most notable achievement was leading and personally financing the Savoyard Crusade against the Turks, during which he successfully aided the Byzantine emperor and extended Savoy's influence through both warfare and diplomacy.\nEarly years.\nWhen his father died in 1343, Amadeus inherited the County of Savoy. Since he was only nine years old, his father's will left two cousins as co-regents: Amadeus III of Geneva and Louis II of Vaud. The two agreed to a document limiting their power as regents. Neither could make any significant decision without the other, and the decisions of both were subject to review by the resident council of nobles representing all bailis in the county.\nShortly after Amadeus took the county, his cousin Joan of Savoy renewed her claim on the county of Savoy, that she was descended from Amadeus's uncle Edward, Count of Savoy, though her claim had previously been denied under Savoy's Semi-Salic tradition. Though she died the following year, in her will she left the county to Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans to spite her cousins. In 1345, he negotiated a similar settlement to the one Joan reached with Aymon, yielding the claim in exchange for 5000 livres annually.\nAmadeus was educated both physically and mentally. He enjoyed learning to fight and ride. His education included classic works such as De Re Militari and more modern texts, including De Regimine Principum. He also showed religious devotion, requesting a portable altar and the right for his chaplain to say mass for him every morning wherever he may be. He took vows to fast more often than was healthy for him, and then asked Pope Clement VI to release him from these vows. The pope agreed, asking him instead to feed twelve of the poor weekly.\nWhen the young Angevin queen Joanna I of Naples took the throne, several in northern Italy sought to take advantage of her inexperience and seize her lands there. John II, Marquess of Montferrat led the first attacks, while James of Piedmont, a cousin and vassal of Amadeus, backed the queen. After her first army was defeated in 1345, the attackers moved next into the territory ruled by James. In 1347, James asked Amadeus for help, and Amadeus sent an army. That army swept the attackers back through July of that year, with Amadeus joining the fighting in the last few weeks. John then recruited the help of Humbert II, Dauphin of Viennois, an old enemy of the Savoyards, and Thomas II, Marquess of Saluzzo. Together, they conquered the Angevin lands. Pope Clement VI spent 1348 negotiating a truce to end the fighting, which none of the combatants were satisfied with.\nFrom 1348 through 1351, the Black Death ravaged the lands of Savoy, halving the population in some villages. In 1348, many of the peasants thought that it was caused by Jews poisoning wells and fountains. Though the castellans in some places tried to protect them, quite a few were killed. In Chamb\u00e9ry, the Jews were locked in the castle for their protection, but a mob broke in and killed several. Court officers were then pressured into finding the remainder guilty of poisoning, executing eleven and charging the remainder a fine of 160 florins per month for the next six years.\nIn 1349, Amadeus agreed to a treaty between himself, Amadeus of Geneva, James of Piedmont, and the House of Visconti, rulers of Milan, for mutual defence and assistance. This treaty included provisions for Galeazzo II Visconti to marry Bianca of Savoy, sister of the count. To honour the marriage in 1350, Amadeus created the Order of the Black Swan.\nIn 1349, Humbert II de La Tour du Pin, Dauphin de Viennois, the last Dauphin de Viennois, surrendered his title and principality to the future Charles V of France. At the time, the new Dauphin was the grandson of the current King Philip VI of France and son of his heir apparent, the latter John II of France. Humbert II retired into a Dominican monastery.\nCount of Savoy.\nIn 1350, Guichard Tavel, the bishop of Sion and an ally of Savoy, attempted to take the rights of some nobles in Valais, a frontier of Savoy. When he and his followers were attacked in August 1351, Pope Clement VI excommunicated the rebels, and Amadeus sent in thirty knights. Eight thousand peasants rose up in response and captured a couple of castles. A further one hundred knights were sent in and pushed the rebels back. In March 1352, Amadeus assembled an army, including Amadeus of Geneva and John of Montferrat, and the count swept through the valley in April. The rebels yielded quickly, and Amadeus re-established the authority over Sion that his uncle Edward had lost.\nIn the summer of 1352, Hugh of Geneva, uncle of Amadeus of Geneva and a noble within the Dauphin\u00e9, re-ignited the long-standing feud with Savoy. The count of Savoy insulted Amadeus of Geneva's honour related to the treaty he had negotiated between Savoy and the Dauphin\u00e9, and so Amadeus of Geneva left the council and challenged one of the others, William de la Baume, who had replaced Louis of Vaud on the council. On 6 June 1352, the Count of Savoy made an alliance with Albert II, Duke of Austria for mutual aid in conflict. Amadeus of Savoy gathered an army from his Italian lands to bring to war. As they were crossing the Alps, the rebellion in Valais and Sion broke out anew. Amadeus turned his army there first, and on 3 November defeated the rebels soundly. On the morning of the fourth, his advisor, William, knighted him. He then had part of the wall of Sion torn down, and his army pillaged the city. He also fined the citizens heavily.\nHe earned the nickname \"the Green Count\" when, in celebration of his 19th birthday in 1353, he appeared in a series of tournaments dressed with green plumes upon his helm, a green silk tabard over his armour, and his horse bearing green caparisons. He entered with an escort of eleven knights dressed in green, each led by a lady also dressed in green, leading her knight's steed with a green cord. From then on, green was the favourite colour for his clothes and for his court.\nIn the spring of 1353, Amadeus prepared his army to attack the Dauphin\u00e9. John II of France intervened and settled a truce in July, as he was hoping to use both armies in Gascony against the English, continuing the Hundred Years' War. However, Hugh immediately broke the truce. Amadeus besieged Hugh's forces in Gex from 26 October through 11 November, when Amadeus defeated and burned the city. Pope Innocent VI and John both sent delegations to negotiate a truce, but Amadeus and Hugh continued their fight until April 1354. The fighting ended then when Amadeus destroyed Hugh's army near Les Abrets.\nIn a treaty concluded in Paris in 1355, Amadeus agreed to exchange territory in Dauphin\u00e9 beyond the rivers Rhone and Guiers, in exchange for recognition as the undisputed sovereign of Faucigny and the county of Gex, as well as becoming the suzerain lord over the Counts of Genevois, all of whose titles had been the subject of earlier contention between the Counts of Savoy and the Dauphins of Viennois. Amadeus also forced the Marquess of Saluzzo to pay him tribute, thus extending his rule to the Italian side of the Alps.\nAmadeus was appointed Imperial vicar of Arelat by Emperor Charles IV in 1365 in an attempt, which did not succeed, to revive the imperial hold on the Kingdom of Arles (Arelat). The following year, Charles IV ceded his rights to the crown of Arles to Louis I of Anjou after, however, transferring the County of Savoy to the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Germany.\nCrusade, 1366.\nAmadeus initiated a minor crusade (with 15 ships and 1,700 men) in 1366 against Murad I of the Ottoman Empire to aid his cousin, John V Palaiologos, the Byzantine Emperor, son of the Dowager Empress, Anne of Savoy. In this campaign, Amadeus joined forces with Francesco I of Lesbos, and the Hungarian king Louis the Great, and they drove the Turks from Gallipoli. (This victory was short-lived, though, for they lost Gallipoli to the Turkish Sultan Murad I a few years later.) At this time, John V was held captive by the Bulgarians. Amadeus turned his forces against Bulgaria and captured the Black Sea ports of Mesembria and Sozopolis. He then laid siege to Varna and sent Tsar Ivan Alexander an ultimatum to release John V or suffer further defeat. Ivan Alexander released John V, and Amadeus returned to spend the winter in Mesembria, arriving there with John V before Christmas.\nLater years.\nFrom 1372 to 1373, he fought alongside Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy in Italy as a part of the Papal forces against the Visconti family.\nIn 1377, he ordered the installation of the first public mechanical clock in the region and established an officer to maintain it. He created a system of state-supported poor relief, one of the first of its kind in the late medieval world.\nIn 1381 at Turin, he mediated between Genoa and Venice and sponsored the peace treaty which brought an end to the War of Chioggia and the larger Venetian-Genoese War. The Republic of Genoa and the Republic of Venice had for long argued over the ownership of the island of Tenedos in the Aegean Sea near the Dardanelles. Eventually, it was agreed under the Treaty of Turin that as a compromise the island, after being depopulated and demilitarised, should be formally entrusted to Amadeus, Count of Savoy, a cousin to the Palaiologos imperial family.\nLater, Amadeus would be persuaded by Antipope Clement VII (Avignon Obedience) to accompany Louis I, Duke of Anjou on an expedition to Naples. Here in 1382, the Count would share with Louis in the successful conquests of Abruzzi and Apulia. He died near Castropignano on 27 February 1383 and was interred at Hautecombe Abbey on 15 June 1383.\nAmadeus was credited with purchasing the territory of the mountain pass, the Col de Largenti\u00e8es, today Maddalena Pass on the border of France and Italy. This purchase took place in 1388, after his death, for the sum of 60,000 ecus.\nMarriage and children.\nThroughout his youth, negotiations took place for him to marry a royal bride. In 1338, he was engaged to Margaret of Bohemia, a three-year-old daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. From 1340 to 1344, he was betrothed to Joanna of Bourbon, niece of Philip VI of France. This marriage would have come with a dowry of fifty thousand florins. In 1347, he renounced that engagement, and became engaged instead to Joan of Burgundy, daughter of Philip of Burgundy and Joan I, Countess of Auvergne. This would have placed Amadeus as heir to her brother, Philip I, Duke of Burgundy. The three-year-old heiress was brought to the court of Savoy to be raised. In the summer of 1351, Amadeus sent to Edward III of England, seeking to marry his daughter, Isabella. This petition was protested by Amadeus of Geneva. Joan remained at the court until 18 April 1355, when she was sent to a convent in Poissy to live out her life.\nHe was married in 1355 in Paris to Bonne of Bourbon, the sister-in-law of Charles V of France. They had three children:\nIn literature.\nAmadeus is one of the main characters in the New Weird novel \"La luce di Orione\" (2007) by Valerio Evangelisti. He is also a supporting character in the \"Chivalry\" series by Christian Cameron, with his epithet providing the title of the third novel, \"The Green Count\" (2017).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At Cambridge, he was a member of a Labour Party club and described himself as a socialist, in later life describing himself as a one-nation conservative. He joined the BBC in 1972, initially at BBC Radio Brighton, relocating to London in 1977. In following years, he worked on \"Tonight\" and \"Panorama\", becoming a newsreader for the \"BBC Six O'Clock News\" and later a presenter on \"Breakfast Time\" and \"University Challenge\".\nIn 1989, he became a presenter for the BBC Two programme \"Newsnight\", interviewing many political figures. Paxman became known for his forthright interviewing style, particularly when interrogating politicians. These appearances were sometimes criticised as aggressive, intimidating and condescending, yet also applauded as tough and incisive. In 2014, Paxman left \"Newsnight\" after 25 years as its presenter. Since then, he has done occasional work for \"Channel 4 News\". From its revival in 1994 up until he stepped down from the show in 2023, he presented \"University Challenge\" and its Christmas spin-off from 2011 to 2022. In 2022, he announced he was standing down, as he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\nEarly life and education.\nPaxman was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of steel company employee and former Royal Navy lieutenant and typewriter salesman (Arthur) Keith Paxman, who left the family and settled in Australia, and Joan McKay (n\u00e9e Dickson; 1920\u20132009). Keith Paxman's father was a worsted spinner, who became sufficiently prosperous as a travelling sales representative to send his son to public school in Bradford. The Dickson family were wealthier, with Keith's father-in-law, a self-made success, paying the Paxman children's school fees.\nPaxman is the eldest of four children: one of his brothers, Giles Paxman (1951\u22122025), was the British ambassador to Spain (having previously been ambassador to Mexico), and the other, James (born 1953), is chief executive of the Dartmoor Preservation Association. His sister, Jenny (born 1957), is a producer at BBC Radio.\nPaxman was brought up in Hampshire, Bromsgrove, and Peopleton near Pershore in Worcestershire. He went to Malvern College in 1964, and later read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he edited the university student newspaper \"Varsity\". While at Cambridge, Paxman was briefly a member of the Cambridge Universities Labour Club, attending only one meeting, finding student politics \"self-important and trivial at the same time.\" He has since been made an honorary fellow of the College.\nIn January 2006, Paxman was the subject of an episode of the BBC genealogy series \"Who Do You Think You Are?\". The documentary concluded that he was descended from Roger Packsman, a 14th-century politician from Suffolk who had changed his name to Paxman to impress the electorate ( being Latin for 'peace'). Paxman's maternal grandmother was born in Glasgow, Scotland. The programme generated much publicity before its transmission by displaying him with tears in his eyes on camera when informed that his impoverished great-grandmother Mary McKay's poor relief had been revoked because she had a child out of wedlock.\nCareer.\nJournalism.\nPaxman joined the BBC's graduate trainee programme in 1972. He started in local radio, at BBC Radio Brighton. He moved to Belfast, where he reported on the Troubles. He moved to London in 1977. Two years later he transferred from the \"Tonight\" programme to \"Panorama\". After five years reporting from places such as Beirut, Uganda and Central America, he read the \"Six O'Clock News\" for two years, before moving to BBC1's \"Breakfast Time\" programme.\n\"Newsnight\" (1989 \u2014 2014).\nPaxman became a presenter of \"Newsnight\" in 1989.\nOn 13 May 1997 he interviewed Michael Howard, who had been Home Secretary until 13 days earlier after he had held a meeting with Derek Lewis, head of Her Majesty's Prison Service, about the possible dismissal of the governor of Parkhurst Prison, John Marriott. Howard was asked by Paxman the same question \u00a0\u2013 \"Did you threaten to overrule him [Lewis]?\" \u00a0\u2013 a total of twelve times in succession (fourteen, if the first two inquiries worded somewhat differently and some time before the succession of twelve are included).\nDuring a 20th anniversary edition of \"Newsnight\" in 2000, Paxman told Howard that he had simply been trying to prolong the interview because the next item in the running order was not ready: \"By the time I'd asked the question five or six times\u00a0... it was clear\u00a0... that you [Howard] weren't going to answer it\u00a0... at which point a voice came in my ear and said 'The next piece of tape isn't cut, you'd better carry on with this for a while' and I'm afraid I couldn't think of anything else to ask you.\"\nIn 1998, Denis Halliday, a United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator, resigned his post in Iraq, describing the effects of his own organisation's sanctions as genocide. Paxman asked Halliday in a \"Newsnight\" interview, \"Aren't you just an apologist for Saddam Hussein?\"\nIn February 2003, Paxman was criticised by the Broadcasting Standards Commission over a \"Newsnight\" interview in which he questioned the then Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy about his drinking. The commission said that the questioning was \"overly intrusive in nature and tone and had exceeded acceptable boundaries for broadcast\".\nIn 2003, Prime Minister Tony Blair opted to make the case for the invasion of Iraq via questions from a TV studio audience, mediated by Paxman. The programme is chiefly remembered for the fact that Paxman asked Blair if he and U.S. President Bush prayed together. Blair replied, \"No, Jeremy. We don't pray together.\" To which Paxman replied, \"But why not?\"\nDuring the 2005 general election, some viewers complained to the BBC that Paxman's questioning of party leaders had been rude and aggressive. He was criticised for his 5\u00a0am interview with George Galloway after his election as the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow by the just defeated Oona King. Paxman asked Galloway more than once whether he was proud of having got rid of \"one of the very few black women in Parliament.\" Galloway cut the interview short. King later said she \"did not wish to be defined, by either [her] ethnicity or religious background.\"\nOn 11 April 2012, Paxman interviewed Russell Brand about Brand's political views and the article he wrote for the \"New Statesman\". The interview went viral as Brand stated that it was \"futile\" to vote and that a \"political revolution\" was needed. After this interview, Paxman revealed that he had not voted either in some previous elections.\nOn 26 June 2012, he interviewed the Economic Secretary to the Treasury Chloe Smith about Chancellor George Osborne's decision that day to delay plans to increase fuel duty. Paxman questioned the apparent change in her views on fuel duty. Senior politicians, including John Prescott, questioned Osborne's judgement for sending a junior minister onto the programme in place of himself.\nThe BBC announced Paxman's departure from \"Newsnight\" at the end of April 2014. He had told Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the director-general of the BBC, and James Harding, the BBC head of news, that he wished to leave in July 2013, but agreed to stay on \"Newsnight\" for another year after the programme had been damaged by the Savile and Lord McAlpine scandals. In his statement Paxman commented: \"After 25 years, I should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people.\"\nPaxman's brusque manner is not restricted to political interviews. When around 2005 \"Newsnight\"'s editor decided to broadcast brief weather forecasts instead of financial reports Paxman openly ridiculed the decision: \"The forecast: it's April, what do you expect?\" The financial reports were re-introduced after a few weeks.\nPaxman presented his last \"Newsnight\" on 18 June 2014 in an edition which included an interview with Peter Mandelson and one with London Mayor Boris Johnson, while they both rode a tandem bicycle, as well as a brief reappearance of Michael Howard who, following on from his 1997 interview, was simply asked: \"Did you?\". The closing theme was replaced with \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\" by The New Seekers. The programme ended with a brief post-credits scene with Paxman standing in front of a weather map exclaiming \"Tomorrow's weather: more of the same! I don't know why they make such a fuss about it\" in reference to the 2005 weather forecasts.\nOther TV work.\nPaxman has presented the weekly TV programme review \"Did You See...?\" and \"You Decide\". From 1994 to 2023, he was the quizmaster for \"University Challenge\", bringing him the distinction of \"longest-serving current quizmaster on British TV.\" In 2013, the BBC received 44 complaints after Paxman's \"acerbic\" remarks caused a 20-year-old contestant to repeatedly apologise for answering a question wrong. In October 2022, an ITV documentary, \"Paxman: Putting Up With Parkinson's\", revealed how the disease has impacted him and revealed that Paxman recorded his very last episode of \"University Challenge\" on 15 October 2022, which aired on 29 May 2023. He presented a weekly compilation of highlights from the domestic edition of \"Newsnight\" from February 2008 until shortly after the 2008 U.S. election on BBC America and BBC World, when the American programme was cancelled. The programme is still aired on BBC World.\nIn April 2006, \"The Sun\" claimed that Paxman earned \u00a3800,000 for his \"Newsnight\" job and \u00a3240,000 for presenting \"University Challenge\", bringing his TV earnings to a yearly total of \u00a31,040,000. This was one of a series of BBC salary leaks in the tabloid press that prompted an internal BBC investigation.\nPaxman appeared as himself in an episode of BBC comedy \"The Thick of It\" that aired in January 2007. He is seen grilling Junior Minister Ben Swain (played by Justin Edwards) in a disastrous \"Newsnight\" interview.\nBeginning on 15 February 2009, Paxman's four-part documentary \"The Victorians\" was transmitted on BBC One. The series explores Victorian art and culture. From 27 February until 26 March 2012, BBC One broadcast his series \"Empire\", examining the history and legacy of the British Empire.\nIn 2014, Paxman presented \"Britain's Great War\", an accompaniment to his 2013 book \"Great Britain's Great War\".\nOn 26 March 2015, Paxman co-presented, with Kay Burley, \"David Cameron and Ed Miliband Live: The Battle for Number 10\", in which he interviewed both British Prime Minister David Cameron and Opposition Leader Ed Miliband regarding their track record in politics and their plans if elected Prime Minister in the general election set for May of that year. He also hosted Channel 4's Alternative Election Night with David Mitchell. He then later co-presented a similar programme with Faisal Islam, interviewing Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May before the 2017 general election on 29 May, \"May v Corbyn Live: The Battle for Number 10\".\nBooks.\nPaxman's first book, \"A Higher Form of Killing\" (1982), written with then BBC colleague and friend Robert Harris, arose out of an edition of the \"Panorama\" programme they had made together on biological and chemical warfare. In a revised 2002 version they asserted that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons. In 1985, Paxman published \"Through the Volcanoes: A Central American Journey\", an eyewitness account of people, places and politics. \"Friends in High Places: Who Runs Britain?\" (1991) was the result of numerous detailed interviews with the powerful or highly influential, what used to be called The Establishment. 1999 saw the publication of his \"The English: A Portrait of a People\". \"The Political Animal: An Anatomy\" (2003), again based on extensive interviews, examines the motivations and methods of those who constitute the author's professional prey: Westminster politicians.\nThe otherwise-republican Paxman's \"On Royalty\", which entailed the cooperation of Britain's Royal Family, became by the time it was published in 2006 a defence of the country's constitutional monarchy. His recent books have been big sellers. His history book, \"The Victorians: Britain through the Paintings of the Age\", published in 2009, was accompanied by a BBC documentary series. In his introduction, Paxman acknowledged that the Irish writer Neil Hegarty had played a significant role in editing the book and bringing it to completion. Paxman stated that since all television is a \"collaborative exercise\", it was \"rather silly for this book \u2013 which accompanies a television series \u2013 to appear with only one name on the cover.\" Paxman's most recent book is a study of the British Empire, \"Empire: What Ruling the World Did to the British\".\nPaxman kept a detached tone while writing his memoir, \"A Life in Questions\", which was published in October 2016.\nRadio.\nPaxman presented the flagship BBC Radio 4 show \"Start the Week\" from 1998 to 2002.\nPodcast.\nSince March 2023 Paxman has contributed to a podcast 'Movers and Shakers' which is \"about life with Parkinson's\". Recordings are made in a Notting Hill pub and presenters (Rory Cellan-Jones, Gillian Lacey-Solymar, Mark Mardell, Paul Mayhew-Archer, Sir Nicholas Mostyn and Jeremy Paxman) discuss \"the highs and lows, trials and tribulations, of living with the condition\". In March 2024 The UK Broadcasting Press Guild made 'Movers and Shakers' its 'UK Podcast of the Year'.\nOther positions.\nPaxman is a Vice-President of The London Library.\nPaxman and the BBC.\nDuring John Birt's tenure as director-general of the BBC, the British press occasionally reported Paxman's criticism of Birt. Birt was suspected at first to be an outsider brought in by a hostile government to supervise the BBC's break-up and ultimate sell-off. Birt then publicly questioned the confrontational approach of certain TV and radio interviewers. This was seen at the time as coded criticism of Paxman himself and of his BBC colleague John Humphrys.\nOn 24 August 2007, Paxman delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. In it he was critical of much of contemporary television in Britain. He expressed concern that as a consequence of recent production scandals the medium was \"rapidly losing public trust\". Speaking of prime minister Tony Blair's criticism of the mass media at the time he left office, Paxman asserted that, though often, press and broadcasting may be \"oppositional\" in relation to the government of the day, this \"could only benefit democracy\". \"Those Reithian goals, to 'inform, educate and entertain,' still remained valid\". Paxman took the opportunity to dismiss as \"inaccurate\" the attribution to him, which was in fact, Louis Heren, of the oft-quoted \"Why is this lying bastard lying to me?\" as the supposed dominant thought in his mind when interviewing senior politicians. He called on the television industry to \"rediscover a sense of purpose\".\nIn November 2012, Paxman publicly defended George Entwistle following his resignation as director-general of the BBC in connection with a \"Newsnight\" report which falsely implicated Lord McAlpine in the North Wales child abuse scandal. Paxman claimed Entwistle had been \"brought low by cowards and incompetents\" and criticised appointments of \"biddable people\" to the BBC in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry, as well as cuts to BBC programme budgets and \"bloated\" BBC management.\nIn August 2013, Paxman appeared on \"Newsnight\" with a beard, causing a Twitter trend when he accused the BBC of having an aversion to beards.\nAwards and honours.\nIn 1996 Paxman received BAFTA's Richard Dimbleby Award for \"outstanding presenter in the factual arena.\" Two years later he won the Royal Television Society's Interviewer of the Year Award for his \"Newsnight\" interview (see above) with Michael Howard, as well as the Broadcasting Press Guild's award for best \"non-acting\" performer. He gained another Richard Dimbleby Award in 2000 and was nominated for the award in 2001 and 2002. In total, Paxman has won five Royal Television Society awards. He won the award for International Current Affairs in 1985, and TV journalism interviewer/presenter of the year four times (1997, 1998, 2001 and 2008).\nPaxman was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Leeds in the summer of 1999 and in December that year received an honorary degree from the University of Bradford. In 2006 he received an honorary doctorate from the Open University. Among those at the ceremony were three members of the Open University's 1999 \"University Challenge\" team. Paxman is a Fellow by special election of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and an Honorary Fellow of his \"alma mater\", St. Catharine's College, Cambridge. In July 2016, Paxman was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Exeter for achievements in the field of broadcasting and journalism.\nHe is played by Nicholas Rowe in the 2025 ITV drama about the News International phone hacking scandal, \"The Hack\".\nPersonal life.\nPaxman formerly lived with television producer Elizabeth Clough in Stonor, southeast Oxfordshire. They have three children. The couple, who did not marry, amicably separated in 2016 after 35 years together. He prefers to keep his private life \"out of the spotlight\" and says he is not interested in the private lives of others. He has a flat in Kensington, London.\nPaxman supports Leeds United and enjoys fly fishing. He is vice-chairman of the Wild Trout Trust conservation charity. He is also a patron of the charity Sustrans and east London homeless charity Caritas Anchor House.\nIn his twenties, Paxman unsuccessfully applied for the vacant editorship of the Labour-supporting weekly, the \"New Statesman\"; he said that in his youth he considered himself a socialist. He had previously stood as a communist candidate in his school elections. More recently, he has been described as \"the archetypal floating voter\", and Jon Snow once said that Paxman's greatest strength was being \"not very political\". In 2014, Paxman described himself as a one-nation conservative. Elsewhere, Paxman has stated that he has no dominant political ideology:\nAs part of a 2009 campaign by the Parkinson's Disease Society Paxman, along with Jane Asher and John Stapleton, pledged to donate his brain to Parkinson's research following his death.\nIn June 2014, Paxman, speaking at the Chalke Valley History Festival about his new book, \"Britain's Great War\", said that \"Newsnight\" was made by \"idealistic 13-year-olds\" who \"foolishly thought they could change the world\". \"Look, \"Newsnight\" is made by 13-year-olds. It's perfectly normal when you're young that you want to change the world,\" Paxman said. \"The older you get, the more you realise what a fools' errand much of that is and that the thing to do is to manage the best you can to the advantage of as many people as possible.\" Speaking about his political views in general, he said he was \"in favour of governments getting out of people's lives \u2013 particularly foreign government\", saying Europe had been \"nothing but trouble for us\". He also joked that Belgium was a \"pointless little country\". \"The closer you can take decision-making to the people affected by those decisions, the better.\"\nIn 2019, in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" on Australia's Nine Network, Paxman said he voted remain in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum (initially intending to vote leave), but believed the result had to be respected:\nPaxman became a focus of media attention in October 2000 when a German Enigma machine, which had been stolen from Bletchley Park Museum, was inexplicably sent to him in the post. He returned it to the museum.\nIn an interview with Emily Dean on a Times Radio podcast, Paxman described his experience with depression. He said that he takes psychiatric medication and has undergone Cognitive behavioural therapy. He stated that he regularly walks his dog, Derek, which \"helps as he meets people\", and that his dog \"makes him laugh\".\nIn September 2021, whilst promoting his book \"Black Gold: The History of How Coal Made Britain\", Paxman revealed his support for Scottish independence. Talking to \"The Sunday Times\", he said, \"My view about the Union is that if there is to be a referendum then the English should be allowed a vote as well. We are supposedly a nation of equals, so we should be equally entitled to a vote. And although I am a quarter Scottish I would vote to separate, I think. Because I can't see what is gained by persistently giving the Jocks an excuse. We're always going to be friends.\"\nPaxman revealed in May 2021 that he is receiving treatment for Parkinson's disease, describing his symptoms as \"mild\". Shan Nicholas of Parkinson's UK said, \"Previously, Jeremy pledged to donate his brain to the Parkinson's UK Brain Bank which will, one day, help scientists uncover the discoveries that will lead to better treatments and a cure for Parkinson's.\"\nIn October 2022 an ITV documentary, \"Paxman: Putting Up With Parkinson's\", revealed how the disease has impacted him \u2013 the programme showed him attending a ballet class, learning to play bowls, meeting experts and observing a brain dissection. He met Sharon Osbourne, the wife of musician and fellow Parkinson's sufferer Ozzy Osbourne, to discuss the role of a partner or family carer; he agreed to her suggestion to one day try cannabidiol oil to relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's. The programme revealed that Paxman recorded his last episode of \"University Challenge\" on 15 October 2022.\nIn April 2024 Paxman delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street with recommendations concerning NHS treatment of patients with Parkinson's Disease, which he commented \"may not kill you but it will make you wish you hadn't been born.\"\nControversies.\nWhile presenting a \"Newsnight\" segment in 2005, Paxman referred to Secretary of State for Health John Reid as an \"attack dog\". In response, Reid accused Paxman of criticising him due to Reid's Glaswegian accent. Paxman responded to Reid's comment by stating that he admired his \"knowledge\" and \"strength of character\", but could not understand why Reid went \"doolally\" over Paxman's criticism of him, further claiming that it was \"extremely bizarre\" that certain Scottish people had a \"chip on their shoulder\" over their nationality. He went on to state that \"I mean down here we live under a sort of Scottish Raj... I don't see why there is any reason for them to feel chippy. Do we complain about it? No we don't. I think it's absurd. I don't understand wherein lies this angst.\" In reaction to Paxman's statements on Scotland, twenty Scottish MPs, including Jim Sheridan, Iain Luke and Brian Donohoe, signed a House of Commons motion criticising the statements as \"insulting, irresponsible, divisive and snobbish\". \nIn 2008, Paxman's employment of domestic workers became the subject of public attention after the \"News of the World\" newspaper published an article about two Romanian nationals who had been employed by Paxman. The article contained testimonies from the two workers, who criticised Paxman for treating them \"like a common serving girl\" and paying wages of only \u00a3200 per week, which was under the British minimum wage (though as the two were live-in workers the minimum wage did not apply to them). They also criticised Paxman for not giving them an official employment contract or paid time off. In the same year, Paxman was the subject of further controversy when he described the work of Scottish poet Robert Burns as \"sentimental doggerel\" in the introduction of the 2008 edition of \"Chambers Dictionary\". \nOn a \"Newsnight\" segment aired on 31 May 2012, Paxman, discussing the possibility of a Greek withdrawal from the eurozone, stated that Greece, \"like a bad kebab\", faced the possibility of being \"vomited out of the single currency\". This statement was criticised in the same segment by the Greek Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change Giorgos Papakonstantinou, who told Paxman during an interview that \"Can I take issue with your 'bad kebab' analogy, which I find offensive. The Greek economy is in a crisis and the Greek people are going through a lot, and deserve some respect, and I really did not find that very appropriate.\" While appearing on \"The Graham Norton Show\" in 2013, Paxman referred to British Prime Minister David Cameron as a \"complete idiot\" for his role in Britain's First World War centenary commemorations. In response, MP Rob Wilson wrote to the director-general of the BBC, Lord Hall, to demand an apology from Paxman. In an interview conducted in the same year with Russell Brand, Paxman revealed that he had not voted at a recent election due to finding the available candidates \"unappetising\", which led to criticism from Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.\nJohn Pilger has raised Paxman's membership of the British-American Project in the context of political biases of mainstream media.\nPaxman was criticised for his presentation of the BBC documentary \"Britain's Great War\". While describing how British conscientious objectors were jailed and threatened with the death penalty because killing was against their beliefs, Paxman ventured his own opinion that it was the objectors themselves who were at fault, and that they were \"extreme\". The conscientious objectors, Paxman said, \"have always struck me as cranks\".\nIn 2017, Paxman's interviews of Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May for the upcoming general election were described by journalist Michael Deacon as \"embarrassing\". Deacon opined that Paxman's pugnacious style of questioning had become tired, claiming that he had been \"doing an impression of himself\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located in the U.S. state of Illinois, the river has a drainage basin of . The Illinois River begins with the confluence of the Des Plaines and Kankakee rivers in the Chicago metropolitan area, and it generally flows to the southwest across Illinois, until it empties into the Mississippi near Grafton, Illinois. Its drainage basin extends into southeastern Wisconsin, northwestern Indiana, and a very small area of southwestern Michigan in addition to central Illinois. Along its banks are several river ports, including the largest, Peoria, Illinois. Historic and recreation areas on the river include Starved Rock, and the internationally important wetlands of the Emiquon Complex and Dixon Waterfowl Refuge.\nThe river was important among Native Americans and French traders as the principal water route connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi. The French colonial settlements along these rivers formed the heart of the area known as the Illinois Country in the 17th and 18th centuries. After the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the Hennepin Canal in the 19th century, the role of the river as link between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi was extended into the era of modern industrial shipping. The Illinois now forms the basis for the Illinois Waterway, extending the river's capabilities for navigation and commercial shipping.\nHydrography.\nThe Illinois River is formed by the confluence of the Kankakee River and the Des Plaines River in eastern Grundy County, approximately southwest of Joliet. Its other major tributaries include the Fox, Vermilion, Macoupin, Mackinaw, Spoon, Sangamon, and La Moine. This river flows west across northern Illinois, passing Morris and Ottawa, where it is joined by the Mazon River and Fox River respectively. At LaSalle, the Illinois River is joined by the Vermilion River, and then it flows west past Peru and Spring Valley. In southeastern Bureau County it turns south at an area known as the \"Great Bend\", flowing southwest across western Illinois, past Lacon, Henry and downtown Peoria, the chief city on the river.\nSouth of Peoria, the Illinois River goes by East Peoria and Creve Coeur and then Pekin in Tazewell County. It is then joined by the Mackinaw River, and then passes through the Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge. Across from Havana, the Illinois is joined by the Spoon River coming from Fulton County, and across from Browning, it is joined by the Sangamon River, which passes through the state capital, Springfield, Illinois. The La Moine River flows into it approximately southwest of Beardstown, which is south of Peoria and Pekin and northwest of Lincoln and Springfield.\nNear the confluence of the Illinois with the La Moine River, it turns south, flowing roughly parallel to the Mississippi across western Illinois. Macoupin Creek joins the Illinois on the border between Greene and Jersey counties, approximately upstream from the confluence with the Mississippi River.\nFor the last of its course, the Illinois is separated from the Mississippi River by only about , by a peninsula of land that makes up Calhoun County. The Illinois joins the Mississippi near Grafton, approximately northwest of downtown St. Louis and about upstream from the confluence of the Missouri River and the Mississippi.\nGeology.\nSouth of Hennepin, the Illinois River follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi River. The Illinoian Stage, about 300,000 to 132,000 years ago, blocked the Mississippi near Rock Island, diverting it into its present channel. After the glacier melted, the Illinois River flowed into the ancient channel. The Hennepin Canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi upstream of Rock Island.\nThe modern channel of the Illinois River was shaped in a matter of days by the Kankakee Torrent. During the melting of the Wisconsin Glacier about 18,500 years ago, a lake formed in present-day Indiana, comparable to one of the modern Great Lakes. The lake formed behind the terminal moraine of a substage of that glacier. Melting ice to the north eventually raised the level of the lake so that it overflowed the moraine. The dam burst, and the entire volume of the lake was released in a very short time, perhaps a few days.\nBecause of the manner of its formation, the Illinois River runs through a deep canyon with many rock formations. It has an \"underutilized channel\", one far larger than would be needed to contain any conceivable flow of the modern river.\nHistory.\nThe Illinois River valley has long been an important transportation route for civilizations. The portages between the Des Plaines and Chicago Rivers and the Kankakee and St. Joseph rivers allowed Native Americans, Europeans, and later Americans access between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basin. The first European presence in the area was the Jesuit mission founded in 1675 by Father Jacques Marquette on the banks of the Illinois across from Starved Rock at the Grand Village of the Illinois, near present-day Utica. The Illinois Confederation were the primary inhabitants of the valley. Marquette wrote of the river, \"We have seen nothing like this river that we enter, as regards its fertility of soil, its prairies and woods; its cattle, elk, deer, wildcats, bustards, swans, ducks, parroquets, and even beaver. There are many small lakes and rivers. That on which we sailed is wide, deep, and still, for 65 leagues.\"\nIn 1680, Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle built the first fort in Illinois, Ft. St. Louis, at Starved Rock to facilitate the fur trade and defend the Illinois against the Iroquois. Later the fort was relocated to the present site of Creve Coeur, near Peoria. The French retained a presence in the area, with small trading posts.\nPrior to the construction of the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal, completed in 1845, Peoria was the only large settlement on the River. The river's trade flowed downstream to be dominated by St. Louis. After the I&amp;M Canal was built, a string of cities, such as LaSalle, Peru, and Ottawa grew along the river, extending Chicago's influence into the Mississippi Valley. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the residents of the river towns were deeply involved in harvesting the river's fish, waterfowl, mussels, and ice. They were economically and culturally dependent on the river, building up industries such as tourism related to duck hunting and sport fishing, commercial fishing, musseling for the button factories, and ice cutting for early attempts at refrigeration for domestic and commercial use.\nWith the construction of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal in the late 19th century, Chicago's sewage was pushed down the river rather than into Lake Michigan.\nAs the canal declined by the early 1900s, it was eventually replaced by the Illinois Waterway in 1933, which is still in use today.\nInterpretation.\nAs late as 2015, the Peoria Riverfront Museum contained a gallery, \"Illinois River Encounter,\" that offered an interpretation of the river through an aquarium tank, and displays of the river's geology, ecology, social history, engineering, and commercial use. The Starved Rock Lock and Dam Visitor Center features exhibits on the Illinois River with a viewing area of the working lock in a site frequented by bald eagles.\nModern use.\nFrom 1905 to 1915, more freshwater fish were harvested from the Illinois River than from any other river in the United States except for the Columbia River. The Illinois River was once a major source of mussels for the shell button industry. Overfishing, habitat loss from heavy siltation, and water pollution have eliminated most commercial fishing except for a small mussel harvest to provide shells to seed pearl oysters overseas. It is commercially fished downstream of the Rt. 89 bridge at Spring Valley. However, an infestation of invasive Asian carp has crowded out many game fish in the river. The Illinois River is still an important sports fishing waterway with a good sauger fishery.\nThe Illinois forms part of a modern waterway that connects the Great Lakes at Chicago to the Mississippi River. The waterway was originally established by the building of the Illinois and Michigan Canal that connected the Illinois River to the Chicago River. When the Sanitary District of Chicago later reversed the flow of the Chicago River, the pollution and sewage of the city of Chicago flowed down into the Illinois River. The Illinois and Michigan Canal has since been replaced by the Illinois Waterway, including the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. River traffic and flood control is managed by eight locks and dams operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. As of 2011, all locks and dams on this waterway are closed to visitors for security reasons, except the Starved Rock Visitor Center, which offers an excellent interpretation of the entire system. The waterway is heavily used by barges transporting bulk goods such as grain and oil. It is used in the summer and early fall by tourists in pleasure boats cruising the Great Loop. The Illinois River is an important part of the Great Loop, the circumnavigation of Eastern North America by water.\nThe City of Peoria is developing a long-term plan to reduce combined sewer overflows to the Illinois River, as required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. During dry weather, sewage flows safely through the city's sewers to the Greater Peoria Sanitation District wastewater treatment plant. However, about 28 times a year, melting snow or rainwater can overwhelm the sewers, causing untreated sewage to overflow into the Illinois River. Peoria was required to examine the sewer overflows and prepare a long-term control plan to meet Clean Water Act requirements and protect the Illinois River. The city had to submit its plan by December 2008 to U.S. EPA and Illinois EPA. The issue was still under discussion as recently as 2016.\nThe John Hartford song \"Long Hot Summer Day\" is written from the perspective of a barge worker on the Illinois River. It references the Illinois towns of Pekin, Beardstown, and Alton.\nCities and towns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been widely identified with the archaeological site of es-Sela' or as-Sila' in Jordan's Tafilah Governorate.\nHebrew Bible.\nBook of Judges.\nIn the Book of Judges there is a mention of a place called Sela, \"the rock\", on the southern border of the lands still inhabited by the Amorites after the partial conquest of Canaan by the Israelites ().\nSecond Book of Kings.\n2 Kings sets \"Sela\" in the great valley extending from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea (). It was near Mount Hor, close by the desert of Zin.\nIn the story of King Amaziah of Judah, a place called Sela is mentioned. Amaziah is described as throwing 10,000 Edomites to their death from the heights of Sela (; ). When Amaziah took Sela he called it Joktheel (also spelled Jokteel (JPS) and Jectehel (DRB)) (q.v.) (, Yoqt\u0115-\u2019\u0112l, \"the blessedness of God\" or \"subdued by God\"; ) or Kathoel () in the Septuagint.\nIsaiah and Obadiah.\nPlaces called Sela are mentioned by the prophets Isaiah and Obadiah (15:1, 16:1; ) as to cry in joy in glory of the Lord.\nArchaeological site.\nSela in Edom is widely identified with the ruins of Sela, east of Tafileh (identified as biblical Tophel) and near Bozrah, both Edomite cities in the mountains of Edom, in modern-day Jordan.\nAs of 2012 Sela, or as-Sila\u201b or es-Sela in Arabic, had not yet been excavated, but surveys of the plateau have produced surface finds from the Early Bronze Age through to the Nabataean period, but mainly from the time of the Edomites of the Hebrew Bible: the early to mid-first millennium BCE. This is the period when Sela was most extensively inhabited.\nArchaeologists have found on a rock face at es-Sila' the so-called \"Nabonidus Inscription\", named after the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (ruled c. 556\u2013539 BCE).\nConfusion with Petra.\nSela appears in later history and in the Vulgate under the name of 'Petra', the Greek translation of the Semitic word 'Sela', meaning 'rock'. This led to Sela being confused with the Nabataean city of Rekem, known to the Hellenistic world as Petra.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69304", "revid": "7098284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69304", "title": "Lord", "text": "Title for a person or deity\nLord is an appellation for a person or deity who has authority, control, or power over others, acting as a master, chief, or ruler. The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the peerage in the United Kingdom, or are entitled to courtesy titles. The collective \"Lords\" can refer to a group or body of peers.\nEtymology.\nAccording to the \"Oxford Dictionary of English\", the etymology of the word can be traced back to the Old English word \"hl\u0101ford\" which originated from \"hl\u0101fweard\" meaning \"loaf-ward\" or \"bread-keeper\", reflecting the Germanic tribal custom of a chieftain providing food for his followers. The appellation \"lord\" is primarily applied to men, while for women the appellation \"lady\" is used. This is no longer universal: the Lord of Mann, a title previously held by the Queen of the United Kingdom, and female Lord Mayors are examples of women who are styled as \"Lord\".\nHistorical usage.\nFeudalism.\nUnder the feudal system, \"lord\" had a wide, loose and varied meaning. An overlord was a person from whom a landholding or a manor was held by a mesne lord or vassal under various forms of feudal land tenure. The modern term \"landlord\" is a vestigial survival of this function. A liege lord was a person to whom a vassal owed sworn allegiance. Neither of these terms were titular dignities, but rather factual appellations, which described the relationship between two or more persons within the highly stratified feudal social system. For example, a man might be lord of the manor to his own tenants but also a vassal of his own overlord, who in turn was a vassal of the King. Where a knight was a lord of the manor, he was referred to in contemporary documents as \"John (Surname), knight, lord of (manor name)\". A feudal baron was a true titular dignity, with the right to attend Parliament, but a feudal baron, Lord of the Manor of many manors, was a vassal of the King.\nManors.\nThe substantive title of \"lord of the manor\" came into use in the English medieval system of feudalism after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The title \"Lord of the Manor\" was a titular feudal dignity which derived its force from the existence and operation of a manorial court or court baron at which he or his steward presided, thus he was the lord of the manorial court which determined the rules and laws which were to govern all the inhabitants and property covered by the jurisdiction of the court. To the tenants of a certain class of manor known in Saxon times as \"Infangenthef\" their lord was a man who had the power of exercising capital punishment over them. The term invariably used in contemporary mediaeval documents is simply \"lord of X\", X being the name of the manor. The term \"Lord of the Manor\" is a recent usage of historians to distinguish such lords from feudal barons and other powerful persons referred to in ancient documents variously as \"Sire\" (mediaeval French), \"Dominus\" (Latin), \"Lord\" etc.\nLaird.\nThe Scottish title Laird is a shortened form of 'laverd' which is an old Scottish word deriving from an Anglo-Saxon term meaning 'Lord' and is also derived from the middle English word 'Lard' also meaning 'Lord'. The word is generally used to refer to any owner of a landed estate and has no meaning in heraldic terms and its use is not controlled by the Lord Lyon.\nModern usage.\nSubstantive title.\nLord is occasionally used as part of a substantive British noble title in its own right: \nIn the Peerage of Scotland, the members of the lowest level of the peerage have the substantive title \"Lord of Parliament\" rather than Baron. \nThe heir to the throne in Scotland holds the title Lord of the Isles. \nIn England, the title Lord of the Isle of Wight used to exist but fell out of use before the creation of the modern peerage system. \nThe British sovereign is also accorded the title Lord of Mann as head of state of the Isle of Mann.\nThe feudal title of \"Lord of the Manor\" is still recognised by the British Government for any such title registered at His Majesty's Land Registry before 13 October 2003 (the commencement date of the Land Registration Act 2002) but after that date titles can no longer be registered, and any such titles voluntarily de-registered by the holder cannot later be re-registered. However any transfer of ownership of registered manors will continue to be recorded in the register, on the appropriate notification. Thus in effect the register is closed for new registrations. Such titles are legally classified as \"incorporeal hereditaments\" as they have no physical existence, and usually have no intrinsic value. However a lucrative market arose in the 20th century for such titles, often for purposes of vanity, which was assisted by the existence of an official register, giving the purchaser the impression of a physical existence. Whether a title of \"Lord of the Manor\" is registered or unregistered has no effect on its legal validity or existence, which is a matter of law to be determined by the courts. Modern legal cases have been won by persons claiming rights as lords of the manor over village greens. The heads of many ancient English land-owning families have continued to be lords of the manor of lands they have inherited. The UK Identity and Passport Service will include such titles on a British passport as an \"observation\" (e.g., 'The Holder is the Lord of the Manor of X'), provided the holder can provide documentary evidence of ownership. The United States forbids the use of all titles on passports. Australia forbids the use of titles on passports if those titles have not been awarded by the Crown (in reference to the Australian Monarchy) or the Commonwealth (in reference to the Australian Government).\nPeers and children of peers.\n\"Lord\" is used as a generic term to denote members of the peerage. Five ranks of peer exist in the United Kingdom: in descending order these are duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron. The appellation \"Lord\" is used most often by barons, who are rarely addressed by their formal and legal title of \"Baron\". The most formal style is \"The Lord (X)\": for example, Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, can be referred to as \"The Lord Tennyson\", although the most common appellation is \"Lord Tennyson\". Marquesses, earls and viscounts are commonly also addressed as Lord. Dukes use the style \"The Duke of (X)\", and are not correctly referred to as \"Lord (X)\". Dukes are formally addressed as \"Your Grace\", rather than \"My Lord\". \n\"Lord\" is also used as a courtesy title for younger sons of a British prince, duke, or marquesses, in the style \"Lord (first name) (surname)\". The eldest son of a peer would be entitled to use one of his father's subsidiary titles (if any). For example, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent holds the subsidiary title of Earl of St Andrews, which is used by his elder son George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews, while his younger son is styled Lord Nicholas Windsor. However, if the father has no subsidiary title, the older son will assume a courtesy title of \"Lord (last name)\", such as in the case of the Earl of Devon. As these forms of address are merely courtesy titles, the holder is not actually a member of the peerage and is not entitled to use the definite article \"The\" as part of the title.\nHouse of Lords.\nThe upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is the House of Lords, which is an abbreviation of the full title, \"The Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled\". The Lords Temporal are the people who are entitled to receive writs of summons to attend the House of Lords in right of a peerage. The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London, Winchester and Durham, and the twenty-one longest-serving bishops of the Church of England from among the other bishops (plus some female bishops of shorter service in consequence of the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015), who are all entitled to receive writs of summons in right of their bishoprics or archbishoprics.\nThe Lords Temporal greatly outnumber the Lords Spiritual, there being nearly 800 of the former and only 26 of the latter. As of December 2016, 92 Lords Temporal sit in the House in right of hereditary peerages (that being the maximum number allowed under the House of Lords Act 1999) and 19 sit in right of judicial life peerages under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. The rest are life peers under the Life Peerages Act 1958.\nJudiciary.\nUntil the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009), certain judges sat in the House of Lords by virtue of holding life peerages. Most of them (those who were members of the Appellate Committee) were known collectively as the Law Lords. All judges, including former Law Lords, lost the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords, despite retaining their life peerages, upon creation of the Supreme Court. The appellation \"Lord\", though not the style, is also used to refer to some judges in certain Commonwealth legal systems, who are not peers. Some such judges, for instance judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, are called \"Lord Justice\". Other Commonwealth judges, for example judges of Canadian provincial supreme courts, are known only as Justices but are addressed with deference in court as 'My Lord', 'My Lady', 'Your Lordship' or 'Your Ladyship'.\nExamples of judges who use the appellation \"lord\" include:\nNaval.\nThe Board of Admiralty (1628\u20131964) was established in 1628 when Charles I put the office of Lord High Admiral into commission. The title Naval Lord to the Board of Admiralty was first used around the 1600s. These were a body of Senior Admirals, first called Naval Lord Commissioners, then Naval Lords then Professional Naval Lords then Sea Lords. The President of the Board was known as the First Lord of the Admiralty (with the other five Naval appointments being the Second Sea Lord, Third Sea Lord, etc. sequentially), or sometimes First Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty. With the abolition of the Board of Admiralty and its merger into the Ministry of Defence in 1964, formal control of the Navy was taken over by the Admiralty Board of the Defence Council of the United Kingdom, with the day-to-day running of the Navy taken over by the Navy Board. The office of Lord High Admiral was vested in the Crown (i.e. in the person of the current British monarch) and that of First Lord of the Admiralty ceased to exist, but the First, Second and Third Sea Lords retained their titles, despite ceasing to be Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. To this day (2023) the first two senior officers of the Royal Navy are still known as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, and Second Sea Lord and Deputy Chief of Naval Staff.\nThe Lords Commissioners were entitled collectively to be known as \"The Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty\", and were commonly referred to collectively as \"Their Lordships\" or \"My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty\", though individual members were not entitled to these styles. More informally, they were known in short as \"The Lords of the Admiralty\". The Lords of the Admiralty are not peers.\nEcclesiastical.\nIn Great Britain and Ireland, and in most countries that are members or former members of the Commonwealth, bishops may be addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lord Bishop\" or \"Your Lordship\", particularly on formal occasions. This usage is not restricted to those bishops who sit in the House of Lords. Indeed, by custom, it is not restricted to bishops of the Church of England but applies to bishops of the Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church, and the Roman Catholic Church, and may be applied (though less commonly) to bishops of other Christian denominations. It has become more common to use simply the one word \"Bishop\".\nIn the United States, bishops are addressed as \"Excellency\".\nOther high offices of state.\nVarious other high offices of state in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth and Republic of Ireland are prefixed with the deferential appellation of \"lord\".\nThese include:\nHolders of these offices are not \"ex officio\" peers, although the holders of some of the offices were in the past always peers.\nNon-English equivalents.\nIn most cultures in Europe an equivalent appellation denoting deference exists. The French term \"Mon Seigneur\" (\"My Lord\"), shortened to the modern French \"Monsieur\", derives directly from the Latin \"seniorem\", meaning \"elder, senior\". From this Latin source derived directly also the Italian \"Signore\", the Spanish \"Se\u00f1or\", the Portuguese \"Senhor\".\nNon-Romance languages have their own equivalents. Of the Germanic family there is the Dutch \"Meneer/Mijnheer/De Heer\" (as in: \"aan de heer Joren Jansen\"), German and Swedish \"Herr\", and Danish \"Herre\". All three of these stem from a Germanic title of respect (in this case, from the Proto-Germanic root \"*haira-\", \"hoary, venerable, grey\", likely a loan translation of Latin \"seniorem\"). \nFinnic languages have their own versions: Finnish uses \"herra\" and Estonian uses \"h\u00e4rra\", both of which are considered loanwords from Scandinavian languages. In other European languages there is Welsh \"Arglwydd\", Hungarian \"\u00dar\", Greek \"Kyrie\", Polish \"Pan\", Czech \"p\u00e1n\", Breton \"Aotrou\", and Albanian \"Zoti\".\nIn several Indian languages there are the Hindi \"Swami\", \"Prabhu\", \"Thakur\", \"Samprabhu\" (Overlord) and also words like \"Saheb\" or \"Laat Saheb\" from \"Lord Saheb\" were once used but have changed in meaning now, Telugu \"Prabhuvu\", Tamil \"Koman\", Kannada \"Dore\", Bengali \"Probhu\", Gujarati \"Swami\", Punjabi \"Su'\u0101m\u012b\", Nepali \"Prabhu\". Words like \"Swami\" and \"Prabhu\" are Sanskrit-origin words, common in many Indian languages.\nPhilippine languages have different words for \"lord\", some of which are cognates. Tagalog has \"Pangino\u00f3n\" for \"lord\" in both the noble and the religious senses. Its root, \"ginoo\", is also found in Visayan languages like Cebuano as the term for \"lord\". \"Ginoo\" is also the Tagalog root for \"Gino\u00f3ng\", the modern equivalent of the English term \"Mister\" (akin to how Romance language terms like \"se\u00f1or\" may be glossed as either \"lord\", \"mister\", or \"sir\"). Ilocano meanwhile employs \"Apo\" for \"Lord\" in religious contexts; it is a particle that generally accords respect to an addressee of higher status than the speaker.\nIn the Yoruba language of West Africa, the words \"Olu\" and \"Oluwa\" are used in much the same way as the English term. Olodumare, the Yoruba conception of God Almighty, is often referred to using either of these two words. In the Yoruba chieftaincy system, meanwhile, the Oluwo of Iwo's royal title translates to \"Lord of Iwo\". In Lagos, the Oluwa of Lagos is one of that kingdom's most powerful chiefs.\nReligion.\nEnglish-speakers use the word \"Lord\" (generally with an initial upper-case letter) as a title of deference for various gods or deities. The earliest recorded use of \"Lord\" in the English language in a religious context\noccurred in the work of English writers such as Bede (c.\u2009673 \u2013 735). However, Bede wrote in Latin\n(Michael Lapidge describes him as \"without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period\"). He used an Anglo-Saxon phrase that indicated a noble, prince, ruler or lord to refer to God; however, he applied this as a gloss to the Latin text that he was producing, and not as a clear translation of the term itself. \"Lord\", as a gloss to Old English ,\nmeant \"royal\", \"ruler\", \"prince\", or \"noble\", and did not indicate a deity. After the 11th-century Norman invasion of England and the influx of Norman-French-speaking clerics, this semantic field began to appear in religious texts as well, but that occurred during the later Middle Ages and not in Bede's early medieval period. The word \"Lord\" appears frequently in the King James Bible of the early 17th century.

In 1382, summoned by Charles VI of France, he led Savoyard troops to victory against Flemish rebels at the Battle of Roosebeke. After his father's death in 1383, his mother and grandmother fought over the regency. In 1384, in order to suppress a revolt against his relative Edward of Savoy, Bishop of Sion, Amadeus led an army that attacked and pillaged Sion. In 1388, he acquired territories in eastern Provence and the port city of Nice, thus giving the County of Savoy control of an important Alpine pass and access to the Mediterranean Sea. Nice became part of the domains of the House of Savoy on 28 September 1388, when Amadeus VII, taking advantage of the internal struggles in Provence, negotiated the transfer with Giovanni Grimaldi, baron of Boglio (governor of Nice and the Eastern Provence) of Nice and the Ubaye Valley to the Savoy domains, with the name of \"Terre Nuove di Provenza\". Amadeus' father, Amadeus VI, the Green Count, was credited with purchasing the territory of the mountain pass, the Col de Largenti\u00e8es, today Maddalena Pass on the border of France and Italy, for the sum of 60,000 ecus, but this took place in 1388 after his death. The Col de Largenti\u00e8re was of great strategic and commercial importance because it linked Lyon with Italy; it offered an easy route between Piedmont and the outlying valley of Barcelonnette, which came into Savoyard possession when Amadeus VII, or his father, transferred it from the County of Provence to the County of Nice. \nOn 1 November 1391, Amadeus died from tetanus, as a result of a hunting accident. Upon his death, controversy arose because of his will. Amadeus left the important role of guardian of his son and heir, Amadeus VIII, to his own mother, a sister of the powerful Duke de Bourbon, instead of following the tradition of appointing the child's mother, who was a daughter of the equally powerful Duke de Berry. Due to the dispute between his mother and his wife, rumours that Amadeus had been poisoned emerged soon after his death. It took three months of negotiations to restore peace in the family.\nAmadeus was known for his hospitality, for he would entertain people of all stations and never turn a person from his table without a meal.\nMarriage and children.\nAmadeus married Bonne of Berry, daughter of John, Duke of Berry, who was the younger brother of King Charles V of France.

{"id": "69308", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69308", "title": "Second Temple", "text": "Temple in Jerusalem (c. 516 BCE\u201370 CE)\nThe Second Temple () was the temple in Jerusalem that replaced Solomon's Temple, which was destroyed during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 587 BCE. It was constructed around 516 BCE and later enhanced by Herod the Great around 18 BCE, consequently also being known as Herod's Temple thereafter. Defining the Second Temple period and standing as a pivotal symbol of Jewish identity, it was the basis and namesake of Second Temple Judaism. The Second Temple served as the chief place of worship, ritual sacrifice (\"korban\"), and communal gathering for the Jewish people, among whom it regularly attracted pilgrims for the Three Pilgrimage Festivals: Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot.\nIn 539 BCE, the Persian conquest of Babylon enabled the Achaemenid Empire to expand across the Fertile Crescent by annexing the Neo-Babylonian Empire, including the territory of the former Kingdom of Judah, which had been annexed as the Babylonian province of Yehud during the reign of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II, who concurrently exiled part of Judah's population to Babylon. Following this campaign, the Persian king Cyrus the Great issued the \"Edict of Cyrus\" (sometimes identified with the Cyrus Cylinder), which is described in the Hebrew Bible as a royal proclamation that authorized and encouraged the repatriation of displaced populations in the region. This event is called the return to Zion in Ezra\u2013Nehemiah, marking the resurgence of Jewish life in what had become the self-governing Persian province of Yehud. The reign of the Persian king Darius the Great saw the completion of the Second Temple, signifying a period of renewed Jewish hope and religious revival. According to the biblical account, the Second Temple was originally a relatively modest structure built under the authority of the Persian-appointed Jewish governor Zerubbabel, who was the grandson of the penultimate Judahite king Jeconiah.\nIn the 1st century BCE, Herod's efforts to transform the Second Temple resulted in a grand and imposing structure and courtyard, including the large edifices and fa\u00e7ades shown in modern models, such as the Holyland Model of Jerusalem in the Israel Museum. The Temple Mount, where both Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple stood, was also significantly expanded, doubling in size to become the ancient world's largest religious sanctuary. The Temple complex was not only a place of worship but also served multiple functions, including being a site for public assemblies. The Sanhedrin, the supreme judicial court, convened in the Temple's Hall of Hewn Stones, and the compound also hosted one of the largest marketplaces in the city.\nIn 70 CE, at the height of the First Jewish\u2013Roman War, the Second Temple was destroyed by the Roman siege of Jerusalem, resulting in a cataclysmic shift in Jewish history. The loss of the Second Temple prompted the development of Rabbinic Judaism, which remains the mainstream form of Jewish religious practices globally.\nHistory.\nConstruction under the Persians.\nThe accession of Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire in 559 BCE made the re-establishment of the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple possible. Some rudimentary ritual sacrifice had continued at the site of the first temple following its destruction. According to the closing verses of the second book of Chronicles and the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, when the Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem following a decree from Cyrus the Great (\u2013, \u2013), construction started at the original site of the altar of Solomon's Temple. These events represent the final section in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible. The original core of the book of Nehemiah, the first-person memoir, may have been combined with the core of the Book of Ezra around 400 BCE. Further editing probably continued into the Hellenistic era.\nBased on the biblical account, after the return from Babylonian captivity, arrangements were immediately made to reorganize the desolated Yehud Province after the demise of the Kingdom of Judah seventy years earlier. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360, having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceedings by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first concerns was to restore their ancient house of worship by rebuilding their destroyed Temple.\nOn the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden darics, besides other gifts, the people poured their gifts into the sacred treasury with great enthusiasm. First they erected and dedicated the altar of God on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris that occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (535 BCE), amid great public excitement and rejoicing, the foundations of the Second Temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mixed feelings by the spectators.\nThe Samaritans wanted to help with this work but Zerubbabel and the elders declined such cooperation, feeling that the Jews must build the Temple unaided. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. According to , the Samaritans sought to \"frustrate their purpose\" and sent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended.\nSeven years later, Cyrus the Great, who allowed the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the Temple, died, and was succeeded by his son Cambyses. On his death, the \"false Smerdis\", an impostor, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then Darius became king (522 BCE). In the second year of his rule the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion, under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. It was ready for consecration in the spring of 516 BCE, more than twenty years after the return from captivity. The Temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius, amid great rejoicings on the part of all the people, although it was evident that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject to a foreign power.\nThe Book of Haggai includes a prediction that the glory of the Second Temple would be greater than that of the first. While the Temple may well have been consecrated in 516, construction and expansion may have continued as late as 500 BCE.\nSome of the original artifacts from the Temple of Solomon are not mentioned in the sources after its destruction in 586 BCE, and are presumed lost. The Second Temple lacked various holy articles, including the Ark of the Covenant containing the Tablets of Stone, before which were placed the pot of manna and Aaron's rod, the Urim and Thummim (divination objects contained in the ), the holy oil and the sacred fire. The Second Temple also included many of the original vessels of gold that had been taken by the Babylonians but restored by Cyrus the Great.\nNo detailed description of the Temple's architecture is given in the Hebrew Bible, save that it was sixty cubits in both width and height, and was constructed with stone and lumber. In the Second Temple, the Holy of Holies (') was separated by curtains rather than a wall as in the First Temple. Still, as in the Tabernacle, the Second Temple included the Menorah (golden lamp) for the ', the Table of Showbread and the golden altar of incense, with golden censers.\nRededication by the Maccabees.\nFollowing the conquest of Judea by Alexander the Great, it became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when the Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated Pharaoh Ptolemy V Epiphanes at the Battle of Paneion.\nIn 167 BCE, Antiochus IV Epiphanes ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He also, according to Josephus, \"compelled Jews to dissolve the laws of the country, to keep their infants un-circumcised, and to sacrifice swine's flesh upon the altar; against which they all opposed themselves, and the most approved among them were put to death.\"\nThese anti-Jewish persecutions provoked the Maccabean Revolt, led by Judas Maccabeus and his brothers from the priestly Hasmonean family. After several years of guerrilla warfare, the Maccabees succeeded in driving out the Seleucid forces from Jerusalem. In 164 BCE, they recaptured the Temple Mount, removed the pagan altar, and undertook the purification and rededication of the Second Temple. This event is the origin of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, which begins on the 25th of Kislev. The earliest accounts of the holiday appear in the Books of the Maccabees, which both associate it with the 25th of Kislev\u2014either as the date when sacrifices resumed following the cleansing of the Temple (according to \"1 Maccabees\"), or as the date of the cleansing itself (according to \"2 Maccabees\").\nHasmonean dynasty and Roman conquest.\nThere is some evidence from archaeology that further changes to the structure of the Temple and its surroundings were made during the Hasmonean rule.\nJudas the Essene, a prophetic figure who lived under the Hasmoneans, is depicted by Josephus as being in the Temple with his followers.\nSalome Alexandra, the queen of the Hasmonean Kingdom appointed her elder son Hyrcanus II as the high priest of Judaea. Her younger son Aristobulus II was determined to have the throne, and as soon as she died he seized the throne. Hyrcanus, who was next in the succession, agreed to be content with being high priest. Antipater, the governor of Idum\u00e6a, encouraged Hyrcanus not to give up his throne. Eventually, Hyrcanus fled to Aretas III, king of the Nabateans, and returned with an army to take back the throne. He defeated Aristobulus and besieged Jerusalem. The Roman general Pompey, who was in Syria fighting against the Armenians in the Third Mithridatic War, sent his lieutenant to investigate the conflict in Judaea. Both Hyrcanus and Aristobulus appealed to him for support. Pompey was not diligent in making a decision about this, which caused Aristobulus to march off. He was pursued by Pompey and surrendered but his followers closed Jerusalem to Pompey's forces. The Romans besieged and took the city in 63 BCE. The priests continued with the religious practices inside the Temple during the siege. The temple was not looted or harmed by the Romans. Pompey himself, perhaps inadvertently, went into the Holy of Holies and the next day ordered the priests to repurify the Temple and resume the religious practices.\nRenovations under Herod.\nIn c. 20/19 BCE, Herod, king of Judaea, began an ambitious renovation of the Second Temple. The old temple built by Zerubbabel was replaced by a magnificent edifice. Herod's Temple was one of the larger construction projects of the 1st century BCE. The expanded sanctuary was the largest of its time. Josephus records that Herod was interested in perpetuating his name through building projects, that his construction programs were extensive and paid for by heavy taxes, but that his masterpiece was the Temple of Jerusalem. Later, the sanctuary shekel was reinstituted to support the temple as the temple tax.\nAccording to Josephus, the construction of the Temple itself took about a year and a half, while the porticoes and outer walls required a further eight years. During the works, Herod was careful not to offend religious sensitivities: ten thousand laborers and a thousand priests were specially trained for the construction, daily offerings continued uninterrupted, and modesty partitions were erected to shield sacred rituals from view.\nBoth Rabbinic tradition and Josephus preserve accounts reflecting popular views that Herod's construction of the Temple was divinely supported, with miraculous signs symbolizing God's approval and guidance of the project. According to the Babylonian Talmud, \"And thus we have from the days of Herod, that when they were working on the construction of the Temple, rains would fall at night. On the morrow, the winds would blow and the clouds dispersed and the sun would shine and the people would proceed with their work, and they knew that they were doing God's work.\" Josephus also writes: \"And it is said that during the time when the Temple was being built, no rain fell during the day, but only at night, so that there was no interruption of the work. And this story, which our fathers have handed down to us, is not at all incredible if, that is, one considers the other manifestations of power given by God.\"\nWhile the main structures were largely completed during Herod's reign, construction at the complex continued for decades, possibly until the 60s CE, as reflected in the New Testament's mention of 46 years of work and Josephus' reference to additions under the procurator Lucceius Albinus (c. 62\u201364 CE).\nUnder Roman rule.\nIn 4 BCE, following the funerary ceremonies for his father Herod, Archelaus, the ethnarch of Judea, conducted hearings with his subjects while seated on a golden throne in the Temple precincts. In the early 40s\u202fCE, a major crisis erupted when the Emperor Caligula ordered that a statue of himself be installed in the Temple\u2014a move that would have deeply violated Jewish religious beliefs prohibiting idolatry. The Jewish population in Judaea and Galilee responded with mass protests and passive resistance, including a sit-in to block the Roman army from transporting the statue. Jewish leaders also mobilized diplomatically: Philo, in Rome as part of a delegation representing the Jews of Alexandria, appealed to Caligula, while Agrippa I, a Herodian prince and confidant of the emperor, attempted to dissuade him. The crisis was ultimately averted with Caligula's assassination in 41\u202fCE.\nDescriptions of Jerusalem by non-Jews emphasize the Temple as its central feature. The 2nd-century BCE Greek historian Polybius described the Jews as a nation residing around a temple called Jerusalem, while Tacitus, a Roman historian from the first century CE, wrote that \"Jerusalem is the capital of the Jews. In it was a temple possessing enormous reaches.\"\nReligious activities around the Temple Mount during this period have been preserved by ancient sources. The Mishnah provides an eyewitness account of Yo'ezer Ish Habirah, who reports that Pharisee leader Gamaliel the Elder responded to questions from the House of Shammai while standing by the Eastern Gate of the Temple. New Testament accounts describe Jesus and the apostles preaching at the Temple, and indicate that the early Christian community in Jerusalem used to gather at Solomon's Portico, in the eastern part of the compound. The Babylonian Talmud further states that Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai used to teach, before the Temple's destruction, \"in the shadow of the sanctuary.\"\nIn rabbinic literature.\nTraditional rabbinic literature states that the Second Temple stood for 420 years, and, based on the 2nd-century work , placed construction in 356 BCE (3824 AM), 164 years later than academic estimates, and destruction in 68 CE (3828 AM).\nAccording to the Mishnah, the \"Foundation Stone\" stood where the Ark used to be, and the High Priest put his censer on it on Yom Kippur. The fifth order, or division, of the Mishnah, known as Kodashim, provides detailed descriptions and discussions of the religious laws connected with Temple service including the sacrifices, the Temple and its furnishings, as well as the priests who carried out the duties and ceremonies of its service. Tractates of the order deal with the sacrifices of animals, birds, and meal offerings, the laws of bringing a sacrifice, such as the sin offering and the guilt offering, and the laws of misappropriation of sacred property. In addition, the order contains a description of the Second Temple (tractate Middot), and a description and rules about the daily sacrifice service in the Temple (tractate Tamid). According to the Babylonian Talmud, the Temple lacked the (the dwelling or settling divine presence of God) and the (holy spirit) present in the First Temple.\nHerod's Temple is praised in the Babylonian Talmud. In \"Bava Batra\" 4a, it states: \"\"He who has not seen the Temple of Herod has never seen a beautiful building\". Similarly, in \"Sukkah\" 51b: \"He who has not seen the Temple in its full construction has never seen a glorious building in his life. Which Temple? \u2013 Abaye, or it might be said, Rabbi Hisda, replied, The reference is to the building of Herod\"\".\nThe Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 51b, provides a description of the stones used in Herod's construction of the Temple. According to the text, the 4th-century amora Rava said: \"It was with stones of green-gray marble and white marble [marmara].\" Others said: \"It was with stones of blue marble and white marble. The rows of stones were set with one row slightly protruded and one row slightly indented, so that the plaster would take better.\" The passage adds that Herod \"thought to plate the Temple with gold, but the Sages said to him: Leave it as is, and do not plate it, as it is better this way, as with the different colors and the staggered arrangement of the rows of stones, it has the appearance of waves of the sea.\"\nArchitecture of Herod's Temple.\nThe Second Temple in Jerusalem was remarkable for its sheer size, surpassing typical temples in the Roman Empire.\nThe writings of Flavius Josephus and the information in tractate Middot of the Mishnah had for long been used for proposing possible designs for the Temple up to 70 CE. The discovery of the Temple Scroll as part of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the 20th century provided another possible source. Lawrence Schiffman states that after studying Josephus and the Temple Scroll, he found Josephus to be historically more reliable than the Temple Scroll.\nTemple structure.\nThe Temple itself once stood on the location now occupied by the Dome of the Rock, while its gates led to areas adjacent to what would later become the site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\nA golden vine adorned the gates of the Temple; it is described by both Josephus and the Mishnah. Its fame reached as far as Rome, where it was mentioned by the historian Tacitus.\nTemenos expansion, date and duration.\nReconstruction of the temple under Herod began with a massive expansion of the Temple Mount temenos. For example, the Temple Mount complex initially measured in size, but Herod expanded it to and so doubled its area. Herod's work on the Temple is generally dated from 20/19 BCE until 12/11 or 10 BCE. Writer Bieke Mahieu dates the work on the Temple enclosures from 25 BCE and that on the Temple building in 19 BCE, and situates the dedication of both in November 18 BCE.\nElements.\nPlatform, substructures, retaining walls.\nMt. Moriah had a plateau at the northern end, and steeply declined on the southern slope. It was Herod's plan that the entire mountain be turned into a giant square platform. The Temple Mount was originally intended to be wide by broad by 9 stories high, with walls up to thick, but had never been finished. To complete it, a trench was dug around the mountain, and huge stone blocks were laid. Some of these weighed well over 100 tons, the largest measuring and weighing approximately 567\u2013628 tons.\nCourt of the Gentiles.\nThe Court of the Gentiles was primarily a bazaar, with vendors selling souvenirs, sacrificial animals, food. Currency was also exchanged, with Roman currency exchanged for Tyrian money, as also mentioned in the New Testament account of Jesus and the Money Changers, when Jerusalem was packed with Jewish pilgrims who had come for Passover, perhaps numbering 300,000 to 400,000.\nAbove the Huldah Gates, on top the Temple walls, was the Royal Stoa, a large basilica praised by Josephus as \"more worthy of mention than any other [structure] under the sun\"; its main part was a lengthy Hall of Columns which includes 162 columns, structured in four rows.\nThe Royal Stoa is widely accepted to be part of Herod's work; however, recent archaeological finds in the Western Wall tunnels suggest that it was built in the first century during the reign of Agripas, as opposed to the 1st century BCE.\nPinnacle.\nThe accounts of the temptation of Christ in the gospels of Matthew and Luke both suggest that the Second Temple had one or more 'pinnacles':\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Then he [Satan] brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, \"If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here.\"\nThe Greek word used is (), which literally means a tower, rampart, or pinnacle. According to \"Strong's Concordance\", it can mean little wing, or by extension anything like a wing such as a battlement or parapet. The archaeologist Benjamin Mazar thought it referred to the southeast corner of the Temple overlooking the Kidron Valley.\nInner courts.\nAccording to Josephus, there were ten entrances into the inner courts, four on the south, four on the north, one on the east and one leading east to west from the Court of Women to the court of the Israelites, named the Nicanor Gate. According to Josephus, Herod the Great erected a golden eagle over the great gate of the Temple.\nRoofs.\nJoachim Bouflet states that \"the teams of archaeologists Nahman Avigad in 1969\u20131980 in the Herodian city of Jerusalem, and Yigael Shiloh in 1978\u20131982, in the city of David\" have proven that the roofs of the Second Temple had no dome. In this, they support Josephus' description of the Second Temple.\nPilgrimages and religious services.\nPilgrimages.\nAt the time of the three pilgrimage festivals, Jerusalem became a gathering place for tens of thousands of pilgrims from across Judea, Galilee, Transjordan, and the Diaspora, who stayed anywhere from a few days to several weeks. Jews from distant parts of the Roman Empire would arrive by boat at the port of Jaffa, where they would join a caravan for the three-day journey to the Holy City and secure lodgings in one of the many hotels or hostelries. Thereafter, they would exchange some of their money from the standard Greek and Roman currency to Jewish and Tyrian money, the latter two considered acceptable for religious use. Mishnah \"Bikkurim\" 3:3\u20134 provides a detailed account of how pilgrims were welcomed to Jerusalem during the festival of Shavuot:Those who lived near [Jerusalem] would bring fresh figs and grapes, while those who lived far away would bring dried figs and raisins. An ox would go in front of them, his horns bedecked with gold and with an olive-crown on its head. The flute would play before them [...] When they drew close to Jerusalem they would send messengers in advance, and they would adorn their \"bikkurim\". The governors and chiefs and treasurers would go out to greet them, and according to the rank of the entrants they would go forth. All the skilled artisans of Jerusalem would stand up before them and greet them saying, \"Our brothers, men of such and such a place, we welcome you in peace.\" [...] When they reached the Temple Mount even King Agrippas would take the basket and place it on his shoulder [...] When he got to the Temple Court, the Levites would sing the song: \"I will extol You, O Lord, for You have raised me up, and You have not let my enemies rejoice over me\" (Psalms 30:2).This passage reflects the public and ceremonial nature of the pilgrimage, as well as the communal ethos fostered by shared ritual, music, and mutual recognition. The idea that pilgrimage helped promote social cohesion is also expressed by Josephus, who writes:Let them come together three times a year from the ends of the land that the Hebrews conquer, into the city in which they establish the Temple, in order that they may give thanks to God for the benefits that they have received and that they may appeal for benefits for the nature and coming together and taking a common meal, may they be dear to each other. For it is well that they not be ignorant of one another, being compatriots and sharing in the same practices. This will occur for them through such intermingling, instilling a memory of them through sight and association, for if they remain unmixed with one another they will be thought completely strangers to each other.The Jerusalem Temple held central importance not only for Jews in Judaea, but also for Jewish communities in the Diaspora. The celebrations brought a variety of languages and dialects spoken by Jews to the streets of the city. Philo, a Jewish philosopher from Alexandria, writes:Countless multitudes from countless cities come, some over land, others by sea, from east and west and north and south at every feast. They take the temple for their port as a general haven and safe refuge from the bustle and great turmoil of life, and there they seek to find calm weather, and, released from the cares whose yoke has been heavy upon them from their earliest years, to enjoy a brief breathing space in scenes of genial cheerfulness.The importance of the Temple for the Diaspora is further illustrated by the delegation led by Philo and other Alexandrian Jews to Emperor Caligula, during which they appealed against the proposed installation of the emperor\u2019s statue in the Temple.\nPilgrimage festivals.\nPassover.\nOn the 14th of Nisan, the eve of Passover, participants would bring a lamb or kid to the Temple for sacrifice. The slaughtering took place in the Temple courtyards, typically in the afternoon\u2014between the ninth and eleventh hours (roughly 3\u20135 PM)\u2014according to Josephus, who also notes that groups of 10 to 20 people shared each animal. Overall, it is estimated that several thousand sheep were sacrificed during Passover. The Mishnah records that the sacrifices were performed in three organized batches, with priests assisting by collecting and pouring the blood at the base of the altar. Once slaughtered, the animals were roasted\u2014in clay ovens, according to the Mishnah\u2014and eaten later that night, along with unleavened bread (\"matzah\") and bitter herbs (\"maror\"), in accordance with Exodus 12. Participants also recited the Hallel during the meal.\nShavuot.\nShavuot was observed on the fiftieth day following the waving of the \"'omer\" (barley offering). Celebrated in the month of Sivan, it marked the beginning of the wheat harvest and served as the conclusion of the Passover season, earning it the alternative name \"'Atseret\" (\"conclusion\") in some sources. The central Temple ritual in Shavuot was the offering of the \"two loaves\" of wheat bread, along with prescribed animal sacrifices, as outlined in the Torah. According to rabbinic tradition, while new grain (\"\u1e25adash\") was permitted for general use after the omer offering, wheat for meal offerings in the Temple was permitted only from Shavuot onward. Shavuot also functioned as the festival of first fruits (\"bikkurim\"), during which pilgrims brought offerings from the seven species to the Temple priesthood. According to the Mishnah, these \"bikkurim\" could be brought from Shavuot until Sukkot.\nSukkot.\nThe pilgrimage festival of Sukkot, which began on the 15th of Tishrei and lasted seven days, was regarded as the preeminent Jewish festival during the Second Temple period. Its centrality is evident in the ancient sources, some referring to it simply as \"the Festival\". Temple offerings during Sukkot involved a extraoridnarily high number of animals sacrificed daily as required by the Torah. Central to the celebration was the procession with the 'Four Species' (which derives from Leviticus 23)\u2014a palm branch (\"lulav\"), myrtle (\"hadas\"), willow (\"aravah\"), and citron (\"etrog\")\u2014which were carried, and according to the Mishnah, shaken, during the recitation of Psalm 118. Another key ritual was the willow ceremony, in which large willow branches were placed around the altar. Participants would circle the altar once each day and seven times on the seventh day, reciting Psalm 118 and concluding with the beating of branches. According to the Mishnah, the willow ceremony overrode the Shabbat, though the Boethusians objecting to this ruling. The water libation ritual, symbolizing the onset of the rainy season, involved water drawn from the Pool of Siloam and poured by the priest at the altar each day. Each night, this ritual was preceded by the Simchat Beit HaShoevah, a night-long celebration held in the Temple courtyards, characterized by music, dancing, and the lighting of bonfires. The Levites stood on the steps leading to the Nicanor Gate, chanting the \"Songs of Ascent\" from the Book of Psalms.\nYom Kippur.\nYom Kippur, the Day of Atonement commanded in the Torah and observed on the tenth of Tishrei, was marked by a special Temple service performed by the high priest, as described in Leviticus 16 and later elaborated in Mishnah Yoma. The high priest prepared for a week prior to the festival through isolation, purification, and instruction. On the day itself, he put on white linen garments after the morning \"tamid\" sacrifice, offered a bull and a goat as sin offerings, and entered the Holy of Holies multiple times to sprinkle blood on the Mercy seat and pronounce the Divine Name. He also carried out the scapegoat ritual, confessing Israel's sins over a second goat and sending it into the wilderness. After further immersions and changes of garments, the high priest concluded the day with additional sacrifices and the evening \"tamid\".\nArchaeology.\nArchaeological understanding of the Second Temple is primarily derived from investigations of the outer walls of the Temple complex, as direct excavations on the Temple Mount itself have been limited due to the presence of later Islamic structures. Foundational research was conducted by Sir Charles Warren between 1867 and 1870; his work remains a principal source for the site's architectural layout.\nTemple warning inscriptions.\nIn 1871, a hewn stone measuring and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and identified by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau as being the Temple Warning inscription. The stone inscription outlined the prohibition extended to those who were not of the Jewish nation to proceed beyond the separating the larger Court of the Gentiles and the inner courts. The inscription read in seven lines:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nToday, the stone is preserved in Istanbul's Museum of Antiquities.\nIn 1935 a fragment of another similar Temple warning inscription was found.\nThe word \"foreigner\" has an ambiguous meaning. Some scholars believe it referred to all gentiles, regardless of ritual purity status or religion. Others argue that it referred to unconverted Gentiles since Herod wrote the inscription. Herod himself was a converted Idumean (or Edomite) and was unlikely to exclude himself or his descendants.\nPlace of trumpeting.\nAnother ancient inscription, partially preserved on a stone discovered below the southwest corner of the Herodian Mount, contains the words \"to the place of trumpeting\". The stone's shape suggests that it was part of a parapet, and it has been interpreted as belonging to a spot on the Mount described by Josephus, \"where one of the priests to stand and to give notice, by sound of trumpet, in the afternoon of the approach, and on the following evening of the close, of every seventh day\" closely resembling what the Talmud says.\nWalls and gates of the Temple complex.\nAfter 1967, archaeologists found that the wall extended all the way around the Temple Mount and is part of the city wall near the Lions' Gate. Thus, the remaining part of the Temple Mount is not only the Western Wall. Currently, Robinson's Arch (named after American Edward Robinson) remains as the beginning of an arch that spanned the gap between the top of the platform and the higher ground farther away. Visitors and pilgrims also entered through the still-extant, but now plugged, gates on the southern side that led through colonnades to the top of the platform. The Southern wall was designed as a grand entrance. Recent archaeological digs have found numerous (ritual baths) for the ritual purification of the worshipers, and a grand stairway leading to one of the now blocked entrances.\nUnderground structures.\nInside the walls, the platform was supported by a series of vaulted archways, now called Solomon's Stables, which still exist. Their current renovation by the is extremely controversial.\nQuarry.\nOn September 25, 2007, Yuval Baruch, archaeologist with the Israeli Antiquities Authority announced the discovery of a quarry compound that may have provided King Herod with the stones to build his Temple on the Temple Mount. Coins, pottery and an iron stake found proved the date of the quarrying to be about 19 BCE. Archaeologist Ehud Netzer confirmed that the large outlines of the stone cuts is evidence that it was a massive public project worked by hundreds of slaves.\nFloor tiling from courts.\nMore recent findings from the Temple Mount Sifting Project include floor tiling from the Second Temple period.\nMagdala stone interpretation.\nThe Magdala stone is thought to be a representation of the Second Temple carved before its destruction in the year 70.\nDestruction of the Temple.\nIn 66 CE, the Jewish population of Judaea launched a rebellion against the Roman Empire. Four years later, on the Hebrew calendrical date of Tisha B'Av, either 4 August 70 or 30 August 70, Roman legions under Titus retook and destroyed much of Jerusalem and Herod's Temple. Josephus, while an apologist for the Empire, claims the burning of the Temple was the impulsive act of a Roman soldier, despite Titus's orders to preserve it, whereas later Christian sources, traced to Tacitus, suggest that Titus himself authorized the destruction, a view currently favored by modern scholars, though the debate persists.\nHistorical accounts relate that not only the Jewish Temple was destroyed, but also the entire Lower city of Jerusalem. Even so, according to Josephus, Titus did not totally raze the towers (such as the \"Tower of Phasael\", now erroneously called the Tower of David), keeping them as a memorial of the city's strength. The Midrash Rabba (\"Eikha Rabba\" 1:32) recounts a similar episode related to the destruction of the city, according to which Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, during the Roman siege of Jerusalem, requested of Vespasian that he spare the westernmost gates of the city () that lead to Lydda (Lod). When the city was eventually taken, the Arab auxiliaries who had fought alongside the Romans under their general, Fanjar, also spared that westernmost wall from destruction.\nThe Arch of Titus, which was built in Rome to commemorate Titus's victory in Judea, depicts a Roman triumph, with soldiers carrying spoils from the Temple, including the temple menorah. According to an inscription on the Colosseum, Emperor Vespasian built the Colosseum with war spoils in 79\u2013possibly from the spoils of the Second Temple. The sects of Judaism that had their base in the Temple dwindled in importance, including the priesthood and the Sadducees.\nThe golden vessels from the Temple were publicly displayed in the Temple of Peace, a monumental complex completed by Vespasian in 75\u202fCE. This display formed part of a broader collection of imperial trophies and artworks. In contrast, the Torah scroll and the purple Temple curtains, were not exhibited but instead deposited and guarded in Vespasian's residence. Later traditions and historical sources trace the possible movement of these objects across the ancient world. A Jewish tradition attributed to rabbi Eliezer ben Jose, dated to around 170\u202fCE, claims he saw a golden diadem and the Temple curtain in Rome, possibly in the imperial treasury. In the 6th century, the Byzantine historian Procopius reported that the \"treasures of the Jews\" captured by Titus had been looted from Rome by the Vandal king Geiseric in 455\u202fCE and taken to Carthage. These were later recovered by the Byzantine general Belisarius in 533\u202fCE and paraded in a triumphal procession in Constantinople. Alarmed by a Jewish observer's warning that the objects belonged only in their original sacred location, Emperor Justinian ordered their transfer to Christian churches in Jerusalem. The ultimate fate of the Temple treasures remains uncertain. Some later medieval sources claim they remained in Rome, while others suggest they may have been lost during the Persian sack of Jerusalem in 614\u202fCE, if they had remained in the city.\nAlthough Jews continued to inhabit the destroyed city, Emperor Hadrian established a new Roman \"colonia\" called Aelia Capitolina. At the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, many of the Jewish communities were massacred. Jews were banned from entering Jerusalem. A Roman temple was set up on the former site of Herod's Temple for the practice of Roman religion. \nLegacy.\nThe destruction of the Temple often serves as a backdrop for poetic expressions of the longing to return to and rebuild the Temple and Jerusalem. One such \"piyyut\" (Jewish liturgical poem), recited on Yom Kippur, is \"Avodah\", a poetic depiction of the High Priest's ritual on that day. \nThe destruction of the First and Second Temples is commemorated on Tisha B'Av, a major Jewish fast day. Leading up to this, a three-week period of mourning is observed, during which weddings and haircuts are forbidden, and many Jews abstain from eating meat during the first eight days of Av.\nJewish wedding ceremonies traditionally conclude with the groom breaking a glass in remembrance of the destruction of Jerusalem. In late medieval Europe, Jewish brides would often wear a large, decorative ring symbolizing the Temple, while grooms would place ashes on their heads to commemorate the destruction.The hope for the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Temple is a central theme in Jewish prayer, art, and life cycle events, consistently expressed through various cultural and religious practices. Jewish eschatology includes a belief that the Second Temple will be replaced by a future Third Temple in Jerusalem. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

RT-11 was first implemented in 1970 and released in June 1973. It was widely used for real-time computing systems, process control, and data acquisition across all PDP-11s. It was also used for low-cost general-use computing.\nFeatures.\nSource code.\nRT-11 was written in assembly language. Heavy use of the conditional assembly and macro programming features of the MACRO-11 assembler allowed a significant degree of configurability and allowed programmers to specify high-level instructions otherwise unprovided for in machine code. RT-11 distributions included the source code of the operating system and its device drivers with all the comments removed and a program named \"SYSGEN\" which would build the operating system and drivers according to a user-specified configuration. Developer's documentation included a kernel listing that included comments.\nDevice drivers.\nIn RT-11, device drivers were loadable, except that prior to V4.0 the device driver for the system device (boot device) was built into the kernel at configuration time. Because RT-11 was commonly used for device control and data acquisition, it was common for developers to write or enhance device drivers. DEC encouraged such driver development by making their hardware subsystems (from bus structure to code) open, documenting the internals of the operating system, encouraging third-party hardware and software vendors, and by fostering the development of the Digital Equipment Computer Users Society.\nMultitasking.\nRT-11 systems did not support preemptive multitasking, but most versions could run multiple simultaneous applications. All variants of the monitors provided a \"background job\". The FB, XM, and ZM monitors also provided a \"foreground job\", and six \"system jobs\" if selected via the SYSGEN system generation program. These tasks had fixed priorities, with the background job lowest and the foreground job highest. It was possible to switch between jobs from the system console user interface, and SYSGEN could generate a monitor that provided a single background job (the SB, XB and ZB variants). The terms \"foreground\" and \"background\" are counterintuitive; the background job was typically the user's command-line interpreter; a foreground job might be doing something like non-interactive data collection.\nHuman interface.\nUsers generally operated RT-11 via a printing terminal or a video terminal, originally via a strap-selectable current-loop (for conventional teletypes) or via an RS-232 (later RS-422 as well) interface on one of the CPU cards; DEC also supported the VT11 and VS60 graphics display devices (vector graphics terminals with a graphic character generator for displaying text, and a light pen for graphical input). A third-party favorite was the Tektronix 4010 family.\nThe Keyboard Monitor (KMON) interpreted commands issued by the user and would invoke various utilities with Command String Interpreter (CSI) forms of the commands. \nRT-11 command language had many features (such as commands and device names) that can be found later in the DOS line of operating systems which heavily borrowed from RT-11. The CSI form expected input and output filenames and options ('switches' on RT-11) in a precise order and syntax. The command-line switches were separated by a slash (codice_1) rather than the dash (codice_2) used in Unix-like operating systems. All commands had a full form and a short one to which they could be contracted. For example, the RENAME command could be contracted to REN.\nBatch files and the batch processor could be used to issue a series of commands with some rudimentary control flow. Batch files had the extension .BAT.\nIn later releases of RT-11, it was possible to invoke a series of commands using a .COM command file, but they would be executed in sequence with no flow control. Even later, it was possible to execute a series of commands with great control through use of the Indirect Command File Processor (IND), which took .CMD control files as input.\nFiles with the extension .SAV were a sort of executable. They were known as \"save files\" because the RT-11 SAVE command could be used to save the contents of memory to a disk file which could be loaded and executed at a later time, allowing any session to be saved.\nThe SAVE command, along with GET, START, REENTER, EXAMINE and DEPOSIT were basic commands implemented in the KMON. Some commands and utilities were later borrowed in the DOS line of operating systems. These commands include DIR, COPY, RENAME, ASSIGN, CLS, DELETE, TYPE, HELP and others. The FORMAT command was used for physical disk formatting, although it was not capable of creating file system, for which purpose the INIT command was used (analogue of DOS command FORMAT /Q). Most commands supported using wildcards in file names.\nPhysical device names were specified in the form 'dd{n}:' where 'dd' was a two-character alphabetic device name and the optional 'n' was the unit number (0\u20137). When the unit number was omitted, unit 0 was assumed. For example, TT: referred to the console terminal, LP: (or LP0:) referred to the parallel line printer, and DX0:, DY1:, DL4: referred to disk volumes (RX01 unit 0, RX02 unit 1, RL01 or RL02 unit 4, respectively). Logical device names consisted of 1\u20133 alphanumeric characters and were used in the place of a physical device name. This was accomplished using the codice_3 command. For example, one might issue codice_4 which would cause all future references to 'ABC:' to map to 'DL0:'. Reserved logical name DK: referred to the current default device. If a device was not included in a file specification, DK: was assumed. Reserved logical name SY: referred to the system device (the device from which the system had been booted).\nLater versions of RT-11 allowed specification of up to 64 units (0\u201377 octal) for certain devices, but the device name was still limited to three alphanumeric characters. This feature was enabled through a SYSGEN selection, and only applied to the DU and LD device handlers. In these two cases, the device name form became 'dnn:' where 'd' was 'D' for the DU device and 'L' for the LD device, and 'nn' was 00\u201377(octal).\nSoftware.\nRT-11 was distributed with utilities for performing many actions. The utilities \"DIR\", \"DUP\", \"PIP\" and \"FORMAT\" were for managing disk volumes. TECO, \"EDIT\", and the visual editors \"KED\" (for the DEC VT100) and \"K52\" (for the DEC VT52) were used to create and edit source and data files. \"MACRO\", \"LINK\", and \"LIBR\" were for building executables. ODT, \"VDT\" and the SD device were used to debug programs. DEC's version of Runoff was for producing documents. Finally, VTCOM was used to connect with and use (or transfer files to and from) another computer system over the phone via a modem.\nThe system was complete enough to handle many modern personal computing tasks. Productivity software such as LEX-11, a word processing package, and a spreadsheet from Saturn Software, used under other PDP-11 operating systems, also ran on RT-11. Large amounts of free, user-contributed software for RT-11 were available from the Digital Equipment Computer Users Society (DECUS) including an implementation of C. Although the tools to develop and debug assembly-language programs were provided, other languages including C, Fortran, Pascal, and several versions of BASIC were available from DEC as \"layered products\" at extra cost. Versions of these and other programming languages were also available from other, third-party, sources. It is even possible to network RT-11 machines using DECNET, the Internet and protocols developed by other, third-party sources.\nDistributions and minimal system configuration.\nThe RT-11 operating system could be booted from, and perform useful work on, a machine consisting of two 8-inch 250KB floppy disks and 56KB of memory, and could support 8 terminals. Other boot options include the RK05 2.5MB removable hard disk platter, or magnetic tape. Distributions were available pre-installed or on punched tape, magnetic tape, cartridge tape, or floppy disk. A minimal but complete system supporting a single real-time user could run on a single floppy disk and in 8K 16-bit words (16KB) of RAM, including user programs. This was facilitated by support for swapping and overlaying. To realize operation on such small memory system, the keyboard command user interface would be swapped out during the execution of a user's program and then swapped into memory upon program termination. The system supported a real-time clock, printing terminal, VT11 vector graphic unit, 16 channel 100\u00a0kHz A/D converter with 2 channel D/A, 9600 baud serial port, 16 bit bidirectional boards, etc.\nFile system.\nRT-11 implemented a simple and fast file system employing six-character filenames with three-character extensions (6.3) encoded in RADIX-50, which packed those nine characters into only three 16-bit words (six bytes). This resulted in allowable filename characters being 'A'-'Z', 'a'-'z' forced to upper case, '0'-'9', '$', '%', '*'. Filenames could be prefixed by a device name to specify a device different to the default DK: device, also encoded in RADIX-50.\nAll files were contiguous, meaning that each file occupied consecutive blocks (the minimally addressable unit of disk storage, 512 bytes) on the disk. This meant that an entire file could be read (or written) very quickly. A side effect of this file system structure was that, as files were created and deleted on a volume over time, the unused disk blocks would likely not remain contiguous, which could become the limiting factor in creating large files; the remedy was to periodically \u201csqueeze\u201d (or \"squish\") a disk to consolidate the unused portions.\nEach volume has only one directory which was preallocated at the beginning of the volume. The directory consists of an array of entries, one per file or unallocated space. Each directory entry is 8 (or more) 16-bit words, though a sysgen option allowed extra application-specific storage.\nCompatibility with other DEC operating systems.\nMany RT-11 programs (those that did not need specialized peripherals or direct access to the hardware) could be directly executed using the RT=11 RTS (Run-time system) of the RSTS/E timesharing system or under RTEM (RT Emulator) on various releases of both RSX-11 and VMS.\nThe implementation of DCL for RT-11 increased its compatibility with the other DEC operating systems. Although each operating system had commands and options which were unique to that operating system, there were a number of commands and command options which were common.\nOther PDP-11 operating systems.\nDEC also sold RSX-11M, a multiuser, multitasking operating system with realtime features, and RSTS/E (originally named RSTS-11) a multiuser time-sharing system, but RT-11 remained the operating system of choice for data acquisition systems where real time response was required. The Unix operating system also became popular, but lacked the real-time features and extremely small size of RT-11.\nHardware.\nRT-11 ran on all members of the DEC PDP-11 family, both Q-Bus- and Unibus-based. In addition, it ran on the Professional Series and the PDT-11 \"Programmed Data Terminal\" systems, also from DEC. Since the PDP-11 architecture was implemented in replacement products by other companies (E.g., the M100 and family from Mentec), or as reverse-engineered clones in other countries (E.g., the DVK from the Soviet Union), RT-11 runs on these machines as well.\nPeripherals.\nAdding driver support for peripherals such as a CalComp plotter, typically involved copying files, and did not require a SYSGEN.\nCompatible operating systems.\nFuzzball.\nFuzzball, routing software for Internet Protocols, was capable of running RT-11 programs.\nSHAREplus.\nHAMMONDsoftware distributed a number of RT-11 compatible operating systems including STAReleven, an early multi-computer system and SHAREplus, a multi-process/multi-user implementation of RT-11 which borrowed some architectural concepts from the VAX/VMS operating system. RT-11 device drivers were required for operation. Transparent device access to other PDP-11s and VAX/VMS were supported with a network option. Limited RSX-11 application compatibility was also available. SHAREplus had its strongest user base in Europe.\nTSX-11.\nTSX-11, developed by S&amp;H Computing, was a multi-user, multi-processing implementation of RT-11. The only thing it didn't do was handle the boot process, so any TSX-Plus machine was required to boot RT-11 first before running TSX-Plus as a user program. Once TSX-Plus was running, it would take over complete control of the machine from RT-11. It provided true memory protection for users from other users, provided user accounts and maintained account separation on disk volumes and implemented a superset of the RT-11 EMT programmed requests.\nS&amp;H wrote the original TSX because \"Spending $25K on a computer that could only support one user bugged [founder Harry Sanders]\"; the outcome was the initial four-user TSX in 1976. TSX-Plus (released in 1980) was the successor to TSX, released in 1976. The system was popular in the 1980s. RT-11 programs generally ran, unmodified, under TSX-Plus and, in fact, most of the RT-11 utilities were used as-is under TSX-Plus. Device drivers generally required only slight modifications.\nDepending on which PDP-11 model and the amount of memory, the system could support a minimum of 12 users (14-18 users on a 2Mb 11/73, depending on workload). The last version of TSX-Plus had TCP/IP support.\nVersions.\nVariants.\nUsers could choose from variants with differing levels of support for multitasking, memory size, and separate I &amp; D (Instruction and Data) address space:\nSpecialized versions.\nSeveral specialized PDP-11 systems were sold based on RT-11:\nClones in the USSR.\nSeveral clones of RT-11 were made in the USSR:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the lowest freshwater lake on Earth and the second-lowest lake in the world (after the Dead Sea, a salt lake), with its elevation fluctuating between below sea level (depending on rainfall). It is approximately in circumference, about long, and wide. Its area is at its fullest, and its maximum depth is approximately . The lake is fed partly by underground springs, but its main source is the Jordan River, which flows through it from north to south with the outflow controlled by the Degania Dam.\nGeography.\nThe Sea of Galilee is situated in northeast Israel, between the Golan Heights and the Galilee region, in the Jordan Rift Valley, formed by the relative motion of the African and Arabian plates. Consequently, the area is subject to earthquakes, and in the past, volcanic activity. This is evident from the abundant basalt and other igneous rocks that define the geology of Galilee.\nNames.\nThe lake has been called by different names throughout its history, usually depending on the dominant settlement on its shores. With the changing fate of the towns, the lake's name also changed.\nThe modern Hebrew name \"Kineret\" comes from the Hebrew Bible, where it appears as the \"sea of Kineret\" in and , and spelled \u05db\u05e0\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \"Kinerot\" in Hebrew in . This name was also found in the scripts of Ugarit, in the Aqhat Epic. As the name of a city, \"Kinneret\" was listed among the \"fenced cities\" in . A persistent, though likely erroneous, popular etymology presumes that the name \"Kinneret\" may originate from the Hebrew word \"kinnor\" (\"harp\" or \"lyre\"), because of the shape of the lake. The scholarly consensus, however, is that the origin of the name is derived from the important Bronze and Iron Age city of Kinneret, excavated at Tell el-'Oreimeh. The city of Kinneret may have been named after the body of water rather than vice versa, and there is no evidence for the origin of the town's name.\nAll Old and New Testament writers use the term \"sea\" (Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\u05dd \"yam\", Greek \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1), with the exception of Luke, who calls it \"the Lake of Gennesaret\" (), from the Greek \u03bb\u03af\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7 \u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4 (\"limn\u0113 Genn\u0113saret\"), the \"Grecized form of Chinnereth\". The Babylonian Talmud as well as Flavius Josephus mention the sea by the name \"Sea of Ginosar\" after the small fertile plain of Ginosar that lies on its western side. Ginosar is yet another name derived from \"Kinneret\".\nThe word \"Galilee\" comes from the Hebrew \"Haggalil\" (\u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc), which literally means \"The District\", a compressed form of \"Gelil Haggoyim\" \"The District of Nations\" (Isaiah 8:23). Toward the end of the 1st century CE, the Sea of Galilee became widely known as the \"Sea of Tiberias\" after the city of Tiberias founded on its western shore in honour of the second Roman emperor, Tiberius. In the New Testament, the term \"sea of Galilee\" (, \"thalassan t\u0113s Galilaias\") is used in the Gospel of Matthew , the Gospel of Mark , and in the Gospel of John as \"the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias\" (\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03a4\u03b9\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, \"thalass\u0113s t\u0113s Galilaias t\u0113s Tiberiados\"), the late 1st century CE name. Sea of Tiberias is also the name mentioned in Roman texts and in the Jerusalem Talmud, and it was adopted into Arabic as (\u0628\u062d\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0637\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627), \"Lake Tiberias\". Some writers use the spelling \"Gallilee\", for example Selah Merrill in a nineteenth century journal article.\nFrom the Umayyad through the Mamluk period, the lake was known in Arabic as \"Bahr al-Minya\", the \"Sea of Minya\", after the Umayyad \"qasr\" complex, whose ruins are still visible at Khirbat al-Minya. This is the name used by the medieval Persian and Arab scholars Al-Baladhuri, Al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nIn 1989, remains of a hunter-gatherer site were found under the water at the southern end. Remains of mud huts were found in Ohalo. Nahal Ein Gev, located about east of the lake, contains a village from the late Natufian period. The site is considered one of the first permanent human settlements in the world from a time predating the Neolithic Revolution.\nEarly Iron Age.\nAccording to Sugimoto (2015), the Iron Age IB (1150\u20131000 BCE) cities in the northeastern region of the Sea of Galilee likely reflect the activities of the Kingdom of Geshur, mentioned in the Bible. Also, the later Iron Age IIA\u2013B cities here are linked with the southern expansion of the Aram-Damascus kingdom. Among these Galilean cities are Tel Dover, Tel 'En Gev, Tel Hadar, Tel Bethsaida, and Tel Kinrot.\nHellenistic and Roman periods.\nThe Sea of Galilee lies on the ancient Via Maris, which linked Egypt with the northern empires. The Greeks, Hasmoneans, and Romans founded flourishing towns and settlements on the lake including Hippos and Tiberias. Contemporary Roman\u2013Jewish historian Flavius Josephus was so impressed by the area that he wrote, \"One may call this place the ambition of Nature\"; he also reports a thriving fishing industry at this time, with 230 boats regularly working in the lake. Archaeologists discovered one such boat, nicknamed the Jesus Boat, in 1986.\nIn the New Testament, much of the ministry of Jesus occurs on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. In those days, there was a continuous ribbon development of settlements and villages around the lake and plenty of trade and ferrying by boat. The Synoptic Gospels of Mark 1:14\u201320), Matthew 4:18\u201322), and Luke 5:1\u201311) describe how Jesus recruited four of his apostles from the shores of the Kinneret: the fishermen Simon and his brother Andrew and the brothers John and James. One of Jesus' famous teaching episodes, the Sermon on the Mount, is supposed to have been given on a hill overlooking the Kinneret. Many of his miracles are also said to have occurred here including his walking on water, calming the storm, the disciples and the miraculous catch of fish, and his feeding five thousand people (in Tabgha). In John's Gospel the sea provides the setting for Jesus' third post-resurrection appearance to his disciples (John 21).\nIn 135 CE, Bar Kokhba's revolt was put down which was part of the Jewish\u2013Roman wars. The Romans responded by banning all Jews from Jerusalem. The center of Jewish culture and learning shifted to the region of Galilee and the Kinneret, particularly Tiberias. It was in this region that the Jerusalem Talmud was compiled.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe Sea of Galilee's importance declined when the Byzantine Empire lost control, and the area came under the control of the Umayyad Caliphate and subsequent Islamic empires. The palace of Minya was built by the lake during the reign of al-Walid I (705\u2013715 CE). Apart from Tiberias, the major towns and cities in the area were gradually abandoned. In 1187, Sultan Saladin defeated the armies of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem at the Battle of Hattin, largely because he was able to cut the Crusaders off from the valuable fresh water of the Sea of Galilee.\nThe lake had little importance within the early Ottoman Empire. Tiberias did see a significant revival of its Jewish community in the 16th century but had gradually declined until the city was destroyed in 1660. In the early 18th century, Tiberias was rebuilt by Zahir al-Umar, becoming the center of his rule over Galilee, and seeing also a revival of its Jewish community.\nEarly 20th century.\nIn 1908, Jewish pioneers established the Kinneret Farm at the same time as and next to Moshavat Kinneret in the immediate vicinity of the lake. The farm trained Jewish immigrants in modern farming. One group of youth from the training farm established Kvutzat Degania in 1909\u20131910, popularly considered as the first kibbutz, another group founded Kvutzat Kinneret in 1913, and yet another the first proper kibbutz, Ein Harod, in 1921, the same year when the first moshav, Nahalal, was established by a group trained at the farm. The Jewish settlements around Kinneret Farm are considered the cradle of the kibbutz culture of early Zionism; Kvutzat Kinneret is the birthplace of Naomi Shemer, buried at the Kinneret Cemetery next to Rachel\u2014two prominent national poets.\nIn 1917, the British defeated Ottoman Turkish forces and took control of Palestine, while France took control of Syria. In the carve-up of the Ottoman territories between Britain and France, it was agreed that Britain would retain control of Palestine while France would control Syria. This required the allies to fix the border between the Mandatory Palestine and the French Mandate of Syria. The boundary was defined in broad terms by the Franco-British Boundary Agreement of December 1920, which drew it across the middle of the lake. However, the commission established by the 1920 treaty redrew the boundary. The High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel, had sought full control of the Sea of Galilee. The negotiations led to the inclusion into the Palestine territory of the whole Sea of Galilee, both sides of the River Jordan, Lake Hula, Dan spring, and part of the Yarmouk. The final border approved in 1923 followed a 10-meter wide strip along the lake's northeastern shore, cutting Mandatory Syria (State of Damascus) off from the lake. Geographer Gideon Biger suggests that the three factors determining the position of these boundaries were (1) \"biblical-historical\", (2) Zionist pressure to include as many water resources as possible in Mandatory Palestine, and (3) the human and physical landscape.\nThe British and French Agreement provided that existing rights over the use of the waters of the River Jordan by the inhabitants of Syria would be maintained; the government of Syria would have the right to erect a new pier at Semakh on Lake Tiberias or jointly use the existing pier; persons or goods passing between the landing-stage on the Lake of Tiberias and Semakh would not be subject to customs regulations, and the Syrian government would have access to the said landing-stage; the inhabitants of Syria and Lebanon would have the same fishing and navigation rights on Lakes Huleh, Tiberias and River Jordan, while the government of Palestine would be responsible for policing of lakes.\nState of Israel.\nOn 15 May 1948, Syria invaded the newborn state of Israel, capturing territory along the Sea of Galilee. Under the 1949 armistice agreement between Israel and Syria, Syria occupied the northeast shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. The agreement stated that the armistice line was \"not to be interpreted as having any relation whatsoever to ultimate territorial arrangements.\" Syria remained in possession of the lake's northeast shoreline until the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.\nIn the 1950s, Israel formulated a plan to link the Kinneret with the rest of the country's water infrastructure via the National Water Carrier, in order to supply the water demand of the growing country. The carrier was completed in 1964. The Israeli plan, which the Arab League opposed while endorsing its own plan to divert the headwaters of the Jordan River, sparked political and sometimes even armed confrontations over the Jordan basin.\nIn October 2025, Israel began pumping desalinated water into the Sea of Galilee, in a world first.\nGeology.\nThe lake lies in the center of the Jordan Valley, in the northern part of the Syrian-African rift. Several directions of tectonic movements characterize the region, mirroring the patterns typical of the entire Syrian-African rift: north\u2013south movements, which started about 20 million years ago; stretching movements in the east\u2013west direction, which began later, at the beginning of the Pleistocene (about 1.8 million years ago), and caused the subsidence of the lake area.\nAs a result of horizontal shifts in the north\u2013south direction and subsidence of the area, a lake was formed, with an asymmetrical bottom\u2014steeper in the east and a gentler in the west. In the southern part an underwater cliff is present, covered by the lake's sediments. The cliff is distinct in the western part and less so in the east.\nThe Sea of Galilee in its current form was preceded by Lake Lisan, which extended from the northern Sea of Galilee to Hatzeva in the south, more than from the present southernmost point of the lake. Lake Lisan was preceded by Lake Ovadia, a much smaller fresh water lake. Lake Kinneret was formed in its current form less than 20,000 years ago, as a result of tectonic subsidence and the shrinking up of Lake Lisan.\nArchaeology.\nIn 1986 the Ancient Galilee Boat, also known as the Jesus Boat, was discovered on the northwest shore during a drought when water levels receded. It is an ancient fishing boat from the 1st century AD, and although there is no evidence directly linking the boat to Jesus and his disciples, it nevertheless is an example of the kind of boat that Jesus and his disciples, some of whom were fishermen, may have used.\nDuring a routine sonar scan in 2003 (finding published in 2013), archaeologists discovered an enormous conical stone structure. The structure, which has a diameter of around , is made of boulders and stones. The ruins are estimated to be between 2,000 and 12,000 years old and are about underwater. The estimated weight of the monument is over 60,000 tons. Researchers explain that the site resembles early burial sites in Europe and was likely built in the early Bronze Age.\nIn February 2018, archaeologists discovered seven intact mosaics with Greek inscriptions. One inscription, at five meters one of the longest found to date in western Galilee, gives the names of donors and the names and positions of church officials, including Irenaeus, bishop of Tyre in 445. Another mosaic mentions a woman as a donor to the church's construction. This inscription is the first in the region to mention a female donor.\nWater level.\nThe water level is monitored and regulated. There are three levels at which the alarm is rung:\nDaily monitoring of the Sea of Galilee's water level began in 1969, and the lowest level recorded since then was November 2001, which today constitutes the \"black line\" of 214.87 meters below sea level (although it is believed that in the first half of the 20th century, the water level had fallen lower than the current black line at times of drought). The Israeli government monitors water levels and publishes the results daily. Increasing water demand in Israel, Lebanon and Jordan, as well as dry winters, have resulted in stress on the lake and a decreasing water line to dangerously low levels at times. The Sea of Galilee is at risk of becoming irreversibly salinized by the salt water springs under the lake, which are held in check by the weight of the freshwater on top of them.\nAfter five years of drought up to 2018, the Sea of Galilee was expected to drop near the black line. In February 2018, the city of Tiberias requested a desalination plant to treat the water coming from the Sea of Galilee and demanded a new water source for the city. March 2018 was the lowest point in water income to the lake since 1927. In September 2018 the Israeli energy and water office announced a project to pour desalinated water from the Mediterranean Sea into the Sea of Galilee using a tunnel. The tunnel is expected to be the largest of its kind in Israel and will transfer half of the Mediterranean desalted water and will move 300 to 500 million cubic meters of water per year. The plan is said to cost five billion shekels.\nSince the beginning of the 2018\u201319 rainy season, the Sea of Galilee has risen considerably. From being near the ecologically dangerous black line of \u2212214.4 m, the level has risen by April 2020 to just below the upper red line, a result of strong rains and a radical decrease in pumping. During the entire 2018\u201319 rainy season the water level rose by a historical record of , while the 2019\u201320 winter brought a rise. The Water Authority dug a new canal in order to let of water flow from the lake directly into the Jordan River, bypassing the existing dams system for technical and financial reasons.\nDue to the low water levels of the lake, in October 2025 Israel began pumping desalinated water into the Sea of Galilee, an unprecedented step globally, as it marks the first attempt to top up a freshwater lake with processed water. The project is expected to raise the lake's level by around 0.5 centimeters per month.\nWater use.\nThe National Water Carrier of Israel, completed in 1964, transports water from the lake to the population centers of Israel, and in the past supplied most of the country's drinking water. In 2016 the lake supplied approximately 10% of Israel's drinking water needs.\nIn 1964, Syria attempted construction of a Headwater Diversion Plan that would have blocked the flow of water into the Sea of Galilee, sharply reducing the water flow into the lake. This project and Israel's attempt to block these efforts in 1965 were factors which played into regional tensions culminating in the 1967 Six-Day War. During the war, Israel captured the Golan Heights, which contain some of the sources of water for the Sea of Galilee.\nUp until the mid-2010s, about of water was pumped through the National Water Carrier each year. Under the terms of the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty, Israel also supplies of water annually from the lake to Jordan. In recent years the Israeli government has made extensive investments in water conservation, reclamation and desalination infrastructure in the country. This has allowed it to significantly reduce the amount of water pumped from the lake annually in an effort to restore and improve its ecological environment, as well as respond to some of the most extreme drought conditions in hundreds of years affecting the lake's intake basin since 1998. Therefore, it was expected that in 2016 only about of water would be drawn from the lake for Israeli domestic consumption, a small fraction of the amount typically drawn from the lake over the previous decades.\nTourism.\nTourism around the Sea of Galilee is an important economic segment. Historical and religious sites in the region draw both local and foreign tourists. The Sea of Galilee is an attraction for Christian pilgrims who visit Israel to see the places where Jesus performed miracles according to the New Testament. Alonzo Ketcham Parker, a 19th-century American traveler, called visiting the Sea of Galilee \"a 'fifth gospel' which one read devoutly, his heart overflowing with quiet joy\".\nIn April 2011, Israel unveiled a hiking trail in Galilee for Christian pilgrims, called the \"Jesus Trail\". It includes a network of footpaths, roads and bicycle paths linking sites central to the lives of Jesus and his disciples. It ends at Capernaum on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus expounded his teachings. Another key attraction is the site where the Sea of Galilee's water flows into the Jordan River, to which thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to be baptized every year.\nIsrael's most well-known open water swim race, the Kinneret Crossing, is held every year in September, drawing thousands of open water swimmers to participate in competitive and noncompetitive events. Tourists also partake in the building of rafts on \"Lavnun Beach\", called Rafsodia. Here many different age groups work together to build a raft with their bare hands and then sail that raft across the sea. Other economic activities include fishing in the lake and agriculture, particularly bananas, dates, mangoes, grapes and olives in the fertile belt of land surrounding it.\nThe Turkish Aviators Monument, erected during the Ottoman era, stands near Kibbutz Ha'on on the lakeshore, commemorating the Turkish pilots whose monoplanes crashed en route to Jerusalem.\nEcology.\nThe warm waters of the Sea of Galilee support various flora and fauna, which have supported a significant commercial fishery for more than two millennia. Local flora include various reeds along most of the shoreline as well as phytoplankton. Fauna include zooplankton, benthos and a number of fish species such as \"Mirogrex terraesanctae\". The Fishing and Agricultural Division of the Ministry of Water and Agriculture of Israel lists 10 families of fish living in the lake, with a total of 27 species \u2013 19 native and 8 introduced species. Local fishermen talk of four types of fish: \"\u0645\u0634\u0637 musht\" (tilapia); sardin (the Kinneret bleak, \"Mirogrex terraesanctae\"); \"\u0628\u0646\u064a biny\" or Jordan barbel, \"Luciobarbus longiceps\" (barb-like); and North African sharptooth catfish (\"Clarias gariepinus\"). The tilapia species include the Galilean tilapia (\"Sarotherodon galilaeus\"), the blue tilapia (\"Oreochromis aureus\"), and the redbelly tilapia (\"Tilapia zillii\"). Fish caught commercially include \"Tristramella simonis\" and the Galilean tilapia, locally called \"St. Peter's fish\". In 2005, of tilapia were caught by local fishermen. This dropped to in 2009 because of overfishing. A fish species that is unique to the lake, \"Tristramella sacra\", used to spawn in the marsh and has not been seen since the 1990s droughts. Conservationists fear this species may have become extinct.\nLow water levels in drought years have stressed the lake's ecology. This may have been aggravated by over-extraction of water for either the National Water Carrier to supply other parts of Israel or, since 1994, for the supply of water to Jordan. Droughts of the early and mid-1990s dried out the marshy northern margin of the lake. It is hoped that drastic reductions in the amount of water pumped through the National Water Carrier will help restore the lake's ecology over the span of several years.\nThe lake, with its immediate surrounds, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports populations of black francolins and non-breeding griffon vultures as well as many wintering waterbirds, including marbled teals, great crested grebes, grey herons, great white egrets, great cormorants and black-headed gulls.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also the capital of the province of Valladolid. With a population of 299,816, it is the 13th largest municipality in Spain.\nThe city is located roughly in the centre of the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula's Meseta Central, at the confluence of the Pisuerga and Esgueva rivers before they join the Duero, surrounded by winegrowing areas. The area was settled in pre-Roman times by the Celtic Vaccaei people, and then by Romans themselves. The settlement was purportedly founded after 1072, growing in prominence within the context of the Crown of Castile, being endowed with fairs and different institutions such as a collegiate church, University (1241), Royal Court and Chancellery and a royal mint.\nValladolid was the location of Europe's first moral debate on the treatment of indigenous people and is the city in which Christopher Columbus died. It was briefly the capital of Habsburg Spain between 1601 and 1606. The city then declined until the arrival of the railway in the 19th century, and with its industrialisation into the 20th century.\nThe old town is made up of a variety of historic houses, palaces, churches, plazas, avenues and parks, and includes the National Museum of Sculpture as well as the houses of Zorrilla and Cervantes which are open as museums. Notably, the city's Plaza Mayor was the first of its kind in Spain, dating back to the thirteenth century. It was eventually used as a model for similar plazas such as Plaza Mayor in Madrid.\nAmong the events that are held each year in the city are the famous Holy Week, the World Jigsaw Puzzle Championships, and the Valladolid International Film Festival (Seminci). In 2019, Valladolid was recognised as a City of Film as part of UNESCO's Creative Cities Network. Together with another 15 surrounding municipalities, it belongs to an urban community of around 404,000 inhabitants.\nName.\nThere is no direct evidence for the origin of the modern name of Valladolid.\nIt is mentioned as \"Valledolit\" in the \"Primera Cr\u00f3nica General\"; earlier documented variants include \"Valledolidi\", \"Valleolide\" (1092) and \"Valleolit\", \"Valleoleti\", \"Valleoliti\" (1095).\nOne widely held etymological theory suggests that the modern name \"Valladolid\" derives from the Celtiberian language expression , meaning \"valley of waters\", referring to the confluence of rivers in the area.\nAnother theory suggests that the name derives from the Arabic expression (, ), which is the and means 'city of al-Walid', referring to Al-Walid I.\nYet a third claims that it derives from , meaning 'valley of the olives'; however, no olive trees are found in that terrain. Instead, innumerable pine trees abound in the south part of the city. The gastronomy reflects the importance of the (pine nut) as a local product, rather than olives.\nIn texts from the Middle Ages the town is called \"Vallisoletum\", meaning 'sunny valley', and inhabitants are still called today (male) and (female).\nThe city is also popularly called , a nickname whose origin is not clear, but may refer to knights in the service of Joan of Arc, known as . Another theory is that comes from the fact that Pozzolana cement was sold there, the only city in Spain that sold it.\nHistory.\nPrecedents.\nThe Vaccaei were a Celtic tribe, the first people documented as a stable presence on the sector of the middle valley of the River Duero.\nRemains of Celtiberian and of a Roman camp have been excavated near the city. The nucleus of the city was originally located in the area of the current San Miguel y el Rosarillo square and was surrounded by a palisade. Proofs of the existence of three ancient lines of walls have been found.\nAfter the Muslim invasion in Spain in 711, the Christian kings moved the population of the Douro basin into more easily defended areas and deliberately created a no man's land as a buffer zone against Muslim encroachment from the south. The area was reconquered by the Christian king Alfonso I of Asturias who reigned in 739-757, but because the area was close to the frontier, it had a small population until after the Christians had secured the entire Douro basin in the battle of Simancas, in 939.\nRepopulation and growth.\nIn 1072 Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile gave the Lordship of Valladolid to Count Pedro Ans\u00farez. Entrusted with the repopulation of the area, Ans\u00farez led the foundation of Valladolid along with his wife Eylo Alf\u00f3nsez. By 1084 the project for the foundation of the settlement was already underway. Ans\u00farez built a palace (now lost) and La Antigua church. Eylo founded three hospitals and the Churches of San Sebasti\u00e1n and San Nicol\u00e1s. Both co-founded the church of Santa Mar\u00eda. Valladolid was repopulated by people from the lands of Carri\u00f3n and Salda\u00f1a.\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries, Valladolid grew rapidly, favoured by the commercial privileges granted by the kings Alfonso VIII and Alfonso X.\nEarly modern period.\nIn 1469, Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon were married in the city; by the 15th century Valladolid was the residence of the kings of Castile. In 1506, Christopher Columbus died in Valladolid \"still convinced that he had reached the Indies\" in a house that is now a museum dedicated to him.\nFrom 1554 to 1559, Joanna of Austria, sister of Philip II, served as regent, establishing herself in Valladolid, with the latter becoming the political center of the Hispanic Monarchy by that time. She favoured the Ebolist Party, one of the two leading factions of the Court of Philip II, in competition with the \"albistas\". The Reformation took hold in some parts of the city where Protestant circles appeared presumably around the leading figure of Augustino de Cazalla, an adviser of Joanna. Ensuing \"autos de fe\" against the Protestant sects took place in 1559 in Valladolid. A catastrophic fire in 1561 destroyed a portion of the city.\nDuring 1550\u20131551 the town held the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of the indigenous people by conquerors.\nValladolid was granted the status of city in 1596, also becoming a bishopric.\nIn the midst of the reign of Philip III, Valladolid briefly served as the capital of the Hispanic Monarchy between 1601 and 1606 under the auspice of the Duke of Lerma, \"valido\" of Philip III. Lerma and his network had bought plots in Valladolid before in order to sell those to the Crown. Promoted by Lerma, the decision on moving the capital from Madrid to Valladolid has been portrayed as case of a (double) real estate speculative scheme, as Lerma had bought housing in Madrid as the prices plummeted when the capital was moved from the city. After a plague in Valladolid, Lerma suggested the King to go back to Madrid, earning a hefty profit when the royal court returned and prices went up again.\nThe city was again damaged by a flood of the rivers Pisuerga and Esgueva.\nContemporary history.\nFrom 1950 onwards Valladolid became an important industrial centre. This was the context in which companies such as ENDASA (1950), FASA (1954), TECNAUTO (1956) and SAVA (1957) were created. The city was declared as a \"Polo de Desarrollo Industrial\" (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") in 1964. During the 1960 and early 1970s the city attracted many immigrants, chiefly coming from the province of Valladolid and neighbouring provinces. The city started to expand across the western bank of the Pisuerga in the early 1960s.\nIn the context of the fraught process for the creation of the autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n (completed in 1983), Valladolid vied for the condition of regional capital, competing with other cities, most notably creating a sense of \"antagonism\" with Burgos. Although the capital was not explicitly enshrined in the region's statute of autonomy from 1983, Valladolid was designated in 1987 as the \"de jure\" seat of the executive and legislative institutions (the Junta of Castile and Le\u00f3n and the Cortes of Castile and Le\u00f3n).\n25 June 2024, the church de la Vera Cruz built in 1581 broke down, causing dust to encircle the whole city. This accident was supposedly due to renovation works.\nJewish History.\nThe earliest documented presence of a Jewish community in Valladoilid dates to 1221. In 1288, Sancho IV prohibited Jews from acquiring land in Valladolid and the surrounding area. In 1322, Christians were prohibited from being treated by Jewish doctors, and could not attend Jewish or Muslim weddings. Furthermore, Jews were barred from positions of public office. In the early 15th century, the Laws of Valladolid were passed with anti-Jewish legislation. These laws stripped the Jews of Valladolid of their autonomy, which included the right to have their own court system. Additionally, Jews and Moors were prohibited from leaving Castille. In 1432, however, officials in Valladolid met with Don Abraham Benveniste in the Jewish quarter of the city, and agreed to restore Jewish autonomy. Converso poet Juan de Valladolid wrote poems criticizing treatment of Jews in Valladolid. Jewish life in Valladolid was nonexistent in the 16th century, after the expulsion of the Jews.\nGeography.\nValladolid is located at roughly 735 metres above sea level, at the centre of the \"Meseta Norte\", the plateau drained by the Duero river basin covering a major part of the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The primitive urban core was built \"ex novo\" in the 11th century on a small elevation near the confluence of the Esgueva with the Pisuerga, on the left-bank of the latter river. The city of Valladolid currently lies on both banks of the Pisuerga, a major right-bank tributary of the Douro.\nBesides the main territory on which the city lies, the municipality also includes two exclaves: Navabuena (5,129 hectares, hosting the Prison of Villanubla) and El Rebollar (400 hectares).\nClimate.\nThe city of Valladolid experiences a continentalized hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\"; Trewartha: \"Doak\") with influences of a cold semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"BSk\"; Trewartha: \"BSak\"). Valladolid's climate features cool and windy winters due to altitude and the inland location of the city. Fog is very typical in the morning during winter. Winters experience occasional snow and low temperatures below freezing during cold fronts. Valladolid's climate is influenced by the distance from the sea and its higher altitude.\nValladolid is drier than Spain's northern coastal regions, although there is year-round precipitation. Average annual precipitation is and the average annual relative humidity is 64%.\nAdministration.\nValladolid is a municipality, the basic local administrative division in Spain. The Ayuntamiento de Valladolid is the body charged with the municipal government and administration. The Plenary of the \"ayuntamiento\" is formed by 27 elected municipal councillors, who in turn invest the mayor. The last municipal election took place on 26 May 2019. Since 2015, \u00d3scar Puente (PSOE) serves as Mayor. He renewed his spell for a second mandate following the 2019 election.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2024, the population of the city proper of Valladolid is 299,816, and the population of the entire urban area is estimated to be 406,923 as of 2015. The most important municipalities of the urban area are (after Valladolid itself) Laguna de Duero and Boecillo on the south, Arroyo de la Encomienda, Zarat\u00e1n, Simancas and Villanubla on the west, Cigales and Santovenia de Pisuerga on the north, and Tudela de Duero and Cist\u00e9rniga on the east.\nAfter new neighbourhoods developed in recent decades, like Covaresa, the high prices in the municipality led young people to buy properties in towns around the city, due to which the population has fallen in Valladolid but is growing fast in other peri-urban areas (for example, Arroyo de la Encomienda or Zarat\u00e1n).\nAs of 2024, the foreign-born population of the city is 33,307, equal to 11.1% of the total population.\nEconomy.\nValladolid is a major economic center in Spain. The automotive industry is one of the major motors of the city's economy since the founding of FASA-Renault in 1953 for the assembling of Renault branded vehicles, which would later become Renault Espa\u00f1a. Four years later, in 1957, Sava was founded and started producing commercial vehicles. Sava would later be absorbed by Pegaso and since 1990 by the Italian truck manufacturer Iveco. Together with the French tire manufacturer Michelin, Renault and Iveco form the most important industrial companies of the city.\nBesides the automotive and automotive auxiliary industries, other important industrial sectors are food processing (with local companies like Acor and Queser\u00edas Entrepinares and facilities of multinationals like Cadbury, Lactalis or Lesaffre), metallurgy (Lingotes Especiales, Saeta die Casting...), chemical and printing. In total 22 013 people were employed in 2007 in industrial workplaces, representing 14.0% of total workers.\nThe main economic sector of Valladolid in terms of employment is however the service sector, which employs 111,988 people, representing 74.2% of Valladolid workers affiliated to Social Security.\nThe construction sector employed 15,493 people in 2007, representing 10.3% of total workers.\nFinally, agriculture is a tiny sector in the city which only employs 2,355 people (1.5% of the total). The predominant crops are wheat, barley and sugar beet.\nTop 10 companies by turnover in 2013 in \u20ac million were: Renault (4 596), Michelin (2 670), Iveco (1 600), the Valladolid-based supermarket chain Grupo El \u00c1rbol (849), cheese processing Queser\u00edas Entrepinares (204), sugar processing Acor (201), service group Grupo Norte (174), automobile auxiliary company Faurecia-Asientos de Castilla y Le\u00f3n (143), Sada (129) and Hipereco (108).\nEducation.\nEducation management and policing in Valladolid depends on the Ministry of Education of the Government of Castile and Le\u00f3n, the department responsible for the education at the regional level, both at the university and non-university level.\nUniversities.\nUniversity of Valladolid.\nThe University of Valladolid (UVA) was founded in 1241 by Alfonso VIII of Castille. It is one of the oldest universities in the world. It has four campuses around the city (Huerta del Rey, Centro, R\u00edo Esgueva and Miguel Delibes) as well as another three campuses scattered around the wider region of Castile and Le\u00f3n (Palencia, Soria and Segovia). Spread over 25 colleges and their associated centers, about 2000 teachers give classes to more than 23,800 students enrolled in 2011.\nIt also features the 25 centers, a number of administrative buildings such as the Palacio de Santa Cruz, where the rector, and the Museum of the University of Valladolid (MUVa), The House of Students, featuring the other administrative services mainly related to international relations, or CTI (Center for Information Technology), both located in the basement of the University Residence Alfonso VIII, next to the old Faculty of Science.\nMiguel de Cervantes European University.\nThe Miguel de Cervantes European University (\"Universidad Europea Miguel de Cervantes\"; UEMC) is a private university with roughly 1,500 students. It is spread over three faculties: Social Sciences, Law and Economics, Health and the Polytechnic School. It has later expanded its campus with a new facility doubling the area devoted to teaching and research. It also has a dental clinic and a library.\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nLyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Castilla y Le\u00f3n, a French international school, is near Valladolid, in Laguna de Duero. San Ju\u00e1n Bautista de La Salle School, a High Private College in Valladolid. Integral and Superior Education. Integrates Kindergarten, Primary School and High School.\nArchitecture.\n12th century romanesque architecture is present in the belltowers of the churches of Santa Mar\u00eda La Antigua and San Mart\u00edn.\nThe School of San Gregorio has been highlighted as an outstanding example Late Gothic architecture (Isabelline gothic). The Gothic style is also present in the Church of San Pablo (featuring also Renaissance and plateresque elements). The late 15th century Palace of Santa Cruz (current seat of the rectorate of the University of Valladolid) has been noted as a pioneer example of Renaissance art in Spain.\nThe monumental Plaza Mayor, considered the first in its genre in Spain, was projected by Francisco de Salamanca by 1561\u201362, following the great fire of 1561. The porticoed plaza distinctly employs stone columns with wooden footings and lintels. The design of the fa\u00e7ades of the \"plaza\" served as template for a number of buildings in nearby streets.\nThe unfinished Cathedral of Valladolid, initially projected by Juan de Herrera in the 16th century (intending to follow a Mannerist style) experienced protracted building works owing to financial problems and its main body was not opened until 1668. Decades later, in 1730, Alberto de Churriguera finished the work on the main front.\nThe Teatro Lope de Vega is a theater built in the classical style in 1861 and now very run-down. There has been recent controversy over whether the city should pay to restore it. The Campo Grande, a large public park located in the heart of the city, dates back to 1787. Architect Modesto Coloma Palenzuela left a key imprint in the city's outline, authoring many housing projects in the late 19th to early 20th century, with a good number of his buildings still standing. Standout examples of Eclectic architecture from the late 19th and early 20th century in the city include the neoplateresque City Hall, the cavalry academy, Palace of Correos y Tel\u00e9grafos (defaced in a revamp undergone in the 1960s), and the neobaroque new building for the university.\nThe Francoist dictatorship left an example of \"Imperial Architecture\" of neo-herrerian (or \"escurialense\") style in the building for the \"Seminario Menor\", clearly influenced by the Spanish capital's Ministry of the Air.\nThe city preserves the residences of iconic city neighbors such as the Casa de Cervantes and the house of Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla. The Christopher Columbus House-Museum, by contrast, is a 1960s reconstruction. \nTransport.\nPublic transport.\nUrban transit system was based on the Valladolid tram network from 1881 to 1933. A public urban bus system started in 1928, managed by different private tenders until 1982, when the service was taken over by the municipality. Today the public company AUVASA operates the network, with 22 regular lines and 5 late night lines.\nHigh-speed rail.\nValladolid-Campo Grande railway station is integrated into the Spanish high-speed network AVE. The Madrid\u2013Valladolid high-speed rail line was inaugurated on 22 December 2007. The line links both cities, crossing the Sierra de Guadarrama through the namesake tunnel, the fourth longest train tunnel in Europe. Valladolid will become the hub for all AVE lines connecting the north and north-west of Spain with the rest of the country. Trainsets used on this line include S-114 (max speed 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph)), S-130 (Patito, max speed 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph)) and the S102 (Pato, max speed 320\u00a0km/h or 199\u00a0mph). This line connects the city with Madrid, which can be reached in 56 minutes.\nRoads.\nSeveral highways connect the city to the rest of the country.\nAirport.\nThe airport serving the city is not located within the municipal limits, but in Villanubla. The airport has connections to Barcelona, M\u00e1laga, and the Canary Islands.\nCulture.\nLanguages.\nSpanish is the only official language throughout the city. Valladolid stands out for having been the residence of the author of \"Don Quixote\", Miguel de Cervantes, as well as authors such as Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla or Miguel Delibes and the thrust of its University. The province stands out for receiving a significant number of people who want to learn the Spanish language (Language tourism).\nEaster.\nHoly Week (\"Semana Santa\" in Spanish) holds one of the best known Catholic traditions in Valladolid. The Good Friday processions are considered an exquisite and rich display of Castilian religious sculpture. On this day, in the morning, members of the brotherhoods on horseback make a poetic proclamation throughout the city. The \"Sermon of the Seven Words\" is spoken in Plaza Mayor Square. In the afternoon, thousands of people take part in the Passion Procession, comprising 31 pasos (religious statues), most of which date from the 16th and 17th centuries. The last statue in the procession is the Virgen de las Angustias, and her return to the church is one of the most emotional moments of the celebrations, with the Salve Popular sung in her honour.\nEaster is one of the most spectacular and emotional fiestas in Valladolid. Religious devotion, art, colour and music combine in acts to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ: the processions. Members of the different Easter brotherhoods, dressed in their characteristic robes, parade through the streets carrying religious statues (pasos) to the sound of drums and music.\nSeminci.\nThe city is also host to one of the foremost (and oldest) international film festivals, the \"Semana Internacional de Cine de Valladolid (Seminci)\", founded in 1956. Valladolid, through various loopholes in state censorship, was able to present films that would otherwise have been impossible to see in Spain. An award or an enthusiastic reception from the audience and the critics meant, on numerous occasions, that the official state bodies gave the go-ahead to certain films which Francisco Franco's regime considered out of line with their ideology.\nEven after the death of Franco in 1975, Valladolid continued to be the \"testing ground\" for films which had been banned. For example, the premiere in Spain of Stanley Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange\" at the 1975 festival is still recalled as a landmark.\nLocal cuisine.\nAlthough an inland province, fish is commonly consumed, some brought from the Cantabrian Sea. Fish like red bream and hake are a major part of Valladolid's cuisine.\nThe main speciality of Valladolid is, however, lechazo (suckling baby lamb). The lechazo is slowly roasted in a wood oven and served with salad.\nValladolid also offers a great assortment of wild mushrooms. Asparagus, endive and beans can also be found. Some legumes, like white beans and lentils are particularly good. Pine nuts are also produced in great quantities.\nSheep cheese from Villal\u00f3n de Campos, the famous pata de mulo (mule's foot) is usually unripened (fresh), but if it is cured the ripening process brings out such flavour that it can compete with the best sheep cheeses in Spain.\nValladolid has a bread to go with every dish, like the delicious cuadros from Medina del Campo, the muffins, the pork-scratching bread and the lechuguinos, with a pattern of concentric circles that resemble a head of lettuce.\nThe pastries and baked goods from the province of Valladolid are well-known, specially St. Mary's ring-shaped pastries, St. Claire's sponge cakes, pine nut balls and cream fritters.\nValladolid is also a producer of wines. The ones that fall under the Designation of Origin Cigales are very good. White wines from Rueda and red wines from Ribera del Duero are known for their quality.\nSports.\nValladolid's main association football club is Real Valladolid, nicknamed \"Pucela\", who play in the country's second-tier league, LaLiga Hypermotion. Players who went on to play for the Spain national football team include Fernando Hierro, Jos\u00e9 Luis Caminero and Rub\u00e9n Baraja. The municipally owned stadium where Real Valladolid play their home matches, the Estadio Nuevo Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla, was built as a venue for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and in preparation staged the 1982 Copa del Rey Final.\nCBC Valladolid is the city's new basketball team since the dissolution of CB Valladolid in 2015. Arvydas Sabonis and Oscar Schmidt played for the latter team. Currently playing in the Segunda FEB, the CBC Valladolid matches are held at the Polideportivo Pisuerga.\nIn handball Valladolid was represented by BM Valladolid of the Liga ASOBAL. They won 2 King's Cup, 1 ASOBAL Cup and 1 EHF Cup Winners' Cup. After the disappearance of this club, BM Atl\u00e9tico Valladolid was born, which also competes in the Liga ASOBAL. They play their games at the Polideportivo Huerta del Rey.\nRugby union is a very popular sport in Valladolid. VRAC and CR El Salvador, with 37 and 28 titles respectively, have dominated Spanish rugby for the last decades. They play their matches at Estadio Pepe Rojo.\nThe Plaza de toros de Valladolid, a bullring, opened on 29 September 1890, and it has a capacity of 11,000.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nValladolid is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther partnerships.\nValladolid cooperates with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "69313", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69313", "title": "Scribe", "text": "Person who writes or copies manuscripts\nA scribe is a person who serves as a professional copyist, especially one who made copies of manuscripts before the invention of automatic printing.\nThe work of scribes can involve copying manuscripts and other texts as well as secretarial and administrative duties such as the taking of dictation and keeping of business, judicial, and historical records for kings, nobles, temples, and cities.\nThe profession of scribe first appears in Mesopotamia. Scribes contributed in fundamental ways to ancient and medieval cultures, including Egypt, China, India, Persia, the Roman Empire, and medieval Europe. Judaism, Buddhism, and Islam have important scribal traditions. Scribes have been essential in these cultures for the preservation of legal codes, religious texts, and artistic and didactic literature. In some cultures, social functions of the scribe and of the calligrapher overlap, but the emphasis in scribal writing is on exactitude, whereas calligraphy aims to express the aesthetic qualities of writing apart from its content.\nPreviously a prominent fixture in literary cultures, scribes lost most of their prominence and status with the advent of the printing press. The generally less prestigious profession of scrivener continued to be important for copying and writing out legal documents and the like. In societies with low literacy rates, street-corner letter-writers (and readers) may still be found providing scribe service.\nMesopotamia.\nThe Sumerians developed one of the earliest writing systems (cuneiform), the first body of written literature, and an extensive scribal profession to further these activities. The work of Near Eastern scribes primarily exists on clay tablets and stone monuments written in cuneiform, though later in the period of cuneiform writing they begin to use papyrus, parchment, and writing tablets. The body of knowledge that scribes possessed belonged to an elite urban culture, and few had access to it. Traveling scribes played a vital role in the dissemination of literary culture.\nDuring the middle to late 3rd millennium BCE, Sumerian literature in the form of disputations proliferated, such as the \"Debate between bird and fish\"; the \"Debate between Summer and Winter\", in which Winter wins; and others between the cattle and grain, the tree and the reed, silver and copper, the pickaxe and the plough, and the millstone and the gul-gul stone. Nearly all known Sumerian literary works were preserved as a result of young scribes apprenticing for their profession. In addition to literary works, the contents of the tablets they produced include word lists, syllabaries, grammar forms, and lists of personal names.\nTo the extent that the curriculum in scribal schools can be reconstructed, it appears that they would have begun by studying lists and syllabaries and learning metrology, the formulas for writing legal contracts, and proverbs. They then might have advanced to praise poems and finally to copying more sophisticated works of literature. Some scholars have thought that apprentice scribes listened to literary compositions read aloud and took dictation; others, that they copied directly from master copies. A combination of dictation, copying, and memorization for reproduction has also been proposed.\nAncient Egypt.\nOne of the most important professionals in ancient Egypt was a person educated in the arts of writing (both hieroglyphics and hieratic scripts, as well as the demotic script from the second half of the first millennium BCE, which was mainly used as shorthand and for commerce) and arithmetic. Sons of scribes were brought up in the same scribal tradition, sent to school, and inherited their fathers' positions upon entering the civil service.\nMuch of what is known about ancient Egypt is due to the activities of its scribes and the officials. But because of their ability to study in the vast Egyptian libraries, they were entrusted with jobs bigger than just copyists. Monumental buildings were erected under their supervision, administrative and economic activities were documented by them, and stories from Egypt's lower classes and foreign lands survive due to scribes putting them in writing.\nScribes were considered part of the royal court, were not conscripted into the army, did not have to pay taxes, and were exempt from the heavy manual labor required of the lower classes (corv\u00e9e labor). The scribal profession worked with painters and artisans who decorated reliefs and other building works with scenes, personages, or hieroglyphic text. However, the physical aspect of their work sometimes took a toll on their joints, with ancient bones showing some signs of arthritis that might be attributable to their profession.\nThe hieroglyph used to signify the scribe, \"to write\" and \"writings\", etc., is Gardiner sign Y3, Y3 from the category of 'writings, &amp; music'. The hieroglyph contains the scribe's ink-mixing palette, a vertical case to hold writing-reeds, and a leather pouch to hold the black and red ink blocks.\nThe demotic scribes used rush pens which had stems thinner than that of a reed (2\u00a0mm). The end of the rush was cut obliquely and then chewed so that the fibers became separated. The result was a short, stiff brush which was handled in the same manner as that of a calligrapher.\nThoth was the god credited with the invention of writing by the ancient Egyptians. He was the scribe of the gods who held knowledge of scientific and moral laws.\nChina.\nThe earliest known examples of writing in China are a body of inscriptions made on bronze vessels and oracle bones during the late Shang dynasty (\u00a0BCE), with the very oldest dated to \u00a0BCE. It was originally used for divination, with characters etched onto turtle shells to interpret cracks caused by exposure to heat. By the sixth century BCE, scribes were producing books using bamboo and wooden slips. Each strip contained a single column of script, and the books were bound together with hemp, silk, or leather. China is well-known as being the place where paper was originally invented, likely by an imperial eunuch named Cai Lun in 105 CE. The invention of paper allowed for the later invention of woodblock printing, where paper was rubbed onto an inked slab to copy the characters. Despite this invention, calligraphy remained a prized skill due to the belief that \"the best way to absorb the contents of a book was to copy it by hand\".\nChinese scribes played an instrumental role in the imperial government's civil service. During the Tang dynasty, private collections of Confucian classics began to grow. Young men hoping to join the civil service would need to pass an exam based on Confucian doctrine, and these collections, which became known as \"academy libraries\" were places of study. Within this merit system, owning books was a sign of status. Despite the later importance of Confucian manuscripts, they were initially heavily resisted by the Qin dynasty. Though their accounts are likely exaggerated, later scholars describe a period of book burning and scholarly suppression. This exaggeration likely stems from Han dynasty historians being steeped in Confucianism as state orthodoxy.\nSimilarly to the west, religious texts, particularly Buddhist, were transcribed in monasteries and hidden during \"times of persecution\". In fact, the earliest known copy of a printed book is of the \"Diamond Sutra\" dating to 868 CE, which was found alongside other manuscripts within a walled-in cave called Dunhuang.\nAs professionals, scribes would undergo three years of training before becoming novices. The title of \"scribe\" was inherited from father to son. Early in their careers, they would work with local and regional governments and did not enjoy an official rank. A young scribe needed to hone their writing skills before specializing in an area like public administration or law. Archaeological evidence even points to scribes being buried with marks of their trade such as brushes, \"administrative, legal, divinatory, mathematical, and medicinal texts\", thus displaying a personal embodiment of their profession.\nAlready throughout the Zhou period, scribes appear to have enjoyed a reputation as trustworthy and steadfast recorders of events\u2014individuals who would risk their lives to preserve an accurate account of the truth. They frequently appear in historiography as reliable witnesses whose very presence authenticates an episode; in some cases, they may even have been invented to lend a particular story greater credibility.\nSouth Asia.\nThe Buddhist Tripi\u1e6daka emerged at the beginning of the first century. Buddhist texts were treasured and sacred throughout Asia and were written in different languages. Buddhist scribes believed that, \u201cThe act of copying them could bring a scribe closer to perfection and earn him merit.\u201d\nRather later, Hindu texts were written, although the most sacred, especially the Vedas, were not written down until much later, and were learnt by heart by the priestly Brahmins. Writing in the several scripts of Indic languages was generally not regarded as a distinct artistic form, in a situation similar to Europe, but different from East Asian traditions of calligraphy.\nJapan.\nBy the 5th century CE, written Chinese was being adapted in Japan to represent spoken Japanese. The complexity of reconciling Japanese with a system of writing not meant to express it meant that acquiring literacy was a long process. Phonetic syllabaries \"(kana)\", used for private writing, were developed by the 8th century and were in use along with \"kanji\", the logographic system, used for official records. Gendering of the private and public spheres led to a characterization of \"kana\" as more feminine and \"kanji\" as masculine, but women of the court were educated and knew \"kanji\", and men also wrote in \"kana\", while works of literature were produced in both.\nThe earliest extant writings take the form of \"mokkan\", wooden slips used for official memoranda and short communications and for practical purposes such as shipping tags; inscriptions on metal and stone; and manuscripts of sutras and commentaries. \"Mokkan\" were often used for writing practice. Manuscripts first took the form of rolls made from cloth or sheets of paper, but when manuscripts began to appear as bound books, they coexisted with handscrolls \"(makimono)\".\nThe influence of Chinese culture, especially written culture, made writing \"immensely important\" in the early Japanese court. The earliest Japanese writing to survive dates from the late Asuka and Nara periods (550\u2013794), when Buddhist texts were being copied and disseminated. Because Buddhism was text-based, monks were employed in scribal and bureaucratic work for their skill in writing and knowledge of Chinese culture. In portraits of Buddhist clerics, a handscroll is a symbol of scribal authority and the possession of knowledge.\nGovernment offices and Buddhist centers employed copyists on a wide scale, requiring an abundance of materials such as paper, glue, ink, and brushes; exemplars from which to copy; an organizational structure; and technicians for assembly, called \"s\u014dk\u014d\" or \"s\u014d\u2019\u014d\". More than 10,000 Nara documents are preserved in the Sh\u014ds\u014din archives of the T\u014ddai-ji temple complex. The institution of the \"ritsury\u014d \" legal state from the 8th to 10th centuries produced \"a mountain of paperwork\" employing hundreds of bureaucratic scribes in the capital and in the provinces. The average sutra copyist is estimated to have generated 3,800\u20134,000 characters a day. Scribes were paid by the \"page,\" and the fastest completed thirteen or more sheets a day, working on a low table and seated on the floor. Both speed and accuracy mattered. Proofreaders checked the copy against the exemplar, and the scribe's pay was docked for errors.\nIn the 8th century, the demand for vast quantities of copies meant that scribes in the Office of Sutra Transcription were lay people of common status, not yet ordained monks, some finding opportunities for advancement. In Classical Japan, even lay scribes at some sutra copyist centers were required to practice ritual purity through vegetarian dietary restrictions, wearing ritual garments \"(j\u014de)\", ablution, avoiding contact with death and illness, and possibly sexual abstinence. Outside Buddhist centers, professional scriveners practiced copyist craft. Court-commissioned chronicles of the 8th century, such as \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon shoki\", survive in much later copies, as is the case for the first Japanese poetry anthologies.\nThe earliest printed books were produced under the Empress Sh\u014dtoku on a large scale in the 8th century, only three centuries after Japanese became a written language, and by the Edo period (1603\u20131868) bound printed books predominated. Manuscripts remained valued for their aesthetic qualities, and the scribal tradition continued to flourish for a wide range of reasons. In addition to handwritten practical documents pertaining to legal and commercial transactions, individuals might write journals or commonplace books, which involved copying out sometimes lengthy passages by hand. This copying might extend to complete manuscripts of books that were expensive or not readily available to buy.\nBut scribal culture was not merely or always a matter of need or necessity. Copying Buddhist sutras was a devotional practice \"(shaky\u014d)\". In the Nara period, wealthy patrons commissioned sutra copying on behalf of ancestors to gain them spiritual passage from the Buddhist hells. The Edo-period court noble Konoe Iehiro created a sutra manuscript in gold ink on dark blue paper, stating his purpose in the colophon as \"to ensure the spiritual enlightenment of his departed mother.\"\nCreating a calligraphic and pictorial work by copying secular literature likewise was an aesthetic practice for its own sake and a means of study. Within the social elite of the court, calligraphy was thought to express the inner character of the writer. In the Heian period, the book collector, scholar-scribe, and literary artist Fujiwara no Teika was a leader in preserving and producing quality manuscripts of works of literature. Even so prolific an author of printed prose works as Ihara Saikaku (1642\u20131693) also produced handwritten works in several formats, including manuscripts, handscrolls, and poetry slips \"(tanzaku)\" and cards \"(shikishi)\". Unique and prized handscrolls preserved the collaborative poetry sessions characteristic of \"renga\" and \"haikai\" poetic composition, distributed more widely in printed copies.\nFor authors not located near the major centers of publishing and printing, manuscripts were a route to publication. Some authors self-published their books, especially romance novels \"(ninj\u014dbon)\", in manuscript form. Women's prose writings in general were circulated as manuscripts during the Edo period. Women were not prevented from writing and circulating their work, but private publication may have been a way for women to adhere to gender norms in not making themselves available in the public sphere.\nManuscripts could more readily evade government censorship, and officially banned books that could no longer be printed were copied for personal use or circulated privately. Lending libraries \"(kashihon'ya)\" offered manuscript books, including illicit texts, along with printed books. Books might also be composed as manuscripts when their transmission was limited to a particular circle of interested parties or sharers in the knowledge, such as local history and antiquarianism, a family's accumulated lore or farming methods, or medical texts of a particular school of medicine. Intentional secrecy might be desired to protect arcane knowledge or proprietary information with commercial value.\nIn the esoteric strand of Japanese Buddhism, scribes recorded oracles, the utterances of a \"kami\"-inspired person often in the form of dialogues in response to questions. The transcriber also filled in context for the transmission. After the text was verified, it became part of the canon, stored in secret places, viewable by affiliated monks, and used to legitimate forms of religious authority. Because they dealt with genealogies and sacral boundaries, oracle texts were consulted as references in questions of lineage and land ownership.\nAt contemporary Shinto or Buddhist shrines, scribal traditions still play a role in creating \"ofuda\" (talismans), \"omikuji\" (fortunes or divination lots), \"ema\" (votive tablets), \"goshuin\" (calligraphic visitor stamps), and \"gomagi\" (inscribed sticks for ritual burning), forms that may employ a combination of stamps and handwriting on media. Today these are often mass produced and commercialized for marketing to tourists. \"Ema\", for instance, began as large-scale pictorial representations that historically were created by professional artists. Small versions began to be produced and sold, and a complex symbology developed for the messages. Modern versions sold at shrines, often already stamped with their local affiliation, tend to be used more verbally, with space left for individuals to act as their own scribes in messaging the \"kami\".\nJudaism.\nScribes of ancient Israel were a literate minority in an oral based-culture. Some of them belonged to the priestly class, other scribes were the record-keepers and letter-writers in the royal palaces and administrative centers, affiliated with the ancient equivalent of professional guilds. \nThere were no scribal schools in Israel during the early part of the Iron Age (1200\u2013800 BCE). Between the 13th and 8th centuries BCE, the Hebrew alphabetic system had not been developed. Only after the appearance of the Kingdom of Israel, Finkelstein points to the reign of Omri, did the scribal schools begin to develop, reaching their culmination in the time of Jeroboam II, under Mesopotamian influence. The eventual standardization of the Hebrew writing system between the eighth and sixth centuries BCE would presumably have given rise to codified rules and principles of language that scribes would then have learned. The education of scribes in ancient Israel was supported by the state, although some scribal arts could have been taught within a small number of families.\nSome scribes also copied documents, but this was not necessarily part of their job.\nThe Jewish scribes used the following rules and procedures while creating copies of the Torah and eventually other books in the Hebrew Bible.\nSofer.\nSofers (Jewish scribes) are among the few scribes that still do their trade by hand, writing on parchment. Renowned calligraphers, they produce the Hebrew Torah scrolls and other holy texts.\nAccuracy.\nUntil 1948, the oldest known manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible dated back to 895 CE. In 1947, a shepherd boy discovered some scrolls dated between 100 BCE and 100 CE, inside a cave west of the Dead Sea. In the course of the following decades more scrolls were found in caves at Qumran and elsewhere.\nThe discovered texts have become known collectively as the \"Dead Sea Scrolls\".\nOne complete book, plus fragments of every other book in the Hebrew Bible except Esther, have been identified amongst the texts.\nFragments from each of the Hebrew canonical books have been discovered,\nincluding 30 fragments from the Book of Deuteronomy.\nWhile there were other items found among the Dead Sea Scrolls not currently in the Hebrew Bible, and many variations and errors occurred when they were copied, the texts, on the whole, testify to the accuracy of the scribes. The Dead Sea Scrolls are currently the best route of comparison to the accuracy and consistency of translation for the Hebrew Bible because they are the oldest out of any biblical text currently known.\nCorrections and editing.\nPriests who took over the leadership of the Jewish community preserved and edited biblical literature. Biblical literature became a tool that legitimated and furthered the priests' political and religious authority.\nCorrections by the scribes (Tiqqun soferim) refers to changes that were made in the original wording of the Hebrew Bible during the second temple period, perhaps sometime between 450 and 350 BCE. One of the most prominent men at this time was Ezra the scribe. He also hired scribes to work for him, in order to write down and revise the oral tradition. After Ezra and the scribes had completed the writing, Ezra gathered the Jews who had returned from exile, all of whom belonged to Kohanim families. Ezra read them an unfamiliar version of the Torah. This version was different from the Torah of their fathers. Ezra did not write a new bible. Through the genius of his \u2018editing', he presented the religion in a new light.\nAncient Rome.\nAncient Rome had several occupations for which the ability to write accurately and clearly was the primary qualification. The English word \u201cscribe\u201d derives from the Latin word \"scriba\", a public notary or clerk. The public \"scribae\" were the highest in rank of the four prestigious occupational grades (\"decuriae\") among the attendants of the Roman magistrates.\nIn the city of Rome, the \"scribae\" worked out of the state treasury and government archive. They received a good salary. \"Scribae\" were often former slaves and their sons; other literary or educated men who advanced to the job through patronage; or even men as highly ranked as the equestrian order. Among the writing duties of a \"scriba\" was the recording of sworn oaths on public tablets. The office afforded several advantages, including a knowledge of Roman law that was traditionally the privilege of the elite. People who needed legal documents drawn up and whose own literacy was low could make use of a public scribe. A \"scriba\" might also be a private secretary.\nA \"tabellio\" (Greek \"agoraios\") was a lower rank of scribe or notary who worked in civil service. A \"notarius\" was a stenographer.\nAn \"amanuensis\" was a scribe who took dictation and perhaps offered some compositional polish. \"Amanuenses\" were typically Greek and might be either male or female. Upper-class Romans made extensive use of dictation, and Julius Caesar was said to employ as many as four secretaries at once on different projects. The Apostle Paul, a Roman citizen literate in Greek, made use of an amanuensis for his epistles. It was considered impolite, however, to use a scribe for writing personal letters to friends; these were to be written by one's own hand. The Vindolanda tablets (early 2nd century CE) from a fort in Roman Britain contain several hundred examples of handwriting; a few tablets stand out as having been written by professional scribes.\nSome Roman households had libraries extensive enough to require specialized staff including \"librarii\", copyists or scribes, who were often slaves or freedmen, along with more general librarians \"(librarioli)\". Public libraries also existed under imperial sponsorship, and bookshops both sold books and employed independent \"librarii\" along with other specialists who constructed the scrolls. A copyist (\"librarius\" or \"libraria\") was said to need an \"irrational knack\" for copying text accurately without slowing down to comprehend it. Some literary slaves specialized in proofreading.\nOccasionally even senators took dictation or copied texts by hand for personal use, as did \"grammatici\" (\u201cgrammarians\u201d or professors of higher education), but generally the routine copying of manuscripts was a task for educated slaves or for freedpersons who worked independently in bookshops. Books were a favored gift for friends, and since they had to be individually written out, \"deluxe\" editions, made from higher-grade papyrus and other fine materials, might be commissioned from intellectuals who also acted as editors. Unscrupulous copyists might produce and trade in unauthorized editions, sometimes passing them off as autograph manuscripts by famous authors.\nThe literacy of a \"librarius\" was also valued in business settings, where they might serve as clerks. For example, a \"libraria cellaria\" would be a woman who kept business records such as inventories. An early 2nd-century marble relief from Rome depicts a female scribe, seated on a chair and writing on kind of a tablet, facing the butcher who is chopping meat at a table.\nEleven Latin inscriptions uncovered from Rome identify women as scribes in the sense of copyists or amanuenses (not public \"scribae\"). Among these are Magia, Pyrrhe, Vergilia Euphrosyne, and a freedwoman whose name does not survive; Hapate, a shorthand writer of Greek who lived to the age of 25; and Corinna, a storeroom clerk and scribe. Three are identified as literary assistants: Tyche, Herma, and Plaetoriae.\nEurope in the Middle Ages.\nMonastic scribes.\nIn the Middle Ages, every book was made by hand. Specially trained monks, or scribes, had to carefully cut sheets of parchment, make the ink, write the script, bind the pages, and create a cover to protect the script. This was all accomplished in a monastic writing room called a scriptorium which was kept very quiet so scribes could maintain concentration. A large scriptorium may have up to 40 scribes working.\nScribes woke to morning bells before dawn and worked until the evening bells, with a lunch break in between. They worked every day except for the Sabbath. The primary purpose of these scribes was to promote the ideas of the Christian Church, so they mostly copied classical and religious works. The scribes were required to copy works in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew whether or not they understood the language. These re-creations were often written in calligraphy and featured rich illustrations, making the process incredibly time-consuming. Scribes had to be familiar with the writing technology as well. They had to make sure that the lines were straight and the letters were the same size in each book that they copied. It typically took a scribe fifteen months to copy a Bible.\nSuch books were written on parchment or vellum made from treated hides of sheep, goats, or calves. These hides were often from the monastery's own animals as monasteries were self-sufficient in raising animals, growing crops, and brewing beer. The overall process was too extensive and costly for books to become widespread during this period.\nAlthough scribes were only able to work in daylight, due to the expense of candles and the rather poor lighting they provided, monastic scribes were still able to produce three to four pages of work per day. The average scribe could copy two books per year. They were expected to make at least one mistake per page.\nDuring the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, copying became more of a specialized activity and was increasingly performed by specialists. To meet expanding demand, the \"pecia\" system was introduced, in which different parts of the same text were assigned to hired copiers working both in and out of the monasteries.\nFemale scribes.\nWomen also played a role as scribes in Anglo-Saxon England, as religious women in convents and schools were literate. Excavations at medieval convents have uncovered styli, indicating that writing and copying were done at those locations. Also, female pronouns are used in prayers in manuscripts from the late 8th century, suggesting that the manuscripts were originally written by and for female scribes.\nIn the 12th century within a Benedictine monastery at Wessobrunn, Bavaria there lived a female scribe named Diemut.\u00a0She lived within the monastery as recluse and professional scribe. Two medieval book lists exist that have named Diemut as having written more than forty books. Fourteen of Diemut's books are in existence today. Included in these are four volumes of a six volume set of Pope Gregory the Great's \"Moralia in Job\", two volumes of a three-volume Bible, and an illuminated copy of the Gospels. It has been discovered that Diemut was a scribe for as long as five decades. She collaborated with other scribes in the production of other books. Since the Wessobrunn monastery enforced its strict claustration it is presumed that these other scribes were also women. Diemut was credited with writing so many volumes that she single-handedly stocked the Wessobrunn's library. Her dedication to book production for the benefit of the Wessobrunn monks and nuns eventually led to her being recognized as a local saint. At the Benedictine monastery within Admont, Austria it was discovered that some of the nuns had written verse and prose in both Latin and German. They delivered their own sermons, took dictation on wax tablets, and copied and illuminated manuscripts. They also taught Latin grammar and biblical interpretation at the school. By the end of the 12th century they owned so many books that they needed someone to oversee their scriptorium and library. Two female scribes have been identified within the Admont Monastery; Sisters Irmingart and Regilind.\nThere are several hundred women scribes that have been identified in Germany. These women worked within German women's convent from the thirteenth to the early 16th century.\u00a0Most of these women can only be identified by their names or initials, by their label as \"scriptrix\", \"soror\", \"scrittorix\", \"scriba\" or by the colophon (scribal identification which appears at the end of a manuscript). Some of the women scribes can be found through convent documents such as obituaries, payment records, book inventories, and narrative biographies of the individual nuns found in convent chronicles and sister books. These women are united by their contributions to the libraries of women's convents. Many of them remain unknown and unacknowledged but they served the intellectual endeavor of preserving, transmitting and on occasion creating texts. The books they left their legacies within were usually given to the sister of the convent and were dedicated to the abbess, or given or sold to the surrounding community. There are two obituaries that have been found that date back to the 16th century, both of the obituaries describe the women who died as a \"scriba\". In an obituary found from a monastery in Rulle, describes Christina Von Haltren as having written many other books.\nWomen's monasteries were different from men's in the period from the 13th to the 16th century. They would shift their order depending on their abbess. If a new abbess would be appointed then the order would change their identity. Every time a monastery would shift their order they would need to replace, correct and sometimes rewrite their texts. Many books survived from this period. Approximately 4,000 manuscripts have been discovered from women's convents from late medieval Germany. Women scribes served as the business women of the convent. They produced a large amount of archival and business materials, they recorded the information of the convent in the form of chronicles and obituaries. They were responsible for producing the rules, statutes and constitution of the order. They also copied a large amount of prayer books and other devotional manuscripts. Many of these scribes were discovered by their colophon.\nDespite women being barred from transcribing Torah scrolls for ritual use, a few Jewish women between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries are known to have copied other Hebrew manuscripts. They learned the craft from male scribes they were related to, and were unusual because women were not typically taught Hebrew. Knowledge of these women scribes comes from their colophon signatures.\nTown scribe.\nThe scribe was a common job in medieval European towns during the 10th and 11th centuries. Many were employed at scriptoria owned by local schoolmasters or lords. These scribes worked under deadlines to complete commissioned works such as historic chronicles or poetry. Due to parchment being costly, scribes often created a draft of their work first on a wax or chalk tablet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Declaration of Geneva was intended as a revision of the Hippocratic Oath to a formulation of that oath's moral truths that could be comprehended and acknowledged in a modern way. Unlike the case of the Oath of Hippocrates, the World Medical Association calls the statement a \"pledge\".\nCreation.\nDuring the post World War II era and immediately after its foundation, the World Medical Association (WMA) showed concern over the state of medical ethics in general and all over the world, taking the responsibility for setting ethical guidelines for the world physicians. The details of the Nazi Doctors' Trial at Nuremberg which ended August 1947 and the revelations about what the Imperial Japanese Army had done at Unit 731 in China during the war clearly demonstrated the need for reform, and for a re-affirmed set of guidelines regarding both human rights and the rights of patients.\nA study committee was appointed to prepare a \"Charter of Medicine\" which could be adopted as an oath or promise that every doctor in the world would make upon receiving their medical degree or diploma. It took two years of intensive study of the oaths and promises submitted by member associations to draft a modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates which was sent for consideration at the WMA's second general assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the assembly agreed to name it the \"Declaration of Geneva.\" This document was adopted by the World Medical Association only three months before the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) which provides for the security of the person.\nDeclaration.\nThe Declaration of Geneva (2017), as currently published by the World Medical Association\nreads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;AS A MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION:\nChanges from original.\nThe original oath read \"My colleagues will be my brothers,\" later changed to \"sisters and brothers.\" Until 1994 it also read \"I will maintain the utmost respect for human life, from the time of its conception (...)\". Age, disability, gender, and sexual orientation have been added as factors that must not interfere with a doctor's duty to a patient; some rephrasing of existing elements has occurred. Secrets are to remain confidential \"even after the patient has died.\" The violation of \"human rights and civil liberties\" replaces the violation of \"the laws of humanity\" as a forbidden use of medical knowledge. \"The health\" in general of a patient is now the doctor's first consideration compared to the \"health and life\" as stated in the original declaration. This was apparently changed to free the medical profession from extending life at all costs.\nThe 68th WMA General Assembly in October 2017 approved revisions including: respecting the autonomy of the patient; mutual respect for teachers, colleagues and students physicians to share medical knowledge for the benefit of their patients and the advancement of healthcare; a requirement for physicians to attend to their own health as well as their patients. Furthermore, the revised text is meant to be used by all active physicians (\"as member of the medical profession\") while before the text was used by beginners only (\"At the time of being admitted as a member of the medical profession\").\nDiscussions of the declaration changes.\nThe Declaration of Geneva was originally adopted by the WMA General Assembly in 1948 right after one year of the formation of World Medical Association, and has undergone a series of amendments throughout the years, until 2006 and the latest amendments, made at the 68th WMA General Assembly in Chicago in October 2017, make several significant additions. The most notable addition was a result of ongoing lobbying by New Zealand doctors' well-being advocate Dr Sam Hazledine, of MedWorld; in order to provide a high standard of care to patients, doctors must look after their own health. \nThe newly revised Declaration of Geneva, released in October 2017, contains some modifications in terms of words throughout but also three entirely new points:\nThe new Geneva Declaration version acknowledges respect for human rights of patients, the value of sharing knowledge with the community and profession, and the right and obligation of physicians to care for themselves, and to maintain their abilities for the benefit of society. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Written in the Samaritan script, it dates back to one of the ancient versions of the Torah that existed during the Second Temple period. It constitutes the entire biblical canon in Samaritanism.\nSome 6,000 differences exist between the Samaritan and the Jewish Masoretic Text. Most are minor variations in the spelling of words or grammatical constructions, but others involve significant semantic changes, such as the uniquely Samaritan commandment to construct an altar on Mount Gerizim. Nearly 2,000 of these textual variations agree with the Koine Greek Septuagint, and some are shared with the Latin Vulgate. Throughout their history, Samaritans have used translations of the Samaritan Pentateuch into Aramaic, Greek, and Arabic, as well as liturgical and exegetical works based upon it.\nIt first became known to the Western world in 1631, proving the first example of the Samaritan alphabet and sparking an intense theological debate regarding its relative age versus the Masoretic Text. This first published copy, much later labelled as Codex B by August Gall, became the source of most Western critical editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch until the latter half of the 20th century; today the codex is held in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France. Some Pentateuchal manuscripts discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls have been identified as bearing a \"pre-Samaritan\" text type.\nOrigin and canonical significance.\nSamaritan traditions.\nSamaritans believe that God authored their Pentateuch and gave Moses the first copy along with the two tablets containing the Ten Commandments. They believe that they preserve this divinely composed text uncorrupted to the present day. Samaritans commonly refer to their Pentateuch as (, 'Truth').\nSamaritans include only the Pentateuch in their biblical canon. They do not recognize divine authorship or inspiration in any other book in the Jewish Tanakh. A Samaritan Book of Joshua partly based upon the Tanakh's Book of Joshua exists, but Samaritans regard it as a non-canonical secular historical chronicle.\nAccording to a view based on the biblical Book of Ezra (Ezra 4:11), the Samaritans are the people of Samaria who parted ways with the people of Judah (the Judahites) in the Persian period. The Samaritans believe that it was not them, but the Jews, who separated from the authentic stream of the Israelite tradition and law, around the time of Eli, in the 11th century BCE.\nScholarly perspective.\nModern scholarship connects the formation of the Samaritan community with events which followed the Babylonian captivity. One view is that the Samaritans are the people of the Kingdom of Israel who separated from the Kingdom of Judah. Another view is that the event happened somewhere around 432 BCE, when Manasseh, the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, founded a community in Samaria, as related in the Book of Nehemiah 13:28 and \"Antiquities of the Jews\" by Josephus. Josephus, however, dates this event and the building of the temple at Shechem to the time of Alexander the Great. Others believe that the real schism between the peoples did not take place until Hasmonean times, when the Temple on Mount Gerizim was destroyed in 128 BCE by John Hyrcanus.\nThe script of the Samaritan Pentateuch, its close connections at many points with the Septuagint, and its even closer agreements with the present Masoretic Text, all suggest a date about 122 BCE. Excavation work undertaken since 1982 by Yitzhak Magen has firmly dated the temple structures on Gerizim to the middle of the 5th century BCE, built by Sanballat the Horonite, a contemporary of Ezra and Nehemiah, who lived more than 100 years before the Sanballat mentioned by Josephus.\nThe adoption of the Pentateuch as the sacred text of the Samaritans before their final schism with the Judean Jewish community provides evidence that it was already widely accepted as a canonical authority in that region.\nComparison with other versions.\nMasoretic Text.\nManuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch are written in a different script than the one used in the Masoretic Pentateuch. The Samaritan text is written with the Samaritan alphabet, derived from the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet used by the Israelite community prior to the Babylonian captivity. During the exile in Babylon, Jews adopted the Ashuri script, based on the Babylonians' Aramaic alphabet, which was developed into the modern Hebrew alphabet. Originally, all manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consisted of unvocalized text written using only the letters of the Samaritan alphabet. Beginning in the 12th century, some manuscripts show a partial vocalization resembling the Jewish Tiberian vocalization used in Masoretic manuscripts. More recently, manuscripts have been produced with full vocalization. The Samaritan Pentateuchal text is divided into 904 paragraphs. Divisions between sections of text are marked with various combinations of lines, dots or an asterisk; a dot is used to indicate the separation between words.\nThe \"London Polyglot\" lists 6,000 instances where the Samaritan Pentateuch differs from the Masoretic text. As different printed editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch are based upon different sets of manuscripts, the precise number varies significantly from one edition to another. Only a minority of such differences are significant. Most are simply spelling differences, usually concerning Hebrew letters of similar appearance; the use of more \"matres lectionis\" (symbols indicating vowels) in the Samaritan Pentateuch, compared with the Masoretic; different placement of words in a sentence; and the replacement of some verbal constructions with equivalent ones. A comparison between both versions shows a preference in the Samaritan version for the Hebrew preposition where the Masoretic text has .\nThe most notable substantial differences between both texts are those related to Mount Gerizim, the Samaritans' place of worship. The Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments includes the command that an altar be built on Mount Gerizim on which all sacrifices should be offered. The Samaritan Pentateuch contains the following paragraph, which is absent from the Jewish version:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnother important difference is in Deuteronomy 27:4. According to the Jewish text, the Israelites were told to enter the Promised Land and build an altar on Mount Ebal, while the Samaritan text says that such altar, the first built by the Israelites in the Promised Land, should be built on Mount Gerizim. A few verses afterwards, both the Jewish and the Samaritan texts contain instructions for the Israelites to perform two ceremonies upon entering the Promised Land: one of blessings, to be held on Mount Gerizim, and one of cursings, to take place on Mount Ebal. In 1946, the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, which include the oldest known versions of the Torah. In Deuteronomy 27:4\u20137, the Dead Sea scroll fragments bring \"Gerizim\" instead of \"Ebal\", indicating that the Samaritan version was likely the original reading.\nOther differences between the Samaritan and the Masoretic (Jewish) texts include:\nSeptuagint and Latin Vulgate.\nThe Samaritan Torah contains frequent agreements with the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate. The Septuagint text agrees with the Samaritan version in approximately 1,900 of the 6,000 instances in which it differs from the Masoretic text. Many of these agreements reflect inconsequential grammatical details, but some are significant. For example, Exodus 12:40 in both the Samaritan and the Septuagint reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now the sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they had dwelt in the land of Canaan and in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.\nIn the Masoretic text, the passage reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.\nPassages in the Latin Vulgate also show agreements with the Samaritan version, in contrast with the Masoretic version. For instance, in Genesis 22:2, the Samaritan Pentateuch places the binding and near-sacrifice of Isaac in the \"land of Moreh\" (Hebrew: ), while the Jewish Pentateuch has \"land of Moriah\" (Hebrew: ). The Samaritan \"Moreh\" describes the region around Shechem and modern-day Nablus, where Mount Gerizim is situated, while Jews claim the land is the same as Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. The Vulgate translates this phrase as ('in the land of vision') which implies that Jerome was familiar with the reading 'Moreh', a Hebrew word whose triliteral root suggests 'vision.'\nEvaluations of its relevance for textual criticism.\nThe earliest recorded assessments of the Samaritan Pentateuch are found in rabbinic literature and the writings of the early Christian Church Fathers of the first millennium. The Talmud records Eleazar ben Simeon, a Rabbinic Jew, condemning the Samaritan scribes: \"You have falsified your Pentateuch... and you have not profited aught by it.\"\nSome early Christian writers found the Samaritan Pentateuch useful for textual criticism. Cyril of Alexandria, Procopius of Gaza, and others spoke of certain words missing from the Hebrew Text but present in the Samaritan Pentateuch. Eusebius writes the \"Greek translation [of the Bible] also differs from the Hebrew, though not so much from the Samaritan\" and notes that the Septuagint agrees with the Samaritan Pentateuch in the number of years elapsed from Noah's Flood to Abraham. Christian interest in the Samaritan Pentateuch fell into neglect during the Middle Ages.\nThe publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 17th-century Europe reawakened interest in the text and fueled a controversy between Protestants and Roman Catholics over which Old Testament textual traditions are authoritative. Roman Catholics showed a particular interest in the study of the Samaritan Pentateuch on account of the antiquity of the text and its frequent agreements with the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate. Some Catholics including Jean Morin argue that the Samaritan Pentateuch's correspondences with the Latin Vulgate and Septuagint indicate that it represents a more authentic Hebrew text than the Masoretic. Several Protestants replied with a defense of the Masoretic text's authority and argued that the Samaritan text is a late and unreliable derivation from the Masoretic.\nThe 18th-century Protestant scholar of Hebrew Benjamin Kennicott's analysis of the Samaritan Pentateuch stands as a notable exception to the general trend of early Protestant research on the text. He questioned the underlying assumption that the Masoretic text must be more authentic simply because it has been more widely accepted as the authoritative Hebrew version of the Pentateuch:We see then that as the evidence of one text destroys the evidence of the other and as there is in fact the authority of versions to oppose to the authority of versions no certain argument or rather no argument at all can be drawn from hence to fix the corruption on either side.Kennicott also states that the reading Gerizim may actually be the original reading, since that is the mountain for proclaiming blessings, and that it is very green and rich of vegetation (as opposed to Mount Ebal, which is barren and the mountain for proclaiming curses) amongst other arguments.\nGerman scholar Wilhelm Gesenius published a study of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1815 which biblical scholars widely embraced during the next century. He argued that the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch share a common source in a family of Hebrew manuscripts which he named the \"Alexandrino-Samaritanus\". In contrast to the proto-Masoretic \"Judean\" manuscripts carefully preserved and copied in Jerusalem, he regarded the Alexandrino-Samaritanus as having been carelessly handled by scribal copyists who popularized, simplified, and expanded the text. Gesenius concluded that the Samaritan text contained only four valid variants when compared to the Masoretic text.\nIn 1915, Paul Kahle published a paper which compared passages from the Samaritan text to Pentateuchal quotations in the New Testament and pseudepigraphal texts including the Book of Jubilees, the First Book of Enoch and the Assumption of Moses. He concluded that the Samaritan Pentateuch preserves \"many genuine old readings and an ancient form of the Pentateuch.\" \nSupport for Kahle's thesis was bolstered by the discovery of biblical manuscripts among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which contain a text similar to the Samaritan Pentateuch. The Dead Sea Scroll texts have demonstrated that a Pentateuchal text type resembling the Samaritan Pentateuch goes back to the second century BCE and perhaps even earlier.\nThese discoveries have demonstrated that manuscripts bearing a \"pre-Samaritan\" text of at least some portions of the Pentateuch such as Exodus and Numbers circulated alongside other manuscripts with a \"pre-Masoretic\" text. One Dead Sea Scroll copy of the Book of Exodus, conventionally named 4QpaleoExodm, shows a particularly close relation to the Samaritan Pentateuch:The scroll shares all the major typological features with the SP, including all the major expansions of that tradition where it is extant (twelve), with the single exception of the new tenth commandment inserted in Exodus 20 from Deuteronomy 11 and 27 regarding the altar on Mount Gerizim.Frank Moore Cross has described the origin of the Samaritan Pentateuch within the context of his local texts hypothesis. He views the Samaritan Pentateuch as having emerged from a manuscript tradition local to the Land of Israel. The Hebrew texts that form the underlying basis for the Septuagint branched out from the Israelite tradition as Israelites emigrated to Egypt and took copies of the Pentateuch with them. Cross states that the Samaritan and the Septuagint share a nearer common ancestor than either does with the Masoretic, which he suggested developed from local texts used by the Babylonian Jewish community. His explanation accounts for the Samaritan and the Septuagint sharing variants not found in the Masoretic and their differences reflecting the period of their independent development as distinct local text traditions. On the basis of archaizing and pseudo-archaic forms, Cross dates the emergence of the Samaritan Pentateuch as a uniquely Samaritan textual tradition to the post-Maccabean age.\nDerivative works.\nTranslations.\nThe Samaritan Targum, composed in the Samaritan variety of Western Aramaic, is the earliest translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch. Its creation was motivated by the same need to translate the Pentateuch into the Aramaic language spoken by the community which led to the creation of Jewish Targums such as Targum Onkelos. Samaritans have traditionally ascribed the Targum to Nathanael, a Samaritan priest who died c.\u200920 BCE. The Samaritan Targum has a complex textual tradition represented by manuscripts belonging to one of three fundamental text types exhibiting substantial divergences from one another. Affinities that the oldest of these textual traditions share with the Dead Sea Scrolls and Onkelos suggest that the Targum may originate from the same school which finalized the Samaritan Pentateuch itself. Others have placed the origin of the Targum around the beginning of the third century or even later. Extant manuscripts of the Targum are \"extremely difficult to use\" on account of scribal errors caused by a faulty understanding of Hebrew on the part of the Targum's translators and a faulty understanding of Aramaic on the part of later copyists.\nScholia of Origen's Hexapla and the writings of some Church Fathers contain references to \"the Samareitikon\" (), a work that is no longer extant. Despite earlier suggestions that it was merely a series of Greek scholia translated from the Samaritan Pentateuch, scholars now concur that it was a complete Greek translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch either directly translated from it or via the Samaritan Targum. It may have been composed for the use of a Greek-speaking Samaritan community residing in Egypt.\nWith the displacement of Samaritan Aramaic by Arabic as the language of the Samaritan community in the centuries following the Muslim conquest of the Levant, they employed several Arabic translations of the Pentateuch. The oldest was an adaptation of Saadia Gaon's mid-900s \"Tafsir Rasag\" or Arabic targum of the Masoretic Text. Although the text was modified to suit the Samaritan community, it still retained many unaltered Jewish readings.\nBy the 11th or 12th century, a new Arabic translation directly based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch had appeared in Nablus. Manuscripts containing this translation are notable for their bilingual or trilingual character; the Arabic text is accompanied by the original Samaritan Hebrew in a parallel column and sometimes the Aramaic text of the Samaritan Targum in a third. Later Arabic translations also appeared; one featured a further Samaritan revision of Saadia Gaon's translation to bring it into greater conformity with the Samaritan Pentateuch and others were based upon Arabic Pentateuchal translations used by Christians.\nIn April 2013, a complete English translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch comparing it to the Masoretic version was published.\nExegetical and liturgical texts.\nSeveral biblical commentaries and other theological texts based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch have been composed by members of the Samaritan community from the fourth century CE onwards. Samaritans also employ liturgical texts containing catenae extracted from their Pentateuch.\nManuscripts and printed editions.\nAbisha Scroll.\nSamaritans attach special importance to the \"Abisha Scroll\" used in the Samaritan synagogue of Nablus. It consists of a continuous length of parchment sewn together from the skins of rams that, according to a Samaritan tradition, were ritually sacrificed. The text is written in gold letters. Rollers tipped with ornamental knobs are attached to both ends of the parchment and the whole is kept in a cylindrical silver case when not in use.\nSamaritans claim it was penned by Abishua, great-grandson of Aaron according to 1 Chronicles 6:35, thirteen years after the entry into the Canaan under the leadership of Joshua, son of Nun. Contemporary scholars describe it as a composite of several fragmentary scrolls, each penned between the 12th and 14th centuries.\nOther manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consist of vellum or cotton paper written upon with black ink. Numerous manuscripts of the text exist but none predate the Middle Ages.\nThe scroll contains a cryptogram, dubbed the \"tashqil\" by scholars, which Samaritans consider to be Abishua's ancient colophon:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the Priest, unto them be accorded the grace of YHWH and His glory\u2014I wrote this holy book at the entrance of the tabernacle on Mount Gerizim, in the year thirteen of the Israelites' possession of the Land of Canaan according to its boundaries [all] around; I praise YHWH.\nWestern scholarship.\nInterest in the Samaritan Pentateuch was awakened in 1616 when the traveler Pietro della Valle purchased a copy of the text in Damascus. This manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a Parisian library. In 1631, an edited copy of Codex B was published in Le Jay's (Paris) Polyglot by Jean Morin. It was republished in Walton's Polyglot in 1657. Subsequently, Archbishop Ussher and others procured additional copies which were brought to Europe and later, America.\nModern publications.\nUntil the latter half of the 20th century, critical editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch were largely based upon Codex B. The most notable of these is \"Der Hebr\u00e4ische Pentateuch der Samaritaner\" (\"The Hebrew Pentateuch of the Samaritans\") compiled by August von Gall and published in 1918. An extensive critical apparatus is included listing variant readings found in previously published manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch. His work is still regarded as being generally accurate despite the presence of some errors, but it neglects important manuscripts including the Abisha Scroll which had not yet been published at the time. Textual variants found in the Abisha scroll were published in 1959 by Federico P\u00e9rez Castro and between 1961 and 1965 by A. and R. Sadaqa in \"Jewish and Samaritan Versions of the Pentateuch\u00a0\u2013 With Particular Stress on the Differences Between Both Texts\". In 1976 L.F. Giron-Blanc published Codex Add. 1846, a Samaritan Pentateuch codex dating to 1100 CE in the critical edition \"Pentateuco Hebreo-Samaritano: G\u00e9nesis\" supplemented with variants found in fifteen previously unpublished manuscripts. Certain recently published critical editions of Pentateuchal books take Samaritan variants into account, including D.L. Phillips' edition of Exodus.\nThe Arabic translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch has been edited and published at the beginning of the 21st century.\nSeveral publications containing the text of the Samaritan Targum have appeared. In 1875, the German scholar Adolf Br\u00fcll published his (\"The Samaritan Targum to the Pentateuch\"). More recently a two volume set edited by Abraham Tal appeared featuring the first critical edition based upon all extant manuscripts containing the Targumic text.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the eighth-largest island in the world, and at 1 in area, it is Canada's second-largest island. It is nearly double the size of Newfoundland (), and is slightly larger than the island of Great Britain () but smaller than Honshu (). The western third of the island lies in the Inuvik Region of the Northwest Territories; the remainder is part of Nunavut's Kitikmeot Region. The population of 2,168 is divided between two settlements, the larger of which is Cambridge Bay (Nunavut) and the other Ulukhaktok (Northwest Territories).\nThe island is named after Queen Victoria, the Canadian sovereign from 1867 to 1901 (though she first became Queen in 1837). The features bearing the name \"Prince Albert\" are named after her consort, Albert.\nHistory.\nVictoria Island was inhabited by the Thule culture, with five prehistoric \"qamutiik\" (sleds) belonging to the Neoeskimo culture being found on the Wollaston Peninsula, dating to 1250\u20131573 AD. The Inuinnaqtun name for the island is \"Kitlineq\", with the local Inuit called \"Kitlinermiut\" (Copper Inuit).\nIn 1826 John Richardson was the first European to see the southwest coast and called it \"Wollaston Land\". In 1839, Peter Warren Dease and Thomas Simpson followed its southeast coast and called it \"Victoria Land\". A map published by John Barrow in 1846 shows a complete blank from these two lands north to \"Banks Land\" which is the north coast of Banks Island. In 1851 John Rae charted its entire south coast and connected the two \"lands\". In 1850 and 1851 Robert McClure circumnavigated most of Banks Island, thereby separating it from the rest of Victoria Land. His men also charted the northwest and west coasts of Victoria Island.\nOne of Roald Amundsen's men, Godfred Hansen, charted its east coast as far as Cape Nansen in 1905, and in 1916 and 1917 Storker T. Storkerson, of Vilhjalmur Stefansson's Canadian Arctic Expedition, charted its northeast coast, sighting the Storkerson Peninsula.\nIn 2008 Clark Carter and Chris Bray became the first recorded people to walk across Victoria Island. Their first attempt at the trek in 2005 failed, so they returned and completed the remaining in 2008.\nGeography.\nViscount Melville Soundmap1 lies to the north, and the M'Clintock Channelmap2 and Victoria Straitmap3 lie eastward. On the west are Amundsen Gulfmap4 and Banks Island,map5 which is separated from Victoria by a long sound called the Prince of Wales Strait.map6 To the south (from west to east) lie the Dolphin and Union Strait,map7 Austin Bay,map8 Coronation Gulfmap9 and the Dease Strait.map10\nThe southern waterways, and sometimes the Prince of Wales Strait, form part of the disputed Northwest Passage which the Government of Canada claims are Canadian Internal Waters, while other nations state they are either territorial waters or international waters.\nVictoria Island is an island of peninsulas, having a heavily indented coastline with many inlets. In the east, pointing northwards, is the Storkerson Peninsula,map11 which ends with the Goldsmith Channel,map12 the body of water separating Victoria from Stefansson Island.map13 The Storkerson Peninsula is separated from the island's north-central areas by Hadley Bay,map14 a major inlet. Another, broad peninsula is found in the north, Prince Albert Peninsula.map15 This ends at the Prince of Wales Strait. In the south, and pointing westwards, is the Wollaston Peninsula,map16 separated from the island's central areas by Prince Albert Sound.\nThe highest point of Victoria Island is in the Shaler Mountainsmap17 in the north-central region. Located in the southeast, just north of Cambridge Bay, is Tahiryuaq (formerly Ferguson Lake)map18. With an area of , it is the largest lake on the island.\nIt was said by Andrew Hund in his book, \"Antarctica and the Arctic Circle: A Geographic Encyclopedia of the Earth's Polar Regions\", that the island resembles a stylized maple leaf, the predominant symbol of Canada.\nVictoria Island contains the world's largest island within an island within an island.\nClimate.\nVictoria Island has a polar climate, with no month having an average temperature of or higher, and is listed as \"ET\" on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Summers are typically cool and rainy, with pleasant days and chilly nights. Winters are cold, dark, and long, with October being the snowiest month. Snowfall and frosts are possible all year round. Rainfall is usually limited to the summer months, when the temperature shortly rises above freezing for a few months before dipping back down for another 9 months of winter. Springs are typically sunny but still very chilly. Autumns are short and crisp, with more frequent cloud cover starting to appear during August and with September being almost constantly cloudy.\nAt Cambridge Bay, the sun is continuously below the horizon, polar night, from approximately 30 November to 11 January and above the horizon, midnight sun, 19 May to 22 July.\nBiology.\nThe Dolphin-Union caribou herd locally known as Island Caribou are a migratory population of barren-ground caribou, \"Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus\", that occupy Victoria Island in Canada's High Arctic and the nearby mainland. They are endemic to Canada. They migrate across the Dolphin and Union Strait from their summer grazing on Victoria Island to their winter grazing area on the Nunavut-NWT mainland. It is unusual for North American caribou to seasonally cross sea ice and the only other caribou to do so are the Peary caribou, which are smaller in size and population, and also occur on Victoria Island.\nBeyond caribou, Victoria Island supports a rich lichen flora that underpins tundra food webs. A 2018\u20132019 survey around Cambridge Bay and the nearby Wellington Inlier documented 237 lichen species (186 collected during the survey and 51 from earlier records), including 35 not previously reported from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Lichens, which are a major winter food for muskox and caribou, are especially common in drier habitats on rock and organic soils. Species turnover is high at local scales (only three species were found across all six surveyed areas, while about 40% occurred at a single locality) and distributions are governed mainly by water availability and bedrock chemistry: lime-rich tills around Cambridge Bay favour crustose communities, whereas the older, more acidic rocks of the Wellington Inlier support a different suite with relatively more foliose and \"Cladonia\" species. The flora shows little endemism, likely because much of the landscape has been ice-free for only about 5,000 years; with ongoing Arctic warming and \"greening\", continued monitoring is warranted to track any shifts in species and cover.\nDemographics.\nIn the 2021 Canadian census the population of the island was 2,168; 1,760 in Nunavut and 408 in the Northwest Territories. Of the two settlements on the island the larger is Cambridge Bay,map19 which lies on the south-east coast and is in Nunavut. Ulukhaktokmap20 is on the west coast and is in the Northwest Territories. Trading posts, such as Fort Collinsonmap21 on the northwest coast, have long been abandoned.\nMaps.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to Leviticus 25, Jews in the Land of Israel must take a year-long break from working the fields every seven years.\nStarting with Harvard University in 1880, many universities and other institutional employers of scientists, physicians, and academics offer the opportunity to qualify for paid sabbatical as an employee benefit, called \"sabbatical leave\". Early academic sabbatical policies were designed to aid their faculty in resting and recovering, but were also provided in order to facilitate \"advancements in knowledge in vogue elsewhere...an intellectual and practical necessity\" for both the professors and university education more broadly. Present-day academic sabbaticals typically excuse the grantee from day-to-day teaching and departmental duties, though progress on research is expected to continue or even increase while away. Academic sabbaticals come in the form of either semester-long or full-academic year terms.\nA \"sabbatical\" has also come to mean a lengthy, intentional break from a career for non-academic professionals as well. There are very few norms and expectations for non-academic, or professional, sabbaticals. They can be paid or unpaid, affiliated with one's employer or self-directed, and have a variety of durations, from several weeks to over a year.\nA 2022 study of working professionals on extended leave identified three types of sabbaticals:\nThe popularity of sabbaticals for non-academics has increased in the 21st century: 17% of companies offered some sort of sabbatical policy to their employees in 2017, according to a survey of US companies by the Society For Human Resource Management.\nSabbaticals are also becoming more common in the medical profession, and are being used in intense subfields such as emergency medicine to reduce physician burnout.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dubbed the \"Prince of Pop\", he is an influential figure in popular music. Timberlake is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of 88 million records worldwide.\nBorn and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Timberlake appeared on musical television shows as a child, competing on \"Star Search\"; in the early to mid-1990s, he was a cast member on the Disney Channel's \"\", where he performed cover songs, skits, and choreography. On the show, Timberlake met and worked with future bandmate JC Chasez, and the two later rose to prominence as the lead vocalists of the pop boy band NSYNC. The group released four commercially successful studio albums, becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time with sales of over 70 million units worldwide.\nTimberlake established himself as a solo artist with his first two albums, \"Justified\" (2002) and \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" (2006), both of which sold over 10 million copies and received triple platinum certification by the RIAA, with the latter becoming his first US \"Billboard 200\" chart number-one album. He further topped the chart on three more occasions, with \"The 20/20 Experience\", \"The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2\" (both 2013) and \"Man of the Woods\" (2018). \"The 20/20 Experience\" became the best-selling album of the year. Throughout his career, Timberlake scored numerous high-charting US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles, including \"Cry Me a River\", \"Rock Your Body\", \"SexyBack\", \"My Love\", \"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows\", \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\", \"Give It to Me\", \"4 Minutes\", \"Pusher Love Girl\", \"Suit &amp; Tie\", \"Mirrors\" and \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\", which earned him an Academy Award nomination.\nTimberlake enhanced his popularity with an acting career. He landed starring roles in the films \"The Love Guru\" (2008), \"The Social Network\" (2010), \"Bad Teacher\" (2011), \"Friends with Benefits\" (2011), \"In Time\" (2011), \"Wonder Wheel\" (2017) and \"Palmer\" (2021). He also voiced Artie in \"Shrek the Third\" (2007), Boo-Boo Bear in \"Yogi Bear\" (2010) and Branch in the \"Trolls\" franchise since 2016. \"Billboard\" named him one of the greatest pop stars of the 21st century. His awards include ten Grammy Awards, four Primetime Emmy Awards, three Brit Awards, nine \"Billboard\" Music Awards, the Contemporary Icon Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and MTV's Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. He has frequently collaborated with producers such as The Neptunes and Timbaland, who are best known for boosting Timberlake's solo career.\nEarly life.\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Janet Lynn (n\u00e9e Bomar) Harless and Charles Randall Timberlake, a Baptist church choir director. Timberlake has two half-brothers, Jonathan and Stephen, from Charles' second marriage to Lisa Perry. His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth in 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album \"NSYNC\" as \"My Angel in Heaven\".\nHis family circle includes several musicians; his grandfather introduced him to music from country music artists like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. Performing as a child, Timberlake sang country and gospel music: at the age of 11, he appeared on the television show \"Star Search\", performing country songs as \"Justin Randall\". By that time, he began listening to rhythm and blues musicians from the 1960s and 70s, such as Al Green, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and he had listening sessions with his father of studio albums by the Eagles and Bob Seger.\nFrom 1993 to 1995, he was a Mouseketeer on \"The All New Mickey Mouse Club\", where his castmates included future girlfriend and singer Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, future bandmate JC Chasez, and future actors Ryan Gosling and Keri Russell. In 1995 Timberlake recruited Chasez to be in an all-male singing group, put together by Chris Kirkpatrick and financed by boy band manager Lou Pearlman, that eventually became NSYNC.\nCareer.\n1995\u20132002: NSYNC.\nThe boy band NSYNC formed in 1995, and they began recording and performing in 1996 in Europe; Timberlake and Chasez served as its two lead singers. In 1998, the group rose to prominence in the United States with the release of their self-titled debut studio album, which sold 11 million copies and includes the single \"Tearin' Up My Heart\". The group had a series of legal battles with former manager Lou Pearlman, and they subsequently signed with Jive Records. They released their third studio album \"No Strings Attached\" (2000) which sold 2.4 million copies in the first week, becoming the fastest-selling album of all time. They held this record until 2015 when Adele surpassed the record with her third album \"25\". No Strings Attached also includes the number one single \"It's Gonna Be Me\", \"Bye Bye Bye\", and \"This I Promise You\". NSYNC's fourth studio album \"Celebrity\" (2001) was also financially successful, selling 1.8 million copies in the first week and spawning top-five singles such as \"Girlfriend\". Upon the completion of the Celebrity Tour, the group went on an indefinite hiatus in 2002. NSYNC performed at the Academy Awards in 2000, the 2002 Winter Olympics, and the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show. The band sold more than 70 million records worldwide, becoming the fifth-best selling boy band in history.\nIn 2000, Timberlake appeared in The Wonderful World of Disney movie \"Model Behavior\". He played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model.\nThe rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of NSYNC. Band member Lance Bass was openly critical of Timberlake's actions in his memoir \"Out of Sync\". By 2002, when the group went on an indefinite hiatus and members were doing individual projects, he partnered with Pharrell Williams of the producing team The Neptunes\u2013and Timbaland to start working on new music. The idea of going solo was strengthened a year earlier. Timberlake originally wrote the single \"Gone\" around 2001 for Michael Jackson, but he turned the song down, and it was instead recorded by NSYNC. Before its release, however, Jackson contacted him. Timberlake declared in a later interview that the first time he felt confident to go solo happened after that conversation. In a retrospective article in 2020, \"Billboard\" considered \"Celebrity\" \"the group's swan song, setting the stage for Timberlake's equally massive solo career\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[Michael] called me on the phone and said that he wanted to cut the record (\"Gone\"), but he wanted it to be a duet between himself and I. And I said, 'Well ... we've already cut the song as an 'N Sync record. Could we do, like, 'N Sync featuring Michael Jackson', or 'Michael Jackson featuring 'N Sync'? And he was very absolute about the fact that he wanted it to be a duet between himself and I.. [That was] the first time I ever really felt the confidence to do it\n \u2013 Timberlake on \"Master Class\", 2014\n2002\u20132004: \"Justified\" and Super Bowl XXXVIII controversy.\nIn August 2002, Timberlake performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he premiered his debut solo single \"Like I Love You\"; it peaked at number 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart. His debut solo studio album \"Justified\" was released in November and debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 439,000 copies, fewer than previous 'N Sync releases. It sold over three million copies in the U.S. and more than ten million copies worldwide. Its R&amp;B influence, provided by hip-hop producers The Neptunes and Timbaland, was complimented by music critics. About the musical direction of the record, he commented, \"I just want to do R&amp;B. It's what I grew up listening to\". The album spawned the top-five singles \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\".\nIn summer 2003, Timberlake and Christina Aguilera co-headlined The Justified &amp; Stripped Tour. Later that year he recorded a song \"I'm Lovin' It\", used by McDonald's as the theme to its \"I'm Lovin' It\" campaign. The deal with McDonald's earned Timberlake an estimated $6\u00a0million. A tour titled Justified and Lovin' It Live was included with the deal, following his initial Justified World Tour. Timberlake was featured on Nelly's song, \"Work It\", which was remixed and included on Nelly's 2003 remix album.\nNear the end of 2002, Timberlake was the first celebrity to appear on \"Punk'd\", a \"candid camera\" type show created by Ashton Kutcher to trick celebrities. Timberlake, who cried during the episode, later admitted to being under the influence of cannabis when he was pranked. Three episodes later, he set up Kelly Osbourne to be \"punk'd\", thus making him the first celebrity to appear on the show more than once. Timberlake later spoofed Ashton Kutcher and \"Punk'd\" in a 2003 episode of NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\". Timberlake co-starred in a skit titled \"The Barry Gibb Talk Show\" alongside comedian Jimmy Fallon, where the duo portrayed Bee Gees brothers Barry and Robin Gibb. It marked the beginning of a long-running friendship and collaboration with Fallon.\nIn February 2004, during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, broadcast on the CBS television network from Houston, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson before a television audience of more than 140 million viewers. At the end of the performance, as the song drew to a close, Timberlake tore off a part of Jackson's black leather costume in a \"costume reveal\" meant to accompany a portion of the song lyrics. Jackson's representative explained Timberlake intended \"to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. Part of the costume detached, and Jackson's breast was briefly exposed. Timberlake apologized for the incident, stating he was \"sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl...\" The phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\" has since been used by the media to refer to the incident and has entered pop culture. Timberlake and Jackson were threatened with exclusion from the 2004 Grammy Awards unless they agreed to apologize on screen at the event. Timberlake attended and issued a scripted apology when accepting the first of two Grammy Awards he received that night (Best Pop Vocal Album for \"Justified\" and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Cry Me a River\"). He had also been nominated for Album of the Year for \"Justified\", and Record of the Year along with Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Where Is the Love?\" with The Black Eyed Peas.\n2004\u20132007: Films and \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\".\nAfter the Super Bowl incident, Timberlake put his recording career on hold to act in several films, having starred in a few feature films earlier in his career. The first role he took during this time was as a journalist in \"Edison Force\", filmed in 2004 and received a direct-to-video release on July 18, 2006. He also appeared in the films \"Alpha Dog\", \"Black Snake Moan\", Richard Kelly's \"Southland Tales\", and voiced Prince Artie Pendragon in the animated film \"Shrek the Third\", released on May 18, 2007. He also appeared as a young Elton John, in the video for John's song \"This Train Don't Stop There Anymore\". Timberlake was considered to play the role of Roger Davis in the film version of the rock musical \"Rent\", but director Chris Columbus had insisted that only the original Broadway members could convey the true meaning of \"Rent\", so the role was reprised by Adam Pascal.\nHe continued to record with other artists. After \"Where Is the Love?\", he again collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas on the 2005 track \"My Style\" from their album \"Monkey Business\". When recording the 2005 single \"Signs\" with Snoop Dogg, Timberlake discovered a throat condition. Nodules were subsequently removed from his throat in an operation that took place on May 5, 2005. He was advised not to sing or speak loudly for at least a few months. In 2005, he began his own record company, JayTee records.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\", a full-length LP of coherence and uniform song-to-song quality virtually unheard of in pop music since the '80s golden age of Michael, Madonna, Janet and Prince... Like one of his suit-and-vest combos, Timberlake himself continued to wear pop stardom exceptionally well. He glided through his music videos and live performances with the confidence of a man who'd already spent a large percentage of his life in the spotlight, and who never doubted he'd be able to return to music on top.\n\u2014\"Billboard\"'s \"The Greatest Pop Star By Year (1981\u20132019)\"\nTimberlake released his second studio album, \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\", on September 12, 2006. The album, which Timberlake created from 2005 to 2006, debuted at number-one on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, selling 684,000 copies its first week. It became the biggest album for pre-orders on iTunes, and beat Coldplay's record for the biggest one-week sales of a digital album. The album was produced by Timbaland and Danja (who produced a bulk of the album), will.i.am, Rick Rubin and Timberlake himself, and features guest vocals by Snoop Dogg, Three 6 Mafia, T.I. and will.i.am. A studio representative described it as being \"all about sexiness\" and aiming for \"an adult feel\".\nThe album's lead single, \"SexyBack\", was performed by Timberlake at the opening of the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards and reached number-one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, where it remained for seven consecutive weeks. \"My Love\", the album's second single, also produced by Timbaland and featuring rapper T.I., reached number-one on the Hot 100, as did third single \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\". The song is reported to have been inspired by the break-up of his childhood friend and business partner, Trace Ayala, with actress Elisha Cuthbert. In October 2006, Timberlake said that he would focus on his music career rather than his film roles, specifying that leaving the music industry would be a \"dumb thing to do at this point\". He was the special guest performer at the 2006 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show where he sang \"SexyBack\", \"My Love\" and \"LoveStoned\".\nTimberlake hosted many music events, including the European MTV Music Awards in 2006. On December 16, 2006, Timberlake hosted \"Saturday Night Live\", doing double duty as both host and musical guest for the second time. During this appearance, he and Andy Samberg performed an R&amp;B song for a skit titled \"Dick in a Box\", which some radio stations aired as an unofficial single from Timberlake. Called \"one of the most iconic musical moments in the show's history\" by \"Billboard\", it became a viral hit and one of the most viewed videos on YouTube at the time. \"Rolling Stone\" listed the skit at number three on their \"50 Greatest 'Saturday Night Live' Sketches of All Time\". The song earned him an Emmy Award and was later featured on The Lonely Island's debut album \"Incredibad\".\nIn January 2007, Timberlake embarked on the FutureSex/LoveShow tour. Following singles off the album, \"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows (Interlude)\" and \"Until the End of Time\", peaked within the top 20 on the Hot 100, while the fourth single \"Summer Love\" reached the top 10. The song \"Give It to Me\", a Timbaland single on which Timberlake guests with Nelly Furtado, reached the Hot 100 number-one spot. Eventually, \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" was added to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's musical library and archive.\n2008\u20132012: Musical hiatus and focus on acting.\nThe song \"4 Minutes\" was first played by Timbaland at Philadelphia's Jingle Ball on December 17, 2007. When released on March 17, 2008, \"4 Minutes\" was revealed to be a duet between Timberlake and Madonna, with backing vocals by Timbaland. It was the lead single from Madonna's eleventh studio album \"Hard Candy\", which featured four other song-writing collaborations with Timberlake, being also one of the executive producers. The single was an international hit, topping the charts in over 21 countries worldwide. Timberlake also appears in the music video, which was directed by Jonas &amp; Fran\u00e7ois. On March 30, 2008, Timberlake performed the song at Madonna's Hard Candy Promo Show at Roseland Ballroom in New York City. On November 6, 2008, Timberlake performed the song with Madonna on the Los Angeles stop of her Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour.\nIn June 2007, Timberlake co-wrote, produced and provided vocals for the songs \"Nite Runner\" and \"Falling Down\" for Duran Duran's album \"Red Carpet Massacre\", released on November 13, 2007. \"Falling Down\" was released as a single in the UK on the previous day. Also in 2007, Timberlake made an appearance on 50 Cent's third album \"Curtis\". Timberlake, along with Timbaland, is featured on a track called \"Ayo Technology\", which was the album's fourth single.

Because there's a formulaic sort of vulnerability... But if you're able to really screenshot your own vulnerability, frame it properly, and color-correct it, then it becomes something that every human can relate to. And I think Justin is in the place where he's mastering that right now.\n \u2013 Pharrell Williams on the recording sessions for \"Man of the Woods\", Timberlake's fifth studio album\nSpeaking of his fifth studio album in 2016, Timberlake stated, \"I think where I grew up in America has a lot of influence. Growing up in Tennessee\u2014very central of the country\u2014Memphis is known as the birthplace of rock &amp; roll, but also the home of the blues, but Nashville's right down the street so there's a lot of country music.\" In following interviews, Timberlake confirmed working with producers Timbaland and Pharrell Williams, while stating, \"It sounds more like where I've come from than any other music I've ever made... It's Southern American music. But I want to make it sound modern \u2013 at least that's the idea right now.\"\nHis fifth studio album \"Man of the Woods\" was released on February 2, 2018, two days before he headlined the Super Bowl LII halftime show in Minneapolis, Minnesota on February 4, where Timberlake performed a medley of his songs featuring both the Tennessee Kids and the Minnesota Marching Band alongside him, as well as a duet of \"I Would Die 4 U\" with a video projection of late singer Prince on screen.

Their relationship ended abruptly in March 2002. Spears wrote in her 2023 memoir \"The Woman in Me\" that she became pregnant during their relationship and had an abortion in late 2000 after Timberlake said they were not prepared for parenthood and he did not want to be a father. In 2003, he briefly dated British singer Emma Bunton. In April 2003, he began a relationship with actress Cameron Diaz soon after they met at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. After much speculation of breakups throughout their relationship, the couple split in December 2006 shortly after she introduced him as a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\".\nIn January 2007, Timberlake began dating actress Jessica Biel. They became engaged in December 2011 and married on October 19, 2012, at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy. Their first child, a son, was born in April 2015. In July 2020, they had a second son.\nLegal issues.\nShortly after midnight on June 18, 2024, Timberlake was arrested in Sag Harbor, New York for driving while intoxicated (DWI). In addition to being charged with one count of DWI, Timberlake was issued two citations, one for running a stop sign and one for failure to keep in lane. He was released nine hours later following his first arraignment at Sag Harbor Village Justice Court. The Sag Harbor Police Department would later release his mugshot. Timberlake was scheduled to return to court on July 26, 2024. According to his arrest report, Timberlake alleged to authorities that he only had one martini shortly before he was pulled over. Despite making this claim, Timberlake refused a breathalyzer.\nOn June 22, 2024, bartender employees at the hotel where Timberlake was staying before his DWI arrest confirmed to \"People\" that he only had one martini while at the hotel bar. One employee stating that \u201cIf he was drinking more, it wasn't here.\" However, according to the arrest report, the officer who pulled Timberlake over after he drove through a stop sign and failed to keep on the right side of the road stated that his \"eyes were bloodshot and glassy\" at the time, and that \"A strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot, and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests.\" During the stop, Timberlake reportedly said, \"this is going to ruin the tour.\" The officer, who did not know who Timberlake was, asked \"what tour?\", to which he replied with \"the world tour.\" That exchange went viral, spawning several memes. Despite the arrest, Timberlake still continued to perform concerts, including a concert in Chicago on June 21, 2024, where he appeared to address the arrest, saying \"We've been through ups and downs and lefts and rights... It's been a tough week - but you're here, and I'm here...I know sometimes I'm hard to love, but you keep on loving me and I love you right back.\"\nTimberlake, who was performing overseas in Poland, would not attend his July 26, 2024, court arraignment, with his lawyer Edward Burke attending instead. Despite Burke's arguments that Timberlake was not intoxicated at the time of his arrest, Sag Harbor Village Justice Carl Irace ordered for Timberlake to be re-arraigned on August 2. For the August 2 arraignment, Timberlake, who was still on tour, appeared virtually from Antwerp, Belgium. During this arraignment, Timberlake pled not guilty to a revised misdemeanor charge of driving drunk. Irace also agreed to review Burke's motion to dismiss the DWI charge. However, Timberlake's New York license was suspended by the judge for an indeterminate amount of time.\nTimberlake was scheduled to have another hearing on August 9, 2024. In contrast to the August 2 hearing, Timberlake was not required to attend this court hearing. On September 11, 2024, it was revealed that Timberlake would plead guilty to a less serious traffic offense during his September 13 court appearance, with the DWI charge being dropped. Under his plea deal, Timberlake agreed to plead guilty to driving while impaired, a lesser offense which carries a penalty of a $300 to $500 fine and a 90-day driver license suspension.\nOn September 13, 2024, during an in-person appearance at the Sag Harbor Village Justice Courthouse, Timberlake pled guilty to a noncriminal driving while impaired traffic violation. Irace then sentenced Timberlake to a $500 fine with a $260 surcharge, 25 hours of community service at the nonprofit of his choosing and required him to make a public safety announcement. It also revealed that Timberlake's refusal to take a breathlyzer automatically triggered a suspension of his driver's license under New York state law.\nResidences.\nIn July 2002, Timberlake purchased a mansion in Hollywood Hills for $8.3 million from Helen Hunt. In 2010, Timberlake purchased a unit at 311 West Broadway in SoHo, formerly owned by Oscar de la Renta, for $6.56 million. He sold the unit in 2018 for $6.35 million, incurring a loss.\nIn 2015, Timberlake bought a house in the Yellowstone Club near Big Sky, Montana. In May 2017, Timberlake and his wife, Jessica Biel, paid $20.2 million for a penthouse unit at 443 Greenwich Street in Tribeca, Manhattan.\nEarnings.\n\"Forbes\" began reporting on Timberlake's earnings in 2008, calculating that he earned $44\u00a0million between June 2007 and June 2008 for his music, tour, commercials, and hospitality, making him the world's 4th best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion. That year, he was ranked twelfth on the \"Forbes\" Celebrity 100 list and second on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list.\nAccording to \"Billboard\", Timberlake was the third highest-paid musician of 2013, with earnings of $31\u00a0million. He was ranked 26th with earnings of $57\u00a0million on the Celebrity 100 list for 2014, and 19th on the 2015 list with $63\u00a0million. Timberlake was listed at number three on the \"Billboard\" Money-Makers List of 2014.\nHe was ranked 41st on the 2019 Celebrity 100 list by \"Forbes\", with earnings of $57.5 million in 2019.\nHealth.\nAt the end of his Forget Tomorrow World Tour in July 2025, Timberlake stated he had been diagnosed with Lyme disease. He shared, in an Instagram post, \"When I first got the diagnosis I was shocked for sure. But, at least I could understand why I would be onstage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness. I was faced with a personal decision. Stop touring? Or, keep going and figure it out. I decided the joy that performing brings me far outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling. I'm so glad I kept going\".\nArtistry.\nTimberlake possesses a lyric tenor vocal range. He began including beatboxing in his records near the end of his boyband era and into his emergence as a solo act with \"Justified\" and \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\". Many of his songs draw from his personal life and relationships, such as \"Cry Me a River\" (about his breakup with Britney Spears). Described by critics as a \"consummate showman\", Timberlake usually plays guitar, piano and keyboard in his shows. \"The New York Times\"' editor Katie Rogers highlighted Timberlake's crossover appeal after his performance with Chris Stapleton at the 2015 Country Music Association Awards.\nPrimarily an R&amp;B album, his 2002 debut \"Justified\" also includes influence from dance-pop, funk and soul music. Timberlake has described it as influenced by Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. For the album's supporting tour Justified and Stripped Tour, he co-headlined with Christina Aguilera, drawing praise from Robert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" for his comfort in performing as part of a package.\nHis 2006 followup album \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" departed from his earlier work to explore a broader sound, with elements of rap, rock, funk, soul, gospel, new wave, opera, and world music. During production, Timberlake was interested in musical techniques associated with rock music, which inspired his approach to recording. He described the album as drawing from David Bowie and Prince. Other influences include late INXS-frontman Michael Hutchence, Arcade Fire, David Byrne, The Killers, The Strokes, and Radiohead.\nTimberlake's next album, \"The 20/20 Experience\" (2013) is a neo soul album partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. Mikael Wood of the \"Los Angeles Times\" found its elaborate structures ambitious in the vein of Stevie Wonder, Prince, and Michael Jackson. He supported the album with a pair of tours: Legends of the Summer, which he co-headlined with Jay-Z, and The 20/20 Experience World Tour. These tours introduced his backing ensemble, the Tennessee Kids, a 15-piece multi-instrumentalist throwback to big band music.\nPublic image.\nTimberlake's fashion and style evolution, from \"boy-band synchronized wardrobe days\" to \"a notable source of fashion inspiration to men all over\", has been noticed by the media. As noted by a \"Billboard\" editor, \"Since his solo career began with the 2002 release of debut album \"Justified\", Timberlake has honed his unique sense of style\", while citing Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Frank Sinatra as style influences: \"guys who were just really never trying to be that [stylish], they just were that\". According to American fashion designer Tom Ford, who has dressed Timberlake since 2011 and created more than 600 exclusive pieces for The 20/20 Experience World Tour, Timberlake \"has a kind of effortless cool that makes classic menswear tailoring modern\".\n\"The New York Times\"' editor Sia Michel wrote in 2007, \"Since his last tour, for 2002's multiplatinum \"Justified\", he has learned how to project sex-symbol edge\" adding \"he's a rock star who can commit.\" Napster's founder Sean Parker, portrayed by Timberlake in \"The Social Network\", stated \"I don't think I look anything like Timberlake, but it's not so bad being played by a sex symbol.\" In Nielsen Music's U.S. report for 2015, Timberlake led the \"Top 10 Musicians Among Millennials\" list. His high-profile relationships earned him the nickname \"Trousersnake\", a reference to his allegedly big penis. Wax statues of Timberlake are on display at the Madame Tussauds wax museums in New York, Las Vegas, Hollywood, Nashville, Berlin, Amsterdam, and London. His costume used in the \"Saturday Night Live\" skit \"Dick in a Box\" is displayed at \"Saturday Night Live: The Exhibition\" in New York.\nAfter New York legalized same-sex marriage in 2011, he voiced his support for LGBT equality in the U.S., stating, \"We're people and we're different, all of us. And we should be using our differences to bring ourselves closer together.\" Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel received the Inspiration Award at the GLSEN Respect Awards in 2015, with the executive director saying, \"They are two vocal and committed allies to the LGBT community who are also devoted to charitable works that improve the lives of youth.\"\nTimberlake's pronunciation of the word \"me\" on \"It's Gonna Be Me\" was popularized as an internet meme titled \"It's Gonna Be May\", after a Tumblr image of Timberlake was posted in 2012 with the respective caption. The meme eventually became an annually recurring joke throughout the month of April, which gained the attention of Barack Obama and Timberlake himself. Influenced by the national attention received by Timberlake's selfie inside a voting booth shared on Instagram during the 2016 presidential election, which was at the moment an illegal act, Senator Brian Kelsey of Germantown, Tennessee brought up a bill that would allow taking photos in voting poll stations, with some exceptions against bad procedures. It was later approved by the Tennessee Senate.\nIn June 2021, Timberlake spoke out in support of Britney Spears during her court battle over her conservatorship. Timberlake wrote on his Twitter that \"No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body [...] [Jessica Biel] and I send our love, and our absolute support to Britney during this time. We hope the courts, and her family make this right and let her live however she wants to live\".\nControversies.\nFollowing the release of \"Framing Britney Spears\", public attention was brought to old comments Timberlake made in 2002 to describe his relationship with Britney Spears following their breakup, with some considering them to contain misogynistic rhetoric. It also led to renewed interest in his participation in the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, where he exposed Janet Jackson's breast on live television. Following much public pressure, Timberlake issued a public apology on his Instagram page, writing he \"benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism\" and \"I do not want to ever benefit from others being pulled down again.\" He finished by saying \"I care deeply about the wellbeing of the people I love and have loved. I can do better and I will do better\".\nPublic scrutiny surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII incident was raised when a stylist alleged that the plan was originally for Timberlake to step on the back of Jackson's dress \"to reveal her butt in this pearl g-string\" but that he changed the plan to exposing her breast because he wanted a \"reveal\" to \"one-up\" Britney Spears' and Madonna's kiss at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. The claim that Timberlake wanted the breast reveal, however, is contradictory to a statement from Salli Frattini, the producer of the Halftime show, who stated in 2018 that the production team experimented with removing elements of clothing in rehearsal to reveal Jackson's skirt without nudity but that the idea was ultimately nixed. According to Frattini, it was Jackson's team who pitched the idea to Timberlake prior to the show that led to Jackson's breast being exposed.\nLegacy.\nTimberlake has been referred to as the \"President of Pop\" and \"Prince of Pop\" by contemporary journalists. In a 2016 article of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", editor Scott Feinberg stated Timberlake is \"widely regarded as one of the greatest all-around entertainers in the history of show business\".\nIn 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" named him the biggest pop star of the year and featured him on the magazine's cover, declaring he was \"The New King of Pop\". For \"Entertainment Weekly\" his second studio album, \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\", \"redefined pop's cutting edge\"; for \"Vibe\" it \"pushed boundaries more forcefully\" than works by his male contemporaries. Fuse TV's editor Jason Lipshutz stated it \"changed the game. [The album] was steely and sweaty, a universal dance opus that made room for intimacy. It had the best first half of any pop album in 25 years. You have to go back to 1979 for \"Off the Wall\", to find a pop album with a first half that matches up.\" He was ranked 66th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time. Timberlake appeared for the first time on the Time 100 list of most influential people by \"Time\" in 2007. In 2013, he made his second appearance on the 100 list, with Stevie Wonder writing \"Justin has accomplished a lot at a young age, taking advantage of all the possibilities, and yet he's found time to give of himself too\u2014he gets and gives back. He has a spirit. He does God's work through using the most of his talent.\"\n\"Justified\"'s single \"Cry Me a River\" was ranked at number 20 on \"Rolling Stone's\" 100 Best Songs of the 2000s, and one of their 500 greatest songs of all time. \"Billboard\" editor Jason Lipshutz named the song's music video \"one of the more brilliant musical moments in pop music since the dawn of the century\". His second album \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" was placed at 46 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s 100 Best Albums of the 2000s, the ninth best album of the decade for \"Entertainment Weekly\", and the greatest of the decade for \"Vibe\". The lead single, \"SexyBack\", helped introduce EDM sounds to top 40 radio, as it brought together variations of electronic dance music with Timberlake's R&amp;B tone. Aside from earning critical acclaim for its parent album, Sia Michel of \"The New York Times\" noted that he was responsible for popularizing in 2006 the catchphrase \"I'm bringing sexy back\".\nConsidered a pop icon by media outlets, his work has influenced numerous artists, including Justin Bieber, Shawn Mendes, Olly Murs, Maroon 5, Britney Spears, Lorde, Marilyn Manson, Joe Jonas, Thomas Rhett, Ed Sheeran, Jason Derulo, Tori Kelly, Liam Payne, Bridgit Mendler, Hunter Hayes, BoA, Seungri, Taeyang, Rain, Lloyd Banks, Maluma, Rosal\u00eda, and Jungkook. Bieber and Nick Jonas have cited him as one of their role models, with the latter stating is for \"not only transitioning from where he started, but also balancing acting and singing\". Christian hip hop artist tobyMac has stated Timberlake's work inspires him, commenting \"he's setting himself up to be a classic, making decisions and moving on them. That's a great place to be.\" In the context of male artists that achieved commercial success after leaving their boy bands, Brittany Spanos from \"Rolling Stone\" wrote \"Timberlake and Michael Jackson set a high bar for what could be attained by solo success in that they not only scored numerous number-one hits but they also crafted the mold for what it meant to be a male pop star\", while for \"Variety\"'s Jeremy Blacklow the singer is \"the modern case study\". Multiple music publications have deemed \"Justified\" as the standard for post boy-band solo albums and teen pop stars seeking credibility. \"Billboard\" critics discussed in 2018 whether Timberlake is \"the Best Male Pop Star of the 21st century;\" those in favor named his crossover appeal, career longevity, showmanship and credibility within the industry among the reasons.\nAchievements.\nThroughout his solo career, Timberlake has sold over 32 million albums and 56 million singles globally, and a further 70 million records with NSYNC, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. Timberlake has won ten Grammy Awards, four Emmy Awards, seven American Music Awards, three Brit Awards, nine \"Billboard\" Music Awards, and eleven MTV Video Music Awards. His Grammy wins include categories on the pop, dance and R&amp;B genres; while his Emmy wins consist of two Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics and two Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. Timberlake received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and the Innovator Award at the 2015 iHeartRadio Music Awards. Among other awards, he won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year for \"Mirrors\" in 2013 and the \"Billboard\" Music Awards for Top Artist with the Top Billboard 200 Album for \"The 20/20 Experience\" in 2014. Timberlake received the inaugural Decade Award at the 2016 Teen Choice Awards for his continuous achievements since the release of \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" (2006).\nIn October 2015, he was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, becoming its youngest member. On April 30, 2018, Timberlake reunited with his NSYNC bandmates to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2019, Timberlake received a Contemporary Icon Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and an honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music.\nAll five of Timberlake's studio albums have been certified platinum or better by the RIAA and have received numerous awards. Worldwide sales figures for \"Justified\" stand at 10 million copies, \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" at 10 million, and joint sales of \"The 20/20 Experience\" and \"2 of 2\" at 6 million copies. As of 2014[ [update]], Timberlake has had seven songs exceed 3 million digital downloads in the United States, with \"SexyBack\" (4.5), \"4 Minutes\", \"Dead and Gone\", \"Suit &amp; Tie\", \"Mirrors\", \"Holy Grail\", and \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\".\nAccording to \"Billboard\", FutureSex/LoveShow was the third highest-grossing concert tour of 2007 and highest solo. The 20/20 Experience World Tour was an international success and became Timberlake's most successful tour to date. The tour was the highest-grossing led by a solo artist in 2014, and one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade. For its associated album, \"The 20/20 Experience\", Timberlake was named 2013 Artist of the Year with the top-selling album by iTunes' annual list of best-sellers.\nIn the United States, five of Timberlake's singles have topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100: \"SexyBack\", \"My Love\" and \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\", \"Give It to Me\" and \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\". The latter became the 41st Hot 100 number one song to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. He topped nine \"Billboard\" Year-End charts for 2013, including \"Billboard\" 200 Artists and \"Billboard\" 200 Albums. For 2014, Timberlake was named \"Billboard\" Top Male Artist. \"Billboard\" published a list of \"Greatest of All Time Pop Songs Artists\" in 2017, where Timberlake ranked at number 5, being the top male soloist. The magazine also ranked him 25 on their \"The Top 60 Male Artists of All-Time\" list in 2018, and 64th on \"The Hot 100's Top Artists of All Time\". In 2019, \"Billboard\" ranked him 20th on their decade-end chart for \"Top Artists\" of the 2010s, and 74th on \"Top 125 Greatest of All Time Artists Chart\".\nOther ventures.\nBusiness ventures.\nTimberlake has co-owned or provided celebrity endorsement for three restaurants in the United States: \"Chi\" opened in West Hollywood, California in 2003, and \"Destino\" and \"Southern Hospitality\" in New York opened in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2005, Timberlake launched the William Rast clothing line with childhood friend Juan (\"Trace\") Ayala. The 2007 line contained cord jackets, cashmere sweaters, jeans, and polo shirts. The pair reports inspiration from fellow Memphis resident Elvis Presley: \"Elvis is the perfect mixture of Justin and I\", Ayala says. \"You can go back and see pictures of him in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and a nice button-down shirt, but then again you can see him in a tux and a collared shirt with rhinestones on it and slacks. We like to think 'If he was alive today, what would he be wearing?'\" Target has announced that a William Rast collection, including denim, outerwear and sportswear for men and women, would launch in December and be available for a month. In 2015, the clothing line earned him a Lord &amp; Taylor's Fashion Oracle Award at the Fashion Group International's \"Night of The Stars Gala\". An avid amateur golfer, in 2007 Timberlake purchased the run-down Big Creek Golf Course in his hometown of Millington, Tennessee, which he redeveloped as the eco-friendly Mirimichi Golf Course at the cost of around $US16\u00a0million. It was reopened on July 25, 2009, but closed again on January 15, 2010, for further improvements expected to take six months. In October 2011, Timberlake received the Futures Award at the Environmental Media Awards for his green-conscious golf course. It was reported on November 7, 2014, that Timberlake had sold Mirimichi to Three Star Leasing LLC for $500,000. In October 2018, Timberlake and Levi's debuted their collaborative clothing line collection \"Fresh Leaves\". In 2022, Justin Timberlake invested in Greenville, South Carolina par-3 golf course Greenville 3's.\nTimberlake provides celebrity endorsement for many commercial products, this aspect of his business being managed by IMG since April 2008. Major endorsements in 2009 included Sony electronic products, Givenchy's men's fragrance \"Play\", the Audi A1, Callaway Golf Company products, and in 2011, Myspace. In 2011, he teamed up with Capital One to announce the winners of the inaugural Capital One Cup, in a six-minute advert, where he is repeatedly getting hit in the groin. In 2012, he hosted Walmart's annual shareholders meeting, saying, \"I buy a lot at Walmart.\"\nIn 2014, Timberlake partnered with Sauza Tequila to re-launch his own version of the beverage as part of the Sauza franchise: Sauza 901. In 2016, he became an investor in the beverage company Bai Brands. In 2017, Tiger Woods and Timberlake acquired an ownership stake in the Hurricane Junior Golf Tour.\nTimberlake and his wife Jessica Biel are minority owners of the Memphis Grizzlies.\nTimberlake is an Air Jordan brand ambassador. His first collection with the brand, the Legend of the Summer collection, debuted on the co-headlining tour of the same name with Jay-Z. These sneakers have gone on to resell for upwards of $10,000. In the lead up to his 2018 Super Bowl Halftime Show, Timberlake worked with famed Nike, Inc. designer Tinker Hatfield to design his own version of the Air Jordan 3.\u00a0Timberlake debuted the shoe at the halftime show. Timberlake's performance was estimated to be worth $2.86 million in marketing for Nike, and is credited for reigniting interested in the Nike and Air Jordan brand. Nike went on to release several colorways as part of the collaboration with Timberlake.\nIn May 2022, Timberlake sold the rights to his entire musical catalog, around 200 songs he wrote or co-wrote, to Hipgnosis Song Management for $100 million. The deal covers only pre-existing work, and not work he produces after the deal.\nTimberlake had an estimated net-worth of $250 million prior to the Hipgnosis deal, and is now estimated to be worth in excess of $350 million \u2013 making him one of the music industry's wealthiest solo performers.\nPhilanthropy.\nTimberlake has been active in several charitable pursuits, initially through NSYNC's \"Challenge for the Children\" aimed at a range of charities, and since 2001 through his \"Justin Timberlake Foundation\", which initially funded music education programs in schools, but now has a much broader agenda. In October 2005, the Grammy Association presented Timberlake with an award for his humanitarian efforts in Tennessee, alongside writer/director Craig Brewer, also a Memphis native.\nIn November 2007, he donated $100,000 from takings from his Australian tour to Wildlife Warriors founded by Steve Irwin. On March 23, 2008, he donated $100,000 to the Memphis Rock N' Soul Museum and another $100,000 to the Memphis Music Foundation.\nOn November 12, 2007, the PGA Tour announced that Timberlake, an avid golfer who plays to a six handicap, would become the host of the tour's Las Vegas tournament starting in 2008. With Timberlake's agreement to host the tournament, its name was changed to the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. He played in the celebrity pro-am on the day before the competitive tournament and hosted a charity concert during the week of the tournament. The activity was a success and was repeated in 2009. A review of the value of celebrities to fundraising concluded that Timberlake's contribution to Shriners Hospitals for Children was the single most valuable celebrity endorsement in the U.S. during 2009, and worth over $US9\u00a0million. However, in 2012, the event's chair Raoul Frevel told reporters Timberlake would no longer be involved in the event: \"We tried everything we could to get him more involved with our kids and the hospitals. But it seemed that when the TV cameras weren't on, he disappeared.\"\nTimberlake often participates in the American Century Championship and the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Both annual tournaments raise money for a range of national and local non-profits.\nIn late 2012, Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel volunteered in Far Rockaway, Queens over the weekend after Hurricane Sandy. Joined by their friend Timbaland, the couple helped distribute backpacks of supplies to members of the community who were still struggling after the hurricane.\nTimberlake has donated items for auction for several charities, including by Ten O'Clock Classics and MusiCares. In 2010, Timberlake participated in the Hope for Haiti Now telethon performing \"Hallelujah\". The cover was made available for digital download with all proceeds donated to organizations doing relief work in Haiti. In 2016, Timberlake was featured in a new version of \"Where Is the Love?\". The proceeds of the charity single will go to educational programs. In 2017, Timberlake and Eminem helped raise over $2\u00a0million for Manchester Arena bombing victims.\nBook.\nTimberlake's autobiography, \"Hindsight &amp; All the Things I Can't See In Front of Me\", was released on October 30, 2018. The book covers some on and off camera candid images, the singer's early life and inspiration for songs. According to publisher HarperCollins, \"Hindsight\" includes a \"collection of anecdotes, reflections, and observations on his life and work\".\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nFilmography.\nFilms starred\nTours.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "69328", "revid": "50433586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69328", "title": "United Arab Emirates", "text": "Country in West Asia\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE), also known simply as the Emirates, is a country in West Asia, situated at the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula. It is a federal semi-constitutional monarchy made up of seven emirates, with Abu Dhabi serving as its national capital. The UAE borders Oman to the east and northeast, and Saudi Arabia to the southwest; it shares maritime borders with Qatar and Iran in the Persian Gulf, and with Oman in the Gulf of Oman. As of 2024[ [update]], the UAE has an estimated population of over 10 million; Dubai is the country's largest city. Islam is the majority religion and Arabic is the official language; English is the most spoken language and the language of business.\nThe present-day United Arab Emirates is located within the historical region of Eastern Arabia, which was oriented to maritime trade and seafaring. The Portuguese arrived in the region around 1500 and set up bases on the territory while waging wars against the Persians. After their expulsion, the Dutch controlled the straits and established global maritime dominance. By the 19th century, with pearling becoming a major economic activity, piracy became rampant in the gulf, prompting British intervention; local sheikhdoms formed a pact with the United Kingdom to create the Trucial States, a British protectorate that was effectively shielded from attempted Saudi and Omani suzerainty. The Trucial States remained under British influence until full independence as the United Arab Emirates in 1971. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the country's first president (1971\u20132004), oversaw rapid development of the Emirates by investing revenues from newly found oil into healthcare, education, and infrastructure.\nThe UAE is considered a middle power in global affairs; Dubai serves as an international hub of finance, tourism, and commerce. Only 11% of the population are native Emiratis; the vast majority of inhabitants are expatriates and migrant workers, most of whom are from South Asia. The United Arab Emirates has the world's seventh-largest oil reserves and seventh-largest natural gas reserves. The country has the most diversified economy among the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), having become less reliant on natural resources in the 21st century and increasingly focusing on tourism and business. The UAE is a member of the United Nations, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OPEC, Non-Aligned Movement, World Trade Organization, and BRICS; it is also a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.\nThe Federal Supreme Council, made up of the seven ruling emirs, is the highest state authority; it jointly appoints one member as federal president, who appoints a prime minister, who in turn forms and leads the cabinet. The UAE is an authoritarian state but generally liberal by regional standards. It ranks highly in several social indicators such as housing, healthcare, education and personal safety, as well as the highest regionally in the Human Development Index. Human rights organisations consider the UAE substandard on human rights, ranking low in the human freedom index due to reports of government critics being imprisoned and tortured, families harassed by the state security apparatus, and cases of forced disappearances. Individual rights such as the freedoms of assembly, association, expression, and the freedom of the press are severely repressed.\nEtymology.\nThe United Arab Emirates is named after the seven emirates that formed a federation: the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the Emirate of Dubai, the Emirate of Ajman, the Emirate of Sharjah, the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, the Emirate of Umm Al Quwain, and the Emirate of Fujairah.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nStone tools recovered reveal a settlement of people from Africa some 127,000 years ago and a stone tool used for butchering animals discovered on the Arabian coast suggests an even older habitation from 130,000 years ago. In time, lively trading links developed with civilisations in Mesopotamia, Iran, and the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley. This contact persisted and became wider, probably motivated by the trade in copper from the Hajar Mountains, which commenced around 3,000 BCE. Sumerian sources talk of the Magan civilisation, which has been identified as encompassing the modern UAE and Oman.\nThere are six periods of human settlement with distinctive behaviours in the region before Islam, which include the Hafit period from 3,200 to 2,600 BCE, the Umm Al Nar culture from 2,600 to 2,000 BCE, and the Wadi Suq culture from 2,000 to 1,300 BCE. From 1,200 BCE to the advent of Islam in Eastern Arabia, through three distinctive Iron Ages and the Mleiha period, the area was variously occupied by the Achaemenids and other forces, and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the \"falaj\" irrigation system.\nIslam.\nThe spread of Islam to the northeastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the Islamic prophet Muhammad to the rulers of Oman in 630 CE. This led to a group of rulers travelling to Medina, converting to Islam, and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular Sassanids, who dominated the coast at the time. Following the death of Muhammad, the new Islamic communities south of the Persian Gulf threatened to disintegrate, with insurrections against the Muslim leaders. Caliph Abu Bakr sent an army from the capital Medina which completed its reconquest of the territory (the Ridda Wars) with the Battle of Dibba in which 10,000 lives are thought to have been lost. This assured the integrity of the Caliphate and the unification of the Arabian Peninsula under the newly emerging Rashidun Caliphate.\nIn 637, Julfar (in the area of today's Ras Al Khaimah) was an important port that was used as a staging post for the Islamic invasion of the Sasanian Empire. The area of the Al Ain/Buraimi Oasis was known as Tu'am and was an important trading post for camel routes between the coast and the Arabian interior.\nThe earliest Christian site in the UAE was first discovered in the 1990s, an extensive monastic complex on what is now known as Sir Bani Yas Island and which dates back to the seventh century. Thought to be Nestorian and built in 600 CE, the church appears to have been abandoned peacefully in 750 CE. It forms a rare physical link to a legacy of Christianity, which is thought to have spread across the peninsula from 50 to 350 CE following trade routes. Certainly, by the fifth century, Oman had a bishop named John \u2013 the last bishop of Oman being Etienne, in 676 CE.\nPortuguese era.\nThe harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the \"versatile tribesman\", nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities, including animal husbandry, agriculture, and hunting. The seasonal movements of these groups led not only to frequent clashes between groups but also to the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres. These formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern Emiratis, including the Bani Yas and Al Bu Falah of Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Liwa, and the west coast; the Dhawahir, Awamir, Al Ali, and Manasir of the interior; the Sharqiyin of the east coast; and the Qawasim to the north.\nWith the expansion of European colonial empires, Portuguese, English, and Dutch forces appeared in the Persian Gulf region. By the 18th century, the Bani Yas confederation was the dominant force in most of the area now known as Abu Dhabi, while the Northern Al Qawasim (Al Qasimi) dominated maritime commerce. The Portuguese maintained an influence over the coastal settlements, building forts in the wake of the bloody 16th-century conquests of coastal communities by Albuquerque and the Portuguese commanders who followed him \u2013 particularly on the east coast at Muscat, Sohar, and Khor Fakkan.\nThe southern coast of the Persian Gulf was known to the British as the \"Pirate Coast\", as boats of the Al Qawasim federation harassed British-flagged shipping from the 17th century into the 19th. The charge of piracy is disputed by modern Emirati historians, including the current ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Sultan Al Qasimi, in his 1986 book \"The Myth of Arab Piracy in the Gulf\".\nBritish expeditions to protect their Indian trade routes led to campaigns against Ras Al Khaimah and other harbours along the coast, including the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809 and the more successful campaign of 1819. The following year, Britain and a number of local rulers signed a maritime truce, giving rise to the term Trucial States, which came to define the status of the coastal emirates. A further treaty was signed in 1843 and in 1853, the Perpetual Maritime Truce was agreed. To this was added the 'Exclusive Agreements', signed in 1892, which made the Trucial States a British protectorate.\nUnder the 1892 treaty, the trucial sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the British and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the British without their consent. In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack. British maritime policing meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security. However, the British prohibition of the slave trade meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchants.\nIn 1869, the Qubaisat tribe settled at Khor Al Adaid and tried to enlist the support of the Ottomans. Khor Al Adaid was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the British. In 1906, the British Political Resident, Percy Cox, confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan ('Zayed the Great'), that Khor Al Adaid belonged to his sheikhdom.\nBritish era and discovery of oil.\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the pearling industry thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. The First World War had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the cultured pearl, that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War, when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on imported pearls. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.\nIn 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC. APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement, which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. In 1952, they formed the Trucial States Council, and appointed Adi Al Bitar, Dubai's Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum's legal advisor, as secretary general and legal advisor to the council. The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed. The tribal nature of society and the lack of definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes, settled either through mediation or, more rarely, force. The Trucial Oman Scouts was a small military force used by the British to keep the peace.\nIn 1953, a subsidiary of BP, D'Arcy Exploration Ltd, obtained an offshore concession from the ruler of Abu Dhabi. BP joined with Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles (later Total) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA). A number of undersea oil surveys were carried out, including one led by the famous marine explorer Jacques Cousteau. In 1958, a floating platform rig was towed from Hamburg, Germany, and positioned over the Umm Shaif pearl bed, in Abu Dhabi waters, where drilling began. In March, it struck oil in the Upper Thamama rock formation. This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962. ADMA made further offshore discoveries at Zakum and elsewhere, and other companies made commercial finds such as the Fateh oilfield off Dubai and the Mubarak field off Sharjah (shared with Iran).\nMeanwhile, onshore exploration was hindered by territorial disputes. In 1955, the United Kingdom represented Abu Dhabi and Oman in their dispute with Saudi Arabia over the Buraimi Oasis. A 1974 agreement between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia seemed to have settled the Abu Dhabi-Saudi border dispute, but this has not been ratified. The UAE's border with Oman was ratified in 2008.\nPDTC continued its onshore exploration away from the disputed area, drilling five more bore holes that were also dry. However, on 27 October 1960, the company discovered oil in commercial quantities at the Murban No. 3 well on the coast near Tarif. In 1962, PDTC became the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals, and roads. When Dubai's oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, was able to invest the revenues from the limited reserves found to spark the diversification drive that would create the modern global city of Dubai.\nIndependence.\nBy 1966, it had become clear that the British government could no longer afford to administer and protect the Trucial States, what is now the United Arab Emirates. British Members of Parliament (MPs) debated the preparedness of the Royal Navy to defend the sheikhdoms. On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the government's decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister Edward Heath, to end the treaty relationships with the seven trucial sheikhdoms. Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the British Armed Forces in the Emirates. The British Conservative government rejected the offer. After Labour MP Goronwy Roberts informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year.\nFears of vulnerability were realised the day before independence. An Iranian destroyer group broke formation from an exercise in the lower Gulf, sailing to the Tunb islands. The islands were taken by force, civilians and Arab defenders alike allowed to flee. A British warship stood idle during the course of the invasion. A destroyer group approached the island of Abu Musa as well. But there, Sheikh Khalid bin Muhammad Al Qasimi had already negotiated with the Iranian shah, and the island was quickly leased to Iran for $3 million a year. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia laid claim to swathes of Abu Dhabi. It was not until 1974 that a border agreement was signed with Saudi Arabia, formally demarcating the frontiers between the UAE and Saudi Arabia. The UAE's sense of threat from Iran influenced its financial support for Iraq during the Iran\u2013Iraq War.\nOriginally intended to be part of the proposed Federation of Arab Emirates, Bahrain became independent in August, and Qatar in September 1971. When the British-Trucial Sheikhdoms treaty expired on 1 December 1971, both emirates became fully independent. On 2 December 1971, six of the emirates (Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Sharjah, and Umm Al Quwain) agreed to enter into a union named the United Arab Emirates. Ras al-Khaimah joined later, on 10 January 1972. In February 1972, the Federal National Council (FNC) was created; it was a 40-member consultative body appointed by the seven rulers. The UAE joined the Arab League on 6 December 1971 and the United Nations on 9 December. It was a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council in May 1981, with Abu Dhabi hosting the first GCC summit.\nPost-independence period.\nThe founding fathers of the United Arab Emirates were: Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi; Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai; Khalid bin Muhammad Al Qasimi of Sharjah; Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi of Ajman; Ahmad bin Rashid Al Mualla of Umm Al Quwain; Saqr bin Mohammed Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah and Mohammed bin Hamad Al Sharqi of Fujairah.\nThe UAE supported military operations by the US and other coalition states engaged in the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein in Ba'athist Iraq (1991), as well as operations supporting the global war on terror for the Horn of Africa at Al Dhafra Air Base located outside of Abu Dhabi. The air base also supported Allied operations during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and Operation Northern Watch. The country had already signed a military defence agreement with the U.S. in 1994 and one with France in 1995. In January 2008, France and the UAE signed a deal allowing France to set up a permanent military base in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The UAE joined international military operations in Libya in March 2011.\nOn 2 November 2004, the UAE's first president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, died. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan was elected as the president of the UAE. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan succeeded Sheikh Khalifa as crown prince of Abu Dhabi. In January 2006, Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai, died, and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum assumed both roles.\nThe first ever national elections were held on 16 December 2006. A number of voters chose half of the members of the Federal National Council. The UAE has largely escaped the Arab Spring, which other countries have experienced; however, 60 Emirati activists from Al Islah were apprehended for an alleged coup attempt and the attempt of the establishment of an Islamist state in the UAE. Mindful of the protests in nearby Bahrain, in November 2012 the UAE outlawed online mockery of its government or attempts to organise public protests through social media.\nOn 29 January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the UAE. Two months later, in March, the government announced the closure of shopping malls, schools, and places of worship, in addition to imposing a 24-hour curfew, and suspending all Emirates passenger flights. This resulted in a major economic downturn, which eventually led to the merger of more than 50% of the UAE's .\nOn 29 August 2020, the UAE established normal diplomatic relations with Israel and with the help of the United States, they signed the Abraham Accords with Bahrain.\nOn 9 February 2021, the UAE achieved a historic milestone when its probe, named \"Hope\", successfully reached Mars's orbit. The UAE became the first country in the Arab world to reach Mars, the fifth country to successfully reach Mars, and the second country, after an Indian probe, to orbit Mars on its maiden attempt.\nOn 14 May 2022, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was elected as the UAE's new president after the death of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\nGeography.\nThe United Arab Emirates is situated in the Middle East, bordering the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, between Oman and Saudi Arabia; it is in a strategic location slightly south of the Strait of Hormuz, a vital transit point for world crude oil.\nThe UAE lies between 22\u00b030' and 26\u00b010' north latitude and between 51\u00b0 and 56\u00b025\u2032 east longitude. It shares a border with Saudi Arabia on the west, south, and southeast, and a border with Oman on the southeast and northeast. The land border with Qatar in the Khor Al Adaid area is about in the northwest; however, it is a source of ongoing dispute. Following Britain's military departure from the UAE in 1971, and its establishment as a new state, the UAE laid claim to Iranian-occupied islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and the Lesser Tunbs, when Iran captured them during the British rule, resulting in disputes with Iran that remain unresolved. The UAE also disputes claim on other islands against the neighbouring state of Qatar. The largest emirate, Abu Dhabi, accounts for 87% of the UAE's total area, . The smallest emirate, Ajman, encompasses only .\nThe UAE coast stretches for nearly along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf, briefly interrupted by an isolated outcrop of the Sultanate of Oman. Six of the emirates are situated along the Persian Gulf, and the seventh, Fujairah, is on the eastern coast of the peninsula with direct access to the Gulf of Oman. Most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend inland. The largest natural harbor is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many coral reefs and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the Al B\u0101\u0163inah coast of the Gulf of Oman. The Musandam Peninsula, the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, and Madha are exclaves of Oman separated by the UAE.\nSouth and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling sand dunes merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation. The extensive Liwa Oasis is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia. About to the northeast of Liwa is the Al-Buraimi oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border. Lake Zakher in Al Ain is a human-made lake near the border with Oman that was created from treated waste water.\nPrior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British interventions, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the Western Hajar Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.\nBiodiversity.\nThe UAE contains the following terrestrial ecoregions: Al Hajar montane woodlands and shrublands, Gulf of Oman desert and semi-desert, and Al-Hajar foothill xeric woodlands and shrublands.\nThe oases grow date palms, acacia, and eucalyptus trees. In the desert, the flora is very sparse and consists of grasses and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, which has led to a conservation program on Sir Bani Yas Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, Arabian Oryx, Arabian camel, and leopards. Coastal fish and mammals consist mainly of mackerel, perch, and tuna, as well as sharks and whales.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the UAE is subtropical-arid with hot summers and warm winters. The climate is categorised as desert climate. The hottest months are July and August, when average maximum temperatures reach above on the coastal plain. In the Hajar Mountains, temperatures are considerably lower, a result of increased elevation. Average minimum temperatures in January and February are between . During the late summer months, a humid southeastern wind known as Sharqi (i.e. \"Easterner\") makes the coastal region especially unpleasant. The average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than , but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches . Rain in the coastal region falls in short, torrential bursts during the winter months, sometimes resulting in floods in ordinarily dry wadi beds. The region is prone to occasional, violent dust storms, which can severely reduce visibility.\nOn 28 December 2004, snow was recorded in the UAE for the first time, in the Jebel Jais mountain cluster in Ras al-Khaimah. A few years later, there were more sightings of snow and hail. The Jebel Jais mountain cluster has experienced snow only twice since records began.\nGovernment and politics.\nGovernment.\nThe United Arab Emirates is a federal constitutional monarchy made up from a federation of seven hereditary tribal monarchy-styled political units called Sheikhdoms. It is governed by a Federal Supreme Council made up of the ruling Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah, and Umm Al Quwain. All responsibilities not granted to the federal government are reserved to the individual emirate. A percentage of revenues from each emirate is allocated to the UAE's central budget.\nThe UAE uses the title Sheikh instead of Emir to refer to the rulers of individual emirates. The title is used due to the sheikhdom-styled governing system in adherence to the culture of tribes of Arabia, where Sheikh means leader, elder, or the tribal chief of the clan who partakes in shared decision making with his followers. The president and vice president are elected by the Federal Supreme Council. Usually, the Head of the Al Nahyan family, who are based in Abu Dhabi, holds the presidency and the Head of the Al Maktoum family, based in Dubai, the prime ministership. All prime ministers but one have served concurrently as vice president.\nThe federal government is composed of three branches:\nThe UAE e-Government is the extension of the UAE federal government in its electronic form. The UAE's Council of Ministers () is the chief executive branch of the government presided over by the prime minister. The prime minister, who is appointed by the Federal Supreme Council, appoints the ministers. The Council of Ministers is made up of 22 members and manages all internal and foreign affairs of the federation under its constitutional and federal law. In December 2019, the UAE became the only Arab country, and one of only five countries in the world, to attain gender parity in a national legislative body, with its lower house being 50 percent women.\nThe UAE is the only country in the world that has a Ministry of Tolerance, a Ministry of Happiness, and a Ministry of Artificial Intelligence. The UAE also has a virtual ministry called the Ministry of Possibilities, designed to find solutions to challenges and improve quality of life. The UAE also has a National Youth Council, which is represented in the UAE cabinet by the Minister of Youth.\nThe UAE legislative body is the Federal National Council which convenes nationwide elections every four years. The FNC consists of 40 members drawn from all the emirates. Each emirate is allocated specific seats to ensure full representation. Half are appointed by the rulers of the constituent emirates, and the other half are elected by a small percentage of Emirati citizens, currently 33%, hand-picked by the rulers of each emirate. By law, the council members have to be equally divided between males and females. The FNC is restricted to a largely consultative role.\nThe UAE is an authoritarian federal monarchy. The UAE has been described as a \"tribal autocracy\" where the seven constituent monarchies are led by tribal rulers in an autocratic fashion. There are no democratically elected institutions, and there is no formal commitment to free speech. According to human rights organizations, there are systematic human rights violations, including the torture and forced disappearance of government critics. The UAE ranks poorly in freedom indices measuring civil liberties and political rights. The UAE has consistently ranked poorly across a number of freedom indices, including being ranked as \"Not Free\" in Freedom House's annual \"Freedom in the World\" report from 1999 to present day, ranks poorly in the annual Reporters without Borders' Press Freedom Index, International IDEA's Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices, thew Democracy Tracker, and the Bertelsmann Transformation Index - which describes the UAE as a \"moderate monarchy\". The country was ranked 91 out of 137 states and is far below the average scoring for development towards a democracy, and is the third least democratic country in the Middle East. The country, by all measurements is not democratic, with particular weaknesses in political representation, including inclusive suffrage and credible elections.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe United Arab Emirates comprises seven emirates. The Emirate of Dubai is the most populous emirate with 35.6% of the UAE population. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi has 31.2%, meaning that over two-thirds of the UAE population lives in either Abu Dhabi or Dubai.\nAbu Dhabi has an area of , which is 86.7% of the country's total area, excluding the islands. It has a coastline extending for more than and is divided for administrative purposes into three major regions. The Emirate of Dubai extends along the Persian Gulf coast of the UAE for approximately . Dubai has an area of , which is equivalent to 5% of the country's total area, excluding the islands. The Emirate of Sharjah extends along approximately of the UAE's Persian Gulf coastline and for more than into the interior. The northern emirates which include Fujairah, Ajman, Ras al-Khaimah, and Umm al-Qaiwain all have a total area of . There are two areas under joint control. One is jointly controlled by Oman and Ajman, the other by Fujairah and Sharjah.\nThere is an Omani exclave surrounded by UAE territory, known as Wadi Madha. It is located halfway between the Musandam peninsula and the rest of Oman in the Emirate of Sharjah. It covers approximately and the boundary was settled in 1969. The north-east corner of Madha is closest to the Khor Fakkan-Fujairah road, barely away. Within the Omani exclave of Madha, is a UAE exclave called Nahwa, also belonging to the Emirate of Sharjah. It is about on a dirt track west of the town of New Madha. It consists of about forty houses with its own clinic and telephone exchange.\nForeign relations.\nThe United Arab Emirates has broad diplomatic and commercial relations with most countries and members of the United Nations, despite significant human rights abuses. It plays a significant role in OPEC, and is one of the founding members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The UAE is a member of the United Nations and several of its specialised agencies (ICAO, ILO, UPU, WHO, WIPO), as well as the World Bank, IMF, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the Non-Aligned Movement. Also, it is an observer in the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. Most countries have diplomatic missions in the capital Abu Dhabi with most consulates being in UAE's largest city, Dubai.\nEmirati foreign relations are motivated to a large extent by identity and relationship to the Arab world. The United Arab Emirates has strong ties with Bahrain, China, Egypt, India, Jordan, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.\nFollowing the British withdrawal from the UAE in 1971 and the establishment of the UAE as a state, the UAE disputed rights to three islands in the Persian Gulf against Iran, namely Abu Musa, Greater Tunb, and Lesser Tunb. The UAE tried to bring the matter to the International Court of Justice, but Iran dismissed the notion. Pakistan was the first country to formally recognise the UAE upon its formation. The UAE alongside multiple Middle Eastern and African countries cut diplomatic ties with Qatar in June 2017 due to allegations of Qatar being a state sponsor of terrorism, resulting in the Qatar diplomatic crisis. Ties were restored in January 2021. The UAE recognised Israel in August 2020, reaching a historic Israel\u2013United Arab Emirates peace agreement and leading towards full normalisation of relations between the two countries.\nGulf Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates, showed interest in engaging with the Syrian transitional government to promote political transition and address regional concerns following the fall of the Assad regime. Additionally, the UAE leadership see the change in Syria as an opportunity to undermine Iranian influence in the Levant. The hope is to help push Iran out of Syria and cut its pathways between Iraq and Lebanon.\nThe UAE is the primary supporter of the rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the ongoing Sudanese Civil War. In 2025, multiple reports exposed the UAE for supplying the arab supremacist with weapons, in violation of international sanctions, and used to commit genocide in the region. \nAs a result of the conflict in Sudan, United States representative Sara Jacobs visited a refugee camp in Sudan in March 2024, reporting her observation of the extensive trauma endured by children in Sudan, under the conflict. As a result of this trip, she stated the US is morally obligated to take measures and stop the selling arms to the Emirates which are being sold to arm the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militias. Joining US Senator Chris Van Hollen, United States Congress has pushed for an export ban of weapons to the UAE. As of November 2025, the bill remained in Congress. \nMilitary.\nThe armed forces of the United Arab Emirates consist of 44,000 active personnel in the Army, 2,500 personnel and 46 ships in the Navy, 4,500 personnel and 386 aircraft in the Air Force, and 12,000 personnel in the Presidential Guard. In 2022 the country spent US$20.4 billion on defense, which is 4% of its GDP. The UAE is considered to have the most capable military among the Gulf states.\nAlthough initially small in number, the UAE armed forces have grown significantly over the years and are presently equipped with some of the most modern weapon systems, purchased from a variety of western military advanced countries, mainly France, the US, and the UK. Most officers are graduates of the United Kingdom's Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, with others having attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Australia, and St Cyr, the military academy of France. France and the United States have played the most strategically significant roles with defence cooperation agreements and military material provision.\nSome of the UAE military deployments include an infantry battalion to the United Nations UNOSOM II force in Somalia in 1993, the 35th Mechanised Infantry Battalion to Kosovo, a regiment to Kuwait during the Iraq War, demining operations in Lebanon, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, American-led intervention in Libya, American-led intervention in Syria, and the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen. The active and effective military role, despite its small active personnel, has led the UAE military to be nicknamed as \"Little Sparta\" by United States Armed Forces Generals and former US defense secretary James Mattis.\nThe UAE intervened in the Libyan Civil War in support of General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army in its conflict with the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA).\nExamples of the military assets deployed include the enforcement of the no-fly-zone over Libya by sending six UAEAF F-16 and six Mirage 2000 multi-role fighter aircraft, ground troop deployment in Afghanistan, 30 UAEAF F-16s and ground troops deployment in Southern Yemen, and helping the US launch its first airstrikes against ISIL targets in Syria.\nThe UAE has begun production of a greater amount of military equipment, in a bid to reduce foreign dependence and help with national industrialisation. Example of national military development include the Abu Dhabi Shipbuilding company (ADSB), which produces a range of ships and is a prime contractor in the Baynunah Programme, a programme to design, develop, and produce corvettes customised for operation in the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. The UAE is also producing weapons and ammunition through Caracal International, military transport vehicles through Nimr LLC, and unmanned aerial vehicles collectively through Emirates Defence Industries Company. The UAE operates the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon F-16E Block 60 unique variant unofficially called \"Desert Falcon\", developed by General Dynamics in collaboration with the UAE and specifically for the United Arab Emirates Air Force. The United Arab Emirates Army operates a customised Leclerc tank and is the only other operator of the tank aside from the French Army. The largest defence exhibition and conference in the Middle East, International Defence Exhibition, takes place biennially in Abu Dhabi.\nThe UAE introduced a mandatory military service for adult males, since 2014, for 16 months to expand its reserve force. The highest loss of life in the history of UAE military occurred on Friday 4 September 2015, in which 52 soldiers were killed in Marib area of central Yemen by a Tochka missile which targeted a weapons cache and caused a large explosion.\nLaw.\nThe United Arab Emirates has a federal court system, and the emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Ras Al Khaimah also have local court systems. The UAE's judicial system is derived from the civil law system and Sharia law. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. Sharia courts have exclusive jurisdiction in Muslim family law matters, while civil courts deal with all other legal matters. Since September 2020, corporal punishment is no longer a legal form of punishment under UAE federal law. Under the decree, legal forms of punishment are retribution and blood money payments, capital punishment, life imprisonment, temporary imprisonment, indefinite detention, and fines. Article 1 of the Federal Penal Code was amended in 2020 to state that Islamic Law applies only to retribution and blood money punishments; previously the article stated that \"provisions of the Islamic Law shall apply to the crimes of doctrinal punishment, punitive punishment and blood money.\" Before 2020, flogging, stoning, amputation, and crucifixion were technically legal punishments for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex, and drug or alcohol use. In recent history, the UAE has declared its intention to move towards a more tolerant legal code, and to phase out corporal punishment altogether in favour of private punishment. With alcohol and cohabitation laws being loosened in advance of the 2020 World Expo, Emirati laws have become increasingly acceptable to visitors from non-Muslim countries.\nSharia courts have exclusive jurisdiction over Muslim family law matters such as marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance. Muslim women must receive permission from a male guardian to marry and remarry. This requirement is derived from Sharia law and has been federal law since 2005. It is illegal for Muslim women to marry non-Muslims and is punishable by law. Non-Muslim expatriates were liable to Sharia rulings on marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance, however, federal law was changed to introduce non-Sharia personal status law for non-Muslims. Recently, the emirate of Abu Dhabi opened a civil law family court for non-Muslims and Dubai has announced that non-Muslims can opt for civil marriages.\nApostasy is a technically capital crime in the UAE, however, there are no documented cases of apostates being executed. Blasphemy is illegal; expatriates involved in insulting Islam are liable for deportation.\nSodomy is illegal and is punishable by a minimum of 6-month imprisonment or a fine or both, but the law does not apply \"except on the basis of a complaint from the husband or legal guardian\", but the penalty may be suspended if the complaint is waived. In 2013, an Emirati man was on trial for being accused of a \"gay handshake\".\nDue to local customs, public shows of affection in certain public places are illegal and could result in deportation, but holding hands is tolerated. Expats in Dubai have been deported for kissing in public. In several cases, the courts of the UAE have jailed women who have reported rape. Federal law in the UAE prohibits swearing on social media. Dancing in public is illegal in the UAE. In November 2020, UAE announced that it decriminalised alcohol, lifted the ban on unmarried couples living together, and ended lenient punishment on honor killing. Foreigners living in the Emirates were allowed to follow their native country's laws on divorce and inheritance.\nDespite the Sharia laws that restrict gambling tools and machines in the UAE, the country granted its first commercial gaming operator's licence to Wynn Resorts that was developing a luxury resort, including a casino component, at Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah. In September 2023, the UAE established the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), hinting towards its plans to legalise gambling. The GCGRA has outlined a comprehensive framework that includes licenses for casinos, slot machines, and poker tables, as well as lotteries, internet gaming, and sports wagering. The GCGRA emphasises responsible gaming, requiring operators to implement socially responsible gaming programs and undergo audits every two years. These programs include player education, responsible marketing, employee training, and evaluation plans to measure their effectiveness. Gaming operators must have a \"qualifying domestic entity\" in the UAE, defined as any UAE company with substantial business operations in the jurisdiction. The GCGRA also mandates player management tools, including deposit limits and cooling-off periods for online gaming.\nThe first lottery license has been granted to The Game LLC, operating under the banner of the 'UAE Lottery'. This move supersedes existing lottery operators like Mahzooz and Big Ticket, which are no longer legally permitted to offer their services. Players are required to engage only with licensed gaming operators to avoid severe penalties. The regulations also specify that operators must enable players to restrict themselves from online gaming platforms for a period of at least 72 hours upon request. This is part of the broader initiative to ensure a secure and responsible commercial gaming environment in the UAE.\nThe UAE's move to legalise gaming is seen as a strategic step to enhance its tourism and entertainment sector, leveraging its existing infrastructure and business-friendly environment. This development is expected to attract major gaming operators and contribute significantly to the country's economy.\nThe country does not have any formal gaming laws, and therefore the project details about the casino were not completely made public. Local citizens are not permitted for gambling, which remains a legal and cultural taboo.\nHuman rights violations.\nHuman Rights Watch has reported on the country's ongoing unfair mass trials, restrictions of freedom of speech and abuses to migrant labor forces. The annual Freedom House report on Freedom in the World has listed the United Arab Emirates as \"Not Free\" every year since 1999, the first year for which records are available on their website. In 2025, the country ranked 18 out of 100 in terms of the freedom index, due to a lack of free elections, lack of government transparency and accountability, and a lack of free media and independent judicial system, and low scores against other metrics.\nFreedom of association is also severely curtailed, and in most cases, banned under existing law. In the UAE an association requires twenty individuals, none of which can have previous convictions and must be preauthorized and registered with the government. All associations have to be submitted to censorship guidelines and all publications have first to be approved by the government. Updated in 2022, article 188 in the Penal Code makes the establishment of an association with the intended goal of challenging the existing regime punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty. In its 2025 Annual Report, Amnesty International has continuously identified severe human rights violations, particularly against freedom of assembly, freedom speech and an uptick in arbitrary arrest and torture.\nImmigrant workers are often subject to harsh forms of the law within the country, and are often victims of arbitrary detention or torture within the country. One notable example is Ryan Cornelius, a 71-year-old British citizen who has been unlawfully detained in the UAE since 2008. The Arab Organization for Human Rights obtained testimonies from defendants who claimed being kidnapped, tortured and abused in detention centers; they reported sixteen methods of torture including beatings, threats with electrocution and denial of medical care. Repressive measures, including deportation, were applied on foreigners based on allegations of attempts to destabilize the country. The issue of sexual abuse among female domestic workers is another area of concern, particularly given that domestic servants are not covered by the UAE labour law of 1980 or the draft labour law of 2007. Additionally, the \"kafala system,\" or sponsorship for work results in a significant cost to migrant workers and conditions comparable to indentured servitude. Protests by foreign workers have been suppressed, and protesters imprisoned without due process; including in 2008, 2012, and most recently in 2023.\nThe state security apparatus in the UAE has been accused of human rights abuses including forced disappearance, arbitrary arrests and torture. In a mass trial in 2013, human rights activist and lawyer, Salim al-Shehhi claimed he was held in solitary confinement and forced to give a confession to crimes he was accused of. In 2023, the country held its largest mass trial where defendants were not given fair treatment. Beginning in December 2023, a trial with 84 defendants resulted in 43 people sentenced to life in prison, ten received sentences up to fifteen years for peaceful protests against the government. Those convicted were Bangladeshi individuals in the UAE, protesting their home government, while the UAE claimed the defendants were a part of a terrorist organization. The trial took place in secrecy with no documents or evidence provided in the court. In January 2025, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report highlighting the human rights abuses committed by the UAE in 2024, majorly focusing on the unfair mass trial, where the UAE's use of Federal Penal Code and the Cybercrime Law were used to silence government critics, journalists, dissidents and activists, while restricting their freedom of expression. \nA December 2024 report by European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (ECDHR) highlights the country's acute issue with unlawful, political persecution and absence of judicial independence. Trials are often held in secrecy and the defendants' lawyers are neglected from accessing case files and court documents. The UAE's 2014 Counter-Terrorism Law is used to enforce travel bans, life imprisonment and even death penalty for peaceful critics of the regime and those managing an organization. The UAE's counterterrorism law represses freedom of expression. The country's judicial system lacks any form of transparency or independence, and international organizations have called on the UN to form an independent committee to review all allegations of torture, incommunicado detention, and unfair trials.\nInvestigations have found that Qatari men have been abducted by the UAE government and allegedly withheld information about the men's fate from their families. Over 4,000 Shia expatriates have been deported from the UAE; including Lebanese Shia families for their alleged sympathies for Hezbollah. In 2013, 94 Emirati activists were held in secret detention centres and put on trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government; a relative of a defendant was arrested for tweeting about the trial, and sentenced to 10 months in jail. The latest forced disappearance involves three sisters from Abu Dhabi.\nThe UAE has expanded its international influence, subsequently committing human rights abuses across national borders. The country has been a leading supporter of Israel's genocide in Gaza as well as funding the genocide in Sudan, through direct support and supply of weapons to the Rapid Support Forces in the Sudanese civil war.\nOn 29 March 2024, Sudan filed a formal complaint with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), in response to the UAE's planning and backing the RSF militias against the Sudanese army. The ongoing conflict has reached new heights of violence with the continued support of the RSF by the UAE in terms of weapons and other equipment. Reports stating the Emirates wanted to provide humanitarian support for the Sudanese people turned out to be an expansion of a covert operation to funnel money, weapons - including drone technology - to opposition forces. Officials said the UAE was playing the most consequential role by inflaming the crisis, while pledging to ease it. In October 2024, Sudan wrote a second official letter to the UNSC, calling for it to take strong action against the UAE's continued aggression towards Sudan, with the Sudanese Foreign Ministry also claimed that the UAE is not just an indirect supporter of RSF, but rather a \"vicious frontline player in the war of aggression\" against Sudan.\nAs a response to their poor human rights records, the government of the UAE has tried to strengthen relations with a number of western private and public entities through whitewashing, to improve their public image. They established a Soft Power Council in 2017 in order to address their international image. The UAE deploys a number of these techniques, including gender-washing, green-washing and sports-washing; as evident in hosting major events like COP28, sporting events including Formula One races, the Abu Dhabi Cup in 2026; or promoting tourism and business to Dubai. The growing interest in playing a role in the international entertainment industriy is an attempt to scour the country's image of its ongoing human rights violations. They continue to face criticism for its ongoing contribution to climate change and human rights abuses, despite participating in these international events. In 2018, the country hosted the Second Annual World Tolerance Summit, which was protested by a number of NGOs and scholars.\nMigrant workers.\nMigrant workers in the UAE are not allowed to join trade unions or go on strike. Those who strike may risk prison and deportation, as seen in 2014 when dozens of workers were deported for striking. The International Trade Union Confederation has called on the United Nations to investigate evidence that thousands of migrant workers in the UAE are treated as slave labour.\nIn 2019, an investigation performed by \"The Guardian\" revealed that thousands of migrant construction workers employed on infrastructure and building projects for the UAE's Expo 2020 exhibition were working in an unsafe environment. Some were even exposed to potentially fatal situations due to cardiovascular issues. Long hours in the sun made them vulnerable to heat strokes.\nA report in January 2020 highlighted that the employers in the United Arab Emirates have been exploiting the Indian labor and hiring them on tourist visas, which is easier and cheaper than work permits. These migrant workers are left open to labor abuse, where they also fear reporting exploitation due to their illegal status. Besides, the issue remains unknown as the visit visa data is not maintained in both the UAE and Indian migration and employment records.\nIn a 22 July 2020 news piece, \"Reuters\" reported human rights groups as saying conditions had deteriorated because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many migrant workers racked up debt and depended on the help of charities. The report cited salary delays and layoffs as a major risk, in addition to overcrowded living conditions, lack of support and problems linked with healthcare and sick pay. Reuters reported at least 200,000 workers, mostly from India but also from Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Nepal, had been repatriated, according to their diplomatic missions.\nOn 2 May 2020, the Consul General of India in Dubai, Vipul, confirmed that more than 150,000 Indians in the United Arab Emirates registered to be repatriated through the e-registration option provided by Indian consulates in the UAE. According to the figures, 25% of applicants lost their jobs and nearly 15% were stranded in the country due to lockdown. Besides, 50% of the total applicants were from the state of Kerala, India.\nOn 9 October 2020, \"The Telegraph\" reported that many migrant workers were left abandoned, as they lost their jobs amidst the tightening economy due to COVID-19.\nVarious human rights organisations have raised serious concerns about the alleged abuse of migrant workers by major contractors organising Expo 2020. UAE's business solution provider German Pavilion is also held accountable for abusing migrant workers.\nEnvironmental policy.\nEnvironmental issues in the United Arab Emirates are caused by the exploitation of natural resources, rapid population growth, and high energy demand. Climate change contributes to UAE's water scarcity, drought, and rising sea level. The country is a leading oil and gas producer. Its energy consumption per capita is around 370 Gigajoule. The UAE's carbon dioxide emissions per capita are high, ranking sixth among countries globally. Recently, it made efforts to make itself more sustainable. Those include:\nAccording to official sources, in Dubai, \"the share of mass transport in people's mobility increased from 6 per cent in 2006 to 20.61 per cent in 2022.\" Together with the USA the country invested 17 billion dollars in sustainable agriculture.\nEconomy.\nThe United Arab Emirates has developed from a juxtaposition of Bedouin tribes to one of the world's wealthiest states in only about 50 years, boasting one of the highest GDP (PPP) per capita figures in the world. Economic growth has been impressive and steady throughout the history of this young confederation of emirates with brief periods of recessions only, e.g. in the global financial and economic crisis years 2008\u201309, and a couple of more mixed years starting in 2015 and persisting until 2019. Between 2000 and 2018, average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was at close to 4%. It is the second largest economy in the GCC (after Saudi Arabia), with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of US$414.2 billion, and a real GDP of 392.8 billion constant 2010 USD in 2018. Since its independence in 1971, the UAE's economy has grown by nearly 231 times to 1.45 trillion AED in 2013. The non-oil trade has grown to 1.2 trillion AED, a growth by around 28 times from 1981 to 2012. Supported by the world's seventh-largest oil reserves and aided by prudent investments coupled with a resolute commitment to economic liberalism and strong governmental oversight, the UAE has witnessed its real GDP increase by more than three times over the past four decades. Presently, the UAE is among the wealthiest countries globally, with GDP per capita nearly 80% higher than the OECD average.\nAs impressive as economic growth has been in the UAE, the total population has increased from just around 550,000 in 1975 to close to 10 million in 2018. This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.\nAs for competitiveness, in June 2024 it was reported that the UAE has moved up three place to the 7th place among the top 10 countries in the IMD World Competitiveness. This ranking is issued by the World Competitiveness Centre of the Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Switzerland.\nBusiness and finance.\nThe UAE is ranked as the 26th best country in the world for doing business by the Doing Business 2017 Report published by the World Bank Group. The UAE are in the top ranks of several other global indices, such as the World Happiness Report (WHR) and 30th in the Global Innovation Index in 2025.The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) assigns the UAE rank two regionally in terms of business environment and 22 worldwide. From the 2018 Arab Youth Survey, the UAE emerges as the top Arab country in areas such as living, safety and security, economic opportunities, and starting a business, and as an example for other states to emulate.\nThe weaker points remain the level of education across the UAE population, limitations in the financial and labour markets, barriers to trade and some regulations that hinder business dynamism. The major challenge for the country, though, remains translating investments and strong enabling conditions into innovation and creative outputs.\nUAE law does not allow trade unions to exist. The right to collective bargaining and the right to strike are not recognised, and the Ministry of Labour has the power to force workers to go back to work. Migrant workers who participate in a strike can have their work permits cancelled and be deported. Consequently, there are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with Emiratis \u2013 and other GCC Arabs \u2013 getting preference in public sector jobs despite lesser credentials than competitors and lower motivation. In fact, just over eighty per cent of Emirati workers hold government posts, with many of the rest taking part in state-owned enterprises such as Emirates airlines and Dubai Properties. Western states, including the United Kingdom, were also warned by the Emirati Trade Minister, Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, to keep politics separate from trade and the economy, as it dilutes the agreements' main objectives. In 2023, Al Zeyoudi indicated that these countries should \"tone down\" the human and workers' rights provisions in the trade deals, in order to gain greater market access and business opportunities.\nThe UAE's monetary policy stresses stability and predictability. The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) keeps a peg to the US Dollar (USD) and moves interest rates close to the Federal Funds Rate.\nAccording to Fitch Ratings, the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 \u2013 which the UAE currency complies to \u2013 have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the economy.\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018, growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy, the government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 2018. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.\nThe UAE has an attractive tax system for companies and wealthy individuals, making it a preferred destination for companies seeking tax avoidance. The NGO Tax Justice Network places them in 2021 in the group of the ten largest tax havens. In 2023, the UAE's legal system fell under international scrutiny, as the members of the British Parliament opened an inquiry into how the foreign business executives are treated in the country, in case of accusations of breaking the law.\n2024 will be the third consecutive year that the UAE holds first place as the world's leading wealth magnet, as 6,700 wealthy migrants are set to move to the country.\nVAT.\nThe UAE government implemented value-added tax (VAT) in the country from 1 January 2018, at a standard rate of 5%.\nWhile the government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.\nEnergy.\nOil and gas production is an important part of the economy of the UAE. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The UAE leadership initiated economic diversification efforts even before the oil price crash in the 1980s, resulting in the UAE having the most diversified economy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region at present. Although the oil and gas sector continues to be significant to the UAE economy, these efforts have yielded great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. The introduction of the VAT has provided the government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion United Arab Emirates dirham (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total government revenue.\nThe Barakah nuclear power plant is the first on the Arabian peninsula and expected to reduce the carbon footprint of the country.\nThe UAE has solar generation potential, and its energy policy has shifted due to the declining price of solar. The Dubai Clean Energy Strategy aims to provide 7 per cent of Dubai's energy from clean energy sources by 2020. It will increase this target to 25 per cent by 2030 and 75 per cent by 2050.\nIn 2023, ADNOC and its CEO Sultan Al Jaber closed at least 20 business deals worth nearly $100 billion. The state oil firm was alleged of exploiting the UAE's COP28 presidency to pursue oil and gas deals. As per leaked documents, Al Jaber's team targeted 16 nations to lobby firms, delegates or ministers on such deals. ADNOC sought deals with companies from 12 countries, which included 11 of the 16 target nations. Al Jaber and senior ADNOC officials openly discussed deals. COP28 organising teams were excluded from meetings and replaced by ADNOC officials, leaving a closed group that made deals.\nTourism.\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy. Dubai is the top tourism destination in the Middle East. According to the annual MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index, Dubai is the fifth most popular tourism destination in the world. Dubai holds up to 66% share of the UAE's tourism economy, with Abu Dhabi having 16% and Sharjah 10%. Dubai welcomed 10 million tourists in 2013.\nThe UAE has the most advanced and developed infrastructure in the region. Since the 1980s, the UAE has been spending billions of dollars on infrastructure. These developments are particularly evident in the larger emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The northern emirates are rapidly following suit, providing major incentives for developers of residential and commercial property.\nThe inbound tourism expenditure in the UAE for 2019 accounted for 118.6 per cent share of the outbound tourism expenditure. Since 6 January 2020, tourist visas to the United Arab Emirates are valid for five years. It has been projected that the travel and tourism industry will contribute about 280.6 billion United Arab Emirati dirham to the UAE's GDP by 2028.\nThe country's major tourist attraction includes the famous Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the tallest tower in the world; The World archipelago and Palm Jumeirah also in Dubai; Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi; Al Hajar Mountains in Fujairah. The uniqueness of the country's natural desert life, especially with the Bedouins, also facilitates the country's tourist industry.\nThe UAE will diversify its tourism sector with the introduction of casino gambling. Wynn Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah will feature the first casino in the country and will also be the country's first integrated resort when it opens in March 2027.\nAbu Dhabi is set to become the home of Disneyland Abu Dhabi, the first Disney theme park in the Middle East.\nTransport.\nDubai International Airport became the busiest airport in the world by international passenger traffic in 2014, overtaking London Heathrow. Abu Dhabi International Airport is the second-largest airport in the UAE. Due to the announced expansion of Al Maktoum Airport on 28 April 2024, Dubai International Airport will be shut down once Al Maktoum Airport expansion will be completed.\nAbu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Ras Al Khaimah are connected by the E11 highway, which is the longest road in the UAE. In Dubai, in addition to the Dubai Metro, The Dubai Tram and Palm Jumeirah Monorail also connect specific parts of the city. There is also a bus, taxi, abra (traditional boat), and water taxi network run by RTA. T1, a double-decker tram system in Downtown Dubai, were operational from 2015 to 2019.\nSalik, meaning \"open\" or \"clear\", is Dubai's electronic toll collection system that was launched in July 2007 and is part of Dubai's traffic congestion management system. Each time one passes through a Salik tolling point, a toll is deducted from the drivers' prepaid toll account using advanced Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. There are four Salik tolling points placed in strategic locations in Dubai: at Al Maktoum Bridge, Al Garhoud Bridge, and along Sheikh Zayed Road at Al Safa and Al Barsha.\nA country-wide railway is under construction which will connect all the major cities and ports. The Dubai Metro is the first urban train network in the Arabian Peninsula.\nThe major ports of the United Arab Emirates are Khalifa Port, Zayed Port, Port Jebel Ali, Port Rashid, Port Khalid, Port Saeed, and Port Khor Fakkan. The Emirates are increasingly developing their logistics and ports in order to participate in trade between Europe and China or Africa. For this purpose, ports are being rapidly expanded and investments are being made in their technology.\nThe Emirates have historically been and currently still are part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region and the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the North Sea.\nTelecommunications.\nThe United Arab Emirates is served by two telecommunications operators, Etisalat and Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (\"du\"). Etisalat operated a monopoly until du launched mobile services in February 2007. Internet subscribers were expected to increase from 0.904 million in 2007 to 2.66 million in 2012. The regulator, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, mandates filtering websites for religious, political, and sexual content.\n5G wireless services were installed nationwide in 2019 through a partnership with Huawei.\nDemographics.\nAccording to an estimate by the World Bank, the UAE's population in 2020 was 9,890,400. Immigrants accounted for 88.52% while Emiratis made up the remaining 11.48%. This unique imbalance is due to the country's exceptionally high net migration rate of 21.71, the world's highest. UAE citizenship is very difficult to obtain other than by filiation and only granted under very special circumstances.\nThe UAE is ethnically diverse. The five most populous nationalities in the emirates of Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman are Indian (25%), Pakistani (12%), Emirati (9%), Bangladeshi (7%), and Filipino (5%). Immigrants from Europe, Australia, and North America make up around 100,000 of the population. The rest of the population are from other Arab states.\nAbout 88% of the population of the United Arab Emirates is urban. The average life expectancy was 76.7 in 2012, higher than for any other Arab country. With a male/female sex ratio of 2.2 males for each female in the total population and 2.75 to 1 for the 15\u201365 age group, the UAE's gender imbalance is second highest in the world after Qatar.\nLargest cities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLanguage.\nModern Standard Arabic is the national language of the United Arab Emirates. English is the most commonly spoken language, following British English conventions. Emirati Arabic, a variety of Gulf Arabic, is spoken natively by Emirati people.\nReligion.\nIslam is the largest and the official state religion of the United Arab Emirates. The government follows a policy of tolerance toward other religions and rarely interferes in the religious activities of non-Muslims.\nThere are more Sunni than Shia Muslims in the United Arab Emirates, and 85% of the Emirati population are Sunni Muslims with most of them adhering to the Maliki school of jurisprudence. The vast majority of the remainder 15% are Shia Muslims, who are concentrated in the Emirates of Dubai and Sharjah. Although no official statistics are available for the breakdown between Sunni and Shia Muslims among noncitizen residents, media estimates suggest less than 20% of the noncitizen Muslim population are Shia. The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi is the largest mosque in the country and a major tourist attraction. Ibadi is common among Omanis in the UAE, while Sufi influences exist as well.\nChristians account for 9% of the total population of the United Arab Emirates, according to the 2005 census; estimates in 2010 suggested a figure of 12.6%. Roman Catholics and Protestants form significant proportions of the Christian minority. The country has over 52 churches in 2023. Many Christians in the United Arab Emirates are of Asian, African, and European origin, along with fellow Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt. The United Arab Emirates forms part of the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia and the Vicar Apostolic Bishop Paul Hinder is based in Abu Dhabi.\nThere is a small Jewish community in the United Arab Emirates. Before 2023, there was only one known synagogue in Dubai, which has been open since 2008 and the synagogue also welcomes visitors. Another synagogue, Moses Ben Maimon Synagogue, was completed in 2023 as part of the Abrahamic Family House complex in Abu Dhabi. As of 2019, according to Rabbi Marc Schneier of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, it is estimated that there are about 150 families to 3,000 Jews who live and worship freely in the UAE.\nSouth Asians in the United Arab Emirates constitute the largest ethnic group in the country. Over 2 million Indian migrants (mostly from the southern states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Coastal Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu) are estimated to be living in the UAE. There are currently three Hindu temples in the country. Other religions also exist in the United Arab Emirates, including Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Judaism, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, and Druze.\nThe UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, Abdullah bin Zayed, announced in 2019 the design and construction plan of the Abrahamic Family House, which will serve as an interfaith complex that houses a synagogue, mosque, and a church on Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi.\nEducation.\nThe education system through secondary level is administered by the Ministry of Education in all emirates except Abu Dhabi, where it falls under the authority of the Department of Education and Knowledge. Public schools are divided into primary schools, middle schools, and high schools. The public schools are government-funded and the curriculum is created to match the United Arab Emirates' development goals. The medium of instruction in the public school is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language. There are also many private schools which are internationally accredited. Public schools in the country are free for citizens of the UAE, while the fees for private schools vary.\nThe higher education system is monitored by the Ministry of Higher Education. The ministry also is responsible for admitting students to its undergraduate institutions. The adult literacy rate in 2015 was 93.8%.\nThe UAE has shown a strong interest in improving education and research. Enterprises include the establishment of the CERT Research Centres and the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology and Institute for Enterprise Development. According to the QS Rankings, the top-ranking universities in the country are the United Arab Emirates University (421\u2013430th worldwide), Khalifa University (441\u2013450th worldwide), the American University of Sharjah (431\u2013440th), and University of Sharjah (551\u2013600th worldwide). United Arab Emirates was ranked 33rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, up from 36th in 2019.\nHealth.\nThe life expectancy at birth in the UAE is at 76.96 years. Cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of death in the UAE, constituting 28% of total deaths; other major causes are accidents and injuries, malignancies, and congenital anomalies. According to World Health Organization data from 2016, 34.5% of adults in the UAE are clinically obese, with a body mass index (BMI) score of 30 or more.\nIn February 2008, the Ministry of Health unveiled a five-year health strategy for the public health sector in the northern emirates, which fall under its purview and which, unlike Abu Dhabi and Dubai, do not have separate healthcare authorities. The strategy focuses on unifying healthcare policy and improving access to healthcare services at reasonable cost, at the same time reducing dependence on overseas treatment. The ministry plans to add three hospitals to the current 14, and 29 primary healthcare centres to the current 86. Nine were scheduled to open in 2008.\nThe introduction of mandatory health insurance in Abu Dhabi for expatriates and their dependents was a major driver in reform of healthcare policy. Abu Dhabi nationals were brought under the scheme from 1 June 2008 and Dubai followed for its government employees. Eventually, under federal law, every Emirati and expatriate in the country will be covered by compulsory health insurance under a unified mandatory scheme.\nThe country has benefited from medical tourists from all over the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf. The UAE attracts medical tourists seeking cosmetic surgery and advanced procedures, cardiac and spinal surgery, and dental treatment, as health services have higher standards than other Arab countries in the Persian Gulf.\nCulture.\nEmirati culture is based on Arabian culture and has been influenced by the cultures of Persia, India, and East Africa. Arabian and Arabian inspired architecture is part of the expression of the local Emirati identity. Arabian influence on Emirati culture is noticeably visible in traditional Emirati architecture and folk arts. For example, the distinctive wind tower that tops traditional Emirati buildings, the \"barjeel\", has become an identifying mark of Emirati architecture and is attributed to Arabian influence. This influence is derived both from traders who fled the tax regime in Persia in the early 19th century and from Emirati ownership of ports on the Arabian coast, for instance the Al Qassimi port of Lingeh. \nMajor holidays in the United Arab Emirates include \"Eid al Fitr\", which marks the end of \"Ramadan\", and National Day (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates. \nLiterature and other written works by modern Emiratis are not well known globally because the majority of writers in country do not publish in English, women are restricted from participating in traditional literary groups, and freedom of expression is surpessed. The earliest known poet in the UAE is Ibn Majid, born between 1432 and 1437 in Ras Al-Khaimah. The most famous Emirati writers were Mubarak Al Oqaili (1880\u20131954), Salem bin Ali al Owais (1887\u20131959), and Ahmed bin Sulayem (1905\u20131976). Three other poets from Sharjah, known as the Hirah group, are observed to have been heavily influenced by the Apollo and Romantic poets. The Sharjah International Book Fair is the oldest and largest in the country. \nTraditional folk dances, such as \"Al-Ayyala\", are performed by men and women in the UAE during festivals, holidays, and weddings. Liwa is a type of music and dance performed locally, mainly in communities that contain descendants of Bantu peoples from the African Great Lakes region. \nThe list of museums in the United Arab Emirates includes some of regional repute, most famously Sharjah with its Heritage District containing 17 museums, which in 1998 was the Cultural Capital of the Arab World. In Dubai, the area of Al Quoz has attracted a number of art galleries as well as museums such as the Salsali Private Museum. Abu Dhabi has established a culture district on Saadiyat Island. Six grand projects are planned, including the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and the Louvre Abu Dhabi. Dubai also plans to build a Kunsthal museum and a district for galleries and artists. There are very few cinemas of the United Arab Emirates, and any published material is subject to strict censorship guidelines, despite a repeal of the harshest guidelines in 2021. To view a movie in the country you must be 21 years old. \nMedia.\nThe UAE's media is annually classified as \"not free\" in the Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House. The UAE ranks poorly in the annual Press Freedom Index by Reporters without Borders. Dubai Media City is the UAE's main media zone. The UAE is home to some pan-Arab broadcasters, including the Middle East Broadcasting Centre and Orbit Showtime Network. In 2007, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum decreed that journalists can no longer be prosecuted or imprisoned for reasons relating to their work. At the same time, the UAE has made it illegal to disseminate online material that can threaten \"public order\", and hands down prison terms for those who \"deride or damage\" the reputation of the state and \"display contempt\" for religion. Journalists who are arrested for violating this law are often brutally beaten by the police.\nAccording to UAE Year Book 2013, there are seven Arabic newspapers and eight English language newspapers, as well as a Tagalog newspaper produced and published in the UAE.\nNew media, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram are used widely in the UAE by the government entities and by the public as well. The UAE government avails official social media accounts to communicate with public and hear their needs.\nIn recent years, there has been a notable surge in digital media consumption in the UAE, driven by the widespread use of platforms like Snapchat and TikTok among the younger population. \u00a0Influencers on these platforms play a significant role in shaping trends and promoting various products and services.\u00a0The government has also implemented digital initiatives to enhance e-Government services and promote smart city concepts, further demonstrating the UAE's commitment to technological advancements.\nCuisine.\nThe traditional food of the Emirates has always been rice, fish, and meat. The people of the United Arab Emirates have adopted most of their foods from other West and South Asian countries including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, and India. Seafood has been the mainstay of the Emirati diet for centuries. Meat and rice are other staple foods, with lamb and mutton preferred to goat and beef. Popular beverages are coffee and tea, which can be complemented with cardamom or saffron to give them a distinctive flavour.\nPopular cultural Emirati dishes include \"threed\", \"machboos\", \"khubisa\", \"khameer\", and \"chabab\" bread among others while lugaimat is a famous Emirati dessert.\nWith the influence of western culture, fast food has become very popular among young people, to the extent that campaigns have been held to highlight the dangers of fast food excesses. Alcohol is allowed to be served only in hotel restaurants and bars. All nightclubs are permitted to sell alcohol. Specific supermarkets may sell alcohol, but these products are sold in separate sections. Likewise, pork, which is haram (not permitted for Muslims), is sold in separate sections in all major supermarkets. Although alcohol may be consumed, it is illegal to be intoxicated in public or drive a motor vehicle with any trace of alcohol in the blood.\nSports.\nFormula One is particularly popular in the United Arab Emirates, and a Grand Prix is annually held at the Yas Marina Circuit in Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. The race takes place in the evening, and was the first ever Grand Prix to start in daylight and finish at night. Other popular sports include camel racing, falconry, endurance riding, and tennis. The emirate of Dubai is also home to two major golf courses: the Dubai Golf Club and Emirates Golf Club.\nAside from the leisure aspect, sports can play an important part in shaping national identity. Falconry, for example, has functioned as a national symbol since its inception in 1971. Aside from the national prevalence of falconry, the UAE have played a formative role internationally in the co-ordination of UNESCO's recognition of falconry as intangible heritage.\nIn the past, child camel jockeys were used, leading to widespread criticism. Eventually, the UAE passed laws banning the use of children for the sport, leading to the prompt removal of almost all child jockeys. Recently robot jockeys have been introduced to overcome the problem of child camel jockeys which was an issue of human rights violations. Ansar Burney is often praised for the work he has done in this area.\nFootball.\nFootball is a popular sport in the UAE. Al Nasr, Al Ain, Al Wasl, Sharjah, Al Wahda, and Shabab Al Ahli are the most popular teams and enjoy the reputation of long-time regional champions. The United Arab Emirates Football Association was established in 1971 and since then has dedicated its time and effort to promoting the game, organising youth programmes, and improving the abilities of not only its players, but also the officials and coaches involved with its regional teams. The UAE qualified for the FIFA World Cup in 1990, along with Egypt. It was the third consecutive World Cup with two Arab nations qualifying, after Kuwait and Algeria in 1982, and Iraq and Algeria again in 1986. The UAE has won the Gulf Cup Championship twice: the first cup won in January 2007 held in Abu Dhabi and the second in January 2013, held in Bahrain. The country hosted the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. The UAE team went all the way to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by the eventual champions, Qatar.\nCricket.\nCricket is one of the most popular sports in the UAE, largely because of the expatriate population from the SAARC countries, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The headquarters of the International Cricket Council (ICC) have been located in the Dubai Sports City complex since 2005, including the ICC Academy which was established in 2009. There are a number of international cricket venues in the UAE, which are frequently used for international tournaments and \"neutral\" bilateral series due to the local climate and Dubai's status as a transport hub. Notable international tournaments hosted by the UAE have included the 2014 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, and three editions of the Asia Cup (1984, 1995, and 2018). Notable grounds include the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in Sharjah, Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi, and Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai.\nThe Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) became a member of the ICC in 1990. The UAE national cricket team has qualified for the Cricket World Cup on two occasions (1996 and 2015) and the ICC Men's T20 World Cup on two occasions (2014 and 2022). The national women's team is similarly one of the strongest associate teams in Asia, notably participating in the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier.\nFollowing the 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team, the UAE served as the \"de facto\" home of the Pakistan national cricket team for nearly a decade, as well as hosting the Pakistan Super League. The UAE has also hosted one full edition of Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2020 and two partial editions of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2014 and 2021.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was the mother of Armoni and Mephibosheth (; ).\nAfter the death of Saul, according to the Bible, Abner was implicitly accused of having aspirations to the throne by taking Rizpah as his wife, resulting in a quarrel between him and Saul's son and successor, Ishbosheth. () The quarrel led to Abner's defection to David, () who was then king of the breakaway Kingdom of Judah. This incident led to the downfall of Ishbosheth and the rise of David as king of a reunited Kingdom of Israel.\nA famine lasting three years hit Israel during the earlier half of David's reign at Jerusalem. God revealed that this calamity happened because of \"Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.\" The Gibeonites were not Israelites, but the remnant of the Amorites, which Saul pursued from within Israel. David inquired of the Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the death of seven of Saul's sons.()\nDavid accordingly delivered up to them the two sons of Rizpah and five of the sons of Michal (according to the Masoretic Text; the Septuagint has \"Merab\"), Saul's daughter. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung up their bodies at the sanctuary at Gibeah (). Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah, and for five months watched the suspended bodies of her children, to prevent them from being devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, () till they were at length taken down and buried by David () in the family grave at Zelah with the bones of Saul and Jonathan. Only once both restitution had been made for Saul's betrayal of the Gibeonites and an olive branch extended to Rizpah and the house of Saul by giving Saul's sons the honour of burial with their father did God respond to the plea of the land and end the famine (https://).\nBritish rabbi Jonathan Magonet has described Rizpah as \"every mother who sees her sons killed before their time for reasons of state, be they in time of peace or in war. All that remains is for her to preserve the dignity of their memory and live on to bear witness and call to account the rulers of the world\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}

It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea (a part of Pacific Ocean) to the north. With a population of 156.9\u00a0million people (including Madura) in mid 2024, projected to have risen to 158\u00a0million by mid-2025, Java is the world's most populous island, home to approximately 56% of the Indonesian population while constituting only 7% of its land area. Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast.\nMany of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically, and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site.\nJava was formed by volcanic eruptions due to geologic subduction of the Australian Plate under the Sunda Plate. It is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass, at about (including Madura's ). A chain of volcanic mountains is the east\u2013west spine of the island.\nFour main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, and Betawi. Javanese and Sundanese are the most spoken. The ethnic groups native to the island are the Javanese in the central and eastern parts and Sundanese in the western parts. The Madurese in the Eastern salient of Java are migrants from Madura Island (which is part of East Java Province in administrative terms), while the Betawi in the capital city of Jakarta are hybrids from various ethnic groups in Indonesia. Most residents are bilingual, speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as their first or second language. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java's population comprises people of diverse religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.\nJava is divided into four administrative provinces: Banten, West Java, Central Java, and East Java, and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.\nEtymology.\nThe origins of the name \"Java\" are not clear. Java could possibly have been named after the \"j\u00e1wa-wut\" (foxtail millet) plant, which was said to be common in Java during the time, and that prior to Indianization of the island had different names.\nThe famous Indian epic, the \"R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a\", mentions an island called \"Yavadvipa\"\u2014the chief of the eponymous hero Rama's army, Sugriva, leads his troops of \"vanara\" humanoid apemen to Yavadvipa in search of Rama's kidnapped consort Sita. Java was hence referred to in India by the Sanskrit name , with meaning \"island\" and meaning \"barley\", a plant for which the island was famous.\nJava is also mentioned in the ancient Tamil epic \"Ma\u1e47im\u0113kalai\" by the poet Satthanar, which states that Java had a kingdom with a capital called \"Nagapuram\".\nAnother possible source for Java's name is the word \"ja\u00fa\", variations of which mean \"beyond\" or \"distant\".\nYet aother possibility is that the word \"Java\" comes from Proto-Austronesian \"awa\" or \"yawa\", meaning \"home\". This is similar to the words \"awa\u02bbi\" (\"awaiki\") or \"hawa\u02bbi\" (\"hawaiki\") used in Polynesia, especially in Hawai\u02bbi.\nAn island called or is also mentioned in Ptolemy's 150 AD \"Geographia\", composed during the height of the Roman Empire. , the \"island of barley\", was also said to be rich in gold, and to have a silver city called \"Argyra\" located at its western end.\nThe late 5th century Chinese historical text \"Book of Song\" and the 7th century \"Book of Liang\" referred to Java as (). Chinese texts also reference an Indianized kingdom on Java's northern cost known as () from 640\u2013818 AD. The island was referred to as () until the Yuan Dynasty (1271\u20131368), whereupon it began to be called (), the present-day name in Mandarin Chinese. In his 1451 book \"Yingya Shenglan\" (\"The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores\"), Chinese explorer Ma Huan, who accompanied the famous Admiral Zheng He on three of his Ming treasure voyages, noted that the Chinese referred to Java as (), and that it had previously been called (). \nWhen 14th century Italian traveler Giovanni de' Marignolli returned to Europe from Asia, he claimed to have stopped at a land called \"Saba\" for several months, which he said had many elephants and was led by a queen, possibly Queen Gitarja (r. 1328\u20131350); this name \"Saba\" might have been his interpretation of .xii, 192\u2013194\n9th century Persian merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir mentioned two notable islands which separated the Arabian Peninsula from China: one was the 800-farsakh long (Sumatra), and the other was the 400-farsakh long \"az-Zabaj\" (; ), identified as Java.\n15th century Russian merchant Afanasy Nikitin, one of the first Europeans to visit India, traveled to India in 1466 and described the land of Java, which he called ().\nGeography.\nJava lies between Sumatra to the west and Bali to the east. Borneo lies to the north, and Christmas Island is to the south. It is the world's 13th largest island. Java is surrounded by the Java Sea to the north, the Sunda Strait to the west, the Indian Ocean to the south and Bali Strait and Madura Strait in the east.\nJava is almost entirely of volcanic origin; it contains 38 mountains forming an east\u2013west spine that have at one time or another been active volcanoes. There are 112 volcanoes in all, 35 of which are active. The highest volcano in Java is Mount Semeru, . The most active volcano in Java and also in Indonesia is Mount Merapi, . In total, Java has more than 150 mountains.\nJava's mountains and highlands split the interior into a series of relatively isolated regions suitable for wet-rice cultivation; the rice lands of Java are among the richest in the world. Java was the first place where Indonesian coffee was grown, starting in 1699. Today, coffea arabica is grown on the Ijen Plateau by small-holders and larger plantations.\nThe area of Java is about (including Madura's and minor offshore islands). It is about long and up to wide. The island's longest river is the 600\u00a0km long Solo River. The river rises from its source in central Java at the Lawu volcano, then flows north and eastward to its mouth in the Java Sea near the city of Surabaya. Other major rivers are Brantas, Citarum, Cimanuk and Serayu.\nThe average temperature ranges from to ; average humidity is 75%. The northern coastal plains are normally hotter, averaging during the day in the dry season. The south coast is generally cooler than the north, and highland areas inland are even cooler. The wet season begins in November and ends in April. During that rain falls mostly in the afternoons and intermittently during other parts of the year. The wettest months are January and February.\nWest Java is wetter than East Java, and mountainous regions receive much higher rainfall. The Parahyangan highlands of West Java receive over annually, while the north coast of East Java receives annually.\nNatural environment.\nJava is an island with a large amount of biodiversity. The natural environment of Java is tropical rainforest, with ecosystems ranging from coastal mangrove forest on the north coast, rocky coastal cliffs on the southern coast, and low-lying tropical forest to high altitude rainforest on the slopes of mountainous volcanic regions in the interior. The Javan environment and climate gradually alters from west to east; from wet and humid dense rainforest in western parts, to a dry savanna environment in the east, corresponding to the climate and rainfall in these regions.\nJavan wildlife originally supported a rich biodiversity, where numbers of endemic species of flora and fauna flourished; such as the Javan rhinoceros, Javan banteng, Javan warty pig, Javan silvery gibbon, Javan lutung, Java mouse-deer, Javan rusa, and Javan leopard. With over 450 bird species and 37 endemic species including the Javan green magpie, Java sparrow, Javan hawk-eagle, and Javan peafowl, Java is a birdwatcher's paradise. There are about 130 freshwater fish species in Java. There are also several endemic amphibian species in Java, including 5 species of tree frogs.\nSince ancient times, people have opened the rainforest, altered the ecosystem, shaped the landscapes and created rice paddy and terraces to support the growing population. Javan rice terraces have existed for more than a millennium and had supported ancient agricultural kingdoms. The growing human population has put severe pressure on Java's wildlife, as rainforests were diminished and confined to highland slopes or isolated peninsulas. Some of Java's endemic species are now critically endangered, with some already extinct; Java used to have Javan tigers and Javan elephants, but both have been rendered extinct. Today, several national parks exist in Java that protect the remnants of its fragile wildlife, such as Ujung Kulon, Mount Halimun-Salak, Gede Pangrango, Baluran, Meru Betiri, Bromo Tengger Semeru and Alas Purwo.\nHistory.\n\"Homo erectus\" presence.\nFossilised remains of \"Homo erectus\", popularly known as the \"Java Man\", dating back 1.3\u00a0million years were found along the banks of the Bengawan Solo River.\n\"H. erectus\" arrived in Eurasia approximately 1.8 million years ago, in an event considered to be the first African exodus. There is evidence that the Java population of \"H. erectus\" lived in an ever-wet forest habitat. More specifically the environment resembled a savannah, but was likely regularly inundated (\"hydromorphic savanna\"). The plants found at the Trinil excavation site included grass (Poaceae), ferns, \"Ficus\", and \"Indigofera\", which are typical of lowland rainforest.\n\"H.\u00a0e.\u00a0soloensis\" was the last population of a long occupation history of the island of Java by \"H.\u00a0erectus\", beginning 1.51 to 0.93 million years ago at the Sangiran site, continuing 540 to 430 thousand years ago at the Trinil site, and finally 117 to 108 thousand years ago at Ngandong. If the date is correct for Solo Man, then they would represent a terminal population of \"H.\u00a0erectus\" which sheltered in the last open-habitat refuges of East Asia before the rainforest takeover. Before the immigration of modern humans, Late Pleistocene Southeast Asia was also home to \"H.\u00a0floresiensis\" endemic to the island of Flores, Indonesia, and \"H.\u00a0luzonensis\" endemic to the island of Luzon, the Philippines. Genetic analysis of present-day Southeast Asian populations indicates the widespread dispersal of the Denisovans (a species currently recognisable only by their genetic signature) across Southeast Asia, whereupon they interbred with immigrating modern humans 45.7 and 29.8 thousand years ago. A 2021 genomic study indicates that, aside from the Denisovans, modern humans never interbred with any of these endemic human species, unless the offspring were unviable or the hybrid lineages have since died out.\nJudging by the sheer number of specimens deposited at Ngandong at the same time, there may have been a sizeable population of \"H.\u00a0e\u00a0soloensis\" before the volcanic eruption which resulted in their interment, but population is difficult to approximate with certainty. This site is quite far from the north coast of Java Island, and it is not always easy to determine the position of the coastline in prehistoric times because of significant geographical changes.\nThe southern coastline and estuary of the Bengawan Solo River at that time may have been different from what it is today, due to geological factors such as sedimentation, erosion, and changes in sea level over time. Currently, the estuary of the Bengawan Solo is in the Java Sea, but in prehistoric times, the river flow and estuary location may have changed. Geological and paleogeographic studies are often used to understand these changes.\nAfter the arrival of modern humans.\nThe island's exceptional fertility and rainfall allowed the development of wet-field rice cultivation, which required sophisticated levels of cooperation between villages. Out of these village alliances, small kingdoms developed. The chain of volcanic mountains and associated highlands running the length of Java kept its interior regions and peoples separate and relatively isolated. Before the advent of Islamic states and European colonialism, the rivers provided the main means of communication, although Java's many rivers are mostly short. Only the Brantas river and Solo river could provide long-distance communication and this way their valleys supported the centers of major kingdoms. A system of roads, permanent bridges, and toll gates is thought to have been established in Java by at least the mid-17th century. Local powers could disrupt the routes as could the wet season and road use was highly dependent on constant maintenance. Consequently, communication between Java's population was difficult.\nThe emergence of civilization on the island of Java is often associated with the arrival of Aji Saka in 78 AD. Although Aji Saka is said to be the bearer of civilization on Java, the story received several objections and rebuttals from other historical sources. Valmiki's Ramayana, made around 500 BC, records that Java already had a governmental organization long before the story:\"Yawadwipa is decorated with seven kingdoms, gold and silver islands, rich in gold mines, and there is Cicira (cold) Mountain that touches the sky with its peak.\"6\nThe Greek geographer Ptolemy called the island Iabadius or Sabadius (). Ptolemy said that the name meant the \"Island of Barley\" and produced a lot of grain and gold, adding that its metropolis was Argyre (\u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u1fc6) meaning silver in Greek.\nAccording to Chinese record \"M\u00edng Sh\u01d0\", the Javanese kingdom was founded in 65 BC, or 143 years before the story of Aji Saka began.39\nThe story of Aji Saka is a Neo Javanese story. This story has not yet been found to be relevant in the Old Javanese text. This story tells of events in the Medang Kamulan kingdom in Java in the past. At that time, the king of Medang Kamulan Prabu Dewata Cengkar was replaced by Aji Saka. This story is considered as an allegory of the entry of Indians into Java. Referring to the Liang dynasty information, the Javanese kingdom was divided into two: the pre-Hinduism kingdom and the post-Hindu kingdom, which began in 78 AD.5 and 7\nHindu\u2013Buddhist kingdoms era.\nThe Taruma kingdom of western Java existed from the 5th to the 7th centuries, while the Heling kingdom sent embassies to China starting in 640. However, the first major principality was the Mataram kingdom that was founded in central Java at the beginning of the 8th century. Mataram's religion centered on the Hindu god Shiva, and the kingdom produced some of Java's earliest Hindu temples on the Dieng Plateau. Around the 8th century, the Sailendra dynasty rose in Kedu Plain and become the patron of Mahayana Buddhism. This ancient kingdom built monuments such as the 9th century Borobudur and Prambanan in central Java.\nAround the 10th century, the center of power shifted from central to eastern Java. The eastern Javanese kingdoms of Kediri, Singhasari and Majapahit were mainly dependent on rice agriculture, yet also pursued trade within the Indonesian archipelago, and with China and India. Majapahit was established by Wijaya, and by the end of the reign of Hayam Wuruk (r. 1350\u201389) it claimed sovereignty over the entire Indonesian archipelago, although control was likely limited to Java, Bali, and Madura. Hayam Wuruk's prime minister, Gajah Mada, led many of the kingdom's territorial conquests. Previous Javanese kingdoms had their power based on agriculture, however, Majapahit took control of ports and shipping lanes and became Java's first commercial empire. With the death of Hayam Wuruk and the coming of Islam to Indonesia, Majapahit went into decline.\nSpread of Islam and rise of Islamic sultanates.\nIslam became the dominant religion in Java at the end of the 16th century. During this era, the Islamic kingdoms of Demak, Cirebon, and Banten were ascendant. The Mataram Sultanate became the dominant power of central and eastern Java at the end of the 16th century. The principalities of Surabaya and Cirebon were eventually subjugated such that only Mataram and Banten were left to face the Dutch in the 17th century.\nJava\u2019s Islamic tradition is known for its tolerance and harmony among faiths. Local religious organizations actively promote peace and inclusivity, reflecting broader values of coexistence in Indonesian society. \nColonial periods.\nJava's contact with the European colonial powers began in 1522 with a treaty between the Sunda kingdom and the Portuguese in Malacca. After its failure, the Portuguese presence was confined to Malacca and to the eastern islands.\nIn 1596, a four-ship expedition led by Cornelis de Houtman was the first Dutch contact with Indonesia. By the end of the 18th century the Dutch had extended their influence over the sultanates of the interior through the Dutch East India Company in Indonesia. Internal conflict prevented the Javanese from forming effective alliances against the Dutch. Remnants of the Mataram survived as the Surakarta (Solo) and Yogyakarta principalities. Javanese kings claimed to rule with divine authority and the Dutch helped them to preserve remnants of a Javanese aristocracy by confirming them as regents or district officials within the colonial administration.\nJava's major role during the early part of the colonial period was as a producer of rice. In spice-producing islands like Banda, rice was regularly imported from Java, to supply the deficiency in means of subsistence.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the Netherlands fell to France, as did its colony in the East Indies. During the short-lived Daendels administration, as French proxy rule on Java, the construction of the Great Post Road was commenced in 1808. The road, spanning from Anyer in Western Java to Panarukan in East Java, served as a military supply route and was used in defending Java from British invasion. In 1811, Java was captured by the British, becoming a possession of the British Empire, and Sir Stamford Raffles was appointed as the island's governor. In 1816, under the governorship of John Fendall, Java was returned to the Dutch as per the terms of the Treaty of Paris.\nIn 1815, there may have been five million people in Java. In the second half of the 18th century, population spurts began in districts along the north-central coast of Java, and in the 19th century population grew rapidly across the island. Factors for the great population growth include the impact of Dutch colonial rule including the imposed end to civil war in Java, the increase in the area under rice cultivation, and the introduction of food plants such as cassava and maize that could sustain populations that could not afford rice. Others attribute the growth to the taxation burdens and increased expansion of employment under the Cultivation System to which couples responded by having more children in the hope of increasing their families\u2019 ability to pay tax and buy goods. Cholera claimed 100,000 lives in Java in 1820.\nThe advent of trucks and railways where there had previously only been buffalo and carts, telegraph systems, and more coordinated distribution systems under the colonial government all contributed to famine elimination in Java, and in turn, population growth. There were no significant famines in Java from the 1840s through to the Japanese occupation in the 1940s. However, other sources claimed the Dutch's Cultivation system is linked to famines and epidemics in the 1840s, firstly in Cirebon and then Central Java, as cash crops such as indigo and sugar had to be grown instead of rice.\nIndependence.\nIndonesian nationalism first took hold in Java in the early 20th century, and the struggle to secure the country's independence following World War II was centered in Java. In 1949, Indonesian independence was recognized.\nAdministration.\nJava is divided into four provinces and two special regions:\n(1) including the neighbouring small archipelagos of the Kangean Islands (648.55\u00a0km2), the Sapudi Islands (167.41\u00a0km2), Talango Island (50.278\u00a0km2), Masalembu (40.85\u00a0km2), the Giligenteng Islands (30.32\u00a0km2) - all the foregoing within Sumenep Regency.\n&lt;br&gt;(2) Other offshore islands are included in this figure, but are comparatively very small in population and area; they include Nusa Barong (84.73\u00a0km2), Bawean (197.42\u00a0km2), Karimunjawa (78\u00a0km2), Nusa Kambangan (121\u00a0km2), Panaitan (170\u00a0km2), and the Thousand Islands (8.7\u00a0km2) \u2013 with a combined population of roughly 150,000 (of whom 85,320 are on Bawean, 28,809 are on the Thousand Islands, 16,200 on Nusa Barong and 10,800 on Karimunjawa).\n(3) Land area of provinces updated in mid 2024 regency/city annual statistics.\nDemographics.\nDemographic profile.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nJava has been traditionally dominated by an elite class, while the people in the lower classes were often involved in agriculture and fishing. The elite class in Java has evolved over the course of history, as cultural wave after cultural wave immigrated to the island. There is evidence that South Asian emigres were among this elite, as well as Arabian and Persian immigrants during the Islamic eras. More recently, Chinese immigrants have also become part of the economic elite of Java. Although politically the Chinese generally remain sidelined, there are notable exceptions, such as the former governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama. Java houses the majority of Indonesia's urban population. Currently, 65% of the island is urbanized. Unlike the rest of Java, the population growth in Central Java remains low. Central Java however has a younger population than the national average. The slow population growth can in part be attributed to the choice by many people to leave the more rural Central Java for better opportunities and higher incomes in the bigger cities. Java's population continues to rapidly increase despite many Javanese leaving the island. This is somewhat due to the fact that Java is the business, academic, and cultural hub of Indonesia, which attracts millions of non-Javanese people to its cities. The population growth is most intense in the regions surrounding Jakarta and Bandung, which is reflected through the demographic diversity in those areas.\nPopulation growth.\nJava is the most populous major island in the world and is home to 55% of Indonesia's population, with a combined population of 156.9\u00a0million according to the official estimates as at mid 2024 (including Madura's 4.16\u00a0million). At nearly 1,183.5 people per km2 in 2024, it is also one of the most densely populated parts of the world, on a par with Bangladesh. Every region of the island has numerous volcanoes, with the people left to share the remaining flatter land. Because of this, many coasts are heavily populated and cities ring around the valleys surrounding volcanic peaks.\nThe population growth rate more than doubled in economically depressed Central Java in the latest 2010\u20132020 period vs 2000\u20132010, indicative of migration or other issues; there were significant volcanic eruptions during the earlier period. Approximately 45% of the population of Indonesia is ethnically Javanese, while Sundanese make a large portion of Java's population as well.\nThe western third of the island (West Java, Banten, and DKI Jakarta) has an even higher population density, of roughly 1,563 per square kilometre and accounts for most of the population growth of Java. It is home to three metropolitan areas, Greater Jakarta (with outlying areas of Greater Serang and Greater Sukabumi), Greater Bandung, and Greater Cirebon.\nFrom the 1970s to the fall of the Suharto regime in 1998, the Indonesian government ran transmigration programs aimed at resettling the population of Java on other less populated islands of Indonesia. This program has met with mixed results, sometimes causing conflicts between the locals and the recently arrived settlers. Nevertheless, it has caused Java's share of the nation's population to progressively decline.\nJakarta and its outskirts, being the dominant metropolis, is also home to people from all over the nation. East Java is also home to ethnic Balinese, as well as large numbers of Madurans due to their historic poverty.\nEthnicity and culture.\nDespite its large population and in contrast to the other larger islands of Indonesia, Java is comparatively homogeneous in ethnic composition. Only two ethnic groups are native to the island\u2014the Javanese and Sundanese. A third group is the Madurese, who inhabit the island of Madura off the northeast coast of Java and have immigrated to East Java in large numbers since the 18th century. The Javanese comprise about two-thirds of the island's population while the Sundanese and Madurese account for 38% and 10% respectively. The fourth group is the Betawi people who speak a dialect of Malay. They are the descendants of the people living around Batavia from around the 17th century. Betawis are creole people, mostly descended from various Indonesian archipelago ethnic groups such as Malay, Sundanese, Javanese, Balinese, Minang, Bugis, Makassar, Ambonese, mixed with foreign ethnic groups such as Portuguese, Dutch, Arab, Chinese and Indian brought to or attracted to Batavia to meet labour needs. They have a culture and language distinct from the surrounding Sundanese and Javanese.\nThe Javanese prose text Tantu Pagelaran (c.\u200915th century) explained the mythical origin of the island and its volcanic nature.\nFour major cultural areas exist on the island: \nMadura makes up a fifth area having close cultural ties with coastal eastern Java.\nThe \"kejawen of Javanese\" culture is the island's most dominant. Java's remaining aristocracy is based here, and it is the region from where the majority of Indonesia's army, business, and political elite originate. Its language, arts, and etiquette are regarded as the island's most refined and exemplary. The territory from Banyumas in the west through to Blitar in the east encompasses Indonesia's most fertile and densely populated agricultural land.\"\"\nIn the southwestern part of Central Java, which is usually named the Banyumasan region, a cultural mingling occurred, bringing together Javanese culture and Sundanese culture to create the Banyumasan culture. In the central Javanese court cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, contemporary kings trace their lineages back to the pre-colonial Islamic kingdoms that ruled the region, making those places especially strong repositories of classical Javanese culture. Classic arts of Java include gamelan music and wayang puppet shows.\nJava was the site of many influential kingdoms in the Southeast Asian region, and as a result, many literary works have been written by Javanese authors. These include \"Ken Arok and Ken Dedes\", the story of the orphan who usurped his king, and married the queen of the ancient Javanese kingdom; and translations of \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\". Pramoedya Ananta Toer is a famous contemporary Indonesian author who has written many stories based on his own experiences of having grown up in Java and takes many elements from Javanese folklore and historical legends.\nLanguages.\nThe three major languages spoken on Java are Javanese, Sundanese and Madurese. Other languages spoken include Betawi (a Malay dialect local to the Jakarta region), Osing, Banyumasan, and Tenggerese (closely related to Javanese), Baduy and Bantenese (closely related to Sundanese), Kangeanese (closely related to Madurese), and Balinese. The vast majority of the population also speaks Indonesian, often as a second language.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHinduism was the main religion in Java before the arrival of Islam. Indian influences came first with Shaivism and Buddhism penetrating deeply into society, blending with indigenous tradition and culture. One conduit for this were the ascetics, called \"resi\", who taught mystical practices. A \"resi\" lived surrounded by students, who took care of their master's daily needs. Resi's authorities were merely ceremonial. At the courts, Brahmin clerics and \"pudjangga\" (sacred literati) legitimised rulers and linked Hindu cosmology to their political needs. Small Hindu enclaves are scattered throughout Java, but there is a large Hindu population along the eastern coast nearest Bali, especially around the town of Banyuwangi.\nThe coming of Islam, strengthened the status structure of this traditional religious pattern. More than 98 percent of the Muslims in Java are Sunnis with very minority being Shia and Ahmadis (respectively 1% and 0.2%), on a broad continuum between \"abangan\" (more syncretic) and \"santri\" (more orthodox). Muslim scholars (\"Kyai\") became the new religious elite as Hindu influences receded. Islam recognises no hierarchy of religious leaders nor a formal priesthood, but the Dutch colonial government established an elaborate rank order for mosque and other Islamic preaching schools. In Javanese \"pesantren\" (Islamic schools), the \"Kyai\" perpetuated the tradition of the \"resi\". Students around him provided his needs, even peasants around the school.\nPre-Islamic Javanese traditions have encouraged Islam in a mystical direction. There emerged in Java a loosely structured society of religious leadership, revolving around \"kyais\", possessing various degrees of proficiency in pre-Islamic and Islamic lore, belief and practice. The kyais are the principal intermediaries between the villages masses and the realm of the supernatural. However, this very looseneess of kyai leadership structure has promoted schism. There were often sharp divisions between orthodox kyais, who merely instructed in Islamic law, with those who taught mysticism and those who sought to reform Islam with modern scientific concepts. As a result, there is a division between \"santri\", who believe that they are more orthodox in their Islamic belief and practice, with \"abangan\", who have mixed pre-Islamic animistic and Hindu-Indian concepts with a superficial acceptance of Islamic belief.\nThere are also Christian communities, mostly in the larger cities, primarily among Chinese Indonesian and minority Javanese even some rural areas of south-central Java are strongly Roman Catholic. Buddhist communities also exist in the major cities, primarily among the Chinese Indonesian. The Indonesian constitution recognises six official religions.\nA wider effect of this division is the number of sects. In the middle of 1956, the Department of Religious Affairs in Yogyakarta reported 63 religious sects in Java other than the official Indonesian religions. Of these, 35 were in Central Java, 22 in West Java and six in East Java. These include Kejawen, Sumarah, Subud, etc. Their total membership is difficult to estimate as many of their adherents identify themselves with one of the official religions. Sunda Wiwitan is a traditional Sundanese religion, its adherents still exist in several villages.\nEconomy.\nInitially the economy of Java relied heavily on rice agriculture. Ancient kingdoms such as the Kingdoms of Sunda, Mataram, and Majapahit were dependent on rice yields and tax. Java was famous for rice surpluses and rice export since ancient times, and rice agriculture contributed to the population growth of the island. Trade with other parts of Asia such as ancient India and China flourished as early as the 4th century, as evidenced by Chinese ceramics found on the island dated to that period. Java also took part in the global trade of Maluku spice from ancient times in the Majapahit era, until well into the Dutch East India Company (VOC) era.\nThe VOC set their foothold on Batavia in the 17th century and was succeeded by the Dutch East Indies in the 19th century. During these colonial times, the Dutch introduced the cultivation of commercial plants in Java, such as sugarcane, rubber, coffee, tea, and quinine. In the 19th and early 20th century, Javanese coffee gained global popularity. Thus, the name \"Java\" today has become a synonym for coffee.\nJava has been Indonesia's most developed island since the Dutch East Indies era and continues to be so today in the modern Republic of Indonesia. The road transportation networks that have existed since ancient times were connected and perfected with the construction of Java Great Post Road by Daendels in the early 19th century. It became the backbone of Java's road infrastructure and laid the base of Java North Coast Road (). The need to transport commercial produces such as coffee from plantations in the interior of the island to the harbour on the coast spurred the construction of railway networks in Java. Today, industry, business, trade and services flourished in major cities of Java, such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, and Bandung; while some traditional Sultanate cities such as Yogyakarta, Surakarta, and Cirebon preserved its royal legacy and has become the centre of art, culture and tourism. Industrial estates are also growing in towns on northern coast of Java, especially around Cilegon, Tangerang, Bekasi, Karawang, Gresik and Sidoarjo. The toll road highway networks was built and expanded since the New Order until the present day, connecting major urban centres and surrounding areas, such as in and around Jakarta and Bandung; also the ones in Cirebon, Semarang and Surabaya. In addition to these motorways, Java has 16 national highways.\nBased on the statistical data by the year of 2021 released by Statistics Indonesia (\"Badan Pusat Statistik\"), Java alone contributes around 60% of Indonesia's GDP or equivalent to US$686\u00a0billion (int$2.0 trillion, PPP).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The waterfall is within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the European Geopark. The whole of the River Tees plunges over a precipice (an almost vertical cliff edge) in two stages. After heavy rainfall the river will also flow over the usually dry right-hand side channel, creating two falls. Very occasionally the river level will be high enough to flow over the central section of rock; the last recorded time this happened was in December 2015 after Storm Desmond. In harsh winters the falls have been known to freeze, creating cathedral-like ice formations.\nAccess to the northern bank is via a private footpath on the Raby estate for which a fee is charged. The southern bank can be reached free of charge via the Pennine Way public footpath which crosses the Moor House-Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve.\nGeology.\nHigh Force was formed where the River Tees crosses the Whin Sill \u2013 a hard layer of igneous rock (also seen at Hadrian's Wall and other locations). The waterfall itself consists of three different types of rock. The upper band is made up of whinstone, or dolerite, a hard igneous rock which the waterfall takes a lot of time to erode. The lower section is made up of Carboniferous Limestone, a softer rock which is more easily worn away by the waterfall. Between these two layers is a thinner layer of Carboniferous sandstone, which was baked hard when the Whin Sill was molten 295 million years ago. The wearing away of rock means that the waterfall is slowly moving upstream, leaving a narrow, deep gorge in front of it. The length of the gorge is currently about . The bed load (rocks that the river is carrying) is mainly composed of large boulders, which are rolled along the river bed. Upstream of the waterfall, the river is narrow; downstream, it widens and meanders.\nRelative height.\nDespite popular belief that it is the highest waterfall in England, at , others have a longer fall: Cautley Spout, in Cumbria's Howgill Fells, is almost high, and Hardraw Force, in North Yorkshire, has an unbroken drop of . Underground, on the flanks of Ingleborough, Fell Beck falls an unbroken down the Jib Tunnel of Gaping Gill Hole. However, High Force does have the largest volume of water falling over an unbroken drop when in full spate, thereby earning its Nordic name \"High Fosse\".\nIn popular culture.\nStock footage of the waterfalls was featured in the 1969 film \"Mackenna's Gold\". Although the story of the film is supposed to occur in the American Southwest, stock footage of High Force was used. High Force also appeared in \"Emmerdale\" in 2021.\nNotable visitors.\nThe painter J. M. W. Turner arrived at High Force at 10:00\u00a0a.m. on 3 August 1816 to sketch the scene. He then travelled upstream to Cauldron Snout and eventually made his way to Dufton, across the fells, in inclement weather.\nArthur Young came with his wife on horseback from Durham in 1771 and made the following comment:\nThe whole river (no trifling one) divided by one rock into two vast torrents pours down a perpendicular precipice of near fourscore feet: The deluging force of the water throws up such a foam and misty rain, that the sun never shines without a large and brilliant rainbow appearing...\nAfter preaching at Cuthberton and in Teesdale, I went a little out of my way, to see one of the wonders of nature. The river Tees rushes down between two rocks, and falls sixty feet perpendicular into a basin of water sixty feet deep ...\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The site lies on the eastern bank of the Orontes river, in a wide and fertile plain, 35 miles north-east of Baalbek and 10 or 12 miles south of the artificial Lake Homs created by the Romans. Brenton translated the place as \"Rablaam\" in his translation of the Septuagint.\nIt was at Riblah that Necho II, pharaoh of Egypt (c. 610 \u2013 c. 595 BCE), established his camp after he had routed Josiah's Judahite army at Megiddo in 609 BCE. Soon after this, the son of Josiah, the newly anointed King Jehoahaz, was made prisoner and held at Riblah to prevent him from ruling Judah; he was later taken to Egypt where he died (). A reference in :\n\"The nations combined against him [Jehoahaz]; he was caught in their pit;\"\n\"They dragged him off with hooks to the land of Egypt\"\nis interpreted as stating that Necho had invited Jehoahaz to a conference in Riblah and trapped him there.\nSome two decades later, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon also set up his headquarters here during his campaign against Judah, which culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 or 586 BCE. King Zedekiah was taken captive and brought to Riblah, described as a dependency of Hamath, where he had to witness how his sons were killed, after which he was blinded and taken to Babylon. His officials were also put to death in Riblah ().\nThe town was situated on the main international trade route from Egypt to Mesopotamia, via Israel and the town of Carchemish where the road crossed over the Euphrates River. An important strategic asset, Riblah had plenty of water, food and fuel, which made also suitable as a military camp.\nIn Roman times, the town also bore the name Daphne.\nRiblah in Canaan.\nThere was also a town with the same name on the eastern boundary of the land promised to Moses in Canaan, known from , but whose location is still uncertain.

{"id": "69346", "revid": "44062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69346", "title": "Soprano", "text": "Classical singing voice with the highest vocal range\nA soprano () is a type of classical singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C4) = 261\u00a0Hz to A5 in choral music, or to soprano C (C6) or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which often encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"soprano\" comes from the Italian word \"sopra\" (above, over, on top of), as the soprano is the highest pitch human voice, often given to the leading female roles in operas. \"Soprano\" refers mainly to women, but it can also be applied to men; \"sopranist\" is the term for a male countertenor able to sing in the soprano vocal range, while a castrato is the term for a castrated male singer, typical of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, and a treble is a boy soprano, whether they finished puberty or are still a child, as long as they are still able to sing in that range.\nThe term \"soprano\" is also based on the Latin word \"superius\" which, like soprano, referred to the highest pitch vocal range of all human voice types. The word \"superius\" was especially used in choral and other multi-part vocal music between the 13th and 16th centuries.\nVocal range.\nThe soprano has the highest vocal range of all voice types, with the highest tessitura. A soprano and a mezzo-soprano have a similar range, but their tessituras will lie in different parts of that range.\nThe low extreme for sopranos is roughly A3 or B\u266d3 (just below middle C). Within opera, the lowest demanded note for sopranos is F3 (from Richard Strauss's \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\"). Often low notes in higher voices will project less, lack timbre, and tend to \"count less\" in roles (although some Verdi, Strauss and Wagner roles call for stronger singing below the staff). However, rarely is a soprano simply unable to sing a low note in a song within a soprano role. Low notes can be reached with a lowered position of the larynx.\nThe high extreme, at a minimum, for non-coloratura sopranos is \"soprano C\" (C6 two octaves above middle C), and many roles in the standard repertoire call for C\u266f6 or D6. A couple of roles have optional E\u266d6s, as well. In the coloratura repertoire, several roles call for E\u266d6 on up to F6. In rare cases, some coloratura roles go as high as G6 or G\u266f6, such as Mozart's concert aria \"Popoli di Tessaglia!\", or the title role of Jules Massenet's opera \"Esclarmonde\". While not necessarily within the tessitura, a good soprano will be able to sing her top notes full-throated, with timbre and dynamic control.\nIn opera, the tessitura, vocal weight, and timbre of voices, and the roles they sing, are commonly categorized into voice types, often called (sg. , from German or , \"vocal category\"). A singer's tessitura is where the voice has the best timbre, easy volume, and most comfort.\nIn choral music.\nIn SATB four-part mixed chorus, the soprano is the highest vocal range, above the alto, tenor, and bass. Sopranos commonly sing in the tessitura G4-A5. When the composer calls for divisi, sopranos can be separated into Soprano I (highest part) and Soprano II (lower soprano part).\nIn contrast to choral singing, in classical solo singing a person is classified through the identification of several vocal traits, including range, vocal timbre, vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal resonance, and vocal transition points (lifts or \"passaggio\") within the singer's voice.\nThese different traits are used to identify different sub-types within the voice. Within opera, particular roles are written with specific kinds of soprano voices in mind, causing certain roles to be associated with certain kinds of voices.\nSubtypes and roles in opera.\nWithin the soprano voice type category are five generally recognized subcategories: coloratura soprano, soubrette, lyric soprano, spinto soprano, and dramatic soprano.\nColoratura.\nThe coloratura soprano may be a lyric coloratura or a dramatic coloratura. The lyric coloratura soprano is a very agile light voice with a high upper extension capable of fast vocal coloratura. Light coloraturas have a range of approximately middle C (C4) to \"high F\" (\"in alt\") (F6) with some coloratura sopranos being able to sing somewhat lower or higher, e.g. an interpolated A\u266d6 in the Doll Aria, \"Les oiseaux dans la charmille\", from \"The Tales of Hoffmann\", e.g. by Rachele Gilmore in a 2009 performance, and a written A\u266e6 by Audrey Luna in 2017 in \"The Exterminating Angel\", both at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.\nThe dramatic coloratura soprano is a coloratura soprano with great flexibility in high-lying velocity passages, yet with great sustaining power comparable to that of a full spinto or dramatic soprano. Dramatic coloraturas have a range of approximately \"low B\" (B3) to \"high F\" (F6) with some coloratura sopranos being able to sing somewhat higher or lower.\nSoubrette.\nIn classical music and opera, a soubrette soprano refers to both a voice type and a particular type of opera role. A soubrette voice is light with a bright, sweet timbre, a tessitura in the mid-range, and with no extensive coloratura. The soubrette voice is not a weak voice, for it must carry over an orchestra without a microphone like all voices in opera. The voice, however, has a lighter vocal weight than other soprano voices with a brighter timbre. Many young singers start out as soubrettes, but, as they grow older and the voice matures more physically, they may be reclassified as another voice type, usually either a light lyric soprano, a lyric coloratura soprano, or a coloratura mezzo-soprano. Rarely does a singer remain a soubrette throughout her entire career. A soubrette's range extends approximately from Middle C (C4) to \"high D\" (D6). The tessitura of the soubrette tends to lie a bit lower than the lyric soprano and spinto soprano.\nLyric.\nThe lyric soprano is a warm voice with a bright, full timbre, which can be heard over a big orchestra. It generally has a higher tessitura than a soubrette and usually plays \"ing\u00e9nues\" and other sympathetic characters in opera. Lyric sopranos have a range from approximately middle C (C4) to \"high D\" (D6).\nThe lyric soprano may be a light lyric soprano or a full lyric soprano. The light lyric soprano has a bigger voice than a soubrette but still possesses a youthful quality. The full lyric soprano has a more mature sound than a light-lyric soprano and can be heard over a bigger orchestra.\nSpinto.\nAlso lirico-spinto, Italian for \"pushed lyric\", the spinto soprano has the brightness and height of a lyric soprano, but can be \"pushed\" to dramatic climaxes without strain, and may have a somewhat darker timbre. Spinto sopranos have a range from approximately B (B3) to \"high D\" (D6).\nDramatic.\nA dramatic soprano (or \"soprano robusto\") has a powerful, rich, emotive voice that can sing over a full orchestra. Usually (but not always) this voice has a lower tessitura than other sopranos, and a darker timbre. Dramatic sopranos have a range from approximately A (A3) to \"high C\" (C6).\nSome dramatic sopranos, known as Wagnerian sopranos, have a very big voice that can assert itself over an exceptionally large orchestra (over eighty pieces). These voices are substantial and very powerful and ideally even throughout the registers.\nOther types.\nTwo other types of soprano are the \"Dugazon\" and the \"Falcon\", which are intermediate voice types between the soprano and the mezzo-soprano: a Dugazon is a darker-colored soubrette, a Falcon a darker-colored soprano drammatico.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Israelites under Moses have come from the Wilderness of Sin. At Rephidim, they can find no water to drink, and angrily demand that Moses give them water. Moses, fearing they will stone him, calls on Jehovah for help and is told to strike a certain \"rock in Horeb,\" in God's name which causes a stream to flow from it, providing ample water for the people. He names the place Massah and Meribah (meaning \"testing\" and \"quarreling\"). In the Book of Numbers a similar event is described as taking place near Kadesh. \nAfterwards, the Amalekites attack the Israelites encamped at Rephidim, but are defeated. The Israelites are led in the battle by Joshua, while Moses, Aaron and Hur watch from a nearby hill. Moses notices that when his arms are raised the Israelites gained the upper hand, but when they are down the Amalekites prevail. He sits with his hands held up by Aaron and Hur until sunset, securing the Israelite victory. The image of Moses raising his arms in battle against Amalek has been seen by allegorical Christian commenters as a prefiguration of Jesus's arms extended on the cross battling sin.\nLocation.\nOne proposal places Rephidim in the Wadi Feiran, near its junction with the Wadi esh-Sheikh. When they leave Rephidim, the Israelites advance into the Sinai Wilderness, possibly marching through the passes of the Wadi Solaf and the Wadi esh-Sheikh, which converge at the entrance to the er-Rahah plain (which would then be identified with the \"Sinai Wilderness\"), which is three kilometers long and about eight hundred metres wide. Wadi Feiran was an oasis, which would explain the battle with the Amalekites in terms of a struggle for control of water sources.\nAnother proposed location for Rephidim is in northwestern Saudi Arabia north of the town of al-Bad, the ancient city of Midian. Some researchers suggest that Mount Sinai was not in the Sinai Peninsula, but in Midian, which is modern-day Saudi Arabia, and subsequently place Rephidim here as well. Jabal Maqla has been the subject of several explorations since the early 1980s. To the northwest of this mountain is a large plain and a massive split rock that shows signs of water erosion (Rephidim is also where Moses is recorded as striking a rock and water coming from it for the parched Hebrews). The plain, or wadi runs from this split rock all the way to Jabal Maqla.\nThe name \"Rephidim\" () means \"place of rest\".\nMore recent scholarship identifies Rephidim with Wadi Refayid in the southwest Sinai.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Religious festivals are commonly celebrated on recurring cycles in a calendar year or lunar calendar. The science of religious rites and festivals is known as heortology.\nWithin the Evangelical Lutheran branch of Christianity, \"festival\" is part of the ranking of feast days in the liturgical kalendar.\nAncient Roman.\nFestivals \"(feriae)\" were an important part of Roman religious life during both the Republican and Imperial eras, and were one of the primary features of the Roman calendar. \"Feriae\" (\"holidays\" in the sense of \"holy days\") were either public \"(publicae)\" or private \"(privatae)\". State holidays were celebrated by the Roman people and received public funding. \"Feriae privatae\" were holidays celebrated in honor of private individuals or by families.\nThe 1st-century BC scholar Varro defined \"feriae\" as \"days instituted for the sake of the gods.\" A deity's festival often marked the anniversary (\"dies natalis,\" \"birthday\") of the founding of the deity's temple, or a rededication after a major renovation. Public business was suspended for the performance of religious rites on the \"feriae\". Cicero says that people who were free should not engage in lawsuits and quarrels, and slaves should get a break from their labors. On calendars of the Republic and early Empire, the religious status days were marked by letters such as \"F\" (for \"fastus)\", and \"N\" (for \"nefastus\", when political activities and the administration of justice were prohibited). By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show these letters, probably as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius that recognized the changed religious environment of the empire.\nOn surviving Roman calendars, festivals that appear in large capital letters (such as the Lupercalia and Parilia) are thought to have been the most ancient holidays, becoming part of the calendar before 509 BC. Some of the oldest festivals are not named for deities. During the Imperial period, several traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important, and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays. Games \"(ludi)\", such as the Ludi Apollinares, were often dedicated to particular deities, but were not technically \"feriae\", although they might be holidays in the modern sense of days off work \"(dies festi)\". After the mid-1st century AD, there were more frequent spectacles and games \"(circenses)\" held in the venue called a \"circus\", in honor of various deities or for imperial anniversaries \"(dies Augusti)\". A religious festival held on a single day, such as the Floralia, might be expanded with games over multiple days \"(Ludi Florae)\"; the festival of Flora is seen as a precursor of May Day festivities.\nA major source for Roman holidays is Ovid's \"Fasti\", a poem that describes and provides origins for festivals from January to June at the time of Augustus. Because it ends with June, less is known about Roman festivals in the second half of the year, with the exception of the Saturnalia, a religious festival in honor of Saturn on December 17 that expanded with celebrations through December 23. Probably the best-known Roman festival, some of its customs, such as gift-giving and the prevalence of candles, are thought to have influenced popular celebrations of Christmas.\nBuddhist.\nJapanese festivals and Barua festivals often involve Buddhist culture, as do pagoda festivals held as fairs held at Buddhist temples in countries such as Thailand. Features of Buddhist Tibetan festivals may include the traditional cham dance, which is also a feature of some Buddhist festivals in India and Bhutan. Many festivals of Nepal are religious festivals involving Buddhism.\nChristian.\nThe central festival of Christianity is Easter, on which Christians celebrate their belief that Jesus Christ rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. Even for Easter, however, there is no agreement among the various Christian traditions regarding the date or manner of the observance, less for Christmas, Pentecost, or various other holidays. Both Protestants and Catholics observe certain festivals commemorating events in the life of Christ, and as well as Eastern Orthodox they often celebrate patronal festivals. Of these, the two most important are Christmas, which commemorates the Birth of Jesus, and Easter, which marks his resurrection.\nFestival of Faiths.\nA celebration of interfaith dialogue, the first Festival of Faiths was held in Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1998, Senator Wendell Ford passed a resolution in the United States Congress \"to express the sense of the Senate that the Louisville Festival of Faiths should be commended and should serve as model for similar festivals in other communities throughout the United States.\" Several cities throughout the United States now host interfaith festivals including Kansas City, Kansas, St Louis, Missouri, Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio.\nHindu.\n'Utsava' is the Sanskrit word for Hindu festivals, meaning 'to cause to grow 'upward'. Hindus observe sacred occasions by festive observances. All festivals in Hinduism are predominantly religious in character and significance. Many festival are seasonal. Some celebrate harvest and the birth of gods or heroes. Some are dedicated to important events in Hindu mythology. Many are dedicated to Shiva and Parvati, Vishnu and Lakshmi and Brahma and Saraswati. A festival may be observed with acts of worship, offerings to deities, fasting, feasting, vigil, rituals, fairs, charity, celebrations, Puja, Homa, aarti etc. They celebrate individual and community life of Hindus without distinction of caste, gender or class. In the Hindu calendar dates are usually prescribed according to the lunar calendar. In vedic timekeeping, a tithi is a lunar day. Among major festivals are Diwali, Gudi Padwa, Pongal, Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Raksha Bhandan, Krishna Janmashtami, Dasara or Dussehra, which may refer to the ten days of Sharada Navratri or the tenth day, Vijayadashami. Others include Onam, Shivaratri, Ugadi, Rathayatra of Jagannath at Puri in Ilam, Nepal and many other places in Nepal and many other countries\nIslamic.\nAmong major Islamic religious festivals are Eid ul-Adha, Eid ul-Fitr and Ramadan.\nJain.\nImportant festivals include Paryushan, Mahavir Janma Kalyanak and Diwali.\nJewish.\nA Jewish holiday (\"Yom Tov\" or \"chag\" in Hebrew) is a day that is holy to the Jewish people according to Judaism and is usually derived from the Hebrew Bible, specifically the Torah, and in some cases established by the rabbis in later eras. There are a number of festival days, fast days (\"ta'anit\") and days of remembrance.\nMandaean.\nParwanaya is the largest Mandaean festival.\n\"Dehwa Honina\" or \"Dehwa \u1e6curma\" (the Little Feast) is a Mandaean religious festival which takes place on the 18th of Taura (Ayar), celebrating the return of the divine messenger Hibil Ziwa from the World of Darkness to the World of Light.\nMandaeans also celebrate Dehwa Rabba (New Year's Day) and Dehwa Daymaneh (Birthday of John the Baptist).\nNeo-Pagan.\nNatale di Roma, historically known as \"Dies Romana\" and also referred to as Romaia, the festival linked to the foundation of Rome, celebrated on April 21. According to legend, Romulus is said to have founded the city of Rome on April 21, 753 BC. From this date, the Roman chronology derived its system, known by the Latin phrase \"Ab Urbe condita\", meaning \"from the founding of the City\", which counted the years from this presumed foundation.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith has eleven holy days, which are important anniversaries in the history of the religion.\nSikh.\nMajor Sikh festivals include Guru Nanak Gurpurab, Guru Gobind Gurpurab, Maghi, Poonai, Sangrand, and Vaisakhi.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), who staged the event after winning the 1967 contest for the United Kingdom with the song \"Puppet on a String\" by Sandie Shaw. Despite being the UK's first win at the contest, it was actually the third time that the BBC had hosted the competition, having previously done so in 1960 and 1963, both of which also took place in London and were presented by Katie Boyle. It was the first time the event was broadcast in colour. Broadcasters from seventeen countries participated in the contest, the same countries that had participated the previous year.\nThe winner was Spain with the song \"La La La\" by Massiel, and written/composed by Manuel de la Calva and Ram\u00f3n Arcusa. This was Spain's first victory - and their first ever top five placing - in the contest.\nLocation.\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) staged the 1968 contest in London, after winning the 1967 contest for the United Kingdom with the song \"Puppet on a String\" by Sandie Shaw. The venue selected was the Royal Albert Hall. This concert hall is known for hosting the world's leading artists from several performance genres, sports, award ceremonies, the annual summer Proms concerts and other events since its opening in 1871, and has become one of the United Kingdom's most treasured and distinctive buildings. At the time of the contest in 1968, the venue had a capacity of 7,000 seats.\nParticipants.\nBroadcasters from seventeen countries participated in the 1968 contest, the same countries that had participated in 1967.\nThe contest featured one representative who had previously performed as lead artists for the same country. Isabelle Aubret had won Eurovision for France in 1962.\nOriginally Spanish broadcaster (TVE) entered Joan Manuel Serrat to sing \"La La La\", but after he demanded to sing the song in Catalan at the contest, Massiel, who was on tour in Mexico, was brought in as a late replacement. In just two weeks, she had to rush back to Spain, learn the song, record it in several languages, travel to Paris to get a dress and go to London for rehearsals. She sang the song in the contest in Spanish with a new arrangement made to fit her. In her winning reprise, she performed part of her song in English, in addition to the original version, becoming the first winner to do so. The Norwegian national selection, Melodi Grand Prix 1968, ended with the song \"\" winning performed by both Kirsti Sparboe and Odd B\u00f8rre. However the composer, Kari Diesen withdrew the song due to receiving multiple accusations of plagiarism of the song \"Summer Holiday\" by Cliff Richard. (NRK) internally selected the runner-up song in the selection, \"Stress\" to participate in the contest instead, and Odd B\u00f8rre was chosen as the singer.\nFormat.\n1968 was the first time that the Eurovision Song Contest was broadcast in colour. The countries that broadcast it in colour were France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, although in the UK it was broadcast as an encore presentation in colour on BBC Two the next day. Many Eastern European countries as well as Tunisia broadcast the contest.\nPrior to the contest, the bookmakers were sure of another British victory, as the English singer Cliff Richard, who was already dominating the music charts at that time, was hotly tipped as the favourite to win, but in the end he lost out to Spain's song by a margin of just one vote.\nContest overview.\nSpokespersons.\nEach participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1968 contest are listed below.\nDetailed voting results.\nDue to a misunderstanding by the hostess, Katie Boyle, Switzerland was erroneously awarded 3 votes by Yugoslavia, instead of 2. The scrutineer asked for the Yugoslav votes to be announced a second time.\nBroadcasts.\nEach participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as \"passive participants\". Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. In addition to the participating countries, the contest was also reportedly broadcast in Tunisia, and in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union via Intervision, with an estimated global audience of between 150 and 200 million.\nKnown details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are many theories regarding its origin.\nThe name \"Africa\" began to be stretched to encompass a larger area when the provinces of Tripolitania, Numidia and Mauretania Caesariensis were subdued to the Diocesis of Africa, following the administrative restructuring of Diocletian. Later, when Justinian I reconquered lands of the former West Roman Empire, all the regions from the Chelif River to the Gulf of Sidra were annexed to the Byzantine Empire as the \"Exarchate of Africa\".\nDuring the Middle Ages, as the Europeans increased their knowledge and awareness of the size of the African continent, they progressively extended the name of Africa to the rest of the continent.\nAmerica.\nThe continent of America is thought to be named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci (who styled himself \"Americus Vespucius\" in Latin). Amerigo Vespucci was named after Saint Emeric of Hungary, who was in turn named for his maternal uncle, the Holy Roman Emperor Henry II. Vespucci, following his four voyages exploring the coastlines of Venezuela and Brazil, first developed the idea that the newly discovered western land was in fact a continent. The German cartographer Martin Waldseem\u00fcller created the earliest known map showing the name \"America\", which he applied to the South American continent only.\nThe 1594 map by Petrus Plancius labels the two landmasses \"America Mexicana\" and \"America Peruana\", two terms still used in the 17th century.\nIn the late 19th century, it was theorized that the name could have been patterned on the Mayan language for the Amerrisque Mountains in present-day Nicaragua.\nAn alternative theory was proposed by the local Bristol antiquarian Alfred Hudd who proposed that the word America had evolved from Amerike or ap Meryk, based on a lost manuscript which he claimed to have seen. Alfred Hudd was an aristocrat who belonged to the Clifton Antiquarian Club of Bristol, founded in 1884 to arrange meetings and excursions for the study of objects of archaeological interest in the West of England and South Wales. He also collected butterflies, was a naturalist and member of the Bristol Naturalists' Society. Hudd proposed that the word \"America\" was originally applied to a destination across the western ocean, possibly an island or a fishing station in Newfoundland. After the king of Denmark and ruler of Iceland had cut off trade for fish, England sent out expeditions to find new sources. Hudd suggested Amerike's sponsorship made his name known in Bristol in association with the North American destinations prior to other mapmaking or voyages. The writer Jonathan Cohen noted he made a conjectural leap to reach that conclusion, and no extant evidence supports it. In the 21st century, the scholar John Davies briefly mentioned the story as a kind of Welsh patriot piece.\nAntarctica.\nThe word \"Antarctica\" comes from Greek \"antarktikos\" (\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2), from \"anti\" (\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af) and \"arktikos\" (\u1f00\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) \"Arctic\". Literally \"opposite to the Arctic (opposite to the North)\". \"Arktikos\" comes from \"Arktos\", the Greek name for the constellation of the Great Bear Ursa Major, visible only in the Northern Hemisphere, which comes from the ancient Greek word \u1f04\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (), which means \"bear\".\nAsia.\nThe word \"Asia\" originated from the Ancient Greek word \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, first attributed to Herodotus (about 440 BCE) in reference to Anatolia or to the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt.\nIt originally was just a name for the east bank of the Aegean Sea, an area known to the Hittites as Assuwa. In early Classical times, the Greeks started using the term \"Asia\" to refer to the whole region known today as Anatolia (the peninsula which forms the Asian portion of present-day Turkey). The Roman Empire referred to the entire Lydian region of what is now northwestern Turkey as the province of Asia. Eventually, however, the name had been stretched progressively further east, until it came to encompass the much larger land area with which the name is associated today, while the Anatolian Peninsula started being called \"Asia Minor\" or \"The Lesser Asia\" instead.\nThe deeper root of the etymology can only be guessed at. The following two possibilities have been suggested: \nHowever, since the Greek name \"Asia\" is in all likelihood related to Hittite Assuwa, the etymology of one has to account for the other as well.\nIt is personified in Greek mythology by the deity of the same name.\nAustralia.\nThe word \"Australia\" means \"Southern Land\" in Neo-Latin, adapted from the legendary pseudo-geographical \"Terra Australis Incognita\" (\"Unknown Southern Land\") dating back to the Roman era. First appearing as a corruption of the Spanish name for an island in Vanuatu in 1625, \"Australia\" was slowly popularized following the advocacy of the British explorer Matthew Flinders in his 1814 description of his circumnavigation of the island. Lachlan Macquarie, a Governor of New South Wales, used the word in his dispatches to England and recommended it be formally adopted by the Colonial Office in 1817. The Admiralty agreed seven years later and the continent became officially known as Australia in 1824.\nEurope.\nIn classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient Greek: \u0395\u1f50\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7, \"Eur\u1e53p\u0113\") was a Phoenician princess. Greek (\"Eur\u1e53p\u0113\") contains the elements \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03cd\u03c2 (\"eurus\"), \"wide, broad\" and \u1f64\u03c8/\u1f60\u03c0-/\u1f40\u03c0\u03c4- (\"\u014dps\"/ \"\u014dp\"-/\"opt-\") \"eye, face, countenance\". \"Broad\" has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion.\nIt is common in ancient Greek mythology and geography to identify lands or rivers with female figures. Thus, \"Europa\" is first used in a geographic context in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea.\nAs a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by Anaximander and Hecataeus.\nThe weakness of an etymology with \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03cd\u03c2 (\"eurus\"), is 1. that the -u stem of \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03cd\u03c2 disappears in \u0395\u1f50\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7 Europa and 2. the expected form \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03c5\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7 euryopa that retains the -u stem in fact exists.\nAn alternative suggestion due to Ernest Klein and Giovanni Semerano (1966) attempted to connect a Semitic term for \"west\", Akkadian \"erebu\" meaning \"to go down, set\" (in reference to the sun), Phoenician \" 'ereb\" \"evening; west\", which would parallel \"occident\" (the resemblance to \"Erebus\", from PIE \"*h1reg\u02b7os\", \"darkness\", is accidental, however). Barry (1999) adduces the word \"Ereb\" on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of \"night\", \"[the country of] sunset\", in opposition to \"Asu\" \"[the country of] sunrise\", i.e. Asia (Anatolia coming equally from \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae, \"(sun)rise\", \"east\"). This proposal is mostly considered unlikely or untenable.\nOceania.\nThe word \"Oceania\" comes from the English word ocean for 'a large body of water'. It is ultimately derived from Greek \u1f68\u03ba\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 (\"Okeanos\"), the great river or sea surrounding the disk of the Earth. In Greek mythology, it is personified as Oceanus, son of Uranus and Gaia and husband of Tethys.\nOther.\nZealandia.\nZealandia (), also known as the New Zealand continent or Tasmantis, is a nearly submerged continental fragment that sank after breaking away from Australia 60\u201385 Ma (million years) ago, and most of it (93%) remains submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean. It derives its name from the island country of New Zealand which occupies the vast majority of its non-submerged land. Dutch explorers named the land \"Nova Zeelandia\" after the Dutch province of Zeeland, and British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand.\nPangaea.\nThe name \"Pangaea/Pangea\" is derived from Ancient Greek \"pan\" (, \"all, entire, whole\") and \"Gaia\" (, \"Mother Earth, land\"). The word was allegedly coined by German meteorologist Alfred L. Wegener in 1915. The name was meant to imply the all-encompassing nature of Pangaea, that all the earth (landmass) on the planet at the time was encompassed within the Supercontinent.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Another object of equivalent value may also be used.\n\"Pidyon haben\" is a relatively rare ceremony. A family does not perform the ceremony if their firstborn is either a girl, or born by caesarian section, or preceded by a miscarriage (although some early miscarriages do not count as miscarriages), or if either grandfather is a Kohen or a Levite.\nOrigin.\nIn the Hebrew Bible the laws (see mitzvah) concerning the redemption of the first-born male are referred to in Exodus, Numbers and Leviticus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You shall set apart for \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 every first issue of the womb: every male firstling that your cattle drop shall be \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u2019s. \nBut every firstling ass you shall redeem with a sheep; if you do not redeem it, you must break its neck. And you must redeem every male first-born among your children. \nAnd when, in time to come, a child of yours asks you, saying, \"What does this mean?\" you shall reply, \"It was with a mighty hand that \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 brought us out from Egypt, the house of bondage. \nWhen Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 slew every [male] first-born in the land of Egypt, the firstborn of both human and beast. Therefore I sacrifice to \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 every first male issue of the womb, but redeem every male first-born among my children.\"\nThe redemption price for firstborn non-Levites was set at 5 shekels:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first [male] issue of the womb of every being, human or beast, that is offered to \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, shall be yours; but you shall have the male first-born of human beings redeemed, and you shall also have the firstling of impure animals redeemed. \nTake as their redemption price, from the age of one month up, the money equivalent of five shekels by the sanctuary weight, which is twenty gerahs.\nThe arakhin laws set the redemption price of different classes of people whose \"value\" was consecrated; the price for a male child under five years is similarly five shekels.\nThe Torah describes the tribe of Levi (to which the priests belong) as having inherited the role of divine service which previously belonged to the firstborns:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I hereby take the Levites from among the Israelites in place of all the male first-born, the first issue of the womb among the Israelites: the Levites shall be Mine. \nFor every male first-born is Mine: at the time that I smote every [male] first-born in the land of Egypt, I consecrated every male first-born in Israel, human and beast, to Myself, to be Mine, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u2019s.\nAccording to the traditional rabbinic interpretation, even before the Exodus the priestly duties were reserved for the oldest son in each family.\nThe priesthood was given specifically to the kohanim (Aaron and his descendants), and at the same time, it was instituted that the firstborn should be redeemed. The replacement of firstborns with Levites occurred following the golden calf episode; during that episode the Levites remained loyal to God.\nLaws.\nThe \"Shulchan Aruch\" states that when a Jewish woman gives birth to a firstborn male by natural means (i.e. a boy born vaginally and not by Caesarean section) then the child must be \"redeemed\". The father of the child must \"redeem\" the child from a known kohen representing the original Temple priesthood, for the sum of five silver shekels, or equivalent in another nation's currency (if it has silver currency of the correct weight).\nThis redemption ceremony is performed when at least thirty days have passed since the child's birth. If the 31st day falls on Shabbat or a festival, the redemption is delayed, because any sort of business transaction is not allowed on those days. The elapsed days are counted from sunset to sunset, and the day of birth counts as the first day. While the redemption could be performed immediately after dark on the 31st\u00a0night, it is usually done the next day; but if the 31st\u00a0day is a fast day, it is done the previous night, so that it can be accompanied by a festive meal. It is also possible to hold the ceremony on the 30th\u00a0day itself, if it will be impossible to perform it the next day, so long as at least one synodic month has passed since the moment of birth.\nIf a first-born son reaches \"bar mitzvah\" age without having been redeemed, he is responsible for arranging the mitzvah himself as soon as possible.\nExemptions.\nRedemption is required for \"the first to exit the womb\" () so it is not performed if a daughter is born first. If a woman gives birth to a second son vaginally when the first son was born by caesarean section, that child is not redeemed either. Also, a first-born male does not require redemption if his birth was preceded by an earlier miscarriage by the mother that occurred after the third month of pregnancy. However, if the miscarriage occurred during the first 40\u00a0days of pregnancy, redemption is required. If the previous miscarriage occurred after forty days, but before the fetus developed distinguishing characteristics, redemption of the first-born is still required, but the blessing said by the father is omitted.\nThe procedure does not apply when the father is a kohen or Levite, and does not normally apply when the mother is the daughter of one. The reason is that the Levites, as substitutes for the first-born, are pledged to minister and assist the \"kohanim\" in divine service, and cannot be redeemed from this service obligation.\nThe first-born son from a Levite's daughter is not redeemed (whether or not the father is Jewish). Similarly, the first-born son of a kohen's daughter, as long as the father is Jewish.\nBat Kohen.\nSome sources state that a bat kohen (daughter of a priest) may accept \"pidyon haben\" money, just as a priest may, but this option is not accepted in practice.\nCeremony.\nIn the traditional ceremony, the father brings the child to the kohen and recites a formula, or responds to ritual questions, indicating that this is the Israelite mother's firstborn son and he has come to redeem him as commanded in the Torah. If the family is Sephardic, the kohen asks the mother if the child is indeed her firstborn son and if she did not miscarry in the past. The kohen asks the father which he would rather have, the child or the five silver shekels which he must pay. The father states that he prefers the child to the money, then he recites a blessing and hands over five silver coins (or an equivalent amount of total silver). The kohen holds the coins over the child and declares that the redemption price is received and accepted in place of the child. He then blesses the child. (Note: The kohen would not receive the child if the father refused to redeem the boy. The function of the question is merely to formally endear the mitzvah to the father.)\nThe ceremony traditionally takes place before a minyan of 10\u00a0men. The child is sometimes presented on a silver tray, surrounded by jewelry lent for the occasion by women in attendance. This is to contrast with the golden calf, when gold and jewelry was used for a sinful purpose.\nThe event starts by beginning a festive meal (unlike a \"brit milah\" or wedding where the meal comes after the ceremony). If the family is Sephardic, the event starts with the ceremony. Guests in some places are given cloves of garlic and cubes of sugar to take home: these strongly flavored foods can be used to flavor a large quantity of food which will in some sense extend the mitzvah of participation in the ceremony to all who eat them.\nCoins.\nContemporary religious authorities believe that the \"Shekel HaKodesh\" (Holy Shekel) of the Temple was larger and of purer silver content than the standard shekel used for trade in ancient Israel. Halakha requires that the coins used have a requisite total amount of actual silver. There are varying opinions as to the correct amount of silver, they fall in between 96.15\u00a0grams and 102\u00a0grams. Coins which do not contain the requisite amount of silver do not result in a valid redemption.\nThe Israeli Mint has minted two sets of coins for this purpose: an edition of 20.57\u00a0gram silver commemorative coins, five of which would come to 102\u00a0grams of silver,\nand a special edition 26\u00a0gram silver commemorative coins, five of which would come to 130\u00a0grams of silver. Pre-1936 American silver dollars (commonly known as Morgan dollars or Peace dollars) weigh 26.73\u00a0grams of 90% silver content and hence contain 24.06g of pure silver, although such coins have become increasingly rare (modern U.S. coins contain no silver). Four American Silver Eagle coins, specially minted coins sold to collectors and investors which contain 31.1035\u00a0grams of 99.9% pure silver, or five of the above-mentioned specially minted silver coins of Israel are commonly used for \"pidyon haben\" in the United States. One may use silver bullion as well; it is not necessary for it to be a coin per se.\nMoreover, it is not mandatory to redeem the son in silver coins, and the ceremony can be held using any movable object worth the same value as five silver coins in the same day, other than promissory notes, which is not acceptable for the ceremony. Later halachic authorities discuss whether paper money is included in promissory notes; according to the stringent approach, it is possible that modern coins, which are fiat money not valued according to their metal value, would be the same as paper money.\nAlthough the silver coins are the payment to the kohen according to the 613 commandments and are one of the twenty-four priestly gifts, they are sometimes returned by the kohen to the family as a gift for the child, although halachic authorities stipulate that, for the \"pidyon\" to be valid, the choice of returning the coins as a gift rests entirely upon the kohen whereas pressuring the kohen to do so would render the redemption invalid.\n\"Pidyon\" certificate.\nSome kohens officiating for the \"pidyon\" ceremony will present the father with a \"\"Pidyon HaBen\" certificate\" of the \"pidyon\" transaction, the certificate will usually be framed for display and may serve as a receipt (and evidence) that the transaction was done according to halacha (i.e. the kohen was not pressured to return the coins), with the kohen and two witnesses (\"Eidim\") affixing their signatures at the time of the ceremony.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This mixture is then put inside a small spheroidal wafer capsule, shaped into nautical shapes such as shells.\nIn 2008, it was designated a product with Protected Geographical Indication by the European Union.\nHistory.\nOvos moles are a traditional pastry of the Aveiro region. They trace their origin to the nuns who lived at various convents of the Dominican, Franciscan, and Carmelite orders present in the area until the early 20th century\u2014particularly the Mosteiro de Jesus (Monastery of Jesus). According to popular legend, the nuns used egg whites to clean their habits, while they used the yolks to make sweets so as not to waste them, and in order to raise money for their religious communities. When the First Portuguese Republic suppressed the convents in 1910, the nuns transferred their artisanal knowledge to educated upper-class women. Ovos moles grew in popularity when women wearing traditional Aveiro costume started selling them at the Aveiro train station on the Lisbon\u2013Porto line.\nPreparation.\nIn order to make the egg yolk and sugar mixture for ovos moles, the yolks are carefully separated from the egg whites and mixed with about half their weight in sugar. The mixture is very smooth and creamy. It is not beat in a circular motion, which would result in undesirable striations, but in a simple back-and-forth or side-to-side motion with a wooden spoon. The mixture is then heated in a copper pan until the pan's bottom is visible.\nThe mixture is wrapped in a thin wafer casing made of rice starch or wheat flour similar to communion wafers. These casings are shaped into various nautical forms such as boats, clamshells, conches, fish, and shells. Sometimes the casings are passed through simple syrup in order to give them more consistency or turn them opaque.\nShops selling ovos moles usually display them in ceramic bowls or wood barrels painted with moliceiro boats and other motifs related to the Ria de Aveiro.\nChocolate ovos moles.\nOvos moles made with 63% cocoa and covered in chocolate are a traditional variation on the pastry. They essentially became extinct during World War II due to chocolate's scarcity at the time. In December 2015 the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Produtores de Ovos-Moles de Aveiro (Association of Producers of Aveiro Ovos-Moles) decided to reintroduce chocolate ovos moles and create a standard recipe for them. In Portuguese, chocolate ovos moles are called ovos moles de chocolate or ovos moles pretos (literally, black soft eggs).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located in the English Channel, north-west of France and south of England. It is long and under wide; oriented north\u2013south, with several stretches of sand along its northern coast. The much larger island of Guernsey lies to the west, Jersey lies to the south-east, and the smaller island of Jethou is just off the south-west coast.\nHerm was first discovered in the Mesolithic period, and the first settlers arrived in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many tombs from that period remain today, the majority in the north of the island. The island was annexed to the Duchy of Normandy in 933, but was transferred to the English Crown with the division of Normandy in 1204. It was occupied by Germany in the Second World War and the scene of Operation Huckaback, but was largely bypassed. Herm is currently managed by Herm Island Ltd, formed by Starboard Settlement, who acquired Herm in 2008, following fears during the sale of the island that the 'identity' of the island was at threat.\nHerm's harbour is on its west coast. There are several buildings of note in the vicinity, including the White House, St Tugual's Chapel, Fisherman's Cottage, The Mermaid pub and restaurant, and a small primary school with about eight pupils. During a busy summer season, up to 100,000 tourists visit the island, arriving by one of the catamaran ferries operated by the Trident Charter Company. Cars are banned from the island as are bicycles, although quad bikes and tractors are allowed for staff and luggage transport, respectively.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nHerm was first found in the Mesolithic period (between 10,000 and 8,000 BC), when hunters were in search of food. In the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, settlers arrived; the remains of chamber tombs have been found on the island, and may be seen today; specifically on the Common, and the Petit and Grand Monceau; it has been suggested that the northern end of the island, i.e. the Common, was set apart for burials. After a three-year project by the University of Durham, supported by specialists from the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, and the Guernsey museum, they stated that the \"density of tombs suggests that the northern end of Herm may have been a place set apart for funerary activity\".\nMiddle Ages.\nThe first records of Herm's inhabitants in historic times are from the 6th century, when the island became a centre of monastic activity; the followers of Saint Tugual (also called Tudwal) arrived, establishing Saint Tugual's Chapel. In 709 AD, a storm washed away the strip of land which connected the island with Jethou.\nAn important moment in Herm's political history was in 933 AD, when the Channel Islands were annexed to the Duchy of Normandy, they remained so until the division of Normandy in 1204, when they became a Crown Dependency. In 1111 Brother Claude Panton was a hermit in \"Erm\" and in 1117 the then hermit, Brother Francis Franche Montague is recorded as living on \"Erm\". After the annexation, Herm gradually lost its monastic inhabitants, and between 1570 and 1737 the governors of Guernsey used it as a hunting ground; visiting to shoot, hunt, and fish.\n19th century to the Second World War.\nIn 1810, an inn was founded; and during the Industrial Revolution, roads, paths, a harbour, accommodation, a forge, blacksmiths, a brewery, a bakery and a prison were built to cater for the largest number of inhabitants since prehistoric times. Most were quarrymen working in new granite quarries. Several quarries can still be seen at present, such as on the Common. When Prince Gebhard F\u00fcrst Bl\u00fccher von Wahlstatt and Princess Bl\u00fccher leased the island from the British government in 1889, he introduced a colony of red-necked wallabies to the island, which lasted until 1910. Offspring were \"said to have been eaten as food by English soldiers occupying the island during World War 2\".\nCompton Mackenzie, an English-born Scottish novelist, acquired the tenancy in 1920. He recalled that his three years there had numerous logistical problems. It has been suggested that Mackenzie was the basis for the character Mr Cathcart in D.H. Lawrence's \"The Man who Loved Islands\", about a man who moved to ever smaller islands much as Mackenzie moved from Herm to the smaller Jethou, but Lawrence himself denied it. Percival Lea Dewhurst Perry was the tenant from 1923 to 1939.\nThe German occupation of the Channel Islands during the Second World War essentially by-passed Herm. The island was claimed on 20 July 1940 by Nazi Germany, a few weeks after the arrival of German troops in Guernsey and Jersey; German soldiers landed on the island to shoot a propaganda film, \"The Invasion of the Isle of Wight.\" Herm's sandy beaches were soon used for practising landings from barges, in preparation for the invasion of England, but otherwise the island saw little of the Germans beyond officers making trips to shoot rabbits. Herm had only a little German construction during the war; a flak battery was placed on the island for a few weeks, and mines were placed in an area. Occasionally German soldiers would travel to Herm to cut wood for fuel.\nOperation Huckaback.\nOperation Huckaback was a British Second World War military operation that was originally designed to be a raid on Herm, Jethou and Brecqhou, but instead became only a raid on Herm undertaken on the night of 27 February 1943, following an earlier attempt that had been aborted. Ten men of the Small Scale Raiding Force and No. 4 Commando under Captain Patrick Anthony Porteous landed 200 yards to the north-west of Selle Rocque on a shingle beach and made several unsuccessful attempts to climb the cliff in front of them. Porteous finally managed to climb up the bed of a stream and pulled the others up with a rope. They later reported that they had found no sign of any Islanders or Germans (who were supposed to be billeted near the harbour). They had failed to make contact with the few civilians on the island whose duties included looking after the sheep.\nSince 1945.\nIn 1949, the States of Guernsey bought Herm from the Crown because of the \"unspoilt island idyll that could be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike\". One of the island's most influential tenants was Major Peter Wood, who looked after the island from 1949 to 1980 with his wife. The island was run down when he arrived, with the manor hidden in undergrowth, the windows and roofs of the houses having been blown off by a sea mine drifting into the harbour shortly after their arrival, but they created a school, and restored St Tugual's Chapel. Major Wood's daughter Pennie Wood Heyworth and her husband Adrian succeeded them; Major Wood died in 1998. Their early efforts are recorded in \"Herm, Our Island Home\", written by Major Wood's wife Jenny Wood.\nOn 17 May 2008, the BBC reported that the tenants had put the remaining 40 years of their lease up for sale, with an asking price of \u00a315,000,000. Within four days, there were over 50 potential buyers. In September 2008 it was announced that Starboard Settlement, a trust, had acquired the remainder of the lease for considerably less than the asking price. The trust formed a company based in Guernsey, Herm Island Ltd, to manage the island for the trustees.\nIn 2013, negotiations for a 21-year extension to the lease broke down, with the tenant offering \u00a3440,000 and the owner requesting \u00a36,000,000 plus improvements to infrastructure, the offer was later reduced to \u00a32.44 million. In 2023 the lease to Starboard Settlement Charitable Trust was extended to 2069 for an undisclosed sum.\nGeography and geology.\nHerm is only &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442\u00a0miles long (north-south) and less than half a mile wide (east-west). In the northern part of the island are two hills, Le Petit Monceau and Le Grand Monceau. To the north of these is a common, leading to Mouisonniere Beach on the northern coast, with Oyster Point in the northwestern corner and La Pointe du Gentilhomme or Alderney Point at the northeastern corner. To the east of the common is Shell Beach and to the west is The Bear's Beach, leading down to the harbour. Half of the coastline of the northern part of the island is surrounded by sandy beaches; the southern half is rocky. Much of Herm's bedrock is granite. In 2008, Adrian Heyworth, who was at the time the island's tenant, said that two or three metres of sand were being lost annually at Alderney Point. The northernmost point of the island, Alderney Point, sits directly south of the Isle of Portland.\nOff the northwestern coast of Herm is the islet of Le Plat Houmet, and beyond that Fondu, which like Herm belongs to Guernsey. In Belvoir Bay on the eastern side of the island are the islets of Mouliere, situated off Frenchman's Point, which is to the northeast of the manor village, and Caquorobert, the latter of which can be accessed at low tide via a vaguely marked path. To the south of this off the southeastern coast is Puffin Bay, which contains the islet of Putrainez near the coast and the islet of Selle Rocque further out to the south. The far southwestern point of the island is Point Sauzebourge, and Bishop's Cove is just to the north of this. North of the cove and south along the beach from the harbour and White House are the Rosiere Steps, with a quarry and cottage of the same name in the vicinity. The Mouette and Percee reefs are offshore here. Hermetier, also known as Rat's Island, lies about off the western coast between Fisherman's Beach and The Bear's Beach, to the north of the harbour, linked by a low causeway from the beach. The islet can be accessed at low tide from the beach around Fisherman's Cottage.\nThe isle of Jethou is around three-quarters of a mile to the southwest beyond Point Sauzebourge. It is possible that in AD 709 a storm washed away the strip of land that connected Jethou to Herm. About off the northern coast of Jethou is the islet of Crevichon, which measures about , with an area of less than three hectares. To the west, between Herm and Guernsey, lies the channel Little Roussel (Petit Ruau); between Herm and Sark, to the east, lies the Big Roussel (Grand Ruau). Br\u00e9hon Tower, a Victorian-era fortification, is in the Little Roussel between Herm and Saint Peter Port. The tower was created between 1854 and 1856 by Thomas Charles de Putron (1806\u20131869) using granite from Herm.\nPolitics.\nHerm is part of the St Peter Port parish of Guernsey but is not part of any canton. It belonged to the Electoral District of Saint Peter Port South, until the binding 2018 referendum implemented a single, island-wide constituency of which Herm was a part of. It is rented out to various tenants. Unlike the largely autonomous islands of Sark and Alderney within the Bailiwick, Herm is administered entirely by the States of Guernsey.\nCars and bicycles are banned from Herm, in order to keep \"peace and tranquillity\". Herm does allow quad bikes and tractors for staff and luggage transport, respectively.\nTenants.\nHolders of the post of tenant of Herm:\nEconomy and services.\nTourism.\nTourism is Herm's main source of income.\nDuring a busy summer season, up to 100,000 tourists visit the island, arriving by one of the Travel Trident catamaran ferries operated by the Trident Charter Company. Money is also made from vegetable growing, livestock and the occasional issue of postage stamps, which occurred between 1949 and 1969. The residents in Herm are workers on the island and their families. The island is very popular for camping, particularly favoured by schools in nearby Guernsey or Jersey conducting overnight field trips. There are ample camping grounds.\nCrime and law enforcement.\nThere are three volunteer Special Constables resident on the island, trained and supervised by the States of Guernsey Police Service. On Bank Holidays they are augmented by a visiting full-time Constable from Guernsey. Crime rates on the island are low.\nHealth.\nThere are no medical facilities on Herm and no resident doctor. A small team of first aiders and community first responders is maintained amongst the resident population, and receives regular training from the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service, a private company operating on a charitable basis under the umbrella of the Venerable Order of Saint John. Medical evacuation to hospital in Guernsey, where necessary, is achieved by means of the ambulance launch \"Flying Christine III\" operated by the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service.\nPublic toilets.\nThere are three sets of public toilets on the island, one in the west and two on the east coasts. The facilities on the east coast sit in between Shell Beach and Belvoir Bay, serving both beaches. The other set of facilities sit about a minute's walk north of the harbour, serving the shops in the village and the harbour itself.\nFire service.\nA voluntary fire service operates on the island. Herm Fire Brigade operates a tractor-hauled fire tender with a hose-reel, a pump, a 2,000-litre water tank, and basic fire-fighting equipment which they use while waiting for assistance from the Guernsey Fire Brigade, who also provide the Herm volunteers with training and support.\nTransport.\nHerm is entirely car free. Transport around the island is mostly on foot via the footpaths snaking through the island, but quadbikes and tractors are also used by farm and island staff for agricultural activities and carrying luggage. Travel to the island can be completed through the Travel Trident ferry, which runs ferries throughout the day from Saint Peter Port in Guernsey. In 2022 a second ferry was run by the Herm Island owners, but this appears to have been discontinued as of 2024. Supplies also arrive on the Travel Trident ferry daily, such as newspapers and stock for island businesses. The ferry docks in Herm at the Harbour during high tides, but at low tides Rosaire Steps are used, which is approximately a 5 minute walk from the village centre.\nNotable landmarks.\nThe nondenominational St Tugual's Chapel dates to the 11th century, but it is believed that there was a place of worship on Herm as far back as the 6th century, although it has not been confirmed whether the chapel was founded by St Tugual himself or his followers at a later date. The current building is Norman and appears to have been a monastery during medieval times. Of particular note is its stained glass windows featuring Noah's Ark and Guernsey cows and Jesus talking to the fisherman at Herm harbour. In 2010 and 2011, the chapel was closed for restoration work.\nOther buildings on the island include the White House hotel, \"The Mermaid\" pub and restaurant, and 20 self-catering cottages. The most notable cottages are Fisherman's Cottage, north of the harbour, and Manor Cottage. There is an obelisk on The Common, in the north of the island. The White House has no clocks, televisions, or phones, which is described as \"part of its charm\", and has a customer return rate of 70% (i.e. each year, 70% of customers have been before). Herm has no consecrated religious buildings or resident professional clergy, but visiting clergy conducts non-denominational weekly services during the summer months, and monthly services, led by local lay people, are held during the winter.\nSculptor Antony Gormley had a sculpture installed on Herm in 2010, originally planned to be removed after one year, but it received such a positive reception that it was kept for two years, and removed in 2012. The statue was number XI (11) of the Another Time series.\nWalking around Herm.\nThe distance around the perimeter of the island is and walking it takes about two hours. If one cuts across the common the distance is and takes about an hour and a half. One can walk from the harbour to Rosaire Steps in about seven minutes. The walk from the harbour to Shell Beach takes about 20 minutes and from the harbour to Belvoir Bay it takes about 15 minutes. One can also walk in between Belvoir Bay and Shell Beach along the rocky eastern coast of the island. Beginning at the rock pools at Belvoir Bay's northern end, the route passes below the round-island path, and the walk takes about 20 minutes but does not follow a marked path.\nFilm of walking around Herm in 1948 is held by the Cinema Museum in London Ref HM0364 \nEducation and culture.\nA number of French/Norman place names remain from the period when the island was in the jurisdiction of the Duchy of Normandy. The Herm Island map, published by the tenant of Herm, states that main place names, including the island name itself, have unclear origins, although there is an unofficial Anglicisation of names; for example, was changed to \"Alderney Point\". The primary present language on Herm is English.\nHerm has one primary school, with around eight pupils; their teacher travels from Guernsey daily. Children over eleven are schooled in Guernsey, usually as boarders.\nHerm has won Britain in Bloom categories several times: in 2002, 2008, and 2012, Herm won the Britain in Bloom Gold Award.\nThe island and its history has been depicted in a number of works of literature: the author Compton Mackenzie, who was the island tenant 1920\u201323, represented it in \"Fairy Gold\", albeit in a fictional portrayal. Jenny Wood, the wife of tenant Major Peter Wood, published her memoirs in 1986. The island's history is told in \"Hidden Treasures of Herm Island\" by Catherine Kalamis. Paul Sherman has written two collections of short stories set on the island: \"Where Seagulls Dare\" and \"One Flew Over the Puffin's Nest\".\nThe northern part of the island was recognised in 2016 as an area of international environmental importance under the Ramsar Convention.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were commanded to always lead a nomadic life. They were noted for their fidelity to the old established custom of their family in the days of Jeremiah; and this feature of their character is referred to by God for the purpose of giving point to his message to the King of Judah. As a reward for their fidelity, God proclaims that there will always be a descendant of Jonadab in his service.\nOne theory is the Rechabites belonged to the Kenites, who accompanied the Israelites into the Holy Land and dwelt among them; the sources of information are few and unclear. Kenites dwelt in cities and adopted settled habits of life. \nClaims of descent from the Rechabites.\nThe Mekhilta tells a story\u2014presumably dating to the late Second Temple period\u2014of Rechabites, known as \"sons of water drinkers\" due to their abstention from wine.\nRabbi Halafta (1st\u20132nd centuries) was a descendant of the Rechabites.\nThe apocryphal \"Story of Zosimus\", from late antiquity, details the journey of a monk named Zosimus to the \"Land of the Rechabites\".\nIn 1839 the Reverend Joseph Wolff found in Yemen, near Sana'a, a tribe claiming to be descendants of Jehonadab; and in the late nineteenth century a Bedouin tribe was found near the Dead Sea who also professed to be descendants of Jehonadab.\nMany Muslims still claim descent from Rechab, along with the nearly-universal claim of Arabs to be descended from Abraham through Ishmael (Ismail).\nSimilar later groups.\nThe term Rechabites also refers to a religious order, similar in some ways to the Nazirites, and they are mentioned by Eusebius of Emesa. \nIn more recent times, the name has been used by Christian groups keen to promote total abstinence from alcohol, such as the Independent Order of Rechabites. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution.\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}

Located in the northern portion of the Philippine archipelago, it is the economic and political center of the nation, being home to the country's capital city, Manila, as well as Quezon City, the country's most populous city. With a population of 64.3 million as of 2024[ [update]], it contains 55% of the country's total population and is the 4th most populous island in the world. It is the 15th largest island in the world by land area.\n\"Luzon\" may also refer to one of the three primary island groups in the country. In this usage, it includes the Luzon Mainland, the Batanes and Babuyan groups of islands to the north, Polillo Islands to the east, and the outlying islands of Catanduanes, Marinduque and Mindoro, among others, to the south. The islands and provinces of Masbate, Palawan and Romblon are also included, although these three are sometimes grouped with another of the island groups, the Visayas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Luzon\" is thought to derive from \"lusong\", a Tagalog word referring to a particular kind of large wooden mortar used in dehusking rice. A 2008 research paper by Eulito Bautista and Evelyn Javier provides an image of a lusong, explaining:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn old Latin, Italian, and Portuguese maps, the island is often called \"Lu\u00e7onia\" or \"Luconia\".\n\"Lu\u00e7\u00f5es,\" (also \"Luzones\" in Spanish) was a demonym used by Portuguese sailors in Malaysia during the early 1500s, referring to the Kapampangan and Tagalog people who lived in Manila Bay, which was then called \"Lusong\" (Kapampangan: \"Lusung\", ), from which Luzon was also derived. The term was also used for Tagalog settlers in Southern Tagalog region, where they created intensive contact with the Kapampangans. Eventually, the term \"Luzones\" would refer to the settlers of Luzon island, and later on, would be exclusive to the peoples of Central Luzon.\nHistory.\nBefore European colonization.\n\"Homo luzonensis\" fossils, found in Callao Cave on Luzon, represent a newly identified extinct archaic human species from at least 50,000 to 67,000 years ago.\nBefore 1000 CE, the Tagalog, Kapampangan, and Pangasinan peoples of south and central Luzon had established several major coastal polities, notably Maynila, Tondo and Namayan. The oldest known Philippine document, written in 900, is the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, which names places in and around Manila Bay and also mentions Medan, a place in Indonesia. These coastal Philippine kingdoms were thalassocracies, based on trade with neighboring Asian political entities and structured by leases between chiefs or lords (\"Datu\") and paramount lords (\"Lakan\") or Rajahs, by whom tributes were extracted and taxes were levied. These kingdoms were under the competing influence of Hinduism, Animism, or Islam. Before that, from 2500 - 2000 BCE, Kapampangans along with Sambal people and Hatang Kayi settled south Luzon; subsequently, from 1200 - 1000 BCE, the migrating Tagalog settlers from eastern Visayas or northeast Mindanao stayed in south Luzon and they made contact with the Kapampangans, Sambal people and the Hatang Kayi, of which contact with the Kapampangans was most intensive; after this, the original settlers moved northward: Kapampangans moved to modern Tondo, Navotas, and Central Luzon (modern Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Aurora, Pampanga, south Tarlac, and east Bataan), and Sambals to the modern province of Zambales, in turn, displacing the Aetas.\nThere was also a Buddhist polity known as Ma-i or Maidh, described in Chinese and Bruneian records in the 10th century, although its location is still unknown and scholars are divided on whether it is in modern-day Bay, Laguna or Bulalacao, Mindoro.\nAccording to sources at the time, the trade in large native \"Ruson-tsukuri\" (literally \"Luzon-made\", Japanese:\u5442 \u5b8b \u88fd) clay jars used for storing green tea and rice wine with Japan flourished in the 12th century, and local Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinan potters had marked each jar with Baybayin letters denoting the particular urn used and the kiln the jars were manufactured in. Certain kilns were renowned over others; prices depended on the reputation of the kiln. Of this flourishing trade, the \"Burnay\" jars of Ilocos are the only large clay jar manufactured in Luzon today with origins from this time.\nIn the early 1300s the Chinese annals, \"Nanhai zhi\", reported that Hindu Brunei invaded or administered Sarawak and Sabah as well as the Philippine kingdoms of Butuan, Sulu, and in Luzon: Ma-i (Mindoro) and Malilu \u9ebb\u88cf\u8606 (present-day Manila); Shahuchong \u6c99\u80e1\u91cd (present-day Siocon or Zamboanga), Yachen \u555e\u9673 Oton (Part of the Madja-as Kedatuan), and \u6587\u675c\u9675 Wenduling (present-day Mindanao), which would regain their independence at a later date.\nIn 1405, the Yongle Emperor appointed a Chinese governor of Luzon, Ko Ch'a-lao, during Zheng He's voyages. China also had vassals among the leaders in the archipelago. China attained ascendancy in trade with the area in Yongle's reign.Afterwards, some parts of Luzon were Islamized when the former Majapahit province of Poni broke free, converted to Islam, and imported Sharif Ali, a prince from Mecca who became the Sultan of Brunei, a nation that then expanded its realms from Borneo to the Philippines and set up the Kingdom of Maynila as its puppet-state. The invasion of Brunei spread Chinese royal descent like Ong Sum Ping's kin and Arab dynasties too into the Philippines like the clan of Sultan Sharif Ali. However, other Luzon kingdoms resisted Islam, like Pangasinan. It had remained a tributary state of China and was a largely Sinified kingdom, which maintained trade with Japan. The Polity of Cainta also existed as a fortified city-state, armed with walls and cannons. As written in the book of Dong-Xiyang kao \u6771\u897f\u6d0b\u8003, the Chinese Ming dynasty recorded that there was a \"Kingdom of Luzon\" that existed over the current island of Luzon.\nInteractions with the Portuguese.\nThe Portuguese were the first European explorers who recorded it in their charts as \"Lu\u00e7onia\" or \"Lu\u00e7on\", calling the inhabitants \"Lu\u00e7\u00f5es\". Edmund Roberts, who visited Luzon in the early 19th century, wrote that Luzon was \"discovered\" in 1521.\nPortuguese and Spanish accounts from the early to mid 1500s state that the Kingdom of Maynila was the same as the Kingdom of Luzon that was mentioned in Ming Dynasty Records (from the Tagalog or Malay name \"Lusong\" and Kapampangan name \"Lusung\"), and whose citizens had been called \"Lu\u00e7\u00f5es\".\nMany people from Luzon were employed within Portuguese Malacca. For example, the spice magnate Regimo de Raja, based in Malacca, was highly influential and was appointed as \"Temenggong\" (Sea Lord)\u2014a governor and chief general responsible for overseeing of maritime trade\u2014by the Portuguese. As \"Temenggong\", de Raja was also the head of an armada which traded and protected commerce in the Indian Ocean, the Strait of Malacca, the South China Sea, and the medieval maritime principalities of the Philippines. His father and wife carried on his maritime trading business after his death. Another important Malacca trader was Curia de Raja who also hailed from Luzon. The \"surname\" of \"de Raja\" or \"diraja\" could indicate that Regimo and Curia, and their families, were of noble or royal descent as the term is an abbreviation of Sanskrit \"adiraja\".\nFern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto noted that a number of Lu\u00e7\u00f5es in the Islamic fleets went to battle with the Portuguese in the Philippines during the 16th century. The Sultan of Aceh gave one of them (Sapetu Diraja) the task of holding Aru (northeast Sumatra) in 1540. Pinto also says one was named leader of the Malays remaining in the Moluccas Islands after the Portuguese conquest in 1511. Antonio Pigafetta notes that one of them was in command of the Brunei fleet in 1521. However, the Lu\u00e7\u00f5es did not only fight on the side of the Muslims. Pinto says they were also apparently among the natives of the Philippines who fought the Muslims in 1538.\nOn Mainland Southeast Asia, Lusung/Lu\u00e7\u00f5es warriors aided the Burmese king in his invasion of Siam in 1547. At the same time, Lusong warriors fought alongside the Siamese king and faced the same elephant army of the Burmese king in the defence of the Siamese capital at Ayutthaya. The Lu\u00e7\u00f5es were so successful in Siam that the Thai king rewarded them by having them ennobled and granted them land. Lu\u00e7\u00f5es military and trade activity reached as far as Sri Lanka in South Asia where Lungshanoid pottery made in Luzon were discovered in burials. Meanwhile in the nearby Sultanate of Aceh the Lu\u00e7\u00f5es fighting men so impressed the Sultan, that they were assigned to become the Sultan's royal guard and to be assigned as the Sultan's royal guard, is proof of Lu\u00e7oes men's physical strength, martial prowess, and masculine attractiveness; as during that time period, among medieval kingdoms, that office was delegated only to the most strong, intelligent, handsome, attractive, virile, aristocratic, and combat-worthy, of warriors.\nScholars have thus suggested that they could be mercenaries valued by all sides.\nSpanish Colonial Era.\nIn 1569, a Spanish expedition dispatched by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi led by Luis Enriquez de Guzman and Augustinian friar Alonso Jimenez first set foot in Albay. They arrived on the coastal settlement called Ibalon in present-day Magallanes, Sorsogon after exploring the islands of Masbate, Ticao and Burias and proceeded inland as far as present-day Camalig, Albay. The Spanish arrival in the 16th century saw the incorporation of the Lu\u00e7\u00f5es people and the breaking up of their kingdoms and the establishment of the \"Las Islas Filipinas\" with its capital Cebu, which was moved to Manila following the defeat of the local Rajah Sulayman in 1570. Mart\u00edn de Goiti, having been dispatched by Legazpi to Luzon, conquered Maynila. Legazpi followed with a larger fleet comprising both Spanish and a majority Visayan force, taking a month to bring these forces to bear due to slow speed of local ships. This large force caused the surrender of neighboring Tondo. An attempt by some local leaders, known as the Tondo Conspiracy, to defeat the Spanish was repelled. Legazpi renamed Maynila \"Nueva Castilla\", and declared it the capital of the Philippines, and thus of the rest of the Spanish East Indies, which also encompassed Spanish territories in Asia and the Pacific. Legazpi became the country's first governor-general. Under Spain, Luzon also came to be known as the Nueva Castilla or the New Castile. The population of Luzon at the time of the first Spanish missions is estimated as between 1 and 1.5 million, overall density being low. Moros from western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago also raided the coastal Christian areas of Luzon and the Visayas. Settlers had to fight off the Chinese pirates (who lay siege to Manila, the most famous of which was Limahong in 1573).After the successful expedition and the exploration of the North, Juan de Salcedo founded \"Villa Fernandina de Vigan\" in honor of King Philip II's son, Prince Ferdinand, who died at the age of four. From Vigan, Salcedo rounded the tip of Luz\u00f3n and proceeded to pacify Camarines, Albay, and Catanduanes. As a reward for his services to the King of Spain, Salcedo was awarded the old province of Ilocos, which consisted of the modern provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, La Union and part of Mountain Province as his hacienda (estate), and was accorded the title of \"Justicia Mayor de esta Provincia de Ylocos\" (Province Mayor of Ilocos).\nIn Spanish times, Luzon became the focal point for trade between the Americas and Asia. The Manila Galleons constructed in the Bicol region brought silver mined from Peru and Mexico to Manila. The silver was used to purchase Asian commercial goods like Chinese silk, Indian gems and Indonesian spices, which were then exported back to the Americas. The Chinese valued Luzon so much, in that when talking about Spain and the Spanish-Americas, they preferred to call it as \"Dao Lusong\" (Greater Luzon) while the original Luzon was referred to as \"Xiao (Small) Lusong\" to refer to not only Luzon but the whole Philippines.\nLuzon also became a focal point for global migration. The walled city of Intramuros was initially founded by 1200 Spanish families. The nearby district of Binondo became the center of business and transformed into the world's oldest Chinatown. There was also a smaller district reserved for Japanese migrants in Dilao. Cavite City also served as the main port for Luzon and many Mexican soldiers and sailors were stationed in the naval garrisons there. When the Spanish evacuated from Ternate, Indonesia; they settled the Papuan refugees in Ternate, Cavite which was named after their evacuated homeland. After the short British Occupation of Manila, the Indian Sepoy soldiers that mutinied against their British commanders and joined the Spanish, then settled in Cainta, Rizal.\nNewcomers who were impoverished Mexicans and peninsulares were accused of undermining the submission of the natives. In 1774, authorities from Bulacan, Tondo, Laguna Bay, and other areas surrounding Manila reported with consternation that discharged soldiers and deserters (from Mexico, Spain and Peru) were providing Indios military training for the weapons that had been disseminated all over the territory during the British war. There was also continuous immigration of Tamils and Bengalis into the rural areas of Luzon: Spanish administrators, native nobles, and Chinese businessmen imported them as slave labor during this period.\nIn the 1600s, Fr. Joaqin Martinez de Zu\u00f1iga, conducted a census of the Archdiocese of Manila which held most of Luzon under its spiritual care, and it had the following number of tributes, with each tribute representing a family of 6\u20137, and he reported 90,243 native Filipino tributes; 10,512 Chinese (Sangley) and mixed Chinese Filipino mestizo tributes; and 10,517 mixed Spanish Filipino mestizo tributes. Pure Spaniards are not counted as they are exempt from tribute. Out of these, Fr. Joaqin Martinez de Zu\u00f1iga estimated a total population count exceeding half a million souls.\nPeople from the Philippines, primarily from Luzon, were recruited by France (then in alliance with Spain), first to defend Indo-Chinese converts to Christianity being persecuted by their native governments. Eventually, Filipino mercenaries helped the French conquer Vietnam and Laos and to re-establish Cambodia as a French Protectorate. This process culminated in the establishment of French Cochinchina, centered in Saigon.\nA great number of infrastructure projects were undertaken during the 19th century that put the Philippine economy and standard of living ahead of most of its Asian neighbors and even many European countries at that time. Among them were a railway system for Luzon, a tramcar network for Manila, and Asia's first steel suspension bridge Puente Claveria, later called Puente Colgante. In the meantime, Luzonians and Filipinos living abroad; were active in the Mexican War of Independence, Argentine War of Independence, and the War of 1812 between the United States and the British Empire, at the Americas, while at the same time had fought in the Taiping Rebellion in China.\nAfter Spanish colonization.\nAfter many years of Spanish occupation and resistance to reform, the Andres Novales uprising occurred and it was inspired by the Latin American Wars of Independence. Novales' uprising was primarily supported by Mexicans living in the Philippines as well as immigrant Latinos from the now independent nations of Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Costa Rica. Although the uprising failed it inspired the Cavite Mutiny, the suppression of which, lead to the martyrdoms of Priests, Gomburza and the subsequent execution of the reformist and hero, Jose Rizal. Reeling against this, the Philippine Revolution against Spain erupted in Cavite and spread all throughout Luzon and the Philippines. Consequently, the First Philippine Republic was established in Malolos, Bulacan. In the meantime, Spain sold the Philippines to the United States and the First Philippine Republic resisted the United States in the Philippine\u2013American War which the Republic's forces lost due to its diplomatic isolation (no foreign nation recognized the First Republic) as well as due to the numerical superiority of the American military. The Americans then set up the cool mountain city of Baguio as a summer retreat for its officials. The Americans also rebuilt the capital, Manila, and established American military bases in Olongapo and Angeles cities mainly Clark Airbase and Subic Naval Base.\nDuring the Pacific War, the Philippines were considered to be of great strategic importance because their capture by Japan would pose a significant threat to the U.S. General McArthur made a successful surprise attack at Lingayen Gulf on January 9, 1945, and captured the island. As a result, 135,000 troops and 227 aircraft were stationed in the Philippines by October 1941. Luzon was captured by Imperial Japanese forces in 1942 during their campaign to capture the Philippines. General Douglas MacArthur\u2014who was in charge of the defense of the Philippines at the time\u2014was ordered to Australia, and the remaining U.S. forces retreated to the Bataan Peninsula.\nA few months after this, MacArthur expressed his belief that an attempt to recapture the Philippines was necessary. The U.S. Pacific Commander Admiral Chester Nimitz and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ernest King both opposed this idea, arguing that it must wait until victory was certain. MacArthur had to wait two years for his wish; it was 1944 before a campaign to recapture the Philippines was launched. The island of Leyte was the first objective of the campaign, which was captured by the end of December 1944. This was followed by the attack on Mindoro and later, Luzon.\nThe end of the World War necessitated decolonization due to rising nationalist movements across the world's many colonies. Subsequently, the Philippines gained independence from the United States. Luzon then arose to become the most developed island in the Philippines. However, the lingering poverty and inequality caused by the long dictatorship of US-supported dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, gave rise to the Philippine diaspora and many people from Luzon have migrated elsewhere and had established large overseas communities; mainly in the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore and Saudi Arabia. Eventually, the People Power Revolution led by Corazon Aquino and Cardinal Jaime Sin, removed Marcos and his cronies from power and they fled to Hawaii where the US granted them asylum. The following administrations are subsequently managing the political and economic recovery of the Philippines with the particular aim of spreading development outside of Luzon and into the more isolated provinces of the Visayas and Mindanao. During the administration of Ferdinand Marcos' son, Bongbong Marcos, Luzon became a destination of American and Japanese investments, it being the location of the Luzon Economic Corridor.\nGeography.\nLuzon island alone has an area of , making it the world's 15th largest island. It is bordered on the west by the South China Sea (\"Luzon Sea\" in Philippine territorial waters), on the east by the Philippine Sea, and on the north by the Luzon Strait containing the Babuyan Channel and Balintang Channel. The mainland is roughly rectangular in shape and has the long Bicol Peninsula protruding to the southeast.\nLuzon is roughly divided into four sections; Northern Luzon, Central Luzon, Southern Luzon, and Southeastern Luzon.\nPhysical.\nNorthern Luzon.\nNorthern Luzon consists of 3 clusters in three regions, the Ilocos Region, the Cordillera Administrative Region and the Cagayan Valley.\nThe northwestern portion of the island, which encompasses most of the Ilocos Region, is characterized by a flat terrain extending east from the coastline toward the Cordillera Central mountains.\nThe Cordillera mountain range, which feature the island's north-central section, is covered in a mixture of tropical pine forests and montane rainforests, and is the site of the island's highest mountain, Mount Pulag, rising at 2,922 metres. The range provides the upland headwaters of the Agno River, which stretches from the slopes of Mount Data, and meanders along the southern Cordillera mountains before reaching the plains of Pangasinan.\nThe northeastern section of Luzon is generally mountainous, with the Sierra Madre, the longest mountain range in the country, abruptly rising a few miles from the coastline. Located in between the Sierra Madre and the Cordillera Central mountain ranges is the large Cagayan Valley. This region, which is known for being the second largest producer of rice and the country's top corn-producer, serves as the basin for the Cagayan River, the longest in the Philippines.\nAlong the southern limits of the Cordillera Central lies the lesser-known Caraballo Mountains. These mountains form a link between the Cordillera Central and the Sierra Madre mountain ranges, separating the Cagayan Valley from the Central Luzon plains.\nCentral Luzon.\nThe central section of Luzon is characterized by a flat terrain, known as the Central Luzon plain, the largest in the island in terms of land area. The plain, approximately in size, is the country's largest producer of rice, and is irrigated by two major rivers; the Cagayan to the north, and the Pampanga to the south. In the middle of the plain rises the solitary Mount Arayat.\nThe western coasts of Central Luzon are typically flat extending east from the coastline to the Zambales Mountains, the site of Mount Pinatubo, made famous because of its enormous 1991 eruption. These mountains extend to the sea in the north, forming Lingayen Gulf, and to the south, forming the Bataan Peninsula. The peninsula encloses Manila Bay, a natural harbor considered to be one of the best natural ports in East Asia, due to its size and strategic geographical location.\nThe Sierra Madre mountain range continues to stretch across the western section of Central Luzon, snaking southwards into the Bicol Peninsula.\nCentral Luzon is located between the regions of Northern Luzon, Southern Luzon and Metro Manila. These are the provinces of: Aurora, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac and Zambales. The province of Aurora in the middle of the year 2002 was included in the Southern Tagalog Region. The regional center of Central Luzon is San Fernando, Pampanga.\nSouthern Luzon.\nSouthern Luzon is dominated by Laguna de Bay (Old Spanish, \"Lake of Bay town\"), the largest lake in the country. The lake is drained into Manila Bay by the Pasig River, one of the most important rivers in the country due to its historical significance and because it runs through the center of Metro Manila.\nLocated southwest of Laguna de Bay is Taal Lake, a crater lake containing the Taal Volcano, the smallest in the country. The environs of the lake form the upland Tagaytay Ridge, which was once part of a massive prehistoric volcano that covered the southern portion of the province of Cavite and the whole of Batangas province.\nSouth of Laguna Lake are two solitary mountains, Mount Makiling in Laguna and Batangas provinces, and Mount Banahaw, the highest in the region of Calabarzon.\nMainland Southern Tagalog is the current region of Calabarzon which consists of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon, and Mimaropa is Region IV-B which is considered the Southwestern Tagalog Region is in the outland. \nMetro Manila is the urban center or capital of the Philippines. It consists of 16 cities and 1 town. Its regional center is Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Metro Manila was formerly a province or province that included the name Tondo. In 1898, it included the districts and barangays of each city area as well as some towns in the province of Rizal.\nSoutheastern Luzon.\nThe southeastern portion of Luzon is dominated by the Bicol Peninsula, a mountainous and narrow region extending approximately southeast from the Tayabas Isthmus in Quezon province to the San Bernardino Strait along the coasts of Sorsogon. The area is home to several volcanoes, the most famous of which is the high symmetrically shaped Mayon Volcano in Albay province. The Sierra Madre range has its southern limits at Quezon province. Ultra-prominent mountains dot the landscape, which include Mount Isarog and Mount Iriga in Camarines Sur, and Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon.\nThe peninsula's coastline features several smaller peninsulas, gulfs and bays, which include Lamon Bay, San Miguel Bay, Lagonoy Gulf, Ragay Gulf, and Sorsogon Bay.\nIt consists of Bicolandia or Region 5 which is the last region on the island of Luzon.\nOutlying islands.\nSeveral outlying islands near mainland Luzon are considered part of the Luzon island group.\nThe largest include Palawan, Mindoro, Masbate, Catanduanes, Marinduque, Romblon and Polillo.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe island is covered by 8 administrative regions, 30 provinces and, as of 2014[ [update]], 68 cities (8 regions, 38 provinces and 71 cities if associated islands are included).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Toptextcells/style.css\" /&gt;\nTable note(s):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTectonics.\nLuzon is part of the Philippine Mobile Belt, a fast deforming plate boundary zone (Gervasio, 1967) hemmed in between two opposing subduction zones, the west-dipping Philippine Trench-East Luzon Trench subduction zone, and the east-dipping north\u2013south trending Manila Trench-Negros Trench-Cotabato Trench. The Philippine Sea Plate subducts under eastern Luzon along the East Luzon Trench and the Philippine Trench, while the South China Sea basin, part of the Eurasian Plate, subducts under western Luzon along the Manila Trench.\nThe North-Southeastern trending braided left-lateral strike-slip Philippine Fault System traverses Luzon, from Quezon province and Bicol to the northwestern part of the island. This fault system takes up part of the motion due to the subducting plates and produces large earthquakes. Southwest of Luzon is a collision zone where the Palawan micro-block collides with SW Luzon, producing a highly seismic zone near Mindoro island. Southwest Luzon is characterized by a highly volcanic zone, called the Macolod Corridor, a region of crustal thinning and spreading.\nUsing geologic and structural data, seven principal blocks were identified in Luzon in 1989: the Sierra Madre Oriental, Angat, Zambales, Central Cordillera of Luzon, Bicol, and Catanduanes Island blocks. Using seismic and geodetic data, Luzon was modeled by Galgana et al. (2007) as a series of six micro blocks or micro plates (separated by subduction zones and intra-arc faults), all translating and rotating in different directions, with maximum velocities ~100\u00a0mm/yr NW with respect to Sundaland/Eurasia.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2024 census, the population of Luzon Island itself is 59,865,193 people, making it the 4th most populated island in the world.\nCities.\nMetro Manila is the most populous of the 3 defined metropolitan areas in the Philippines and the 11th most populous in the world. as of 2007[ [update]], census data showed it had a population of 11,553,427, comprising 13% of the national population. Including suburbs in the adjacent provinces (Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal) of Greater Manila, the population is around 21 million.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEthnic groups.\nSeven major Philippine ethnolinguistic groups predominate Luzon. Ilocanos and Pangasinenses dominate northern Luzon, particularly in the Ilocos Region to parts of the Cagayan Valley, while Kapampangans, Tagalogs, Ilocanos, Pangasinans and Sambals populate Central Luzon. Tagalogs dominate the National Capital Region, Calabarzon and the island provinces of Marinduque, Mindoro and extending to parts of Palawan and northern Bicol Peninsula, while Bicolanos populate the Bicol peninsula. Visayans, such as Masbate\u00f1os, Romblomanons, Waray Sorsogonons, Cuyunons, mainly populate in the southern Bicol peninsula and island provinces of Masbate, Romblon, and Palawan.\nOther ethnic groups lesser in population include the Aetas of Zambales and Bataan, the Ibanags of Cagayan and Isabela, the Gaddang of Nueva Vizcaya, the Igorot of the Cordilleras, the Bugkalots of Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Nueva Ecija and Aurora, Umiray and Tagabul\u00f3s of Aurora and Quezon, Remontado of Quezon, and the Mangyans of Mindoro.\nDue to historical centuries-old migrations, populations of ethnic Chinese Filipinos, Spanish Filipinos, Japanese Filipinos, Indian Filipinos, and Muslim Moros from Mindanao have also been present in urban areas. Historical mixed mestizo populations, particularly Chinese mestizos (\"mestizo de Sangley\") and Spanish mestizos, and more recent mixed mestizos of Americans, Japanese, Koreans, Indians (mostly Punjabis), and Arabs are also occasionally present. The historical Sangley Chinese and their pure and mixed-mestizo descendants are spread all across Luzon of several generations across the centuries. According to old Spanish censuses, around 1/3rd of the population of Luzon are mestizo admixed with either or both Southern Han Chinese (mostly from Manila to Pampanga) and/or Hispanic (Spanish or Latino) descent (Mostly in Cavite and Manila). Most Americans have settled in Central Luzon's highly urbanized cities of Angeles and Olongapo due to the former presence of the U.S. air and naval bases (Clark &amp; Subic) there, while a majority of the Koreans and Japanese have mainly settled in the major cities and towns like Koreatown in Angeles City and Baguio and Subic.\nLanguages.\nAlmost all of the languages of Luzon belong to the Philippine group of the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. Major regional languages include: Tagalog, Ilocano, Central Bikol, Kapampangan, and Pangasinan.\nEnglish is spoken by many inhabitants. The use of Spanish as an official language declined following the American occupation of the Philippines. Almost inexistent among the general populace, Spanish is still used by the elderly of some families of great tradition (Rizal, Liboro...) and by upper and middle-class residents of Spanish blood.\nReligion.\nLike most of the Philippines, the major religion in Luzon is Christianity, with Roman Catholicism being the major denomination. Other major sects includes Jehovah's Witnesses, Protestantism, the Philippine Independent Church (Aglipayans), the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and the Iglesia ni Cristo. Indigenous traditions and rituals, though rare, are also present.\nThere are also sizable communities of Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims in Metro Manila and in other, especially, urban areas due to the immigration of Indians, Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, Moros and Muslims from other countries to the island.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of the island is centered in Metro Manila with Makati serving as the main economic and financial hub. Major companies such as Ayala, Jollibee Foods Corporation, SM Group, and Metrobank are based in the business hubs of Makati Central Business District, Ortigas Center, and Bonifacio Global City. Industry is concentrated in and around the urban areas of Metro Manila while agriculture predominates in the other regions of the island producing crops such as rice, bananas, mangoes, coconuts, pineapple, and coffee. Other sectors include livestock raising, tourism, mining, and fishing.\nAir transport.\nThe island is served by the main international airports:\nThere are also other airports in the island serving domestic air services which are:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

It was located in the tribal territorial allotment of the tribe of Gad.\nBiblical events.\nAccording to (), Ramoth-Gilead was the base of Ben-Geber, one of King Solomon's regional governors. He was responsible for (\"to him belonged\") the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, in Gilead and the region of Argob in Bashan: sixty large cities with walls and bronze gate-bars.\nIt appears to have been lost to Syria (Aram-Damascus) during the battles between the northern kingdom of Israel and Syria, as Ahab, King of Israel, proposed to go to battle to win it back. After consulting prophets about the prospects of success, Ahab went to fight for Ramoth in Gilead, aided by Jehoshaphat, King of Judah. During the battle, Ahab was wounded by an arrow. He was propped up in his chariot facing the enemy, but by evening Ahab had bled to death and the Syrians won the battle.\nLater, an incident occurred when Ahaziah and Joram fought against Hazael, king of Aram-Damascus, and Joram was wounded ().\nAlso in this city, Elisha, the prophet of God told one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu, Joram's commander, king over Israel ().\nThe British Bible scholar, Hugh J.
