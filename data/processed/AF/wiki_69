Among the first to argue that members of sexual minorities can also constitute cultural minorities were Adolf Brand, Magnus Hirschfeld, and Leontine Sagan in Germany. These pioneers were later followed by the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis in the United States.\nNot all individuals of various gender and sexual orientations self-identify with or participate in a particular subculture. Reasons include geographic distance, unawareness of the subculture's existence, fear of social stigma, or personal preference for privacy. Some have suggested that the identities defined by the Western heterosexualized cultures are based on sexuality that have serious flaws and often limit public discussion. The lack of inclusive spaces can lead to peopling rejecting who they are and ignoring their own sexual needs. This rejection can lead to people being classified under sexual identities that doesn't feel representative to them as a person. \nThese cultures continue to evolve. For example, Greece recently legalized same-sex marriage, taking a huge step for an Orthodox country.\nLGBTQ+ culture.\nLGBTQ+ culture is the shared culture among people who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and related identities, encompassing both sexual and gender minorities.\nLGBTQ+ is occasionally referred to as \"queer culture\" or \"gay culture\", but the latter term can also be specific to gay men's culture.\nLGBTQ culture varies widely by geography and the identity of the participants. Elements often identified as being common to the culture include:\nIn some cities, especially in North America, gay men and lesbians tend to live in certain neighbourhoods that celebrate or support their community.\nLGBTQ communities organize a number of events to celebrate their culture, such as Pride parades, the Gay Games and Southern Decadence.\nIn recent years, the LGBTQ+ acronym has expanded to the more inclusive but lesser-known LGBTQIA+ form, which recognizes intersex and asexual identities.\nThe inclusion of the intersex category in the acronym is debated. Some argue against its inclusion because it could transform the intersex category into an issue of gender and sexuality comparable to LGBT issues, thus driving attention away to matters related to physical traits and medical mismanagement. Others argue for its inclusion because it is what raises awareness of it to a wider audience and creates a central culture for others to gather around.\nPolyamory.\nPolyamory is the practice and associated culture of engaging in more than one consensual romantic relationship at the same time. It is sometimes associated with polysexuality, the attraction to multiple genders, though distinct in its own way. Polyamory can occur in a social group, culture, or group of people specific to a certain gender-identity or sexual orientation. In some cultures the practice of forming multiple simultaneous romantic relationships is controversial.\nPolygamy (a practice that overlaps heavily with polyamory) is the practice of legally marrying more than one person. It is against the law to marry more than one person in the United States; however, there are some countries around the world where polygamy and/or polyamorous relationships are not unusual. For example, it is not uncommon in many middle eastern cultures for men to have multiple wives. This type of polyamorous relationship is known as polygyny, whereas the opposite, in which women have multiple husbands, is called polyandry.\nThe illegal status of multiple marriages in many parts of the world has not stopped the formation of communities and sub-cultures that practice polyamory and informal polygamy. There are several accounts of attempted private polygamist communities in Western Europe and North America. However, these communities, for the most part, have eventually disbanded. In Western culture there are few examples of widespread acceptance of polyamory. This does not mean that polyamorous relationships in Western culture (and subcultures) do not exist. In the United States it is estimated that polyamory is practiced by 4-5% of the population. Polyamory exists mainly as isolated instances in which those in relationships have made agreements with their significant other(s).\nSexual fetish-based cultures.\nThe fetish subculture comprises people who share interests in a broad range of sexual fetishes and other paraphilias. Alternative terms for the fetish subculture include fetish scene and fetish community.\nThis subculture is often has a strong nightclub scene, in the form of fetish clubs.\nSome of the most common paraphilias seen in the fetish subculture include BDSM, leather fetishism and rubber fetishism. The subculture itself allows for people to come together and share their common interests in regards to sexual fetishes, allowing for a safe and supportive environment. However, there is typically a negative stigma associated with this subculture as it encourages the uncommon discussion and indulging of sexual desires in society. This often results in people rejecting such subcultures or associating it with other cultures that explore such topics, thus including the LGBTQ culture.\nInfluence on mainstream culture.\nIn recent years, sexual minority cultures influenced parts of mainstream culture. \nThe latter half of the 20th century\u2019s mainstream culture was characterized by the film industry. Previous to the civil rights movements from the 1960\u2019s to 70\u2019s, homosexuality was not depicted in films. It was banned in the Motion Picture Production Code from 1930 to 1960. Even when it was shown in films, homosexuality was associated with violent and criminal characters, such as in the 1980 film \"Cruising\".\nHowever, during the civil rights movement, certain films and their portrayals of queer sexuality and gender showed positive shifts in attitudes towards queer people. The documentary depicted queer people in mundane settings in the home, presenting them in everyday circumstances and showing their normality. The documentary and several other films at the time showed queer people as \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201crespectable\u201d characters instead of the previous violent criminals.\nYale sociology professor Joshua Gamson argues that the tabloid talk show genre, popularized by Oprah Winfrey in the 1980s provided a much needed, high impact media visibility for sexual minorities and did more to make gay culture mainstream than any other development of the 20th century. Slang frequently originates in subcultures, including sexual minority subcultures, which becomes part of the larger vernacular. \nMadonna is one of many artists who have borrowed from sexual minority cultures, including her appropriation of vogueing. The television series \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" depicts straight men being given fashion make-overs or decorating tips from gay men.\nNon-Western cultures.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIn 2006, the Thai film \"Rainbow Boys\" produced by Vitaya Saeng-aroon, depicted a contemporary gay relationship. Vitaya also produced the comedy-drama \"Club M2\", set in a gay sauna. The significance of his work was attributed to the exposure of LGBTQ communities in a culturally conservative society. Another 2007 film, \"Bangkok Love Story\", directed by Poj Arnon, was critically hailed as a departure from the stereotyped view of homosexuals as transvestites and transsexuals.\nThese filmmaker's made breakthroughs with their films as other scholars and public authors also began to bring the issue of gender and stereotypes to the forefront in contemporary culture. In many countries, homosexuality and bisexuality are widely accepted and often legal, although often still face discrimination and criticism. In this context, \"queer youth are often cast as victims of homophobic violence or heterosexist exclusion in ways that inscribe them within tropes of victimization and risk.\"\nEast Asia.\nUnlike European cultures which are primarily based in Christian religion and have a history of anti-LGBT laws, the Chinese culture was much more open about non-exclusive, non-heterosexual relationships. Though there were still restrictions in the ancient Chinese culture, homosexual relations have been documented since early historical periods. There were recordings of subcultures of prostitute/actors in existence; however, even in modern-day Chinese culture, there are those who are opposed to homosexual/bisexual relationships and lifestyles. In the People's Republic of China, \"Reportedly, Mao Zedong believed in the sexual castration of 'sexual deviants', but little is known about the Communist Chinese government's official policy with regards to homosexuality prior to the 1980s.\nIn Japan, many Japanese have adopted a wide range of sexual identity, and space has always existed for non-dominant gender roles in Japanese society. The modern era, however, has made more room for those openly varied gender roles. Before Western contact, Japan did not have a system of identification in which one's identity was determined by one's biological sexual preference (see Sexual minorities in Japan). Yet, hegemonic and culturally exalted notions of how men and women \"should\" behave are still strong in the country, same as in the Western cultures. \nEarlier studies on sex roles and gender identities in Asia focused heavily on particular constraints felt by women, for \"'[Japanese] models of citizenship implicitly privilege the male, white-collar 'citizen in a suit.'\" Constraints are also felt, however, on the males in Asian societies who are held at a higher standard due to the \"dominant paradigm\" referred to as \"hegemonic masculinity\". \"Masculinity\" has a history and is actually not only expressed differently in different societies but also differently \"within\" societies throughout eras. Masculinity, even in traditional Asian cultures is, so called, plural. Still, certain forms of masculinity (and femininity for that matter) become particularly privileged, the hegemonic masculinity.\nActivism and Advocacy.\nEarly movements.\nLGBTQ+ activism in the United States can be traced back to William Dorsey Swann, the first known person to openly identify as a \"queen of drag.\" In the late 1800s, Swann organized one of the earliest documented LGBTQ+ gatherings, where attendees, primarily men, dressed in women's clothing, marking an early form of organized resistance against discrimination. In 1924, Henry Gerber, a German immigrant and early gay rights advocate, founded the Society for Human Rights in Chicago, one of the first organizations in the U.S. dedicated to advancing homosexual rights. Gerber wrote about homosexual oppression in an attempt to build solidarity and advocate for the community.\nIn 1950, activist Harry Hay founded the Mattachine Society, one of the earliest enduring LGBTQ+ rights organizations in the U.S. The society worked to raise awareness, educate members, and connect the pursuit of social justice with LGBTQ+ rights. In 1955, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon established the Daughters of Bilitis, the first organization in the U.S. devoted specifically to lesbian advocacy, providing support, and promoting visibility for lesbian women.\nGay liberation movement (1969-1980s).\nIn 1969, police raided the Stonewall inn gay bars, which sparked the Stonewall riots and then a slew of LGBT protests for the next two decades aiming to end discrimination against gay people. Gay activism rose exponentially, and this time period was called the Gay Liberation movement.\nAfter the Stonewall riots, The Gay Liberation Front was created as an activist group seeking to take more assertive approaches to LGBT activism, which quickly spread to other nations. Organizations were formed and protests occurred in many countries around the world\nIn 1984, the International March on the United Nations for Gay and Lesbian Freedom took place where protestors marched from Sheridan Square to Dag Hammarskjold Plaza across from the UN in a demonstration to demand an end to discrimination against gays and lesbians.\nLGBTQ+ organizations.\nNumerous organizations emerged in the 20th and 21st centuries to advance LGBTQ+ rights globally. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and Lambda Legal are U.S. organizations focused on advancing legal protections and promoting social acceptance for LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly those who are transgender, people of color, or living with HIV, to ensure they are recognized as full and equal citizens. International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA) campaigns for freedom and equality for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, across continents. OutRight Action International supports LGBTQ+ individuals in restrictive regions, engaging in advocacy, providing legal aid for asylum seekers, and leading crisis interventions for LGBTQ+ communities.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The phrase originated in gay male culture in the United States and was historically an insult. Some women who associate with gay men object to being called \"fag hags\" while others embrace the term. The male counterpart, for heterosexual men who have similar interpersonal relationships with gay and bisexual men, is \"fag stag\".\nUsage.\nFag hags are frequently stereotyped as outgoing women who are seeking a substitute for heterosexual relationships, or who are secretly (or openly) sexually attracted to gay men. In fact, many women who identify as fag hags are already in romantic relationships, either with straight men or with women, but seek out the alternative experience of socializing with gay men.\nRelated terms.\nAmerican \"fag hag\" synonyms include \"fruit fly\", \"queen bee\", \"homo honey\", \"fruit loop\", \"Goldilocks\", \"flame dame\", \"fairy princess\", \"gabe\" (a portmanteau of \"gay\" and \"babe\"), \"Tori\" (in honor of Tori Spelling and Tori Amos) and \"fairy godmother\". Recently, \"cherry fairy\" has started to catch on as well in some select social groups in San Francisco and the East Coast.\nIn the case of friendships between lesbians and gay men, the term \"dyke diva\" describes the gay man in the relationship. A straight man of platonic affinity with gay men is a \"fag stag\"; again, the usage is rare in mainstream sexual culture.\nFor men who have many lesbian friends the slang terms \"dutch boy\", \"lesbro\" or \"dyke tyke\" apply.\nHeterosexuals who associate with lesbian, gay, and bisexual people may be called \"fruit flies\" regardless of their sex.\nFag hags, fag stags, etc. are regarded as belonging to the phenomenon of \"hagism\", the attachment of a person to a group defined by sexuality, even though they do not personally share that identity.\nIn the Philippines, heterosexual women who develop deep friendships or almost exclusively associate with the native \"bakla\" LGBT subculture are known as \"babaeng bakla\" (literally \"a woman who is a \"bakla\" [gay man]\"). They stereotypically acquire the mannerisms, campy sense of humor, lingo (swardspeak), and fashion sense of the \"bakla\". They are also usually more extroverted and socially dominant. It is commonly perceived as a positive self-identification, and various prominent local celebrities (like Maricel Soriano and Rufa Mae Quinto) openly identify as \"babaeng bakla\".\n\"Girlfag\" is a term similar to \"fag hag\", but designate specifically attraction, either sexually or romantically, to gay men, sometimes to the point of identifying as queer or genderqueer. Men who are attracted to lesbians/sapphics also have their slangs, such as \"lesboy\", \"guydyke\", and \"boydyke\".\nIn popular culture.\nThe term has often been used in entertainment. It was used in the lyrics of hip hop group Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's 1982 hit \"The Message\". Comedian Margaret Cho has written and regularly talks in her stand-up routines about being a fag hag. In an episode of the British TV sitcom \"Gimme Gimme Gimme\", Tom refers to Linda as a fag hag. The term was used in multiple episodes of the sitcom \"Will and Grace\" when referring to characters Grace Adler and Karen Walker as their best friends are both gay men. The term was also used in one of the episodes of \"Sex and the City\", in which Samantha overheard two women discussing her relationship with the actor Smith Jerrod, calling her a fag hag. English singer Lily Allen released a song called \"Fag Hag\" in 2008 as the B-side to \"The Fear\".\nThe first annual Miss Fag Hag Pageant took place in New York City on May 17, 2009 at Comix with judges Caroline Rhea, Michael Musto, Hedda Lettuce and Katina Corrao. Heather Shields took the first prize.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of December 2021, it has a population of 2,260.\nThe town was first mentioned in a 13th-century document. In the early 16th century it was the residence of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who used it as a site for several of his observations.\nThe town and its 14th century cathedral were badly damaged in World War II. After the war the cathedral was meticulously reconstructed and is again a popular tourist destination, listed as a Historic Monument of Poland.\nFrombork is known as \"The Jewel of Warmia\" because of its many historical sites. The Museum of Copernicus in Frombork holds exhibitions related to the astronomer, as well as to astronomy in general, and includes a planetarium. One of the biggest attractions is also the annual International Festival of Organ Music, held every summer.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe town was founded as a defensive stronghold on an Old Prussian site. In 1224 at Catania, Emperor Frederick II declared Prussia directly subordinate to the church and Holy Roman Empire. Later in the same year the pope assigned Bishop William of Modena as the papal legate to Prussia. With the imperial Golden Bull of Rimini, the Teutonic Knights were granted control of the region, which they subsequently conquered. According to a local legend, the Old Prussian inhabitants were baptised by Anselm of Meissen, a priest of the Teutonic Knights and the first Bishop of the Bishopric of Warmia which was created in 1242 by William of Modena.\nSupposedly when the stronghold's lord died, his widow Gertruda offered the settlement to the bishop, and in her honor it was named \"Frauenburg\" (German for \"Our Lady's fortress\", \"Castrum Dominae Nostrae\" in Latin). This name is not unique in German, as it usually originates in the construction of a fortified chapel, church, or monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary or inhabited by nuns. Several places were thus named Frauenburg or Marienburg, like the nearby Marienburg castle and city (now Malbork).\nThe village was first mentioned in a 1278 document signed by Bishop Heinrich Fleming. On 8 July 1310, Bishop Eberhard of Neisse granted the town L\u00fcbeck city rights, as used by many member cities of the Hanseatic League. It was described, still rather unspecifically, as \"Civitas Warmiensis\" (\"Warmian city\").\nIn 1329\u20131388, the magnificent Brick Gothic cathedral (now the Archcathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Andrew) was built, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, or \"Our Lady\".\nOver the centuries, the cathedral has been expanded and rebuilt repeatedly. There are also several other historic churches, dedicated to St. Nicholas, St. George, and St. Anne, all built in the 13th century.\nCopernican era.\nIn 1414, the town was plundered and burned during the Hunger War between the Teutonic Knights and Poland. In 1440, the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, at the request of which Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. In 1454, the Warmian Chapter paid homage to King Casimir IV Jagiellon, recognizing him as rightful ruler. In retaliation the Teutonic Knights invaded the town in the same year. In 1455, Czech mercenaries in the service of Poland, commanded by Jan Skalski, took back the city. Frombork was recognized as part of the Polish Kingdom by the Second Peace of Thorn (1466). It became an important town of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia and part of the province of Royal Prussia within the larger Greater Poland Province. The town was also devastated after a raid by Albert, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights in 1520 during the Polish\u2013Teutonic War of 1519\u20131521.\nIn the Middle Ages, the inhabitants were mainly merchants, farmers and fishermen. The most famous resident was the astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus, who lived and worked here as a canon (1512\u201316 and 1522\u201343). Copernicus is said to have jokingly called it \"Weiberstadt\" (\"Wives' Town\") or \"Gynepolis\" (in Medieval Greek). In 1519 Copernicus wrote to the King of Poland, asking for help against the Teutonic Knights who were threatening the city. The letter however was intercepted, and the Teutonic Knights took and burned the city (Copernicus and other canons had left the city shortly before).\nThe astronomer wrote his epochal work, \"De revolutionibus orbium c\u0153lestium\" in Frombork. In his book, written in Latin, Copernicus used the Latin name of the town and region - \"Frueburgo Prussiae\". Shortly after its 1543 publication, Copernicus died there and was buried in the town's cathedral where there is a monument to him bearing the inscription \"\" (Most renowned astronomer, whose name and glory filled both worlds). His grave was thought to have been found by archaeologists in 2005, when the body was exhumed and subsequently confirmed in November 2008 by the publication of the results of DNA tests on fragments of bone and hair found on the skeleton. The body was reinterred on Sunday May 23, 2010 in the Catholic church of Frombork. Hair that matched two strands of hair which belonged to Copernicus are currently located in Uppsala University.\nIn the northwest corner of the cathedral grounds is Copernicus' tower, and in the southwest corner an octagonal building with a square bell tower and a small planetarium and a Foucault's pendulum. From atop the tower one can survey the town, the tiny harbor, the panorama of the Baltic Sea, and much of Warmia's countryside.\nModern history.\nFrombork suffered destruction and heavy population losses during the Polish\u2013Swedish wars. Between 1626 and 1635 it was occupied by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden who looted the cathedral and shipped many cultural artifacts, including Copernicus' manuscripts to Sweden. Further destruction followed during the Deluge (Swedish invasion of Poland of 1655\u20131660), the Great Northern War and the War of the Fourth Coalition.\nAfter the First Partition of Poland (1772) the town was taken over by the Kingdom of Prussia and in 1773 it became part of the newly established province of East Prussia. Following the unsuccessful Polish November Uprising, hundreds of Polish insurgents, including professors and students of the Wilno University, were interned in the town in 1832. With the unification of Germany in 1871, Frauenburg became part of the German Empire. The \"Preu\u00dfische Ostbahn\" railway line was opened in 1899 connecting Elbing (present-day Elbl\u0105g) and Braunsberg (present-day Braniewo) via Frauenburg, leading further to the Russian border at Eydtkuhnen (present-day Chernyshevskoye). Passenger services on the railway line ceased in early 2006.\nAfter German surrender in World War II, sovereignty over the town was ceremoniously transferred to Polish authorities on August 5, 1945. The unilateral Soviet transfer of power to Poland was accepted according to the Potsdam Agreement, however, under preliminary terms. Towards and after the end of World War II the German inhabitants had either been evacuated or expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The town was resettled by Poles, many of whom were expelle\u00e9s from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union.\nIn 1959, Frombork regained its city rights. Having been heavily (70%) damaged in World War II, it was rebuilt by Polish Boy Scouts and others in 1966\u20131973, in time for the 500th anniversary of Copernicus' birth. Between 1975 and 1998 Frombork was part of the Elbl\u0105g Voivodeship.\nToday, Frombork is regaining its importance as a tourist destination, aided by its key location just south of the frontier with the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast. Although the railway through Frombork closed in 2006, the port has seasonal ferry connections with Elbl\u0105g, Krynica Morska and Kaliningrad.\nSights.\nThe greatest landmark of Frombork is the fortified Cathedral Hill with the Gothic Archcathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Andrew, where Nicolaus Copernicus is buried, the Copernicus Tower, the Radziejowski Tower, which contains a Foucault pendulum, the Old Bishop's Palace, which houses the Nicolaus Copernicus Museum, and other historical buildings. Other sights include:\nMonuments.\nSeveral monuments are on display in Frombork (see external links):\nTransport.\nFrombork is located at the intersection of Voivodeship roads 504 and 505.\nFrom Frombork, it is possible to sail from the pier in Krynica Morska by water tram via Tolkmicko or by ship.\nAlthough inactive since 2013, Frombork's railway station rests on line No. 254 (formerly \"Nadzalewowa Railway\").\nIn the year 1897, the construction of the Nadzalewowa Railway (\"German: Haffuferbahn, HUB\") began - a railway line that was intended by German designers to connect Elbl\u0105g with K\u00f6nigsberg (\"Polish: Kr\u00f3lewiec\"). In May 1899, the section from Elbl\u0105g to Frombork was completed, and in September, the segment connecting Frombork to Braniewo was put into service.\nRegular passenger train service on the route was suspended on April 1, 2006. Since then, only special and freight trains operated here. In the years 2010 and 2011, thanks to the efforts of the Pomorskie Society of Railway Enthusiasts, special services were resumed during the summer, on Saturdays and Sundays, running from Grudzi\u0105dz and Elbl\u0105g to Braniewo, with stops at this station. The last passenger train stopped here on July 7, 2013.\nSports.\nThe local football club is Zalew Frombork. It competes in the lower leagues.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns - sister cities.\nFrombork is twinned with:\nFormer twin towns.\nOn 24 March 2022, Frombork terminated its partnership with Russian and Belarusian cities as a response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68272", "revid": "39594876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68272", "title": "Trill (music)", "text": "Rapid alternation between two adjacent notes\n&lt;score&gt;\n \\relative c\" {\n \\time 2/4\n c8 b16 a b4\\trill c4\n&lt;/score&gt; Example of a trill, on the quarter note B. and\n&lt;score&gt;\n \\relative c {\n g8 f e d cis4.-+ d8 d1\n&lt;/score&gt; Baroque cadence parfaite ('authentic cadence' trill). \nThe trill (or shake, as it was known from the 16th until the early 20th century) is a musical ornament consisting of a rapid alternation between two adjacent notes, usually a semitone or tone apart, which can be identified with the context of the trill (compare mordent and tremolo). It is sometimes referred to by the German Triller, the Italian trillo, the French trille or the Spanish trino. A cadential trill is a trill associated with each cadence. A groppo or gruppo is a specific type of cadential trill which alternates with the auxiliary note directly above it and ends with a musical turn as additional ornamentation. \nA trill provides rhythmic interest, melodic interest, and\u2014through dissonance\u2014harmonic interest. Sometimes it is expected that the trill will end with a turn (by sounding the note below rather than the note above the principal note, immediately before the last sounding of the principal note), or some other variation. Such variations are often marked with a few appoggiaturas following the note bearing the trill indication.\nNotation.\nIn most modern musical notation, a trill is generally indicated with the letters \"tr\" (or sometimes simply \"t\") above the trilled note. This has sometimes been followed by a wavy line, and sometimes, in the baroque and early classical periods, the wavy line was used on its own. In those times the symbol was known as a chevron. The following two notations are equivalent:\n&lt;score lang=\"lilypond\"&gt; {\n \\relative c\" {\n \\time 2/4\n g2\\trill\n g\\startTrillSpan \\stopTrillSpan\n&lt;/score&gt;\nBoth the \"\"tr\"\" and the wavy line are necessary for clarity when the trill is expected to be applied to more than one note (or to tied notes). Also, when attached to a single notehead in one part that corresponds to smaller note values in another part, it leaves no room for doubt if both the letter and line are used.\nThe usual way of executing a trill, known as a diatonic trill, is to rapidly alternate between the written note and the one directly above it in the given scale (unless the trill symbol is modified by an accidental, understood to apply to the added note above; this is a chromatic trill).\n&lt;score vorbis=\"1\"&gt; {\n \\relative c\" {\n \\time 2/4\n g32[ a g \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]\n g32[ a g \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]\n&lt;/score&gt;\nThis is an alternative trill:\n&lt;score vorbis=\"1\"&gt; {\n \\relative c\" {\n \\time 2/4\n a32[ g a \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 g \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 a g a g]\n a32[ g a \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 g \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 a g a g]\n&lt;/score&gt;\nThese examples are approximations of how trills may be executed. In many cases, the rate of the trill does not remain constant as indicated here, but starts slower and increases. Whether it is played this way or not is largely a matter of taste.\nThe number of alternations between the notes played in a trill can vary according to the length of the notated note. At slower tempos, a written note lasts longer, meaning more notes can be played in the trill applied to it; but at fast tempo and with a short note, a trill may be reduced to nothing more than the indicated note, the note above it, and the indicated note again, in which case it resembles an upper mordent. \nTrills may also be started on the note above the notated note (the \"auxiliary note\"). Additionally, a trill is often ended by playing the note \"below\" the notated one, followed by the note itself.\nIn specific styles.\nIn baroque music.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The taste for cadences (like the taste for sequences), and with them the obligation to bring in their implied cadential trills, was... ingrained in baroque musicianship... For those who do not like cadences, sequences, and cadential trills, baroque music is not the scene.\u2014\u200a\nHugo Riemann described the trill as \"the chief and most frequent\" of all musical embellishments. In the baroque period, a number of signs indicating specific patterns with which a trill should be begun or ended were used. In the \"Klavierb\u00fcchlein f\u00fcr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach\", Johann Sebastian Bach lists a number of these signs together with the correct way to interpret them. Unless one of these specific signs is indicated, the details of how to play the trill are up to the performer. In general, however, trills in this era are executed beginning on the auxiliary note, before the written note, often producing the effect of a harmonic suspension which resolves to the principal note. But, if the note preceding the ornamented note is itself one scale degree above the principal note, then the dissonant note has already been stated, and the trill typically starts on the principal note.\nSeveral trill symbols and techniques common in the Baroque and early Classical era have fallen entirely out of use, including for instance the brief \"Pralltriller\", represented by a very brief wavy line, referred to by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach in his \"Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments\" (\"Versuch\") (1753\u20131762).\nBeyond the baroque era, specific signs for ornamentation are very rare. Continuing through the time of Mozart, the default expectations for the interpretation of trills continued to be similar to those of the baroque. In music after the time of Mozart, the trill usually begins on the principal note.\nAll of these are only rules of thumb, and, together with the overall rate of the trill and whether that rate is constant or variable, can only be determined by considering the context in which the trill appears, and is usually to a large degree a matter of opinion with no single \"right\" way of executing the ornament.\nOn specific instruments.\nThe trill is frequently found in classical music for all instruments, although it is more easily executed on some than others. For example, while it is relatively easy to produce a trill on the flute, the proper execution on brass instruments requires higher skill and is produced by quickly alternating partials. While playing a trill on the piano the pianist may find that it becomes increasingly difficult to execute a trill including the weak fingers of the hand (3, 4 and 5), with a trill consisting of 4 and 5 being the hardest. On the guitar, a trill can be either a series of hammer-ons and pull-offs (generally executed using just the fingers of the fretting hand, but players can use both hands), or a rapidly plucked pair of notes on adjacent strings, known as a cross-string trill. Trill keys are used to rapidly alternate between a note and an adjacent note often in another register on woodwind instruments. On the bowed instruments, the violin and the viola in particular, the trill is relatively easy to execute, with a straightforward bowing and the trill involving the oscillation of just one finger against the main note which is stopped by the finger behind, or more rarely, the open string.\nOn brass instruments.\nTrills may be performed on valveless brass instruments by rapidly slurring between two adjacent notes by means of the embouchure \u2013 this is colloquially known as a \"lip trill.\" This was a common practice on the natural trumpets and natural horns of the Baroque/Classical era. However the lip trill is often still used in the modern French horn in places where the harmonics are only a tone apart (though this can be difficult for inexperienced players). Such trills are also a stylistic feature of jazz music, particularly in trumpet parts.\nVocal trills.\nVocal music of the classical tradition has included a variety of ornaments known as trills since the time of Giulio Caccini. In the preface to his Le nuove musiche, he describes both the \"shake\" (what is commonly known today as the trill) and the \"trill\" (now often called a Baroque or Monteverdi trill). However, by the time of the Italian bel canto composers such as Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini, the rapid alternation between two notes that Caccini describes as a shake was known as a trill and was preferred.\nColoratura singers, particularly the high-voiced sopranos and tenors, are frequently required to trill not only in the works of these composers but in much of their repertoire. Soprano Dame Joan Sutherland was particularly famed for the evenness and rapidity of her trill, and stated in an interview that she \"never really had to learn how to trill\". The trill is usually a feature of an ornamented solo line, but choral or chorus trills do appear.\nDespite the trill being written in many works for voice, a singer with an even, rapid trill is a rarity. Opinion is divided as to if and how well a trill can be taught or learnt, though mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne frequently stated that she gained her trill by a commonly taught exercise, alternating between two notes, starting slowly and increasing velocity over time. The director of the Rossini Opera Festival, Alberto Zedda has opined in interview that the \"widespread technical deficiency\", the inability to trill, is a source of \"frustration and anguish\". In fact, whole performances and recordings, especially of bel canto works, have been judged based on performance\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of trills, especially trills written \"in the score\" as opposed to trills in a cadenza or variation.\nTrillo.\nThe word \"trillo\" is sometimes used to mean the same as trill. However, in early music some refer to a related ornament specifically called \"trillo\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Trillo is the least familiar of the vocal maneuvers, and, in present day usage, is performed either on a single note or as a technique for executing rapid scale-like passages. Perceptually, it is heard as a rhythmic interruption, or near interruption, of phonation that typically begins slowly with individual pulses separated by a short silent period and then often increases in rate to something resembling a vocal imitation of machine gun firing, albeit without the accompanying cacophony.\nMontserrat Caball\u00e9 was a known exponent of the \"trillo\", as can be heard from her famous 1974 \"Norma\".\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Delegates of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (Viet Cong), as well as several smaller groups, participated in its creation.\nThe PRG was recognized as the government of South Vietnam by most socialist states and Malta. It signed the 1973 Paris Peace Treaty as an independent entity, separate from both South Vietnam and North Vietnam. After the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, the PRG formally replaced the Republic of Vietnam to become the nominal and representative government of South Vietnam under the official name Republic of South Vietnam (), inheriting all properties, rights, obligations and sovereignty representation of the Republic of Vietnam. On 2 July 1976, the Republic of South Vietnam and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam constitutionally merged to form the current Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\nHistory.\nThe Provisional Revolutionary Government was preceded by the \"Vietnam Alliance of National, Democratic, and Peaceful Forces\" (VANDPF) made up of anti-government forces and headed by Trinh Dinh Thao. The Alliance was a collection of individuals who wanted a new South Vietnamese government but disagreed with the ever-present Northern Communist presence.\nDiscussions about forming an alliance had begun as early as 1966, but plans were disrupted when South Vietnamese intelligence agents apprehended a prominent anti-government figure, Ba Tra. Ba Tra gave the South Vietnamese government extensive information on anti-government forces working in the city. This setback was compounded by his identification of one of the key cadre in the financial division.\nUnder torture, Ba Tra identified more figures in the underground, who were then arrested. By 1967, the entire Saigon organization had been sent further underground.\nIn early 1969, the then-new American president, Richard Nixon, started a process of Vietnamization to allow the American Armed Forces to withdraw from South Vietnam.\n1969\u20131975.\nOn 8 June 1969 delegates from the Vietcong, the VANDPF, the People's Revolutionary Party (the South Vietnamese communist party) and \"the usual assortment of mass organizations, ethnic groups, and geopolitical regions\" met off Route 22 in Cambodia's Fishhook region and formed the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG). Banners displayed prominently at the convention proclaimed that \"South Vietnam is independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral\".\nFollowing the military and political results of the 1968 Tet Offensive and related military offensives in the South by Saigon and the United States, in which the Vietcong suffered serious military losses, the PRG was envisioned as a political counter-force that could influence international public opinion in support of reunification and in opposition to the United States and South Vietnam.\nThe declared purpose of the PRG was to provide a formal governmental structure to the NLF and enhance its claim of representing \"the Southern people\". Included in this strategy was the pursuit of a negotiated settlement to the war leading to reunification, organized during the initial phase of Vietnamization. According to Justice Minister Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Nh\u01b0 T\u1ea3ng, the new group's main purpose was to help the NLF \"acquire a new international stature.\"\nDuring 1969\u201370, most of the PRG's cabinet ministries operated near the Cambodian border. Starting on 29 March to late April 1970, the US and South Vietnamese offensives forced the PRG to flee deeper into Cambodia. The stressful escape caused many of the PRG officials (such as Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Nh\u01b0 T\u1ea1ng) to need extensive medical furloughs. After Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Nh\u01b0 T\u1ea1ng returned, he noticed that new cadres from the north were causing problems for the non-communist members of the PRG. One member in particular, Ba Cap, harshly denounced most of the PRG as bourgeois. T\u1ea1ng complained to the higher members of the DRV government, but was rebuffed. T\u1ea1ng later saw this as the point when the PRG turned from being an independent South Vietnam-based alternative government to being a mouthpiece for the communist movement.\nThe central bodies of the PRG functioned as a provisional government. The PRG maintained diplomatic relations with many countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, such as Algeria and SFR Yugoslavia as well as with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.\n1975\u20131976.\nAfter the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, the PRG assumed power in South Vietnam and subsequently participated in the reunification of Vietnam.\nAccording to professor (University of Maine), mid-July 1975, the delegates of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n L\u01b0u) and the Republic of South Vietnam (\u0110inh B\u00e1 Thi) applied to join the United Nations (UN) as two independent member states. However, both countries failed in joining the United Nations due to American vetoes on 11 August and 30 September 1975 as the USSR and China refused to allow South Korea to join the organization on 6 August. However, North Vietnam and North Vietnam-controlled South Vietnam became two UN observers in 1975. Kuwait was the last country to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of South Vietnam on 22 and 24 January 1976, before North and South Vietnam were eventually reunited on 2 July 1976.\nCulture.\nMusic.\nThe national anthem of the Government was \"Liberate the South\" (Vietnamese: ). The song was written in 1961 by L\u01b0u H\u1eefu Ph\u01b0\u1edbc (1921\u20131989) and adopted at that time as the anthem of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (Viet Cong).\nIn 1966, L\u01b0u H\u1eefu Ph\u01b0\u1edbc wrote a military song \"March on Saigon\" () as an encouragement the soldiers going to attack Saigon in the Tet Offensive. The song was spread again during the fall of Saigon.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has been described as the greatest experimentalist of antiquity and a representative of the Hellenistic scientific tradition.\nHero published a well-recognized description of a steam-powered device called an \"aeolipile\", also known as \"Hero's engine\". Among his most famous inventions was a windwheel, constituting the earliest instance of wind harnessing on land. In his work \"Mechanics\", he described pantographs. Some of his ideas were derived from the works of Ctesibius.\nIn mathematics, he wrote a commentary on Euclid's \"Elements\" and a work on applied geometry known as the \"Metrica\". He is mostly remembered for Heron's formula; a way to calculate the area of a triangle using only the lengths of its sides.\nMuch of Hero's original writings and designs have been lost, but some of his works were preserved in manuscripts from the Byzantine Empire and, to a lesser extent, in Latin or Arabic translations.\nLife and career.\nAlmost nothing is known about Hero's life, including his birthplace and background. The first extant mention of him is references to his works found in Book VIII of Pappus's \"Collection\" (4th century AD), and scholarly estimates for Hero's dates range from 150 BC to 250 AD. Otto Neugebauer (1938) noted a lunar eclipse observed in Alexandria and Rome used as a hypothetical example in Hero's \"Dioptra\", and found that it best matched the details of an eclipse in 62 AD; A. G. Drachmann subsequently surmised that Hero personally observed the eclipse from Alexandria. However, Hero does not explicitly say this, his brief mention of the eclipse is vague, and he might instead have used some earlier observer's data or even made up the example.\nAlexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, and by Hero's time was a cosmopolitan city, part of the Roman Empire. The intellectual community, centered around the Mouseion (which included the Library of Alexandria), spoke and wrote in Greek; however, there was considerable intermarriage between the city's Greek and Egyptian populations. It has been inferred that Hero taught at the Mouseion because some of his writings appear to be lecture notes or textbooks in mathematics, mechanics, physics and pneumatics. Although the field was not formalized until the twentieth century, it is thought that works of Hero, in particular those on his automated devices, represented some of the first formal research into cybernetics.\nInventions.\nA number of devices and inventions have been ascribed to Hero, including the following:\nMathematics.\nHero described an iterative algorithm for computing square roots, now called Heron's method, in his work \"Metrica\", alongside other algorithms and approximations. Today, however, his name is most closely associated with Heron's formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its side lengths. Hero also reported on a method for calculating cube roots. In solid geometry, the Heronian mean may be used in finding the volume of a frustum of a pyramid or cone.\nHero also described a shortest path algorithm, that is, given two points A and B on one side of a line, find a point C on the straight line that minimizes AC + BC. This led him to formulate the principle of the shortest path of light: If a ray of light propagates from point A to point B within the same medium, the path-length followed is the shortest possible (Hero's principle). In the Middle Ages, Ibn al-Haytham expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and the principle was later stated in this form by Pierre de Fermat in 1662; the most modern form is that the optical path is stationary.\nBibliography.\nThe most comprehensive edition of Hero's works was published in five volumes in Leipzig by the publishing house Teubner in 1903.\nWorks known to have been written by Hero include:\nWorks that have been preserved only in Arabic translations:\nWorks that sometimes have been attributed to Hero, but are now thought most likely to have been written by someone else:\nWorks that are preserved only in fragments:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The words \"microtone\" and \"microtonal\" were coined before 1912 by Maud MacCarthy Mann in order to avoid the misnomer \"quarter tone\" when speaking of the srutis of Indian music. Prior to this time the term \"quarter tone\" was used, confusingly, not only for an interval actually half the size of a semitone, but also for all intervals (considerably) smaller than a semitone. It may have been even slightly earlier, perhaps as early as 1895, that the Mexican composer Juli\u00e1n Carrillo, writing in Spanish or French, coined the terms \"microtono\"/\"micro-ton\" and \"microtonalismo\"/\"micro-tonalit\u00e9\".\nIn French, the usual term is the somewhat more self-explanatory \"micro-intervalle\", and French sources give the equivalent German and English terms as \"Mikrointervall\" (or \"Kleinintervall\") and \"micro interval\" (or \"microtone\"), respectively. \"Microinterval\" is a frequent alternative in English, especially in translations of writings by French authors and in discussion of music by French composers. In English, the two terms \"microtone\" and \"microinterval\" are synonymous. The English analogue of the related French term, \"micro-intervalit\u00e9\", however, is rare or nonexistent, normally being translated as \"microtonality\"; in French, the terms \"micro-ton\", \"microtonal\" (or \"micro-tonal\"), and \"microtonalit\u00e9\" are also sometimes used, occasionally mixed in the same passage with \"micro-intervale\" and \"micro-intervalit\u00e9\".\nEzra Sims, in the article \"Microtone\" in the second edition of the \"Harvard Dictionary of Music\" defines \"microtone\" as \"an interval smaller than a semitone\", which corresponds with Aristoxenus's use of the term \"diesis\". However, the unsigned article \"Comma, Schisma\" in the same reference source calls comma, schisma, and diaschisma \"microintervals\" but not \"microtones\", and in the fourth edition of the same reference (which retains Sims's article on \"Microtone\") a new \"Comma, Schisma\" article by Andr\u00e9 Barbera calls them simply \"intervals\". In the second edition of \"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", Paul Griffiths, Mark Lindley, and Ioannis Zannos define \"microtone\" as a musical rather than an acoustical entity: \"any musical interval or difference of pitch distinctly smaller than a semitone\", including \"the tiny enharmonic melodic intervals of ancient Greece, the several divisions of the octave into more than 12 parts, and various discrepancies among the intervals of just intonation or between a sharp and its enharmonically paired flat in various forms of mean-tone temperament\", as well as the Indian sruti, and small intervals used in Byzantine chant, Arabic music theory from the 10th century onward, and similarly for Persian traditional music and Turkish music and various other Near Eastern musical traditions, but do not actually name the \"mathematical\" terms schisma, comma, and diaschisma.\n\"Microtone\" is also sometimes used to refer to individual notes, \"microtonal pitches\" added to and distinct from the familiar twelve notes of the chromatic scale, as \"enharmonic microtones\", for example.\nIn English the word \"microtonality\" is mentioned in 1946 by Rudi Blesh who related it to microtonal inflexions of the so-called \"blues scales\". In Court B. Cutting's 2019 \"Microtonal Analysis of \u201cBlues Notes\u201d and the Blues Scale\", he states that academic studies of the early blues concur that its pitch scale has within it three microtonal \u201cblue notes\u201d not found in 12 tone equal temperament intonation. It was used still earlier by W. McNaught with reference to developments in \"modernism\" in a 1939 record review of the \"Columbia History of Music, Vol. 5\". In German the term \"Mikrotonalit\u00e4t\" came into use at least by 1958, though \"Mikrointervall\" is still common today in contexts where very small intervals of early European tradition (diesis, comma, etc.) are described, as e.g. in the new \"Geschichte der Musiktheorie\" while \"Mikroton\" seems to prevail in discussions of the avant-garde music and music of Eastern traditions. The term \"microinterval\" is used alongside \"microtone\" by American musicologist Margo Schulter in her articles on medieval music.\nMicrotonal.\nThe term \"microtonal music\" usually refers to music containing very small intervals but can include any tuning that differs from Western twelve-tone equal temperament. Traditional Indian systems of 22 \u015bruti; Indonesian gamelan music; Thai, Burmese, and African music, and music using just intonation, meantone temperament or other alternative tunings may be considered microtonal. Microtonal variation of intervals is standard practice in the African-American musical forms of spirituals, blues, and jazz.\nMany microtonal equal divisions of the octave have been proposed, usually (but not always) in order to achieve approximation to the intervals of just intonation.\nTerminology other than \"microtonal\" has been used or proposed by some theorists and composers. In 1914, A. H. Fox Strangways objected that \"'heterotone' would be a better name for \u015bruti than the usual translation 'microtone'\". Modern Indian researchers yet write: \"microtonal intervals called shrutis\". In Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia in the 1910s and 1920s the usual term continued to be \"Viertelton-Musik\" (quarter tone music), and the type of intervallic structure found in such music was called the \"Vierteltonsystem\", which was (in the mentioned region) regarded as the main term for referring to music with microintervals, though as early as 1908 Georg Capellan had qualified his use of \"quarter tone\" with the alternative term \"Bruchtonstufen (Viertel- und Drittelt\u00f6ne)\" (fractional degrees (quarter and third tones)). Despite the inclusion of other fractions of a whole tone, this music continued to be described under the heading \"Vierteltonmusik\" until at least the 1990s, for example in the twelfth edition of the \"Riemann Musiklexikon\", and in the second edition of the popular \"Brockhaus Riemann Musiklexikon\".\nIvan Wyschnegradsky used the term \"ultra-chromatic\" for intervals smaller than the semitone and \"infra-chromatic\" for intervals larger than the semitone; this same term has been used since 1934 by ethnomusicologist Victor Belaiev (Belyaev) in his studies of Azerbaijan and Turkish traditional music. A similar term, \"subchromatic\", has been used by theorist Marek \u017dabka. Ivor Darreg proposed the term \"xenharmonic\" in March 1966; see xenharmonic music. The Austrian composer Franz Richter Herf and the music theorist Rolf Maedel, Herf's colleague at the Salzburg Mozarteum, preferred using the Greek word \"ekmelic\" when referring to \"all the pitches lying outside the traditional twelve-tone system\". Some authors in Russia and some musicology dissertations disseminate the term (microchromatics), coined in the 1970s by Yuri Kholopov, to describe a kind of 'intervallic genus' () for all possible microtonal structures, both ancient (as enharmonic genus\u2014\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u2014of Greeks) and modern (as quarter tone scales of Alois Haba); this generalization term allowed also to avoid derivatives such as \"\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\" (microtonality, which could be understood in Russian as a sub-tonality, which is subordinate to the dominating tonality, especially in the context of European music of the 19th century) and \"\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\" (microtonic, \"a barely perceptible tonic\"; see a clarification in Kholopov [2000]). Other Russian authors use the more international adjective 'microtonal' and have rendered it in Russian as '\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439', but not 'microtonality' ('\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c'). However, the terms '\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c' and '\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430' are also used. Some authors writing in French have adopted the term \"micro-intervallique\" to describe such music. Italian musicologist Luca Conti dedicated two of his monographs to \"microtonalismo\", which is the usual term in Italian, and also in Spanish (e.g., as found in the title of Ru\u00e9 [2000]). The analogous English form, \"microtonalism\", is also found occasionally instead of \"microtonality\", e.g., \"At the time when serialism and neoclassicism were still incipient a third movement emerged: microtonalism\".\nThe term \"macrotonal\" has been used for intervals wider than twelve-tone equal temperament, or where there are \"fewer than twelve notes per octave\", though \"this term is not very satisfactory and is used only because there seems to be no other\". The term \"macrotonal\" has also been used for musical form.\nExamples of this can be found in various places, ranging from Claude Debussy's impressionistic harmonies to Aaron Copland's chords of stacked fifths, to John Luther Adams' \"Clouds of Forgetting\", \"Clouds of Unknowing\" (1995), which gradually expands stacked-interval chords ranging from minor 2nds to major 7thsm. Louis Andriessen's \"De Staat\" (1972\u20131976) contains a number of \"augmented\" modes that are based on Greek scales but are asymmetrical to the octave.\nHistory.\n&lt;score&gt;{ \\omit Score.TimeSignature \\relative c' { \\override NoteHead.duration-log = #0 \\hide Stem e feh geses a b ceh deses e } }&lt;/score&gt; &lt;br&gt;Greek Dorian mode (enharmonic genus) on E, divided into two tetrachords.\nThe Hellenic civilizations of ancient Greece left fragmentary records of their music, such as the Delphic Hymns. The ancient Greeks approached the creation of different musical intervals and modes by dividing and combining tetrachords, recognizing three genera of tetrachords: the enharmonic, the chromatic, and the diatonic. Ancient Greek intervals were of many different sizes, including microtones. The enharmonic genus in particular featured intervals of a distinctly \"microtonal\" nature, which were sometimes smaller than 50\u00a0cents, less than half of the contemporary Western semitone of 100\u00a0cents. In the ancient Greek enharmonic genus, the tetrachord contained a semitone of varying sizes (approximately 100\u00a0cents) divided into two equal intervals called dieses (single \"diesis\", \u03b4\u03af\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2); in conjunction with a larger interval of roughly 400\u00a0cents, these intervals comprised the perfect fourth (approximately 498\u00a0cents, or the frequency ratio of in just intonation). Theoretics usually described several diatonic and chromatic genera (some as chroai, \"coloration\" of one specific intervallic type), but the enarmonic genus was always the only one (argumented as one with the smallest intervals possible).\nGuillaume Costeley's \"Chromatic Chanson\", \"Seigneur Dieu ta piti\u00e9\" of 1558 used meantone (which almost exactly equals 19 equal temperament) and explored the full compass of 19\u00a0pitches in the octave.\nThe Italian Renaissance composer and theorist Nicola Vicentino (1511\u20131576) worked with microtonal intervals and built a keyboard with 36 keys to the octave known as the archicembalo. While theoretically an interpretation of ancient Greek tetrachordal theory, in effect Vicentino presented a circulating system of quarter-comma meantone, maintaining major thirds tuned in just intonation in all keys.\nIn 1760 the French flautist Charles de Lusse published a treatise, \"L'Art de la flute traversiere\", all surviving copies of which conclude with a composition (possibly added a year or two after the actual publication of the volume) incorporating several quarter tones, titled \"Air \u00e0 la grecque\", accompanied by explanatory notes tying it to the realization of the Greek enharmonic genus and a chart of quarter tone fingerings for the entire range of the one-keyed flute. Shortly afterward, in a letter published in the \"Mercure de France\" in September\u00a01764, the celebrated flautist Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin mentioned this piece and expressed an interest in quarter tones for the flute.\nJacques Fromental Hal\u00e9vy composed a cantata \"Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e encha\u00een\u00e9\" for a solo voice, choir and orchestra (premiered in 1849), where in one movement (\"Choeur des Oc\u00e9anides\") he used quarter tones, to imitate the enharmonic genus of Greeks.\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, quarter tones received attention from such composers as Charles Ives, Juli\u00e1n Carrillo, Alois H\u00e1ba, Ivan Wyschnegradsky, and Mildred Couper.\nAlexander John Ellis, who in the 1880s produced a translation of Hermann Helmholtz's \"On the Sensations of Tone\", proposed an elaborate set of exotic just intonation tunings and non-harmonic tunings. Ellis also studied the tunings of non-Western cultures and, in a report to the Royal Society, stated that they used neither equal divisions of the octave nor just intonation intervals. Ellis inspired Harry Partch immensely.\nDuring the Exposition Universelle of 1889, Claude Debussy heard a Balinese gamelan performance and was exposed to non-Western tunings and rhythms. Some scholars have ascribed Debussy's subsequent innovative use of the whole-tone (six equal pitches per octave) tuning in such compositions as the \"Fantaisie for piano and orchestra\" and the Toccata from the suite \"Pour le piano\" to his exposure to the Balinese gamelan at the Paris exposition, and have asserted his rebellion at this time \"against the rule of equal temperament\" and that the gamelan gave him \"the confidence to embark (after the 1900 world exhibition) on his fully characteristic mature piano works, with their many bell- and gong-like sonorities and brilliant exploitation of the piano's natural resonance\". Still others have argued that Debussy's works like \"L'isle joyeuse\", \"La cath\u00e9drale engloutie\", \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\", \"La mer\", \"Pagodes\", \"Danseuses de Delphes\", and \"Cloches \u00e0 travers les feuilles\" are marked by a more basic interest in the microtonal intervals found between the higher members of the overtone series, under the influence of Helmholtz's writings. Emil Berliner's introduction of the phonograph in the 1890s allowed much non-Western music to be recorded and heard by Western composers, further spurring the use of non- tunings.\nMajor microtonal composers of the 1920s and 1930s include Alois H\u00e1ba (quarter tones, or 24\u00a0equal pitches per octave, and sixth tones), Juli\u00e1n Carrillo (, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96\u00a0equal pitches to the octave embodied in a series of specially custom-built pianos), Ivan Wyschnegradsky (third tones, quarter tones, sixth tones and twelfth tones, non octaving scales) and the early works of Harry Partch (just intonation using frequencies at ratios of prime integers 3, 5, 7, and 11, their powers, and products of those numbers, from a central frequency of G-196).\nProminent microtonal composers or researchers of the 1940s and 1950s include Adriaan Daniel Fokker (), Partch (continuing to build his handcrafted orchestra of microtonal just intonation instruments), and Eivind Groven.\nDigital synthesizers from the Yamaha TX81Z (1987) on and inexpensive software synthesizers have contributed to the ease and popularity of exploring microtonal music.\nMicrotonality in electronic music.\nElectronic music facilitates the use of any kind of microtonal tuning, and sidesteps the need to develop new notational systems. In 1954, Karlheinz Stockhausen built his electronic \"Studie II\" on an 81-step scale starting from 100\u00a0Hz with the interval of 51/25 between steps, and in \"Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge\" (1955\u201356) he used various scales, ranging from seven up to sixty equal divisions of the octave. In 1955, Ernst Krenek used 13 equal-tempered intervals per octave in his Whitsun oratorio, \"Spiritus intelligentiae, sanctus\".\nIn 1979\u201380 Easley Blackwood composed a set of \"Twelve Microtonal Etudes for Electronic Music Media,\" a cycle that explores all of the equal temperaments from 13 notes to the octave through 24 notes to the octave, including 15-ET and 19-ET. \"The project,\" he wrote, \"was to explore the tonal and modal behavior of all [of these] equal tunings..., devise a notation for each tuning, and write a composition in each tuning to illustrate good chord progressions and the practical application of the notation\".\nIn 1986, Wendy Carlos experimented with many microtonal systems including just intonation, using alternate tuning scales she invented for the album \"Beauty In the Beast\". \"This whole formal discovery came a few weeks after I had completed the album, \"Beauty in the Beast\", which is wholly in new tunings and timbres\".\nIn 2016, electronic music composed with arbitrary microtonal scales was explored on the album \"Radionics Radio: An Album of Musical Radionic Thought Frequencies\" by British composer Daniel Wilson, who derived his compositions' tunings from frequency-runs submitted by users of a custom-built web application replicating radionics-based electronic soundmaking equipment used by Oxford's De La Warr Laboratories in the late 1940s, thereby supposedly embodying thoughts and concepts within the tunings.\nFinnish artist Aleksi Per\u00e4l\u00e4 works exclusively in a microtonal system known as the Colundi sequence.\nLimitations of some synthesizers.\nThe MIDI 1.0 specification does not directly support microtonal music, because each note-on and note-off message only represents one chromatic tone. However, microtonal scales can be emulated using pitch bending, such as in LilyPond's implementation.\nAlthough some synthesizers allow the creation of customized microtonal scales, this solution does not allow compositions to be transposed. For example, if each B note is raised one quarter tone, then the \"raised 7th\" would only affect a C major scale.\nMicrotonality in rock music.\nEarly microtonal guitars focused on issues with the 12-tone equal temperament system. In 1829, Thomas Perronet Thompson designed the Enharmonic Guitar that featured small holes where frets could be inserted. Later developments from Luthier Ren\u00e9 Lac\u00f4te and Paul Kochendorfer include an adjustable ebony-mounted frets and levers to simultaneously adjust multiple frets. A form of microtone known as the blue note is an integral part of rock music and one of its predecessors, the blues. The blue notes, located on the third, fifth, and seventh notes of a diatonic major scale, are flattened by a variable microtone. Joe Monzo has made a microtonal analysis of the song \"Drunken Hearted Man\", written and recorded by the delta blues musician Robert Johnson.\nMusicians such as Jon Catler have incorporated microtonal guitars like 31-tone equal tempered guitar and a 62-tone just intonation guitar in blues and jazz rock music.\nEnglish rock band Radiohead has used microtonal string arrangements in their music, such as on \"How to Disappear Completely\" from the album \"Kid A\".\nAmerican band Secret Chiefs 3 has been making its own custom \"microtonal\" instruments since the mid 1990s. The proprietary tuning system they use in their \"Ishraqiyun\" aspect is ratio-based, not equal temperament. The band's leader Trey Spruance, also of Mr. Bungle, challenges the terminology of \"microtonality\" as a development that instead of liberating tonal sensibility to a universe of diverse possibilities, both new and historical, instead mainly serves to reinforce the idea that the universal standard for \"tone\" is the (western) semitone.\nAustralian band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard utilises microtonal instruments, including custom microtonal guitars modified to play in 24-TET tuning. Tracks with these instruments appear on their albums \"Flying Microtonal Banana\", \"K.G\", and \"L.W.\".\nAmerican band Horse Lords uses just intonation, playing hand-modified guitars with repositioned frets.\nAmerican band The Mercury Tree began incorporating microtonality in their 2014 album \"Countenance\", using quarter tones on the song \"Vestigial\". In their 2016 album \"Permutations\", they continued exploring quarter tones, and the track \"Ether / Ore\" was composed using the Carlos Alpha tuning. Their 2018 collaborative EP with Cryptic Ruse, titled \"Cryptic Tree\", utilized both 23-TET and 17-TET. The 2019 album \"Spidermilk\" and the 2023 album \"Self Similar\" both feature 17 notes per octave, with the latter also including tracks in 34-TET and 68-TET.\nVentifacts, a prog-rock and folk songwriting duo between Ben Spees (of The Mercury Tree) and Damon Waitkus (of Jack O' the Clock) have made music which is exclusively microtonal. The tuning systems they use are free pitch, 24-TET, 17-TET, 22-TET, 10-TET and 20-TET.\nAmerican band Dollshot used quarter tones and other microtonal intervals in their album \"Lalande\".\nAustralian alternative musician Jack Tickner uses a just intonation guitar in releases like his 2018 EP \"Reassuring Weight\"."}

Ten of those successfully landed on the surface of the planet. Due to the extreme conditions, the probes could only survive for a short period on the surface, from 23 minutes to two hours.\nThe \"Venera\" program established a number of precedents in space exploration, among them being the first human-made devices to enter the atmosphere of another planet (Venera 3 on 1 March 1966), the first to make a soft landing on another planet (Venera 7 on 15 December 1970), the first to return images from another planet's surface (Venera 9 on 8 June 1975), the first to record sounds on another planet (Venera 13 on 30 October 1981), and the first to perform high-resolution radar mapping scans (Venera 15 on 2 June 1983).\nThe Venera probes.\nVenera 1 and 2.\nThe first Soviet attempt at a flyby probe to Venus was launched on 4 February 1961, but failed to leave Earth orbit. In keeping with the Soviet policy at that time of not announcing details of failed missions, the launch was announced under the name Tyazhely Sputnik (\"Heavy Satellite\"). It is also known as Venera 1VA.\nAs with some of the Soviet Union's other planetary probes, the later versions were launched in pairs, with a second vehicle launched soon after the first.\nVenera 1 and Venera 2 were intended to fly past Venus without entering orbit. Venera 1 was launched on 12 February 1961. Telemetry on the probe failed seven days after launch. It is believed to have passed within of Venus and remains in heliocentric orbit. Venera 2 launched on 12 November 1965, but also suffered a telemetry failure after leaving Earth orbit.\nSeveral other failed attempts at Venus flyby probes were launched by the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, but were not announced as planetary missions at the time, and hence did not officially receive the \"Venera\" designation.\nVenera 3 to 6.\nThe Venera 3 to 6 probes were similar. Weighing approximately one ton, and launched by the Molniya-type booster rocket, they included a cruise \"bus\" and a spherical atmospheric entry probe. The probes were optimised for atmospheric measurements, but not equipped with any special landing apparatus. Although it was hoped they would reach the surface still functioning, the first probes failed almost immediately, thereby disabling data transmission to Earth.\nVenera 3 became the first human-made object to impact another planet's surface as it crash-landed on 1 March 1966. However, as the spacecraft's data probes had failed upon atmospheric penetration, no data from within the Venusian atmosphere were retrieved from the mission.\nOn 18 October 1967, Venera 4 became the first spacecraft to measure the atmosphere of another planet. This spacecraft first showed the major gas of Venus's atmosphere to be CO2. While the Soviet Union initially claimed the craft reached the surface intact, re-analysis, including atmospheric occultation data from the American Mariner 5 spacecraft that flew by Venus the day after its arrival, demonstrated that Venus's surface pressure was 75\u2013100 atmospheres, much higher than Venera 4's 25 atm hull strength, and the claim was retracted.\nRealizing the ships would be crushed before reaching the surface, the Soviets launched Venera 5 and Venera 6 as atmospheric probes. Designed to jettison nearly half their payload prior to entering the planet's atmosphere, these craft recorded 53 and 51 minutes of data, respectively, while slowly descending by parachute before their batteries failed.\nAround that time it became increasingly known that Venus was unlikely to have liquid bodies of water, however the designs for the Soviet \"Venera\" probes still considered the possibility of a water landing as late as 1964.\nVenera 7.\nThe Venera 7 probe, launched in August 1970, was the first one designed to survive Venus's surface conditions and to make a soft landing. Massively overbuilt to ensure survival, it had few experiments on board, and scientific output from the mission was further limited due to an internal switchboard failure that stuck in the \"transmit temperature\" position. Still, the control scientists succeeded in extrapolating the pressure (90 atm) from the temperature data with , which resulted from the first direct surface measurements. The Doppler measurements of the Venera 4 to 7 probes were the first evidence of the existence of zonal winds with high speeds of up to 100 metres per second (330 ft/s, 362\u00a0km/h, 225 mph) in the Venusian atmosphere (super rotation). Along with the pressure and temperature data acquired Venera 7 also measured atmospheric composition.\nVenera 7's parachute failed shortly before landing very close to the surface. It impacted at and toppled over, but survived. This caused antenna misalignment making the radio signal very weak, but it was detected (with temperature telemetry) for 23 more minutes before its batteries expired. Thus, it became, on 15 December 1970, the first human-made probe to transmit data from the surface of Venus.\nVenera 8.\nVenera 8, launched in 1972, was equipped with an extended set of scientific instruments for studying the surface (gamma-spectrometer etc.). The cruise bus of Venera 7 and 8 was similar to that of earlier ones, with the design ascending to the Zond 3 mission. The lander transmitted data during the descent and landed in sunlight. It measured the light level but had no camera. It transmitted data for almost an hour.\nVenera 9 to 12.\nFollowing the failed Kosmos 482, the 1975 Venera 9 and 10 probes and 1978 Venera 11 and 12 probes were of a different design. They weighed approximately five tons and were launched by the powerful Proton booster. They included a transfer and relay bus that had engines to brake into Venus orbit and to serve as receiver and relay for the entry probe's transmissions. The entry probe was attached to the top of the bus in a spherical heat shield. The probes were optimized for surface operations with an unusual design that included a spherical compartment to protect the electronics from atmospheric pressure and heat for as long as possible. Beneath this was a shock-absorbing \"crush ring\" for landing. Above the pressure sphere was a cylindrical antenna structure and a wide, dish-shaped structure that resembled an antenna but was actually an aerobrake. They were designed to operate on the surface for a minimum of 30 minutes. Instruments varied on different missions, but included cameras and atmospheric and soil analysis equipment. All four landers had problems with some or all of their camera lens caps not releasing.\nThe Venera 9 lander operated for at least 53 minutes and took pictures with one of two cameras; the other lens cap did not release. These were the first pictures ever taken on the surface of another planet.\nThe Venera 10 lander operated for at least 65 minutes and took pictures with one of two cameras; the other lens cap did not release.\nThe Venera 11 lander operated for at least 95 minutes but neither camera's lens cap released.\nThe Venera 12 lander operated for at least 110 minutes but neither camera's lens cap released.\nVenera 13 and 14.\nVenera 13 and 14 (1981\u201382) each had a descent craft/lander that contained most of the instrumentation and electronics, and a flyby spacecraft that was used as a communications relay. The design was similar to the earlier Venera 9\u201312 landers. They carried instruments to take scientific measurements of the ground and atmosphere once landed, including cameras, a microphone, a drill and surface sampler, and a seismometer. They also had instruments to record electric discharges during its descent phase through the Venusian atmosphere.\nThe two descent craft landed about apart, just east of the eastern extension of an elevated region known as Phoebe Regio. The Venera 13 lander survived for 127 minutes, and the Venera 14 lander for 57 minutes, where the planned design life was only 32 minutes. The Venera 14 craft had the misfortune of ejecting the camera lens cap directly under the surface compressibility tester arm, and returned information for the compressibility of the lens cap rather than the surface. The descent vehicles transmitted data to the buses, which acted as data relays as they flew by Venus.\nVenera 15 and 16.\nThe 1983 Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft were orbiter missions, similar to previous probes, but the entry probes were replaced with surface imaging radar equipment. Radar imaging was necessary to penetrate the dense cloud of Venus and both missions included identical synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and radio altimeter systems. The SAR system was crucial in the mapping efforts of the mission and featured an 8-month operational tour to capture Venus's surface at a resolution of 1 to 2 kilometers (0.6 to 1.2 miles). When the system was switched to radio altimeter mode the antenna operated at an 8-centimeter wavelength band to send and receive signals off of the Venusian surface over a period of 0.67 milliseconds. \nThe results were a detailed map of the reflectivity distribution over the surface of the Venusian Northern Hemisphere. The linear distance measurements that were taken ranged from 91 to 182 kilometers. The twin Soviet spacecraft flew in near-polar elliptical orbits and succeeded in mapping the top half of the northern atmosphere (from the north pole to 30 degrees N latitude, about 115\u00a0million square kilometers or 71\u00a0million square miles) by the end of the main mission. An altimeter provided topographical data with a height resolution of 50 m (164 feet), and an East German instrument mapped surface temperature variations.\nVeGa probes.\nThe VeGa (Cyrillic: \u0412\u0435\u0413\u0430) probes to Venus and comet 1/P Halley launched in 1984 also used this basic Venera design, including landers but also atmospheric balloons which relayed data for about two days. \"VeGa\" is a portmanteau of the words \"Venera\" (Venus in Russian) and \"Gallei\" (Halley in Russian).\nFuture.\nVenera-D.\nVenera-D is a proposed mission to Venus that would include a highly capable orbiter and a lander. From the standpoint of total mass delivered to Venus, the best launch opportunities occur in 2026 and 2031; however, as of March 2021, Venera-D is planned for launch no earlier than November 2029. Venera-D could incorporate some NASA components, including balloons, a subsatellite for plasma measurements, or a long-lived (24 hours) surface station on the lander.\nScientific findings.\nThere were many scientific findings from the data retrieved by the Venera probes making them pivotal in our understanding of Venus. The Venera probes provided direct data regarding Venus's surface and atmosphere while also providing important information on electronics lifetime under Venus's harsh conditions. Venera 4 was the first successful probe, and showed that CO2 is the main component in Venus's atmosphere. Venera 7 found the temperature and pressure data as well as the atmospheric composition. Venera 8 measured the K, U, and Th on the surface through gamma-ray analysis. Venera 9 provided the first images of the surface of Venus as well as more gamma-ray analysis. By sending the first images of Venus's surface back to Earth the Venera missions provided scientists with the ability to relay the achievements with the public. Venera 13 provided the first color images and X-ray fluorescence data of the surface of the planet. After analyzing the radar images returned from Venera 15 and 16, it was concluded that the ridges and grooves on the surface of Venus were the result of tectonic deformations. This was found by radar imaging while in orbit. Even with their short lifetimes, the Venera missions each added significant understanding of our sister planet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Europe, three classes of peasants existed: non-free slaves, semi-free serfs, and free tenants. Peasants might hold title to land outright (fee simple), or by any of several forms of land tenure, among them socage, quit-rent, leasehold, and copyhold.\nIn some contexts, \"peasant\" has a pejorative meaning, even when referring to farm laborers. As early as in 13th-century Germany, the concept of \"peasant\" could imply \"rustic\" as well as \"robber\", as the English term villain/villein. In 21st-century English, the word \"peasant\" can mean \"an ignorant, rude, or unsophisticated person\".\nThe word rose to renewed popularity in the 1940s\u20131960s as a collective term, often referring to rural populations of developing countries in general, as the \"semantic successor to 'native', incorporating all its condescending and racial overtones\".\nThe word peasantry is commonly used in a non-pejorative sense as a collective noun for the rural population in the poor and developing countries of the world. Via Campesina, an organization claiming to represent the rights of about 200 million farm-workers around the world, self-defines as an \"International Peasant's Movement\" as of 2019[ [update]]. The United Nations and its Human Rights Council prominently uses the term \"peasant\" in a non-pejorative sense, as in the UN \"Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas\" adopted in 2018. In general English-language literature, the use of the word \"peasant\" has steadily declined since about 1970.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"peasant\" is derived from the 15th-century French word , meaning one from the \"pays\", or countryside; ultimately from the Latin , or outlying administrative district.\nSocial position.\nPeasants typically made up the majority of the agricultural labour force in a pre-industrial society. The majority of the people\u2014according to one estimate 85% of the population\u2014in the Middle Ages were peasants.\nThough \"peasant\" is a word of loose application, once a market economy had taken root, the term \"peasant proprietors\" was frequently used to describe the traditional rural population in countries where smallholders farmed much of the land. More generally, the word \"peasant\" is sometimes used to refer pejoratively to those considered to be \"lower class\", perhaps defined by poorer education and/or a lower income.\nMedieval European peasants.\nThe open field system of agriculture dominated most of Europe during medieval times and endured until the nineteenth century in many areas. Under this system, peasants lived on a manor presided over by a lord or a bishop of the church. Peasants paid rent or labor services to the lord in exchange for their right to cultivate the land. Fallowed land, pastures, forests, and wasteland were held in common. The open field system required cooperation among the peasants of the manor. It was gradually replaced by individual ownership and management of land.\nThe relative position of peasants in Western Europe improved greatly after the Black Death had reduced the population of medieval Europe in the mid-14th century, resulting in more land for the survivors and making labor more scarce. In the wake of this disruption to the established order, it became more productive for many laborers to demand wages and other alternative forms of compensation, which ultimately led to the development of widespread literacy and the enormous social and intellectual changes of the Enlightenment.\nThe evolution of ideas in an environment of relatively widespread literacy laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution, which enabled mechanically and chemically augmented agricultural production while simultaneously increasing the demand for factory workers in cities, who became what Karl Marx called the proletariat. The trend toward individual ownership of land, typified in England by Enclosure, displaced many peasants from the land and compelled them, often unwillingly, to become urban factory-workers, who came to occupy the socio-economic stratum formerly the preserve of the medieval peasants.\nThis process happened in an especially pronounced and truncated way in Eastern Europe. Lacking any catalysts for change in the 14th century, Eastern European peasants largely continued upon the original medieval path until the 18th and 19th centuries. Serfdom was abolished in Russia in 1861, and while many peasants would remain in areas where their family had farmed for generations, the changes did allow for the buying and selling of lands traditionally held by peasants, and for landless ex-peasants to move to the cities. Even before emancipation in 1861, serfdom was on the wane in Russia. The proportion of serfs within the empire had gradually decreased \"from 45\u201350 percent at the end of the eighteenth century, to 37.7 percent in 1858.\"\nEarly modern Germany.\nIn Germany, peasants continued to center their lives in the village well into the 19th century. They belonged to a corporate body and helped to manage the community resources and to monitor community life. In the East they had the status of serfs bound permanently to parcels of land. A peasant is called a \"Bauer\" in German and \"Bur\" in Low German (pronounced in English like \"boor\").\nIn most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord\u2014typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages' communal life centered on church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.\nFrance.\nInformation about the complexities of the French Revolution, especially the fast-changing scene in Paris, reached isolated areas through both official announcements and long-established oral networks. Peasants responded differently to different sources of information. The limits on political knowledge in these areas depended more on how much peasants chose to know than on bad roads or illiteracy. Historian Jill Maciak concludes that peasants \"were neither subservient, reactionary, nor ignorant.\"\nIn his seminal book \"Peasants into Frenchmen: the Modernization of Rural France, 1880\u20131914\" (1976), historian Eugen Weber traced the modernization of French villages and argued that rural France went from backward and isolated to modern and possessing a sense of French nationhood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He emphasized the roles of railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription. He based his findings on school records, migration patterns, military-service documents and economic trends. Weber argued that until 1900 or so a sense of French nationhood was weak in the provinces. Weber then looked at how the policies of the Third Republic created a sense of French nationality in rural areas. The book was widely praised, but some argued that a sense of Frenchness existed in the provinces before 1870.\nChinese farmers.\nFarmers in China have been sometimes referred to as \"peasants\" in English-language sources. However, the traditional term for farmer, \"nongfu\" (), simply refers to \"farmer\" or \"agricultural worker\". In the 19th century, Japanese intellectuals reinvented the Chinese terms \"fengjian\" () for \"feudalism\" and \"nongmin\" (), or \"farming people\", terms used in the description of feudal Japanese society. These terms created a negative image of Chinese farmers by making a class distinction where one had not previously existed. Anthropologist Myron Cohen considers these terms to be neologisms that represented a cultural and political invention. He writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This divide represented a radical departure from tradition: F.\u00a0W. Mote and others have shown how especially during the later imperial era (Ming and Qing dynasties), China was notable for the cultural, social, political, and economic interpenetration of city and countryside. But the term \"nongmin\" did enter China in association with Marxist and non-Marxist Western perceptions of the \"peasant,\" thereby putting the full weight of the Western heritage to use in a new and sometimes harshly negative representation of China's rural population. Likewise, with this development Westerners found it all the more \"natural\" to apply their own historically derived images of the peasant to what they observed or were told in China. The idea of the peasant remains powerfully entrenched in the Western perception of China to this very day.\nWriters in English mostly used the term \"farmers\" until the 1920s, when the term \"peasant\" came to predominate, implying that China was feudal, ready for revolution, like Europe before the French Revolution. This Western use of the term suggests that China is stagnant, \"medieval\", underdeveloped, and held back by its rural population. Cohen writes that the \"imposition of the historically burdened Western contrasts of town and country, shopkeeper and peasant, or merchant and landlord, serves only to distort the realities of the Chinese economic tradition\".\nLatin American farmers.\nIn Latin America, the term \"peasant\" is translated to \"Campesino\" (from campo\u2014country person), but the meaning has changed over time. While most before the 20th century were in equivalent status to peasants\u2014they usually did not own land and had to make payments to or were in an employment position towards a landlord (the hacienda system), most Latin American countries saw one or more extensive land reforms in the 20th century. The land reforms of Latin America were more comprehensive initiatives that redistributed lands from large landholders to former peasants\u2014farm workers and tenant farmers. Hence, many Campesinos in Latin America today are closer smallholders who own their land and do not pay rent to a landlord, rather than peasants who do not own land.\nThe Catholic Bishops of Paraguay have asserted that \"Every campesino has a natural right to possess a reasonable allotment of land where he can establish his home, work for [the] subsistence of his family and a secure life\".\nHistoriography.\nIn medieval Europe society was theorized as being organized into three estates: those who work, those who pray, and those who fight. The Annales School of 20th-century French historians emphasized the importance of peasants. Its leader Fernand Braudel devoted the first volume\u2014called \"The Structures of Everyday Life\"\u2014of his major work, \"Civilization and Capitalism 15th\u201318th Century\" to the largely silent and invisible world that existed below the market economy.\nOther research in the field of peasant studies was promoted by Florian Znaniecki and Fei Xiaotong, and in the post-1945 studies of the \"great tradition\" and the \"little tradition\" in the work of Robert Redfield. In the 1960s, anthropologists and historians began to rethink the role of peasant revolt in world history and in their own disciplines. Peasant revolution was seen as a Third World response to capitalism and imperialism.\nThe anthropologist Eric Wolf, for instance, drew on the work of earlier scholars in the Marxist tradition such as Daniel Thorner, who saw the rural population as a key element in the transition from feudalism to capitalism. Wolf and a group of scholars criticized both Marx and the field of Modernization theorists for treating peasants as lacking the ability to take action. James C. Scott's field observations in Malaysia convinced him that villagers were active participants in their local politics even though they were forced to use indirect methods. Many of these activist scholars looked back to the peasant movement in India and to the theories of the revolution in China led by Mao Zedong starting in the 1920s. The anthropologist Myron Cohen, however, asked why the rural population in China were called \"peasants\" rather than \"farmers\", a distinction he called political rather than scientific. One important outlet for their scholarly work and theory was \"The Journal of Peasant Studies\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He started writing films for Roger Corman, including \"The Tomb of Ligeia\" in 1964, and was later part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking.\nTowne wrote and won an Academy Award for Roman Polanski's \"Chinatown\" (1974); starring Jack Nicholson, widely considered one of the greatest screenplays ever written, as well as its sequel, \"The Two Jakes\" (1990). For Hal Ashby, he penned the comedy-dramas \"The Last Detail\" (1973) and \"Shampoo\" (1975). He collaborated with Tom Cruise on the films \"Days of Thunder\" (1990), \"The Firm\" (1993) and the first two installments of the \"\" franchise (1996, 2000).\nTowne directed the sports dramas \"Personal Best\" (1982) and \"Without Limits\" (1998), the crime thriller \"Tequila Sunrise\" (1988), and the romantic drama \"Ask the Dust\" (2006).\nEarly life.\nTowne was born Robert Bertram Schwartz in Los Angeles, California, the son of Helen and Lou Schwartz, a clothing store owner and property developer who changed the family's name from \"Schwartz\" to \"Towne.\" Towne grew up in San Pedro and Rolling Hills and attended Chadwick School. His family was Jewish, and had emigrated from Romania on his father's side and Russia on his mother's. He had a younger brother, Roger, who co-wrote the 1984 film \"The Natural\" starring Robert Redford.\nHe graduated from Pomona College in Claremont, California, studying philosophy and literature. After college, Towne served in the U.S. Army before doing odd jobs including working as a tuna fisherman.\nCareer.\nRoger Corman.\nTowne originally sought work as a writer and actor. He took an acting class with Roger Corman taught by Jeff Corey where his classmates also included Jack Nicholson (with whom he shared an apartment), Irvin Kershner, and Sally Kellerman.\nCorman was known for giving work to untested people of talent. Towne wrote the screenplay for the Corman-financed \"Last Woman on Earth\" (1960), in which Towne also played one of the lead roles.\nThe following year he also starred in the Corman-financed \"Creature from the Haunted Sea\" (1961).\nTelevision.\nTowne started writing for television on such programs as \"The Lloyd Bridges Show\", \"Breaking Point\", \"The Outer Limits\", and \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\".\nHe also wrote a screenplay for the Corman-directed \"The Tomb of Ligeia\" (1965). In 1981 Towne said \"I worked harder on... [that] screenplay for him than on anything I think I have ever done.\"\nTowne went back to working in television when Corman hired him to write a script for a Western, which became \"A Time for Killing\" (1967). Corman left the project during filming and Towne took his name off the credits. Towne said later he \"hated\" the film.\nScript doctor.\nTowne's script for \"A Time for Killing\" had been read and admired by Warren Beatty, who asked Towne to help out on the script for \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967). Towne later claimed his main contributions were removing the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois relationship between Bonnie, Clyde, and C.W., making some structural changes. Towne was on set during filming and continued to work during post-production. The film was a huge success and although Towne's contribution was credited only as a \"special consultant\", he began to earn a reputation in Hollywood as a top script doctor.\nTowne was credited on \"Villa Rides\" (1968), which he later said he did as a favor for Robert Evans, head of Paramount. He hated the experience.\nTowne did uncredited work on the scripts for \"Drive, He Said\" (1971), directed by Jack Nicholson; \"Cisco Pike\" (1972), which Towne said turned into \"a pretty good movie\" but where he got \"so angry with the director\" he took his name off; and \"The New Centurions\" (1972), where he was to share credit with Stirling Silliphant but asked for his name to be taken off after he saw the film.\nHe did uncredited work for Francis Ford Coppola during the making of \"The Godfather\" (1972), including the final scene between Michael and Vito in a garden, shortly before Vito dies. Coppola later thanked Towne for writing this pivotal and \"very beautiful\" scene in his Academy Award speech for Best Screenplay.\nTowne also did some work on \"The Parallax View\" (1974) at the behest of star Warren Beatty.\n\"The Last Detail\", \"Chinatown\", and \"Shampoo\".\nTowne received acclaim and was nominated in the Best Original and Adapted Screenplay categories for his scripts \"The Last Detail\" (1973), \"Chinatown\" (1974), and \"Shampoo\" (1975).\nHe won for \"Chinatown\". He later said it was inspired by a chapter in Carey McWilliams's \"Southern California Country: An Island on the Land\" (1946) and a \"West\" magazine article on Raymond Chandler's Los Angeles.\nAccording to Sam Wasson's \"The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years of Hollywood\", Towne \"secretly employed an old college friend named Edward Taylor as his uncredited writing partner for more than 40 years.\" (Taylor died in 2013).\nTowne was credited for his work on \"The Yakuza\" (1975) and did script doctoring on \"The Missouri Breaks\" (1976), \"Orca\" (1977) and \"Heaven Can Wait\" (1978).\nDirector.\nTowne turned to directing with \"Personal Best\" (1982). He also wrote the script for \"\", hoping to direct, but \"Personal Best\" was a financial failure, and he had to sell the \"Greystoke\" script. He grew dissatisfied with the production and credited his dog, P. H. Vazak, with the script. Vazak became the first dog nominated for an Academy Award for screenwriting.\nTowne did uncredited work on \"Deal of the Century\" (1983), \"8 Million Ways to Die\" (1986), \"Tough Guys Don't Dance\" (1987) and \"Frantic\" (1988).\nHis second feature film as director was \"Tequila Sunrise\" (1988), which he wrote back in the early 1980s. Towne told \"The New York Times\" that \"Tequila Sunrise\" is \"a movie about the use and abuse of friendship.\"\n\"The Two Jakes\".\nTowne expressed his disappointment in \"The Two Jakes\" in many interviews. He told writer Alex Simon, \"In the interest of maintaining my friendships with Jack Nicholson and Robert Evans, I\u2019d rather not go into it, but let\u2019s just say \"The Two Jakes\" wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience for any of us. But, we\u2019re all still friends, and that\u2019s what matters most.\"\nIn a November 5, 2007, interview with MTV, Jack Nicholson claimed that Towne had written the part of Gittes specifically for him and had conceived \"Chinatown\" as a trilogy, with the third film set in 1968 and dealing in some way with Howard Hughes. Towne said he did not know how the rumour started and denied any planned trilogy.\nTom Cruise.\nTowne wrote the script for \"Days of Thunder\" (1990) and formed a close friendship with its star Tom Cruise.\nHe was one of the writers on Cruise's \"The Firm\" (1993), then Beatty's \"Love Affair\" (1994). Cruise brought him on to \"\" (1996) and co-produced Towne's third film as director, \"Without Limits\" (1998). He also co-wrote \"Mission Impossible II\" (2000) for Cruise.\nLater career.\nA project Towne had long sought to bring to the screen came to fruition in 2006 with \"Ask the Dust\", a romantic period piece set in Los Angeles based on the novel by John Fante and starring Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek. Towne had found the novel decades earlier during his research for \"Chinatown\", as he was looking for authentic descriptions of 1930s Los Angeles. He enjoyed the book, considering it \"the best book about Los Angeles ever written\", and arranged a meeting with Fante, himself a screenwriter. As a result of that meeting, Towne was granted the screen rights to the novel. The rights eventually lapsed, and the new owner was Mel Brooks. In 1993, Towne wrote the script for free in exchange for the chance to direct the film. Tom Cruise (with Paula Wagner and Cruise/Wagner Productions) served as one of the film's producers. \"Ask the Dust\" received mixed reviews and failed at the box office. The film was entered into the 28th Moscow International Film Festival.\nTowne framed several of his signature films as elaborate melodramas. He told \"The New York Times\" \"I think melodrama is always a splendid occasion to entertain an audience and say things you want to say without rubbing their noses in it. With melodrama, as in dreams, you're always flirting with the disparity between appearance and reality, which is a great deal of fun. And that's also not unrelated to my perception of my life working in Hollywood, where you're always wondering, 'What does that guy really mean?'\"\nIn 2006, Towne was the subject of artist Sarah Morris's film, \"Robert Towne\". Morris describes him as an \u201celliptical figure\u201d whose career exemplifies a certain characteristic mode of working in the film industry, marked by collaboration, shared or changing roles. Morris's painting installation in the entryway to the Lever House in Manhattan, commissioned by the Public Art Fund, was also titled \"Robert Towne\".\nReturn to television.\nIn the 2010s, Towne returned to television, working as a consulting producer on \"Mad Men.\"\nIn 2019, Towne began co-writing, with David Fincher, a Netflix prequel miniseries based on \"Chinatown\" character J. J. Gittes, with Fincher serving as showrunner. By June 2024, a week before his death, Towne confirmed that the script for each episode had been completed.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1968, Towne met actress Julie Payne; they were married from 1977 to 1982. According to Sam Wasson's \"The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years of Hollywood\", Towne was addicted to cocaine during this period and was occasionally violent, which led to a bitter divorce and custody battle over their daughter Katharine (born 1978).\nIn 1984, Towne married Luisa Gaule. They had one daughter, Chiara.\nHe was the former son-in-law of late actor John Payne and actress Anne Shirley. Through his daughter Katharine, he was former father-in-law of actor Charlie Hunnam.\nTowne died at his home in Los Angeles on July 1, 2024, at the age of 89.\nFilmography.\nFilm.\nWriter\nUncredited writer\nActor\nOther roles\nTelevision.\nWriter\nLegacy and honors.\nAwards\nIn the book \"Fifty Filmmakers\", journalist Andrew J. Rausch argues: \"There is a strong case to be made that Robert Towne is the most gifted scribe ever to write for film. There can be little doubt that he is one of the finest ever.\"\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is typically served with rice, but can become the Chinese-American form of chow mein with the substitution of stir-fried noodles for rice.\nChop suey has become a prominent part of American Chinese cuisine, British Chinese cuisine, Cambodian Chinese cuisine, Canadian Chinese cuisine, Thai Chinese cuisine, Indian Chinese cuisine, and Polynesian cuisine. In Chinese Indonesian cuisine it is known as \"cap cai\" (tjap tjoi) (\u96dc\u83dc, \"mixed vegetables\") and mainly consists of vegetables.\nOrigins.\nChop suey is widely believed to have been developed in the U.S. by Chinese Americans. However, the anthropologist E. N. Anderson traces the dish to \"tsap seui\" (\u6742\u788e, \"miscellaneous leftovers\"), common in Taishan, Guangdong (Toisan) \u2013 the home of many early Chinese immigrants to the United States. Hong Kong doctor Li Shu-fan likewise reported that he knew it in Toisan in the 1890s. Charles Hayford argues that the dish was not invented per se, but rather was collectively adopted by Chinese American restaurants when the owners saw an opportunity to have a dish that Americans would like.\nThe long list of conflicting stories about the origin of chop suey is, in the words of food historian Alan Davidson, \"a prime example of culinary mythology\" and typical of popular foods.\nOne account claims that it was invented by Chinese American cooks working on the transcontinental railroad in the 19th century. Another tale is that it was created during Qing dynasty premier Li Hongzhang's visit to the United States in 1896 by his chef, who tried to create a meal suitable for both Chinese and American palates. Another story is that Li wandered to a local Chinese restaurant after the hotel kitchen had closed, where the chef, embarrassed that he had nothing ready to offer, came up with the new dish using scraps of leftovers. Yet recent research by the scholar Renqiu Yu led him to conclude that \"no evidence can be found in available historical records to support the story that Li Hung Chang [Li Hongzhang] ate chop suey in the United States.\" Li brought three Chinese chefs with him, and would not have needed to eat in local restaurants or invent new dishes in any case. Yu speculates that shrewd Chinese American restaurant owners took advantage of the publicity surrounding his visit to promote chop suey as Li's favorite.\nAnother myth is that, in the 1860s, a Chinese restaurant cook in San Francisco was forced to serve something to drunken miners after hours, when he had no fresh food. To avoid a beating, the cook threw leftover meat and vegetables into a wok and served it to the miners, who loved it and asked what dish it was\u2014he replied \"chopped sui\". There is no good evidence for any of these stories.\nChop suey appears in an 1884 article in the \"Brooklyn Eagle\", by Wong Chin Foo, \"Chinese Cooking\", in which he says it \"may justly be so-called the 'national dish of China'.\" In 1888 Wong wrote that a \"staple dish for the Chinese gourmand is chow chop svey [\"sic\"], a mixture of chickens' livers and gizzards, fungi, bamboo buds, pigs' tripe, and bean sprouts stewed with spices.\" An 1896 newspaper report states: \"Chow chop suey is a sort of stew made of chicken's livers and gizzards, calves' tripe, bean sprouts, celery and 'meu', which is a sort of Chinese first cousin to macaroni\". An article in \"The Illustrated American\" on Chinese cuisine in 1897, reproduces a menu from Ma Hung Low's restaurant on Mott Street in New York's Chinatown quarter which includes the dish \"Beef Chop Suey with Bean Sprouts, Water Chestnuts and Boiled Rice.\" The dish itself, referred to as \"the standard Chinese dish of chop suey,\" is described as \"a stew of beef, chicken, or pork, with bean sprouts, mushrooms, water-lily roots, sprouted grain and unknown flavorings.\" In 1898, it is described as \"A Hash of Pork, with Celery, Onions, Bean Sprouts, etc.\"\nDuring his travels in the United States, Liang Qichao, a Guangdong (Canton) native, wrote in 1903 that there existed in the United States a food item called \"chop suey\" which was popularly served by Chinese restaurateurs, but which local Chinese people do not eat, because the cooking technique is \"really awful\".\nIn earlier periods of Chinese history, \"chop suey\" or \"chap sui\" in Cantonese, and \"za sui\", in Mandarin, has different meanings of cooked animal offal or entrails. For example, in the classic novel \"Journey to the West\" (circa 1590), Sun Wukong tells a lion-monster in chapter 75: \"When I passed through Guangzhou, I bought a pot for cooking \"za sui\" \u2013 so I'll savor your liver, entrails, and lungs.\" The term \"za sui\" (\u6742\u788e) is found in newer Chinese-English dictionaries with both meanings listed: cooked entrails, and \"chop suey\" in the Western sense.\nIn 2012, Andrew Coe, who wrote \" Chop Suey \u2013 A Cultural History of Chinese Food in the United States\", stated that in chop suey's period of peak popularity, chop suey restaurants attracted \"an interesting crowd of artists and theater people and the kind of like demimonde\" and that chop suey \"was exotic\" and \"like sushi is today\".\nHayford stated that the popularity of chop suey declined after a new interest in China and new immigration into the United States in the mid-20th century pushed new dishes into prominence while chop suey became perceived as inauthentic. Chop suey especially declined in popularity on the West Coast and the East Coast with new Chinese immigration and with more diverse types of food available, while it retained more prominence in the American Midwest, where there was less Chinese immigration. St. Louis, Missouri, as of 2012, continued to have a number of chop suey restaurants in low-income neighborhoods.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was formally organized as and led by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and conducted military operations under the name of the Liberation Army of South Vietnam (LASV). The movement fought under the direction of North Vietnam against the South Vietnamese and United States governments during the Vietnam War. The organization had both guerrilla and regular army units, as well as a network of cadres who organized and mobilized peasants in the territory the VC controlled. During the war, communist fighters and some anti-war activists claimed that the VC was an insurgency indigenous to the South that represented the legitimate rights of people in South Vietnam, while the U.S. and South Vietnamese governments portrayed the group as a tool of North Vietnam. It was later conceded by the modern Vietnamese communist leadership that the movement was actually under the North Vietnamese political and military leadership, aiming to unify Vietnam under a single banner.\nNorth Vietnam established the National Liberation Front (NLF) on December 20, 1960, at T\u00e2n L\u1eadp village in T\u00e2y Ninh Province to foment insurgency in the South. Many of the VC's core members were volunteer \"regroupees\", southern Viet Minh who had resettled in the North after the Geneva Accord (1954). Hanoi gave the regroupees military training and sent them back to the South along the Ho Chi Minh trail in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The VC called for the unification of Vietnam and the overthrow of the American-backed South Vietnamese government. The VC's best-known action was the Tet Offensive, an assault on more than 100 South Vietnamese urban centers in 1968, including an attack on the U.S. embassy in Saigon. The offensive riveted the attention of the world's media for weeks, but also overextended the VC. Later communist offensives were conducted predominantly by the North Vietnamese. The organization officially merged with the Fatherland Front of Vietnam on February 4, 1977, after North and South Vietnam were officially unified under a communist government.\nNames.\n\"Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng\" is a contraction of ('Vietnamese communist'). By the late 1940s, Vietnamese anti-communist nationalist groups had begun employing the term \"Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng\" in their publications. Since the early 1950s, the State of Vietnam used the term to depict Vietnamese communists, hiding behind the mask of the Viet Minh front, as false patriots serving the foreign communist powers. The earliest citation for \"Viet Cong\" in English is from 1957. American soldiers referred to the Viet Cong as \"Victor Charlie\" or \"VC\". \"Victor\" and \"Charlie\" are both letters in the NATO phonetic alphabet. \"Charlie\" referred to communist forces in general, both South Vietnamese 'Liberation Front' and North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN).\nThe official Vietnamese history gives the Southern group's name as the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLFSV; ). Many writers shorten this to National Liberation Front (NLF). In 1969, the NLF created the \"Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam\" (\"Ch\u00ednh ph\u1ee7 C\u00e1ch m\u1ea1ng L\u00e2m th\u1eddi C\u1ed9ng h\u00f2a Mi\u1ec1n Nam Vi\u1ec7t Nam\"), abbreviated PRG. Although the NLF was not officially abolished until 1977, the NLF no longer used the name after the PRG was created. Members generally referred to the NLF as \"the Front\" (\"M\u1eb7t tr\u1eadn\"). Their armed wing was the \"Liberation Army of South Vietnam\" (\"Qu\u00e2n Gi\u1ea3i ph\u00f3ng Mi\u1ec1n Nam Vi\u1ec7t Nam\").\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nBy the terms of the Geneva Accord (1954), which ended the Indochina War, France and the Viet Minh agreed to a truce and to a separation of forces. The Viet Minh had become the government of North Vietnam, and military forces of the communists regrouped there. Military forces of the non-communists regrouped in South Vietnam, which became a separate state. Elections on reunification were scheduled for July 1956. A divided Vietnam angered Vietnamese nationalists, but it made the country less of a threat to China. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai negotiated the terms of the ceasefire with France and then imposed them on the Viet Minh.\nAbout 90,000 Viet Minh were evacuated to the North while 5,000 to 10,000 cadre remained in the South, most of them with orders to refocus on political activity and agitation. The Saigon-Cholon Peace Committee, the first VC front, was founded in 1954 to provide leadership for this group. Other front names used by the VC in the 1950s implied that members were fighting for religious causes, for example, \"Executive Committee of the Fatherland Front\", which suggested affiliation with the H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o sect, or \"Vietnam-Cambodia Buddhist Association\". Front groups were favored by the VC to such an extent that its real leadership remained shadowy until long after the war was over, prompting the expression \"the faceless Viet Cong\".\nLed by Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, South Vietnam refused to sign the Geneva Accord. Arguing that a free election was impossible under the conditions that existed in communist-held territory, Di\u1ec7m announced in July 1955 that the scheduled election on reunification would not be held. After subduing the B\u00ecnh Xuy\u00ean organized crime gang in the Battle for Saigon in 1955, and the H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o and other militant religious sects in early 1956, Di\u1ec7m turned his attention to the VC. Within a few months, the Viet Cong had been driven into remote swamps. The success of this campaign inspired U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower to dub Di\u1ec7m the \"miracle man\" when he visited the U.S. in May 1957. France withdrew its last soldiers from Vietnam in April 1956.\nIn March 1956, southern communist leader L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n presented a plan to revive the insurgency entitled \"The Road to the South\" to the other members of the Politburo in Hanoi. He argued adamantly that war with the United States was necessary to achieve unification. But as China and the Soviets both opposed confrontation at this time, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n's plan was rejected and communists in the South were ordered to limit themselves to economic struggle. Leadership divided into a \"North first\", or pro-Beijing, faction led by Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh, and a \"South first\" faction led by L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n.\nAs the Sino-Soviet split widened in the following months, Hanoi began to play the two communist giants off against each other. The North Vietnamese leadership approved tentative measures to revive the southern insurgency in December 1956. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n's blueprint for revolution in the South was approved in principle, but implementation was conditional on winning international support and on modernizing the army, which was expected to take at least until 1959. President Ho Chi Minh stressed that violence was still a last resort. Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu Xuy\u00ean was assigned military command in the South, replacing L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n, who was appointed North Vietnam's acting party boss. This represented a loss of power for H\u1ed3, who preferred the more moderate V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, who was defense minister.\nAn assassination campaign, referred to as \"extermination of traitors\" or \"armed propaganda\" in communist literature, began in April 1957. Tales of sensational murder and mayhem soon crowded the headlines. Seventeen civilians were killed by machine gun fire at a bar in Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c in July and in September a district chief was killed with his entire family on a main highway in broad daylight. In October 1957, a series of bombs exploded in Saigon and left 13 Americans wounded.\nIn a speech given on September 2, 1957, H\u1ed3 reiterated the \"North first\" line of economic struggle. The launch of Sputnik in October boosted Soviet confidence and led to a reassessment of policy regarding Indochina, long treated as a Chinese sphere of influence. In November, H\u1ed3 traveled to Moscow with L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n and gained approval for a more militant line. In early 1958, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n met with the leaders of \"Inter-zone V\" (northern South Vietnam) and ordered the establishment of patrols and safe areas to provide logistical support for activity in the Mekong Delta and in urban areas. In June 1958, the VC created a command structure for the eastern Mekong Delta. French scholar Bernard Fall published an influential article in July 1958 which analyzed the pattern of rising violence and concluded that a new war had begun.\nLaunches armed struggle.\nThe Communist Party of Vietnam approved a \"people's war\" on the South at a session in January 1959 and this decision was confirmed by the Politburo in March. In May 1959, Group 559 was established to maintain and upgrade the Ho Chi Minh trail, at this time a six-month mountain trek through Laos. About 500 of the \"regroupees\" of 1954 were sent south on the trail during its first year of operation. The first arms delivery via the trail, a few dozen rifles, was completed in August 1959.\nTwo regional command centers were merged to create the Central Office for South Vietnam (\"Trung \u01b0\u01a1ng C\u1ee5c mi\u1ec1n Nam\"), a unified communist party headquarters for the South. COSVN was initially located in T\u00e2y Ninh Province near the Cambodian border. On July 8, the VC killed two U.S. military advisors at Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a, the first American dead of the Vietnam War. The \"2d Liberation Battalion\" ambushed two companies of South Vietnamese soldiers in September 1959, the first large unit military action of the war. This was considered the beginning of the \"armed struggle\" in communist accounts. A series of uprisings beginning in the Mekong Delta province of B\u1ebfn Tre in January 1960 created \"liberated zones\", models of VC-style government. Propagandists celebrated their creation of battalions of \"long-hair troops\" (women). The fiery declarations of 1959 were followed by a lull while Hanoi focused on events in Laos (1960\u201361). Moscow favored reducing international tensions in 1960, as it was election year for the U.S. presidency. Despite this, 1960 was a year of unrest in South Vietnam, with pro-democracy demonstrations inspired by the South Korean student uprising that year and a failed military coup in November.\nTo counter the accusation that North Vietnam was violating the Geneva Accord, the independence of the VC was stressed in communist propaganda. The VC created the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in December 1960 at T\u00e2n L\u1eadp village in T\u00e2y Ninh as a \"united front\", or political branch intended to encourage the participation of non-communists. The group's formation was announced by Radio Hanoi and its ten-point manifesto called for, \"overthrow the disguised colonial regime of the imperialists and the dictatorial administration, and to form a national and democratic coalition administration.\" Th\u1ecd, a lawyer and the VC's \"neutralist\" chairman, was an isolated figure among cadres and soldiers. South Vietnam's Law 10/59, approved in May 1959, authorized the death penalty for crimes \"against the security of the state\" and featured prominently in VC propaganda. Violence between the VC and government forces soon increased drastically from 180 clashes in January 1960 to 545 clashes in September.\nBy 1960, the Sino-Soviet split was a public rivalry, making China more supportive of Hanoi's war effort. For Chinese leader Mao Zedong, aid to North Vietnam was a way to enhance his \"anti-imperialist\" credentials for both domestic and international audiences. About 40,000 communist soldiers infiltrated the South in 1961\u201363. The VC grew rapidly; an estimated 300,000 members were enrolled in \"liberation associations\" (affiliated groups) by early 1962. The ratio of VC to government soldiers jumped from 1:10 in 1961 to 1:5 a year later.\nThe level of violence in the South jumped dramatically in the fall of 1961, from 50 guerrilla attacks in September to 150 in October. U.S. President John F. Kennedy decided in November 1961 to substantially increase American military aid to South Vietnam. The arrived in Saigon with 35 helicopters in December 1961. By mid-1962, there were 12,000 U.S. military advisors in Vietnam. The \"special war\" and \"strategic hamlets\" policies allowed Saigon to push back in 1962, but in 1963 the VC regained the military initiative. The VC won its first military victory against South Vietnamese forces at \u1ea4p B\u1eafc in January 1963.\nA landmark party meeting was held in December 1963, shortly after a military coup in Saigon in which Di\u1ec7m was assassinated. North Vietnamese leaders debated the issue of \"quick victory\" vs \"protracted war\" (guerrilla warfare). After this meeting, the communist side geared up for a maximum military effort and the troop strength of the PAVN increased from 174,000 at the end of 1963 to 300,000 in 1964. The Soviets cut aid in 1964 as an expression of annoyance with Hanoi's ties to China. Even as Hanoi embraced China's international line, it continued to follow the Soviet model of reliance on technical specialists and bureaucratic management, as opposed to mass mobilization. The winter of 1964\u20131965 was a high-water mark for the VC, with the Saigon government on the verge of collapse. Soviet aid soared following a visit to Hanoi by Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in February 1965. Hanoi was soon receiving up-to-date surface-to-air missiles. The U.S. would have 200,000 soldiers in South Vietnam by the end of the year.\nIn January 1966, Australian troops uncovered a tunnel complex that had been used by COSVN. Six thousand documents were captured, revealing the inner workings of the VC. COSVN retreated to Mimot in Cambodia. As a result of an agreement with the Cambodian government made in 1966, weapons for the Viet Cong were shipped to the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville and then trucked to VC bases near the border along the \"Sihanouk Trail\", which replaced the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\nMany VC units operated at night, and employed terror as a standard tactic. Rice procured at gunpoint sustained the Viet Cong. Squads were assigned monthly assassination quotas. Government employees, especially village and district heads, were the most common targets. But there were a wide variety of targets, including clinics and medical personnel. Notable VC atrocities include the massacre of over 3,000 unarmed civilians at Hu\u1ebf, 48 killed in the bombing of My Canh floating restaurant in Saigon in June 1965 and a massacre of 252 Montagnards in the village of \u0110\u1eafk S\u01a1n in December 1967 using flamethrowers. VC death squads assassinated at least 37,000 civilians in South Vietnam; the real figure was far higher since the data mostly cover 1967\u201372. They also waged a mass murder campaign against civilian hamlets and refugee camps; in the peak war years, nearly a third of all civilian deaths were the result of VC atrocities. Ami Pedahzur has written that \"the overall volume and lethality of Vietcong terrorism rivals or exceeds all but a handful of terrorist campaigns waged over the last third of the twentieth century\".\nTet Offensive.\nMajor reversals in 1966 and 1967, as well as the growing American presence in Vietnam, inspired Hanoi to consult its allies and reassess strategy in April 1967. While Beijing urged a fight to the finish, Moscow suggested a negotiated settlement. Convinced that 1968 could be the last chance for decisive victory, General Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed Thanh, suggested an all-out offensive against urban centers. He submitted a plan to Hanoi in May 1967. After Thanh's death in July, Gi\u00e1p was assigned to implement this plan, now known as the Tet Offensive. The Parrot's Beak, an area in Cambodia only from Saigon, was prepared as a base of operations. Funeral processions were used to smuggle weapons into Saigon. VC entered the cities concealed among civilians returning home for T\u1ebft. The U.S. and South Vietnamese expected that an announced seven-day truce would be observed during Vietnam's main holiday.\nAt this point, there were about 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, as well as 900,000 allied forces. General William Westmoreland, the U.S. commander, received reports of heavy troop movements and understood that an offensive was being planned, but his attention was focused on Khe Sanh, a remote U.S. base near the DMZ. In January and February 1968, some 80,000 VC struck more than 100 towns with orders to \"crack the sky\" and \"shake the Earth.\" The offensive included a commando raid on the U.S. Embassy in Saigon and the massacre at Hu\u1ebf of about 3,500 residents. House-to-house fighting between VC and South Vietnamese Rangers left much of Cholon, a section of Saigon, in ruins. The VC used any available tactic to demoralize and intimidate the population, including the assassination of South Vietnamese commanders. A photo by Eddie Adams showing the summary execution of a VC in Saigon on February 1 became a symbol of the brutality of the war. In an influential broadcast on February 27, newsman Walter Cronkite stated that the war was a \"stalemate\" and could be ended only by negotiation.\nThe offensive was undertaken in the hope of triggering a general uprising, but urban Vietnamese did not respond as the VC anticipated. About 75,000 VC/PAVN soldiers were killed or wounded, according to Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0, commander of the \"B-2\" district, which consisted of southern South Vietnam. \"We did not base ourselves on scientific calculation or a careful weighing of all factors, but...on an illusion based on our subjective desires\", Tr\u00e0 concluded. Earle G. Wheeler, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Tet resulted in 40,000 communist dead (compared to about 10,600 U.S. and South Vietnamese dead). \"It is a major irony of the Vietnam War that our propaganda transformed this debacle into a brilliant victory. The truth was that Tet cost us half our forces. Our losses were so immense that we were unable to replace them with new recruits\", said PRG Justice Minister Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Nh\u01b0 T\u1ea3ng. Tet had a profound psychological impact because South Vietnamese cities were otherwise safe areas during the war. U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and Westmoreland argued that panicky news coverage gave the public the unfair perception that America had been defeated.\nAside from some districts in the Mekong Delta, the VC failed to create a governing apparatus in South Vietnam following Tet, according to an assessment of captured documents by the U.S. CIA. The breakup of larger VC units increased the effectiveness of the CIA's Phoenix Program (1968\u201372), which targeted individual leaders, as well as the Chi\u00eau H\u1ed3i Program, which encouraged defections. By the end of 1969, there was little communist-held territory, or \"liberated zones\", in the rural lowlands of Cochin China, according to the official communist military history. The US military believed that 70 percent of communist main-force combat troops in the South were northerners, but most communist military personnel were not main-force combat troops. Even in early 1970, MACV estimated that northerners made up no more than 45 percent of communist military forces overall in South Vietnam.\nThe VC created an urban front in 1968 called the Alliance of National, Democratic, and Peace Forces (ANDPF). in other to mobilize and attract support from non-communist opposition groups in the then-South Vietnamese politics. The group's manifesto called for an independent, neutralist, non-aligned South Vietnam and stated that \"national reunification cannot be achieved overnight.\" In June 1969, the alliance merged with the VC to form a \"Provisional Revolutionary Government\" (PRG). Both the NLF and ANDPF were subsequently merged into the contemporary Vietnam Fatherland Front after 1975.\nVietnamization.\nThe Tet Offensive increased American public discontent with participation in the Vietnam War and led the U.S. to gradually withdraw combat forces and to shift responsibility to the South Vietnamese, a process called Vietnamization. Pushed into Cambodia, the VC could no longer draw South Vietnamese recruits. In May 1968, Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh urged \"protracted war\" in a speech that was published prominently in the official media, so the fortunes of his \"North first\" faction may have revived at this time. COSVN rejected this view as \"lacking resolution and absolute determination.\" The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 led to intense Sino-Soviet tension and to the withdrawal of Chinese forces from North Vietnam. Beginning in February 1970, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n's prominence in the official media increased, suggesting that he was again top leader and had regained the upper hand in his longstanding rivalry with Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh. After the overthrow of Prince Sihanouk in March 1970, the VC faced a hostile Cambodian government which authorized a U.S. offensive against its bases in April. However, the capture of the Plain of Jars and other territory in Laos, as well as five provinces in northeastern Cambodia, allowed the North Vietnamese to reopen the Ho Chi Minh trail. Although 1970 was a much better year for the VC than 1969, it would never again be more than an adjunct to the PAVN. The 1972 Easter Offensive was a direct North Vietnamese attack across the DMZ. Despite the Paris Peace Accords, signed by all parties in January 1973, fighting continued. In March, Tr\u00e0 was recalled to Hanoi for a series of meetings to hammer out a plan for an enormous offensive against Saigon.\nFall of Saigon.\nIn response to the anti-war movement, the U.S. Congress passed the Case\u2013Church Amendment to prohibit further U.S. military intervention in Vietnam in June 1973 and reduced aid to South Vietnam in August 1974. With U.S. bombing ended, communist logistical preparations could be accelerated. An oil pipeline was built from North Vietnam to VC headquarters in L\u1ed9c Ninh, about northwest of Saigon. (COSVN was moved back to South Vietnam following the Easter Offensive.) The Ho Chi Minh Trail, beginning as a series of treacherous mountain tracks at the start of the war, was upgraded throughout the war, first into a road network driveable by trucks in the dry season, and finally, into paved, all-weather roads that could be used year-round, even during the monsoon. Between the beginning of 1974 and April 1975, with now-excellent roads and no fear of air interdiction, the North delivered nearly 365,000 tons of war mat\u00e9riel to battlefields, 2.6 times the total for the previous 13 years.\nThe success of the 1973\u201374 dry season offensive convinced Hanoi to accelerate its timetable. When there was no U.S. response to a successful PAVN attack on Ph\u01b0\u1edbc B\u00ecnh in January 1975, South Vietnamese morale collapsed. The next major battle, at Bu\u00f4n Ma Thu\u1ed9t in March, was a walkover. After the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, the PRG moved into government offices there. At the victory parade, T\u1ea1ng noticed that the units formerly dominated by southerners were missing, replaced by northerners years earlier. The bureaucracy of the Republic of Vietnam was uprooted and authority over the South was assigned to the PAVN. People considered tainted by association with the former South Vietnamese government were sent to re-education camps, despite the protests of the non-communist PRG members including T\u1ea1ng. Without consulting the PRG, North Vietnamese leaders decided to rapidly dissolve the PRG at a party meeting in August 1975. North and South were merged as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in July 1976 and the PRG was dissolved. The VC was merged with the Vietnamese Fatherland Front on February 4, 1977.\nRelationship with North Vietnam.\nActivists opposing American involvement in Vietnam said that the VC was a nationalist insurgency indigenous to the South. They said that the VC was composed of several parties\u2014the People's Revolutionary Party, the Democratic Party and the Radical Socialist Party\u2014and that VC chairman Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu Th\u1ecd was not a communist.\nAnti-communists countered that the VC was merely a front for Hanoi. They said some statements issued by communist leaders in the 1980s and 1990s suggested that southern communist forces were influenced by Hanoi. According to the memoirs of Tr\u00e0, the VC's top commander and PRG defense minister, he followed orders issued by the \"Military Commission of the Party Central Committee\" in Hanoi, which in turn implemented resolutions of the Politburo. Tr\u00e0 himself was deputy chief of staff for the PAVN before being assigned to the South. The official Vietnamese history of the war states that \"The Liberation Army of South Vietnam [Viet Cong] is a part of the People's Army of Vietnam\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At least 347 and up to 504 civilians, almost all women, children, and elderly men, were murdered by U.S. Army soldiers from C Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade and B Company, 4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade of the 23rd (Americal) Division (organized as part of Task Force Barker). Some of the women were gang-raped and their bodies mutilated, and some soldiers mutilated and raped children as young as 12. The incident was the largest massacre of civilians by U.S. forces in the 20th century.\nOn the morning of the massacre, C Company, commanded by Captain Ernest Medina, was sent into one of the village's hamlets (marked on maps as My Lai 4) expecting to engage the Viet Cong's Local Force 48th Battalion, which was not present. The killing began while the troops were searching the village for guerillas, and continued after they realized that no guerillas seemed to be present. Villagers were gathered together, held in the open, then murdered with automatic weapons, bayonets, and hand grenades; one large group of villagers was shot in an irrigation ditch. Soldiers also burned down homes and killed livestock. Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson Jr. and his helicopter crew are credited with attempting to stop the massacre. Nearby, B Company killed 60 to 155 of the massacre's victims in the hamlet of My Khe 4.\nThe massacre was originally reported as a battle against Viet Cong troops, and was covered up in initial investigations by the U.S. Army. The efforts of veteran Ronald Ridenhour and journalist Seymour Hersh broke the news of the massacre to the American public in November 1969, prompting global outrage and contributing to domestic opposition to involvement in the war. Twenty-six soldiers were charged with criminal offenses, but only Lieutenant William Calley Jr., the leader of 1st Platoon in C Company, was convicted. He was found guilty of murdering 22 villagers and originally given a life sentence, but served three-and-a-half years under house arrest after his sentence was commuted.\nOperation.\nCharlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division, arrived in South Vietnam in December\u00a01967. Though their first three months in Vietnam passed without any direct contact with People's Army of Vietnam or Viet Cong (VC) forces, by mid-March the company had suffered 28 casualties involving mines or booby-traps.\nDuring the Tet Offensive in January 1968, attacks were carried out in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i province by the VC 48th Local Force Battalion. U.S. military intelligence assumed that the 48th Battalion, having retreated and dispersed, was taking refuge in the village of S\u01a1n M\u1ef9, in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i province. A number of specific hamlets within that village \u2013 designated M\u1ef9 Lai (1) through M\u1ef9 Lai (6) \u2013 were suspected of harboring the 48th. S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 was located southwest of the Batangan Peninsula, a VC stronghold throughout the war.\nIn February and March 1968, the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) was aggressively trying to regain the strategic initiative in South Vietnam after the Tet Offensive, and the search-and-destroy operation against the 48th Battalion thought to be located in S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 became a small part of the U.S. military's overall strategy. Task Force Barker (TF Barker), a battalion-sized ad hoc unit of 11th Brigade, was to be deployed for the operation. It was formed in January 1968, composed of three rifle companies of the 11th Brigade, including Charlie Company, led by Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Frank A. Barker. S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 village was included in the area of operations of TF Barker. The area of operations (AO) was codenamed Muscatine AO, after Muscatine County, Iowa, the home county of the 23rd Division's commander, Major General Samuel W. Koster.\nIn February 1968, TF Barker had already tried to secure S\u01a1n M\u1ef9, with limited success. After that, the village area began to be referred to as \"Pinkville\" by TF Barker troops. The U.S. Army slang name for the hamlets and sub-hamlets in that area was \"Pinkville\", due to the reddish-pink color used on military maps to denote a more densely populated area, and the carnage was initially referred to as the Pinkville Massacre.\nOn 16\u201318 March, TF Barker planned to engage and destroy the remnants of the 48th Battalion, allegedly hiding in the S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 village area. Before the engagement, Colonel Oran K. Henderson, the 11th Brigade commander, urged his officers to \"go in there aggressively, close with the enemy and wipe them out for good\". In turn, LTC Barker reportedly ordered the 1st Battalion commanders to burn the houses, kill the livestock, destroy food supplies, and destroy or poison the wells.\nOn the eve of the attack, at the Charlie Company briefing, Captain Ernest Medina told his men that nearly all the civilian residents of the hamlets in S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 village would have left for the market by 07:00, and that any who remained would most likely be VC or VC sympathizers. He was asked whether the order included the killing of women and children. Those present later gave differing accounts of Medina's response. Some, including platoon leaders, testified that the orders, as they understood them, were to kill all VC and North Vietnamese combatants and \"suspects\" (including women and children, as well as all animals), to burn the village, and pollute the wells. He was quoted as saying, \"They're all VC, now go and get them\", and was heard to reply to the question \"Who is my enemy?\", by saying, \"Anybody that was running from us, hiding from us, or appeared to be the enemy. If a man was running, shoot him, sometimes even if a woman with a rifle was running, shoot her.\"\nAt Calley's trial, one defense witness testified that he remembered Medina instructing to destroy everything in the village that was \"walking, crawling or growling\".\nCharlie Company was to enter the village of S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 spearheaded by 1st Platoon, engage the enemy, and flush them out. The other two companies from TF Barker were ordered to secure the area and provide support if needed. The area was designated a free-fire zone, where American forces were allowed to deploy artillery and air strikes in populated areas, without consideration of risk to civilian or non-combatant lives. Varnado Simpson, a rifleman in Charlie Company, said, \"We were told to leave nothing standing. We did what we were told, regardless of whether they were civilians.\"\nKillings.\nOn the morning of 16 March at 07:30, around 100 soldiers from Charlie Company led by Medina, following a short artillery and helicopter gunship barrage, landed in helicopters at S\u01a1n M\u1ef9, a patchwork of individual homesteads, grouped settlements, rice paddies, irrigation ditches, dikes, and dirt roads, connecting an assortment of hamlets and sub-hamlets. The largest among them were the hamlets M\u1ef9 Lai, C\u1ed5 L\u0169y, M\u1ef9 Kh\u00ea, and Tu Cung.\nThe GIs expected to engage the VC Local Force 48th Battalion, which was one of the VC's most successful units. Although the GIs were not fired upon after landing, they still suspected there were VC hiding underground or in the huts. Confirming their suspicions, the gunships engaged several VC in the vicinity of M\u1ef9 Lai, killing four; later, one weapon was retrieved from the site.\nAccording to the operational plan, 1st Platoon, led by Second Lieutenant (2LT) William Calley, and 2nd Platoon, led by 2LT Stephen Brooks, entered the hamlet of Tu Cung in line formation at 08:00, while the 3rd Platoon, commanded by 2LT Jeffrey U. Lacross, and Captain Medina's command post remained outside. On approach, both platoons fired at people they saw in the rice fields and in the brush.\nInstead of the expected enemy, the GIs found women, children and old men, many of whom were cooking breakfast over outdoor fires. The villagers were getting ready for a market day and at first did not panic or run away as they were herded into the hamlet's common spaces and homestead yards. Harry Stanley, a machine gunner from Charlie Company, said during the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) inquiry that the killings started without warning. He first observed a member of 1st Platoon strike a Vietnamese man with a bayonet. Then the same trooper pushed another villager into a well and threw a grenade in the well. Next, he saw 15 or 20 people, mainly women and children, kneeling around a temple with burning incense. They were praying and crying. They were all killed by shots to the head.\nMost of the killings occurred in the southern part of Tu Cung, a sub-hamlet of Xom Lang, which was a home to 700 residents. Xom Lang was erroneously marked on the U.S. military operational maps of Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i province as M\u1ef9 Lai.\nA large group of approximately 70\u201380\u00a0villagers was rounded up by 1st\u00a0Platoon in Xom Lang and led to an irrigation ditch east of the settlement. They were then pushed into the ditch and shot dead by soldiers after repeated orders issued by Calley, who was also shooting. PFC Paul Meadlo testified that he expended several M16 rifle magazines. He recollected that women were saying \"No VC\" and were trying to shield their children. He remembered that he was shooting old men and women, ranging in ages from grandmothers to teenagers, many with babies or small children in their arms, since he was convinced at that time that they were all booby-trapped with grenades and poised to attack. On another occasion during the security sweep of My Lai, Meadlo again fired into civilians side by side with Calley.\nPFC Dennis Konti, a witness for the prosecution, told of one especially gruesome episode during the shooting, \"A lot of women had thrown themselves on top of the children to protect them, and the children were alive at first. Then, the children who were old enough to walk got up and Calley began to shoot the children\". Other 1st Platoon members testified that many of the deaths of individual Vietnamese men, women and children occurred inside M\u1ef9 Lai during the security sweep. To ensure the hamlets could no longer offer support to the enemy, the livestock was shot as well.\nWhen PFC Michael Bernhardt entered the subhamlet of Xom Lang, the massacre was underway:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I walked up and saw these guys doing strange things\u00a0... Setting fire to the hootches and huts and waiting for people to come out and then shooting them\u00a0... going into the hootches and shooting them up\u00a0... gathering people in groups and shooting them\u00a0... As I walked in you could see piles of people all through the village\u00a0... all over. They were gathered up into large groups. I saw them shoot an M79 grenade launcher into a group of people who were still alive. But it was mostly done with a machine gun. They were shooting women and children just like anybody else. We met no resistance and I only saw three captured weapons. We had no casualties. It was just like any other Vietnamese village\u00a0\u2013 old papa-sans, women and kids. As a matter of fact, I don't remember seeing one military-age male in the entire place, dead or alive.\nOne group of 20\u201350 villagers was herded south of Xom Lang and killed on a dirt road. According to U.S. Army photographer Sgt. Ronald Haeberle's eyewitness account of the massacre, in one instance,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There were some South Vietnamese people, maybe fifteen of them, women and children included, walking on a dirt road maybe away. All of a sudden the GIs just opened up with M16s. Beside the M16 fire, they were shooting at the people with M79 grenade launchers\u00a0... I couldn't believe what I was seeing.\nCalley testified that he heard the shooting and arrived on the scene. He observed his men firing into a ditch with Vietnamese people inside, then began to take part in the shooting himself, using an M16 from a distance of no more than . During the massacre, a helicopter landed on the other side of the ditch and the pilot asked Calley if they could provide any medical assistance to the wounded civilians in M\u1ef9 Lai; Calley admitted replying that \"a hand grenade was the only available means he had for their evacuation\". At 11:00 Medina radioed an order to cease fire, and 1st Platoon took a break, during which they ate lunch.\nMembers of 2nd\u00a0Platoon killed at least 60\u201370 Vietnamese, as they swept through the northern half of M\u1ef9 Lai and through Binh Tay, a small sub-hamlet about north of M\u1ef9 Lai. After the initial sweeps by 1st and 2nd Platoons, 3rd Platoon was dispatched to deal with any \"remaining resistance\". 3rd Platoon, which stayed in reserve, reportedly rounded up and killed a group of seven to 12 women and children.\nSince Charlie Company had not met any enemy opposition at M\u1ef9 Lai and did not request back-up, Bravo Company, 4th\u00a0Battalion, 3rd\u00a0Infantry Regiment of TF Barker was transported by air between 08:15 and 08:30 away. It attacked the subhamlet My Hoi of the hamlet known as C\u1ed5 L\u0169y, which was mapped by the Army as M\u1ef9 Kh\u00ea. During this operation, between 60 and 155 people, including women and children, were killed.\nOver the remaining day, both companies were involved in the further burning and destruction of dwellings, as well as continued mistreatment of Vietnamese detainees. While it was noted in the courts-martial proceedings that some soldiers of Charlie Company did not participate in any killings, it was also noted they neither openly protested against them nor filed complaints later to their superiors.\nWilliam Thomas Allison, a professor of Military History at Georgia Southern University, wrote, \"By midmorning, members of Charlie Company had killed hundreds of civilians and raped or assaulted countless women and young girls. They encountered no enemy fire and found no weapons in My Lai itself\".\nBy the time the killings stopped, Charlie Company had suffered one casualty\u00a0\u2013 a soldier who had intentionally shot himself in the foot to avoid participating in the massacre\u00a0\u2013 and just three enemy weapons were confiscated.\nRapes.\nAccording to the Peers Commission Investigation, the U.S. government allocated commission for inquiry into the incident, concluded at least 20 Vietnamese women and girls were raped during the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre. Since there had been little research over the case other than that of the Peers Commission, which solely accounts the cases with explicit rape signs like torn cloth and nudity, the actual number of rapes is not easy to estimate. According to the reports, the rape victims ranged between the ages of 10 and 45, with nine being under 18. The sexual assaults included gang rapes and sexual torture.\nNo U.S. serviceman was charged with rape. According to an eyewitness, as reported by Seymour Hersh in his book on the massacre, a woman was raped after her children were killed by the U.S. soldiers. Another Vietnamese villager also noticed soldiers rape a 13-year-old girl.\nHelicopter crew intervention.\nWarrant Officer Hugh Thompson Jr., a helicopter pilot from Company B (Aero-Scouts), 123rd Aviation Battalion, Americal Division, saw dead and wounded civilians as he was flying his OH-23 over the village of S\u01a1n M\u1ef9, providing observation for ground forces. The crew made several attempts to radio for help for the wounded. They landed their helicopter by a ditch, which they noted was full of bodies and in which they could discern movement by survivors. Thompson asked a sergeant he encountered there (David Mitchell of 1st Platoon) if he could help get the people out of the ditch; the sergeant replied that he would \"help them out of their misery\". Thompson, shocked and confused, then spoke with 2LT Calley, who claimed to be \"just following orders\". As the helicopter took off, Thompson saw Mitchell firing into the ditch.\nThompson and his crew witnessed an unarmed woman being kicked and shot at point-blank range by Medina, who later claimed that he thought she had a hand grenade. Thompson then saw a group of civilians at a bunker being approached by ground personnel. Thompson landed, and told his crew that if the soldiers shot at the villagers while he was trying to get them out of the bunker, then they were to open fire on the soldiers.\nThompson later testified that he spoke with a lieutenant (identified as Stephen Brooks of 2nd Platoon) and told him there were women and children in the bunker, and asked if the lieutenant would help get them out. According to Thompson, \"he [the lieutenant] said the only way to get them out was with a hand grenade\". Thompson testified that he then told Brooks to \"just hold your men right where they are, and I'll get the kids out.\" He found 12\u201316\u00a0people in the bunker, coaxed them out and led them to the helicopter, standing with them while they were flown out in two groups.\nReturning to M\u1ef9 Lai, Thompson and other air crew members noticed several large groups of bodies. Spotting some survivors in the ditch, Thompson landed again. A crew member, Specialist 4 Glenn Andreotta, entered the ditch and returned with a bloodied but apparently unharmed four-year-old girl, who was then flown to safety.\nUpon returning to the LZ Dottie base, Thompson reported to his section leader, Captain Barry Lloyd, that the American infantry were no different from Nazis in their slaughter of innocent civilians: It's mass murder out there. They're rounding them up and herding them in ditches and then just shooting them. Thompson then reported what he had seen to his company commander, Major Frederic W. Watke, using terms such as \"murder\" and \"needless and unnecessary killings\". Thompson's statements were confirmed by other helicopter pilots and air crew members.\nFor his actions at M\u1ef9 Lai, Thompson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, while his crew members Glenn Andreotta and Lawrence Colburn were awarded the Bronze Star. Andreotta was awarded his medal posthumously, as he was killed in Vietnam on 8 April 1968. As the DFC citation included a fabricated account of rescuing a young girl from M\u1ef9 Lai from \"intense crossfire\", Thompson threw his medal away. He later received a Purple Heart for other services in Vietnam.\nIn March 1998, the helicopter crew's medals were replaced by the Soldier's Medal, the highest the U.S.\u00a0Army can award for bravery not involving direct conflict with the enemy. The medal citations state they were \"for heroism above and beyond the call of duty while saving the lives of at least 10 Vietnamese civilians during the unlawful massacre of non-combatants by American forces at My Lai\".\nThompson initially refused to accept the medal when the U.S. Army wanted to award it quietly. He demanded it be done publicly and that his crew be honored in the same way.\nAftermath.\nAfter returning to base at about 11:00, Thompson reported the massacre to his superiors. His allegations of civilian killings quickly reached LTC Barker, the operation's overall commander. Barker radioed his executive officer to find out from Medina what was happening on the ground. Medina then gave the cease-fire order to Charlie Company to \"cut [the killing] out \u2013 knock it off\".\nSince Thompson made an official report of the civilian killings, he was interviewed by Colonel Oran Henderson, the commander of the 11th Infantry Brigade. Concerned, senior American officers canceled similar planned operations by Task Force Barker against other villages (My Lai 5, My Lai 1, etc.) in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i province. Despite Thompson's revealing information, Henderson issued a Letter of Commendation to Medina on 27 March 1968.\nThe following day, 28 March, Barker submitted a combat action report for the 16 March operation, in which he stated that the operation in M\u1ef9 Lai was a success, with 128 VC combatants killed. The Americal Division commander, General Koster, sent a congratulatory message to Charlie Company.\nGeneral William C. Westmoreland, the head of MACV, also congratulated Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry for \"outstanding action\", saying that they had \"dealt [the] enemy [a] heavy blow\". Later, after learning of the massacre, he wrote in his memoir that it was \"the conscious massacre of defenseless babies, children, mothers, and old men in a kind of diabolical slow-motion nightmare that went on for the better part of a day, with a cold-blooded break for lunch\".\nOwing to the chaotic circumstances of the war and the U.S. Army's decision not to undertake a definitive body count of noncombatants in Vietnam, the number of civilians killed at M\u1ef9 Lai cannot be stated with certainty. Estimates vary from source to source, with 347 and 504 being the most commonly cited figures. The memorial at the site of the massacre lists 504\u00a0names, with ages ranging from one to 82. A later investigation by the U.S.\u00a0Army arrived at a lower figure of 347\u00a0deaths, the official U.S. estimate. The official estimate by the local government remains 504.\nInvestigation and cover-up.\nInitial reports claimed \"128 Viet Cong and 22 civilians\" had been killed in the village during a \"fierce fire fight\". Westmoreland congratulated the unit on the \"outstanding job\". As relayed at the time by \"Stars and Stripes\" magazine, \"U.S.\u00a0infantrymen had killed 128\u00a0Communists in a bloody day-long battle.\"\nOn 16 March 1968, in the official press briefing known as the \"Five\u00a0O'Clock Follies\", a mimeographed release included this passage: \"In an action today, Americal Division forces killed 128\u00a0enemy near Quang Ngai City. Helicopter gunships and artillery missions supported the ground elements throughout the day.\"\nInitial investigations of the M\u1ef9 Lai operation were undertaken by Colonel Henderson, under orders from the Americal Division's executive officer, Brigadier General George H. Young. Henderson interviewed several soldiers involved in the incident, then issued a written report in late April claiming that some 20 civilians were inadvertently killed during the operation. According to Henderson's report, the civilian casualties that occurred were accidental and mainly attributed to long-range artillery fire. The Army at this time was still describing the event as a military victory that had resulted in the deaths of 128 enemy combatants.\nSix months later, Tom Glen, a 21-year-old soldier of the 11th Light Infantry Brigade, wrote a letter to General Creighton Abrams, the new MACV commander. He described an ongoing and routine brutality against Vietnamese civilians on the part of American forces in Vietnam that he had personally witnessed, and then concluded,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nColin Powell, then a 31-year-old Army major serving as an assistant chief of staff of operations for the Americal Division, was charged with investigating the letter, which did not specifically refer to M\u1ef9 Lai, as Glen had limited knowledge of the events there. In his report, Powell wrote, \"In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between Americal Division soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent.\" A 2018 U.S. Army case study of the massacre noted that Powell \"investigated the allegations described in the [Glen] letter. He proved unable to uncover either widespread unnecessary killings, war crimes, or any facts related to My Lai\". Powell's handling of the assignment was later characterized by some observers as \"whitewashing\" the atrocities of M\u1ef9 Lai.\nIn May 2004, Powell, then United States Secretary of State, told CNN's Larry King, \"I mean, I was in a unit that was responsible for M\u1ef9 Lai. I got there after M\u1ef9 Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored.\"\nSeven months prior to the massacre at M\u1ef9 Lai, on Robert McNamara's orders, the Inspector General of the U.S. Defense Department investigated press coverage of alleged atrocities committed in South Vietnam. In August 1967, the 200-page report \"Alleged Atrocities by U.S. Military Forces in South Vietnam\" was completed.\nIndependently of Glen, Specialist 5 Ronald L. Ridenhour, a former door gunner from the Aviation Section, Headquarters Company, 11th Infantry Brigade, sent a letter in March 1969 to 30 members of Congress imploring them to investigate the circumstances surrounding the \"Pinkville\" incident. He and his pilot, Warrant Officer Gilbert Honda, flew over M\u1ef9 Lai several days after the operation and observed a scene of complete destruction. At one point, they hovered over a dead Vietnamese woman with a patch of the 11th Brigade on her body.\nRidenhour himself had not been present when the massacre occurred, but his account was compiled from detailed conversations with soldiers of Charlie Company who had witnessed and, in some cases, participated in the killing. He became convinced that something \"rather dark and bloody did indeed occur\" at M\u1ef9 Lai, and was so disturbed by the tales he heard that within three months of being discharged from the Army he penned his concerns to Congress as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the President. He included the name of Michael Bernhardt, an eyewitness who agreed to testify, in the letter.\nMost recipients of Ridenhour's letter ignored it, with the exception of Congressman Mo Udall and Senators Barry Goldwater and Edward Brooke. Udall urged the House Armed Services Committee to call on Pentagon officials to conduct an investigation.\nPublic revelation and reaction.\nUnder mounting pressure caused by Ridenhour's letter, on 9 September 1969, the Army quietly charged Calley with six specifications of premeditated murder for the deaths of 109 South Vietnamese civilians near the village of S\u01a1n M\u1ef9, at a hamlet called simply \"My Lai\". Calley's court martial was not released to the press and did not commence until November 1970. However, word of Calley's prosecution found its way to American investigative reporter and freelance journalist Seymour Hersh.\nMy Lai was first revealed to the public on 13 November 1969\u2014more than a year and a half after the incident\u2014when Hersh published a story through the Dispatch News Service. After extensive interviews with Calley, Hersh broke the M\u1ef9 Lai story in 35 newspapers; additionally, the \"Alabama Journal\" in Montgomery and \"the New York Times\" ran separate stories on the allegations against Calley on 12 and 13 November, respectively. On 20 November, explicit color photographs and eye-witness testimony of the massacre taken by U.S. Army combat photographer Ronald L. Haeberle were published in \"The Cleveland Plain Dealer\". The same day, \"Time\", \"Life\" and \"Newsweek\" all covered the story, and CBS televised an interview with Paul Meadlo, a soldier in Calley's unit during the massacre. From the U.S. Government and Army's point of view, Haeberle's photos transformed the massacre from potentially manageable to a very serious problem. The day after their publication, Melvin Laird the Secretary of Defense discussed them with Henry Kissinger who was at the time National Security Advisor to President Richard Nixon. Laird was recorded as saying that while he would like \"to sweep it under the rug\", the photographs prevented it. \"They're pretty terrible\", he said. \"There are so many kids just laying there; these pictures are authentic\". Within the Army, the reaction was similar. Chief Warrant Officer Andr\u00e9 Feher, with the CID, was assigned the case in early August 1969. After he interviewed Haeberle, and was shown the photographs which he described as \"evidence that something real bad had happened\", he and the Pentagon officials he reported to realized \"that news of the massacre could not be contained\".\nThe story threatened to undermine the U.S. war effort and severely damage the Nixon presidency. Inside the White House, officials privately discussed how to contain the scandal. On 21 November, Kissinger emphasized that the White House needed to develop a \"game plan\", to establish a \"press policy\", and maintain a \"unified line\" in its public response. The White House established a \"My Lai Task Force\" whose mission was to \"figure out how best to control the problem\", to make sure administration officials \"all don't go in different directions\" when discussing the incident, and to \"engage in dirty tricks\". These included discrediting key witnesses and questioning Hersh's motives for releasing the story. What soon followed was a public relations offensive by the administration designed to shape how My Lai would be portrayed in the press and understood among the American public.\nAs members of Congress called for an inquiry and news correspondents abroad expressed their horror at the massacre, the General Counsel of the Army Robert Jordan was tasked with speaking to the press. He refused to confirm allegations against Calley. Noting the significance that the statement was given at all, Bill Downs of ABC News said it amounted to the first public expression of concern by a \"high defense official\" that American troops \"might have committed genocide\".\nOn 24 November 1969, Lieutenant General William R. Peers was appointed by the Secretary of the Army and the Army Chief of Staff to conduct a thorough review of the My Lai incident, 16\u201319 March 1968, and its investigation by the Army. Peers's final report, presented to higher-ups on 17 March 1970, was highly critical of top officers at brigade and divisional levels for participating in the cover-up, and the Charlie Company officers for their actions at M\u1ef9 Lai.\nAccording to Peers' findings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2003 Hugh Thompson, the pilot who had intervened during the massacre, said of the Peers report:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 1968, an American journalist, Jonathan Schell, wrote that in Quang Ngai province, where the massacre occurred, up to 70% of all villages were destroyed by the air strikes and artillery bombardments, including the use of napalm; 40 percent of the population were refugees, and the overall civilian casualties were close to 50,000 a year. Regarding the massacre at M\u1ef9 Lai, he stated, \"There can be no doubt that such an atrocity was possible only because a number of other methods of killing civilians and destroying their villages had come to be the rule, and not the exception, in our conduct of the war\".\nIn May 1970, a sergeant who participated in Operation Speedy Express wrote a confidential letter to then Army Chief of Staff Westmoreland describing civilian killings he said were on the scale of the massacre occurring as \"a My Lai each month for over a year\" during 1968\u201369. Two other letters to this effect from enlisted soldiers to military leaders in 1971, all signed \"Concerned Sergeant\", were uncovered within declassified National Archive documents. The letters describe common occurrences of civilian killings during population pacification operations. Army policy also stressed very high body counts and this resulted in dead civilians being marked down as combatants. Alluding to indiscriminate killings described as unavoidable, the commander of the 9th Infantry Division, then Major General Julian Ewell, in September 1969, submitted a confidential report to Westmoreland and other generals describing the countryside in some areas of Vietnam as resembling the battlefields of Verdun.\nIn July 1969, the Office of Provost Marshal General of the Army began to examine the evidence regarding possible criminal charges. Eventually, Calley was charged with several counts of premeditated murder in September 1969, and 25 other officers and enlisted men were later charged with related crimes.\nIn April 1972, Congressman Les Aspin sued the Department of Defense in District Court to reveal the Peers Commission. Following the massacre a Pentagon task force called the Vietnam War Crimes Working Group (VWCWG) investigated alleged atrocities which were committed against South Vietnamese civilians by U.S. troops and created a secret archive of some 9,000 pages which documents 320 alleged incidents from 1967 to 1971 including seven massacres in which at least 137 civilians died; 78 additional attacks targeting noncombatants in which at least 57 were killed, 56 were wounded and 15 were sexually assaulted; and 141 incidents of U.S. soldiers torturing civilian detainees or prisoners of war. 203 U.S. personnel were charged with crimes, 57 of them were court-martialed and 23 of them were convicted. The VWCWG also investigated over 500 additional alleged atrocities but it could not verify them.\nCourt martial.\nOn 17 November 1970, a court-martial in the United States charged 14 officers, including Major General Koster, the Americal Division's commanding officer, with suppressing information related to the incident. Most of the charges were later dropped. Brigade commander Colonel Henderson was the only high ranking commanding officer who stood trial on charges relating to the cover-up of the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre; he was acquitted on 17 December 1971.\nDuring the four-month-long trial, Calley consistently claimed that he was following orders from his commanding officer, Medina. Despite that, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on 29 March 1971, after being found guilty of premeditated murder of not fewer than 20 people. Two days later, Nixon made the controversial decision to have Calley released from armed custody at Fort Benning, Georgia, and put under house arrest pending appeal of his sentence. Calley's conviction was upheld by the Army Court of Military Review in 1973 and by the U.S. Court of Military Appeals in 1974.\nIn August 1971, Calley's sentence was reduced by the convening authority from life to twenty years. Calley would eventually serve three-and-a-half years under house arrest at Fort Benning including three months in the disciplinary barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In September 1974, he was paroled by the Secretary of the Army, Howard Callaway.\nIn a separate trial, Medina denied giving the orders that led to the massacre, and was acquitted of all charges, effectively negating the prosecution's theory of \"command responsibility\", now referred to as the \"Medina standard\". Several months after his acquittal, however, Medina admitted he had suppressed evidence and had lied to Henderson about the number of civilian deaths.\nCaptain Kotouc, an intelligence officer from 11th Brigade, was also court-martialed and found not guilty. Koster was demoted to brigadier general and lost his position as the Superintendent of West Point. His deputy, Brigadier General Young, received a letter of censure. Both were stripped of Distinguished Service Medals which had been awarded for service in Vietnam.\nOf the 26 men initially charged, Calley was the only one convicted. Some have argued that the outcome of the M\u1ef9 Lai courts-martial failed to uphold the laws of war established in the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunals.\nClassification as a war crime.\nTelford Taylor, a senior American prosecutor at Nuremberg, wrote that legal principles established at the war crimes trials could have been used to prosecute senior American military commanders for failing to prevent atrocities such as the one at M\u1ef9 Lai.\nHoward Callaway, Secretary of the Army, was quoted in \"The New York Times\" in 1976 as stating that Calley's sentence was reduced because Calley honestly believed that what he did was a part of his orders\u2014a rationale that contradicts the standards set at Nuremberg and Tokyo, where following orders was not a defense for committing war crimes. On the whole, aside from the M\u1ef9 Lai courts-martial, there were 36 military trials held by the U.S. Army from January 1965 to August 1973 for crimes against civilians in Vietnam.\nSome authors have argued that the light punishments of the low-level personnel present at M\u1ef9 Lai and unwillingness to hold higher officials responsible was part of a pattern in which the body-count strategy and the so-called \"Mere Gook Rule\" encouraged U.S. soldiers to err on the side of killing suspected Vietnamese enemies even if there was a very good chance that they were civilians. This in turn, Nick Turse argues, made lesser known massacres similar to M\u1ef9 Lai and a pattern of war crimes common in Vietnam.\nSurvivors.\nIn early 1972, the camp at M\u1ef9 Lai (2) where the survivors of the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre had been relocated was largely destroyed by Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) artillery and aerial bombardment, and remaining eyewitnesses were dispersed. The destruction was officially attributed to \"Viet Cong terrorists\". Quaker service workers in the area gave testimony in May 1972 by Martin Teitel at hearings before the \"Congressional Subcommittee to Investigate Problems Connected with Refugees and Escapees\" in South Vietnam. In June 1972, Teitel's account was published in \"The New York Times\".\nMany American soldiers who had been in M\u1ef9 Lai during the massacre accepted personal responsibility for the loss of civilian lives. Some of them expressed regrets without acknowledging any personal guilt, as, for example, Medina, who said, \"I have regrets for it, but I have no guilt over it because I didn't cause it. That's not what the military, particularly the United States Army, is trained for.\"\nLawrence La Croix, a squad leader in Charlie Company, stated in 2010: \"A lot of people talk about My Lai, and they say, 'Well, you know, yeah, but you can't follow an illegal order.' Trust me. There is no such thing. Not in the military. If I go into a combat situation and I tell them, 'No, I'm not going. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to follow that order', well, they'd put me up against the wall and shoot me.\"\nOn 16 March 1998, a gathering of local people and former American and Vietnamese soldiers stood together at the place of the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre in Vietnam to commemorate its 30th anniversary. American veterans Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn, who were shielding civilians during the massacre, addressed the crowd. Among the listeners was Phan Thi Nhanh, a 14-year-old girl at the time of the massacre. She was saved by Thompson and vividly remembered that tragic day, \"We don't say we forget. We just try not to think about the past, but in our hearts we keep a place to think about that\". Colburn challenged Calley \"to face the women we faced today who asked the questions they asked, and look at the tears in their eyes and tell them why it happened\". No American diplomats or any other officials attended the meeting.\nMore than a thousand people turned out on 16 March 2008, forty years after the massacre. The S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 Memorial drew survivors and families of victims and some returning U.S. veterans. One woman (an eight-year-old at the time) said, \"Everyone in my family was killed in the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre\u2014my mother, my father, my brother and three sisters. They threw me into a ditch full of dead bodies. I was covered with blood and brains.\" The U.S. was unofficially represented by a volunteer group from Wisconsin called Madison Quakers, who in 10 years built three schools in M\u1ef9 Lai and planted a peace garden.\nOn 19 August 2009, Calley made his first public apology for the massacre in a speech to the Kiwanis club of Greater Columbus, Georgia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"There is not a day that goes by that I do not feel remorse for what happened that day in My Lai\", he told members of the club. \"I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed, for their families, for the American soldiers involved and their families. I am very sorry.\u00a0... If you are asking why I did not stand up to them when I was given the orders, I will have to say that I was a 2nd lieutenant getting orders from my commander and I followed them\u2014foolishly, I guess.\"\nTr\u1ea7n V\u0103n \u0110\u1ee9c, who was seven years old at the time of the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre and now resides in Remscheid, Germany, called the apology \"terse\". He wrote a public letter to Calley describing the plight of his and many other families to remind him that time did not ease the pain, and that grief and sorrow over lost lives will forever stay in M\u1ef9 Lai.\nParticipants.\nOfficers.\nAltogether, 14 officers directly and indirectly involved with the operation, including two generals, were investigated in connection with the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre, except for LTC Frank A. Barker, CPT Earl Michaels, and 2LT Stephen Brooks, who all died before the beginning of the investigation.\n1st Platoon, Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry.\nBefore being shipped to South Vietnam, all of Charlie Company's soldiers went through an advanced infantry training and basic unit training at Pohakuloa Training Area in Hawaii. At Schofield Barracks they were taught how to treat POWs and how to distinguish VC guerrillas from civilians by a Judge Advocate.\nMedia coverage.\nA photographer and a reporter from the 11th Brigade Information Office were attached to Task Force Barker and landed with Charlie Company in S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 on 16 March 1968. Neither the \"Americal News Sheet\" published 17 March 1968, nor the \"Trident\", 11th Infantry Brigade newsletter from 22 March 1968, reported the deaths of noncombatants in M\u1ef9 Lai. \"Stars and Stripes\" published a laudatory piece, \"U.S. troops Surrounds Red, Kill 128\", on 18 March.\nOn 12 April 1968, the \"Trident\" wrote, \"The most punishing operations undertaken by the brigade in Operation Muscatine's area involved three separate raids into the village and vicinity of My Lai, which cost the VC 276 killed\". On 4 April 1968, the information office of the 11th Brigade issued a press-release, \"Recent Operations in Pinkville,\" without reporting mass casualties among civilians. Subsequent criminal investigation found that \"Both individuals failed to report what they had seen, the reporter wrote a false and misleading account of the operation, and the photographer withheld and suppressed from proper authorities the photographic evidence of atrocities he had obtained.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVietnam was an atrocity from the get-go... There were hundreds of My Lais. You got your card punched by the numbers of bodies you counted.\n \u2014 David H. Hackworth\nThe first reporting of the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre appeared in the American media after Fort Benning issued a press release related to the charges pressed against Calley. This was issued on 5 September 1969.\nConsequently, NBC aired on 10 September 1969 a segment in the \"Huntley-Brinkley Report\" which reported the killings of numerous civilians in South Vietnam. Following that, Ridenhour decided to disobey the Army's order to withhold the information from the media. He approached reporter Ben Cole of the \"Phoenix Republic\", who chose not to handle the scoop. Charles Black from the \"Columbus Enquirer\" uncovered the story on his own but also decided to put it on hold. Two major national news press outlets\u2014\"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\"\u2014received some tips with partial information but did not act on them.\nRidenhour called Seymour Hersh on 22 October 1969. The freelance investigative journalist conducted an independent inquiry, and published to break the wall of silence that was surrounding the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre. Hersh initially tried to sell the story to \"Life\" and \"Look\" magazines; both turned it down. Hersh went to the small, Washington-based Dispatch News Service, which sent it to fifty major American newspapers; thirty accepted it for publication. \"New York Times\" reporter Henry Kamm investigated further and found several survivors of the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre in South Vietnam. He estimated the number of civilians killed as 567.\nNext, Ben Cole published an article about Ronald Ridenhour, a helicopter gunner and an Army whistleblower, who was among the first who started to uncover the truth about the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre. Haeberle contacted Joseph Eszterhas of \"The Plain Dealer\", which then published Haeberle's grisly images of the dead bodies of old men, women, and children on 20 November 1969. \"Time Magazine\"'s article on 28 November 1969 and in \"Life\" magazine on 5 December 1969, both of which included Haeberle's photos, finally brought M\u1ef9 Lai to the fore of the public debate about Vietnam War.\nRichard L. Strout, the \"Christian Science Monitor\" political commentator, wrote: \"American press self-censorship thwarted Mr. Ridenhour's disclosures for a year. 'No one wanted to go into it', his agent said of telegrams sent to \"Life\", \"Look\", and \"Newsweek\" magazines outlining allegations.\"\nAfterward, interviews and stories connected to the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre started to appear regularly in the American and international press.\nConcluding an ABC television news broadcast, anchorman Frank Reynolds said to his audience that, as a consequence of the allegations, \"our spirit as a people is scarred\". The massacre, he believed, offered \"the most compelling argument yet advanced for America to end its involvement in Vietnam, not alone because of what the war is doing to the Vietnamese or to our reputation abroad, but because of what it is doing to us\".\nCultural representations.\nIn theater.\n\"The Lieutenant\" is a 1975 Broadway rock opera that concerns the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre and resulting courts martial. It was nominated for four Tony Awards including Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical.\nPhotography.\nThe M\u1ef9 Lai massacre, like many other events in Vietnam, was captured on camera by U.S.\u00a0Army personnel. The most published and graphic images were taken by Haeberle, a U.S. Army Public Information Detachment photographer who accompanied the men of Charlie Company that day.\nIn 2009, Haeberle said that he destroyed a number of photographs he took during the massacre. Unlike the photographs of the dead bodies, the destroyed photographs depicted Americans in the actual process of murdering Vietnamese civilians. According to M.\u00a0Paul Holsinger, the \"And babies\" poster, which used a Haeberle photo, was \"easily the most successful poster to vent the outrage that so many felt about the human cost of the conflict in Southeast Asia. Copies are still frequently seen in retrospectives dealing with the popular culture of the Vietnam War era or in collections of art from the period.\"\nAnother soldier, John Henry Smail of the 3rd Platoon, took at least 16 color photographs depicting U.S.\u00a0Army personnel, helicopters, and aerial views of M\u1ef9 Lai. These, along with Haeberle's photographs, were included in the \"Report of the Department of the Army review of the Preliminary Investigations into the My Lai Incident\". Former First Lieutenant (1LT) Roger L. Alaux Jr., a forward artillery observer, who was assigned to Charlie Company during the combat assault on M\u1ef9 Lai 4, also took some photographs from a helicopter that day, including aerial views of M\u1ef9 Lai, and of the Charlie Company's landing zone.\nHistorical memorials.\nHo Chi Minh City.\nThe massacre is memorialized at two locations within Vietnam. The first is in Ho Chi Minh City at the War Remnants Museum, which contains exhibits relating to the First Indochina War and the Second Indochina War (the Vietnam War in the United States). This museum is the most popular museum in the city, attracting approximately half a million visitors every year. A number of Haeberle's photos are displayed in the museum along with other artifacts and information about the massacre.\nS\u01a1n M\u1ef9.\nThe second is the S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 Memorial Museum which is located at the site of the massacre and includes the remains of the village of S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province. A large black marble plaque just inside the entrance to the museum lists the names of all 504 civilians killed by the American troops, including \"17 pregnant women and 210 children under the age of 13.\" A number of enlarged versions of Haeberle's photos are shown inside the museum. The images are dramatically backlit in color and share the central back wall with a life-size recreation of American soldiers \"rounding up and shooting cowering villagers.\" The museum also celebrates American heroes, including Ridenhour who first exposed the killings, as well as Thompson and Colburn who intervened to save a number of villagers.\nAt the center of the museum grounds, which is at the heart of the destroyed village, is a large stone monument. The two children to the lower right in the sculpture are modeled on the two children in one of Haeberle's photos, often called \"Two Children on a Trail\". The two siblings were shot and wounded, but survived.\nSome American veterans choose to go on pilgrimage to the site of the massacre to heal and reconcile.\nM\u1ef9 Lai Peace Park.\nOn the 30th anniversary of the massacre, 16 March 1998, a groundbreaking ceremony for the M\u1ef9 Lai Peace Park was held away from the site of the massacre. Veterans, including Thompson and Colburn, attended the ceremony. Mike Boehm, a veteran who was instrumental in the peace park effort, said, \"We cannot forget the past, but we cannot live with anger and hatred either. With this park of peace, we have created a green, rolling, living monument to peace.\"\nOn 16 March 2001, the M\u1ef9 Lai Peace Park was dedicated, a joint venture of the Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province Women's Union, the Madison Quakers' charitable organization, and the Vietnamese government.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Common names include eryngo and sea holly (though not to be confused with true hollies, of the genus \"Ilex\").\nThese are annual and perennial herbs with hairless and usually spiny leaves. The dome-shaped umbels of steely blue or white flowers have whorls of spiny basal bracts. European and Asian species tend to be native to dry, rocky and coastal areas, and the American species are native to often damp grasslands.\nIn the language of flowers, they represent admiration.\nSystematics.\nTaxonomic history.\nThe genus name \"Eryngium\" was established by Linnaeus in 1753 where he mentioned eight species, including two from America (\"E. aquaticum\", \"E. foetidum\"). Linnaeus, in \"Genera Plantarum\" (1754), cited his source of the name \"Eryngium\" as being from Joseph Tournefort\u2019s \"Institutiones rei herbariae\" (1700). The name itself has an Ancient Greek origin as ().\nPrior to the nomenclatural establishment of \"Eryngium\" by Linnaeus, plants that can be recognised as belonging to the genus were mentioned by Theophrastus (371\u2013287BC), Pedanius Dioscorides (40\u201390AD), Otto Brunfels (1532) and Leonhart Fuchs (1543). Early mentions of American species were made by Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de Toledo (1651) and Leonard Plukenet (1692).\nAfter Linnaeus, a major treatment of the genus was made by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1798) who mentioned 25 species, and Antonio Jos\u00e9 Cavanilles (1800, 1801) who described at least seven species, six of which were from America. The first monograph of the genus was by Fran\u00e7ois-\u00c9tienne de La Roche (1808), which covers 50 species. In the 19th century further European and Asian species were described by Pierre Edmond Boissier and Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, and American species by Adelbert von Chamisso, Joseph Decaisne, William Jackson Hooker, August Grisebach, Willis Linn Jepson and Rodolfo Amando Philippi. In 1913 Karl F.A.H. Wolff published a major revision of the genus, discussing 196 species which he allocated to 34 sections while also recognising a division between Old World (Europe and Asia) and New World (America and Australia) species. The understanding of American species was further enhanced by Mildred E. Mathias (1906\u20131995) and Lincoln Constance (1909\u20132001) who published a synopsis of North American species (Mathias &amp; Constance 1941) and described a total of 18 species from North and South America. \nMore recently, Arno W\u00f6rz has made a major contribution to the understanding of the genus with his revision of European, Asian and African species (W\u00f6rz 2011) and his checklist of all species (W\u00f6rz 1999).\nEvolutionary history.\nIt is likely that the genus originated in Eurasia, with a radiation from west to east in subgenus \"Eryngium\", and the western Mediterranean being a primary centre of diversity. The American species are probably derived from a more recent intensive evolution and radiation, possibly from a single trans-Atlantic dispersal and subsequent landfall in southeastern South America where there is a primary diversity centre in southern Brazil and a younger secondary one in Mexico. It is likely that the sword-leaved structure seen in many American species occurred only once in the evolution of the genus. The palmate leaf patterns seen in Eurasian species do not occur in any American species.\nClassification.\nW\u00f6rz (2011) divided the genus into six subgenera, with one subgenus divided into 10 sections:\nSelected species.\nSpecies include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUses.\nHorticulture.\nEryngos are grown as ornamental plants in gardens. The most widely grown species are \"E. agavifolium\", \"E. alpinum\", \"E. bourgatii\", \"E. giganteum\", \"E. pandanifolium\", \"E. planum\", \"E. variifolium\" and \"E. yuccifolium\". Two hybrids have also been selected for garden use, one being \"E.\"\u00a0\u00d7 \"olivierianum\" (syn. \"E.\" x \"zabelii\"), of which there are several cultivars such as \u2018Big Blue\u2019, and the other is \"E.\"\u00a0\u00d7 \"tripartitum\". The species with the most cultivars is \"E. planum\". Overall, around 250 cultivars have been named in the genus. Some species and cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nMedicine and food.\nMany species of \"Eryngium\" have been used as medicine and food. \"Eryngium campestre\" is used as a folk medicine in Turkey. In Iran, \"Eryngium\" (Boghnagh \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc- \u0628\u0648\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0642) is used as herbal tea to lower blood sugar. \"Eryngium creticum\" is a herbal remedy for scorpion stings in Jordan. \"Eryngium elegans\" is used in Argentina and \"Eryngium foetidum\" in Latin America and South-East Asia. Native American peoples used many species for varied purposes. Cultures worldwide have used \"Eryngium\" extracts as anti-inflammatory agents. \"Eryngium\" yields an essential oil and contains many kinds of terpenoids, saponins, flavonoids, coumarins, and steroids.\nThe roots, particularly those of \"Eryngium maritimum\", have been used as vegetables or sweetmeats. Young shoots and leaves are sometimes used as vegetables like asparagus. \"Eryngium foetidum\" is used as a culinary herb in tropical parts of the Americas and Asia. It tastes similar to coriander or cilantro, and is sometimes mistaken for it. It may be called spiny coriander or culantro, or by its Vietnamese name of ngo gai.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A National Park, its highest point is Na Picamosques (172 m). Uninhabited, it is administratively part of the city of Palma in Mallorca.\nCabrera is the largest island of the small archipelago that includes (from south to north) the islands of Estells de Fora, L'Imperial, Illa de ses Bledes, Na Redona, Conillera, L'Esponja, Na Plana, Illot Pla, Na Pobra and Na Foradada.\nHistory.\nIn December 1530, Hayreddin Barbarossa, an Ottoman admiral of the fleet, captured the Castle of Cabrera, and started to use the island as a logistic base for his operations in the area. Barbarossa's naval victories secured Ottoman dominance over the Mediterranean during the mid-16th century, from 1530 until the Battle of Lepanto in 1571.\nCabrera was used to house French prisoners of war following the 1808 Battle of Bail\u00e9n. Of the 9,000 sent to Cabrera during the war, only 3,600 remained to be repatriated at its end in 1814, though 876 officers and sergeants were taken off in July 1810 and sailed to England. The island was to be supplied every two days with food and water but these ships often did not set sail. As well as dying of starvation, thirst and disease many were driven insane and some became cannibalistic. Inscriptions by the prisoners have been discovered in a cave at Cap Ventos, in the northwest of the island, an area still littered with buttons from their disintegrated uniforms.\nLate in 1916, a malfunctioning Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine remained at Cabrera for several hours, and the Spanish government subsequently decided to expropriate the island for defense. It is alleged that Juan March Ordinas, avoiding the blockade, had been selling supplies, including fuel, to submarine personnel, from the area of Cala Ganduf and S'Olla. There was strong international protest, particularly by the British Admiralty, as Spain was officially neutral during the First World War.\nCabrera remained a military zone until the 1980s, although from the 1920s some Mallorcan civilians rented out their Cabrera land for agriculture.\nIn 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, a Republican Air Force Dornier Wal D-1 airplane crashed near the island. The crew were captured by military nationalist forces, but two Republican submarines (a B2 and B3) sent by order of Pedro Marqu\u00e9s Barber (an old NCO and former military Menorca self-proclaimed governor) came immediately and the small Cabreran force surrendered. Facundo Flores Horrach (the chief military officer), Mariano Ferrer Bravo (a retired Spanish officer) and three civilians (males of the Su\u00f1er Mas family) were taken to Menorca and executed in a harbour place named S'Hort d'en Morillo (Mah\u00f3n). After the failure of Captain Alberto Bayo Column landing in Mallorca, from 15 August to 4 September, the Republican troops left Cabrera. Bayo's plan was for the CNT column, stationed in Cabrera, to appear at Dragonera Island just southwest of Mallorca and simulate a false landing. But the anarchist CNT command refused this tactic and later went to Mallorca. A bloody battle destroyed them in Porto Cristo. The rest of this column failed before it arrived and was killed on Sa Cabana, just outside their point of entry at Manacor.\nCabrera, which had been a former Santa Catalina, Palma de Mallorca district, was declared a National Park in April 1991. The Cabrera National Park is now administratively grouped with the municipality of Palma de Mallorca.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He had a key role in the events of the proclamation and first steps of the Second Spanish Republic. Appointed president of the Generalitat of Catalonia in 1934, after the death of the previous president, Francesc Maci\u00e0, his government tried to consolidate the recently acquired Catalan self-government and implement a progressive agenda, despite the internal difficulties. Opposed to the inclusion of the right-wing CEDA party in the coalition Spanish government during the strikes and insurgency in October 1934, on 6 October he proclaimed a new Catalan State. He and Catalan government officials were subsequently arrested and imprisoned. \nAfter the left-wing Popular Front won the Spanish national election in 1936, Companys was pardoned, and he returned to head the fractious Catalan government. He remained president during the Spanish Civil War, loyal to the Republican faction. A refugee in France after the Republican defeat in 1939, he was arrested in 1940 by the secret police of Nazi Germany, the Gestapo. Extradited back to Francoist Spain, he was executed on 15 October 1940.\nEarly life.\nLlu\u00eds Companys i Jover was born in El Tarr\u00f2s near Lleida in western Catalonia on 21 June 1882. His parents, Josep Companys and Maria Llu\u00efsa de Jover, were peasants with aristocratic roots. The second child of ten, Companys was sent to boarding school in Barcelona at the \"Liceu Poliglot\". He obtained his law degree from the University of Barcelona, where he met Francesc Layret, another Catalan nationalist with an interest in politics. \nCompanys participated in the political life of Catalonia from a young age. In 1906, the military pressured and attacked the offices of Catalan newspapers \"Cu-Cut!\" and \"La Veu de Catalunya\", events which were followed by the passage of the repressive \"Ley de Jurisdicciones\" (\"Law of Jurisdictions\"), making speech against Spain and its symbols a criminal offense. In response to these events, he participated in the creation of the successful coalition Solidaritat Catalana. Later, he became affiliated with the ephemeral Republican Nationalist Federal Union (\"Uni\u00f3 Federal Nacionalista Republicana\"), where he was president of the youth section. He was investigated for his intense youth activities and was jailed fifteen times. After the violent confrontations in Barcelona during Tragic Week in 1909, he was classified as a \"dangerous individual\" in police records.\nWith Francesc Layret, Companys represented the left-wing labour faction of the Partit Republic\u00e0 Catal\u00e0 (Catalan Republican Party), for which he was elected local councilor of Barcelona in 1916. In November 1920, he was arrested together with Salvador Segu\u00ed (known as \"El Noi del Sucre\"), Mart\u00ed Barrera and other trade unionists, and he was deported to the \"Castell de la Mola\" in Mah\u00f3n, Menorca. While Layret was preparing Companys' legal defense, he was assassinated by gunmen of the Sindicatos Libres. In the 1920 Spanish legislative elections Companys took the place of Layret, who would likely have won that election, and despite having been deported, Companys was elected member of parliament for Sabadell. As a member of parliament he had legal immunity, which secured his release from prison.\nIn 1922 Companys was one of the founders of the peasants' trade union Uni\u00f3 de Rabassaires, where he worked as lawyer and director of the \"La Terra\" magazine during the years of the Primo de Rivera regime in the 1920s. Detained again, he was unable to attend the \"Confer\u00e8ncia d'Esquerres\" (Conference of Leftists), held from 12 to 19 March 1931. The conference produced the political party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC, Republican Left of Catalonia) by merging Estat Catal\u00e0 (led by Francesc Maci\u00e0), the Partit Republic\u00e0 Catal\u00e0 itself, and the journal L'Opini\u00f3. The latter included Joan Lluh\u00ed as prominent figure. Nevertheless, Companys was elected as an executive member of ERC, representing the Partit Republic\u00e0 Catal\u00e0. Thanks to the bonds between the Spanish labor movement and the Spanish trade union movement, the election of Companys to this position gave the ERC great prestige in left-wing public opinion, as it would otherwise have been regarded as a party of the progressive petty bourgeoisie.\nProclamation of Second Spanish Republic.\nIn the 1931 Spanish local elections, the ERC won a surprise victory in Barcelona and other municipalities of Catalonia. After he learned the results, on 14 April, Companys, who was elected a city representative, and other ERC candidates together with the Party's leader Francesc Maci\u00e0, decided to take over by surprise the office of mayor and entered the City Hall. After some dispute, the transitional Mayor of Barcelona was deposed, and Companys was proclaimed new mayor. Subsequently, he hung a tricolour Spanish Republican Flag from the City Hall's balcony and proclaimed the Republic. Shortly after, Francesc Maci\u00e0 proclaimed the Catalan Republic within the Federation of Iberian Republics, a project that was later abandoned after gaining the promise of regional devolution and the restitution of the Catalan Generalitat (as autonomous government) from the new Republican government.\nAfter controlling the Barcelona City Hall, Maci\u00e0 ordered Companys to take the office of \"Gobernador Civil\" (civil governor) of the Barcelona Province, which at that time held considerable powers such as policing. It had been controlled by republican radicals during the proclamation of the republic. Maci\u00e0 probably wanted a less public office for Companys, whom he thought of as a political rival. Companys ran as a Barcelona provincial candidate in the December 1931 Spanish legislative election. After gaining a seat, he led the ERC representation and the Catalan minority group in the new Republican Parliament. He described his political objectives in Madrid: \"We, the Catalan members of the Parliament, have come here not only to defend our Statute of Autonomy [law of self-government], and the fraternal and democratic understanding of the members of Parliament; but, also to participate in matters that affect the greatness of Spain: the Constitution, the agrarian reforms and social legislation\". In 1932, Companys was elected the first Speaker of the Parliament of Catalonia.\nPresidency of Catalonia and proclamation of Catalan State.\nAfter the death of Francesc Maci\u00e0 on 25 December 1933, who was presiding over the Generalitat of Catalonia, Companys was elected the successor President of the Generalitat by the Catalan Parliament. He appointed a new coalition government composed by the Republican Left of Catalonia and the other left-wing republican and catalanist parties. Under his presidency, the Parliament passed laws to improve the living conditions of the popular classes and the petite bourgeoisie. One example was the Crop Contracts Law, which protected the tenant farmers and granted them access to the land they were cultivating. The law increased tensions, however, after it was contested by the Regionalist League, and it provoked a legal dispute with the Spanish government led by Ricardo Samper. Meanwhile, the Generalitat established its own Court of Appeal (\"Tribunal de Cassaci\u00f3\") and assumed executive powers in public order, according as the Statute of Autonomy stipulated. \nOn 6 October 1934, with the support of the Worker's Alliance and the pro-independence Escamots, Companys led a Catalan nationalist uprising. Companys proclaimed the Catalan State (Estat Catal\u00e0) within the \"Spanish Federal Republic\". The uprising was opposed by both the centrist and conservative Catalan representatives and the new centrist and right-wing republican government, led by Alejandro Lerroux. That government included ministers from the political party CEDA, which was considered by many left-wing sectors as nearly fascist. The attempt to form the Catalan state was seen as an attempt at a coup d'\u00e9tat, as Companys had revolted against the newly appointed center-right republican government and joined the Asturias miners' attempt at revolution. Companys asked Manuel Aza\u00f1a, who happened to be in Barcelona during the events, to lead the newly proclaimed Spanish Republican government, but Aza\u00f1a rejected the proposition. The proclamation was suppressed by the Spanish army, and the Catalan government members were arrested. Companys was sentenced to 30 years in prison. After the victory of the left-wing coalition Popular Front in the 1936 election, he was pardoned by the new Spanish government, and the Catalan government was restored. \nThe period after that election until July 1936 is considered a time of relative peace in Catalonia, in contrast with the rest of Spain. The Parliament restored their legislative activities. As a response to the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics held in Nazi Germany, the government prepared the People's Olympiad in Barcelona, with Companys as its honorary president. The Olympiad was planned to commence on 19 July, but on that same day the Spanish Army began a national coup d'\u00e9tat that would fail but eventually precipitate the Spanish Civil War. On the morning of 19 July, civil conflict began between Republican and Nationalist forces in Barcelona.\nCivil War.\nWhen the Spanish Civil War began, Companys sided with the Spanish Republic against the Nationalist faction. Responding to the coup attempt in Barcelona, several Catalan political and workers parties independently fought to defeat the local Nationalist forces, subsequently causing tensions in political power. As a consequence of the independently organized resistance, by the end of the fighting on 21 July some of the political parties wielded considerably more power than the government. These parties included: the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), an anarchist syndicalist trade union; the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI), a Spanish anarchist organization; the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a revolutionary anti-Stalinist communist party; and others. Companys was instrumental in organizing an umbrella collaboration between these diverse groups called the Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias (CCMA). CCMA was formed on 21 July and sponsored by his Catalan government to reconcile the political tensions, recover the control of the situation, and organize the war effort.\nIn November 1936, the Generalitat government was the target of a planned coup by members of the pro-independence party Estat Catal\u00e0, a break-away political party from Companys' ERC. Primarily objecting to Companys conciliation with anarchist groups, the conspirators intended to replace him with Prime Minister . The plot was exposed and some of its leaders jailed. Companys continued to try to maintain the unity of his fragile political coalition, but after the Soviet Union's consul, Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, threatened to cut off Russian aid to Catalonia for his continued collaboration with the anti-Stalinist POUM, he sacked POUM leader Andreu Nin from his post as Minister of Justice in December 1936. After May Days, a series of clashes between Republican factions in early May 1937 which saw the removal of the central role played by the anarchist CNT-FAI, control of public order, defense, borders and war industries (in the hands of the Generalitat since the beginning of the war) was assumed by the Spanish Republican government. Companys could only protest, and political tensions with the Spanish Republican forces increased. As a consequence of Soviet/Comintern and Spanish Communist Party (PCE) pressures, POUM was declared illegal on 16 June 1937; Nin disappeared soon thereafter, widely viewed as having been assassinated by Soviet agents.\nWith the fall of Barcelona to the Nationalists in January 1939, Companys feared for his life and left the city, departing on 24 January, 2 days prior to the Nationalist takeover. Ten days later he joined the half-million Republican soldiers and civilians in La Retirada escaping the Nationalists of Francisco Franco by crossing the Pyrenees of Catalonia to France. Companys crossed the French border at Coll de Lli, La Vajol with the Basque lehendakari (president) Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguirre on 5 February 1939, thus beginning his exile.\nExile and execution.\nA refugee in France in 1939 after the Civil War, Companys passed up various chances to leave France because his son Llu\u00eds was seriously ill in a clinic in Paris. His position became particularly perilous after Germany took France in June 1940. In collaboration with the Spanish police, the Gestapo arrested him in La Baule-les-Pins near Nantes on 13 August 1940. First detained in La Sant\u00e9 Prison in Paris, he was then extradited by Nazi German authorities to Spain in early September 1940. He was imprisoned at Puerta del Sol, Madrid's central square, in the basement of the headquarters of the Direcci\u00f3n General de Seguridad (General Directorate of State Security) at the Real Casa de Correos (Royal House of the Post Office). Held there for five weeks, he was kept in solitary confinement, interrogated, starved, tortured and brutally beaten. Senior figures of the Francoist State visited his cell, insulted him and threw coins or crusts of bread at him. \nIn a military trial held in Barcelona in mid-October 1940,\nCompanys was accused of military rebellion and sentenced to death. The trial lasted less than one hour and lacked legal guarantees. During the trial, Companys was courageously defended by Ram\u00f3n de Colub\u00ed, a young soldier who had fought in the war for the rebels. Colub\u00ed sent a telegram to Franco pleading for clemency for Companys, to no avail. In 2015 V\u00edctor Gay Zaragoza, a Catalan writer, found that Companys and Colub\u00ed were relatives.\nEfforts to save Companys were useless, and at 6:30\u00a0a.m. on 15 October 1940 he was executed at Montju\u00efc Castle. Refusing to wear a blindfold, he was taken barefoot before a firing squad of Civil Guards, and, as they fired, Companys shouted 'Per Catalunya!' (For Catalonia!). The cause of death was given as 'traumatic internal hemorrhage'. He was the only democratically elected president executed by fascism in Europe.\nLegacy.\nLlu\u00eds Companys is buried at the Montju\u00efc Cemetery within the memorial space Fossar de la Pedrera, which is dedicated to Republican victims of the Civil War. An annual memorial to Companys and the 1,700 Republicans executed for political reasons is held at his grave site on the anniversary of his execution on 15 October.\nIn Catalonia, Companys is viewed as a martyr to Catalan nationalism and independence. In Spain, Companys\u2019 legacy is divisive, however. While perceived favorably and with reverence by liberals, progressives and those favoring independence in Catalonia, conservative and right-wing factions in Catalonia and Spain view his memory as a threat to the unity of Spain. In recent years, multiple controversial and unsuccessful attempts have been made to rescind the guilty verdict of Companys' court martial.\nIn 1998 a monument to Companys was installed near Arc de Triomf, on Passeig de Llu\u00eds Companys in Barcelona. The poet Conxita Juli\u00e0, who as a teenager had written to Companys while he was in prison in 1934\u20131936, is portrayed next to Companys' image in the monument. The main stadium used for the 1992 Summer Olympics, located on Montju\u00efc, was officially named in his memory in 2001. Many cities and villages of Catalonia have named streets and squares after him.\nHis personal archive is located in the CRAI Library of the Pavilion of the Republic at the University of Barcelona. It consists of correspondence about him, as well as discourses and declarations between 1936 and 1938.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68298", "revid": "11639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68298", "title": "Huesca", "text": "Huesca (; ) is a city in north-eastern Spain, within the autonomous community of Aragon. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon between 1096 and 1118. It is also the capital of the Spanish province of the same name and of the comarca of Hoya de Huesca. In 2009, it had a population of 52,059, almost a quarter of the total population of the province. The city is one of the smallest provincial capitals in Spain.\nHuesca celebrates its main festival, the \"Fiestas de San Lorenzo\", in honor of Saint Lawrence, from 9 to 15 August.\nHistory.\nHuesca dates from pre-Roman times, and was once known as \"Bolskan\" (Iberian: ) in the ancient Iberian language. It was once the capital of the Vescetani, in the north of Hispania Tarraconensis, on the road from Tarraco (modern Tarragona) and Ilerda (modern Lleida) to Caesaraugusta (modern Zaragoza). During Roman times, the city was known as Osca, and was a Roman colony under the rule of Quintus Sertorius, who made Osca his base. The city minted its own coinage and was the site of a prestigious school founded by Sertorius to educate young Iberians in Latin and Roman customs. After Sertorius, it is thought that it was renamed Ileoscan () by Strabo. It appears to have been situated on silver mines.\nEighteenth-century Spanish historian Enrique Fl\u00f3rez has pointed out the impossibility of one city supplying such vast quantities of minted silver as has been recorded by ancient writers under the terms \"argentum Oscense\", \"signatum Oscense\"; and is of the opinion that \"Oscense\" meant \"Spanish\", being a corruption of \"Eus-cara\". The Romanised city was made a \"municipium\" by decree of Augustus in 30 BC.\nThe Arabs conquered the city in the late 8th century, and the city came to be called \"Washqah\" (\u0648\u0634\u0642\u0629 in Arabic), falling within the Upper March of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba. It was ruled by a local governor appointed from C\u00f3rdoba, but was repeatedly subject to political turmoil, rebellion and assassination as the Banu Qasi, Banu Amrus and Banu al-Tawil clans, as well as the Arista dynasty of Pamplona, struggled for control, autonomy and independence from the Emirate. In the mid-10th century, Wasqah was transferred to the Banu Tujib, who governed the Upper March from Zaragoza, and it became part of the Taifa of Zaragoza in 1018 when they successfully freed themselves from the disintegrating Caliphate. In 1094 Sancho Ramirez built the nearby Castle of Montearag\u00f3n with the intention of laying siege to Wasqah but was killed by a stray arrow as he reached the city's walls. It was conquered in 1096 by Peter I of Aragon and moved his royal capital to Huesca from the ancient capital of Jaca. In 1118 the Aragonese capital was moved to Zaragoza.\nIn 1354, King Peter IV of Aragon founded the University of Huesca, which initially had a faculty of theology. The school expanded, but by the end of the 16th century was eclipsed by the University of Zaragoza. The university was abolished in 1845.\nHistorically, Huesca was home to one of the most important Jewish communities in Aragon, third after Zaragoza and Calatayud. The town once had three synagogues. In 1489\u201390, the Inquisition prosecuted and burned several local Jews for having arranged the circumcision of two \"conversos\" some twenty-five years earlier. The Jewish community flourished until the 1492 expulsion of the Jews.\nDuring the First Carlist War, Huesca was the site of a battle between Spanish Constitutionalists and Carlists.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339) the \"Huesca Front\" was the scene of some of the worst fighting between the Republicans and Franco's army. Held by the Nationalists, the city was besieged by the Republicans, with George Orwell among them, but did not fall.\nModern Huesca.\nVarious streets in the centre of Huesca have recently been pedestrianised.\nGeography.\nHuesca lies on a plateau in the northern region of Arag\u00f3n, with an elevation of above sea level. Close to the city lie the Sierra de Guara mountains, which reach 2,077 m. The geographical coordinates of the city are: 42\u00b0 08\u00b4 N, 0\u00b0 24\u00b4 W.\nIts municipal area is 161.02\u00a0km2 and borders the municipalities of Almud\u00e9var, Vici\u00e9n, Monflorite-Lascasas Tierz, Quicena, Loporzano, Nueno, Igri\u00e9s, Banast\u00e1s, Chimillas, Alerre, Barbu\u00e9s and Albero Bajo.\nThe city lies from Zaragoza, from Pamplona, from Lleida, from Madrid and from Barcelona.\nCoat of arms.\nBoth the modern Coat of Arms of Huesca () (which date from the 16th century) and its mediaeval predecessor (from the 13th) include at their top the device of a block having a V-shaped notch. It is commonly said that it symbolises Salto de Rold\u00e1n ('Roland's Leap'), a natural rock formation about north of the city. Some writers have suggested that the official Spanish name of Huesca () derives from a Latin, Basque and Catalan word \"osca\", meaning notch or indentation, referring to the Salto de Rold\u00e1n.\nClimate.\nHuesca has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\"). with semi-arid influences. Winters are cool (with normal maximums from 8 to 16\u00a0\u00b0C and minimums from -2 to 6\u00a0\u00b0C) and summers are hot, with daily maximums reaching up to , while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The average precipitation is 480\u00a0mm per year. Frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall, with an average of three snowy days per year.\nMain sights.\nA double line of ancient walls can still be seen in present-day Huesca.\nNearby, in the territory of Quicena, lie the ruins of the Castle of Montearag\u00f3n Monastery.\nCulture.\nHuesca celebrates its most important annual festival in August: the festival (or fiesta) of San Lorenzo (Saint Lawrence), a native of Huesca martyred in 268 AD. The anniversary of his martyrdom falls on August 10. The fiesta starts on 9 August and finishes on the 15. Many of the inhabitants dress in green and white for the duration. San Lorenzo, born in Huesca, was a deacon in Rome and a martyr who, according to legend, was burned on a grille by the Romans. The grille is the symbol of San Lorenzo and can be seen in a number of decorative works in the city.\nEvery summer since 1973 the city has hosted the Huesca International Film Festival, an international gathering dedicated to short meter films. It is one of the six Spanish festivals qualifying for the Goya and the Academy Awards.\nNotable people.\nHuesca is the birthplace of film director Carlos Saura and his brother Antonio Saura, a contemporary artist.\nThe writer Oscar Sipan, winner of several literary prizes, was born in Huesca in 1974. The celebrated illustrator Isidro Ferrer, though born in Madrid, lives in the city.\nPopular references.\nHuesca is notable for the saying \"Tomorrow we'll have coffee in Huesca\", a running joke among militiamen of the Spanish Civil War. In February 1937, George Orwell was stationed near the falangist-held Huesca as a member of the POUM militia. In \"Homage to Catalonia\", Orwell writes about this running joke, originally a na\u00efvely optimistic comment made by one of the Spanish Republican generals:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Months earlier, when Si\u00e9tamo was taken, the general commanding the Government troops had said gaily: \"Tomorrow we'll have coffee in Huesca.\" It turned out that he was mistaken. There had been bloody attacks, but the town did not fall, and [the phrase] had become a standing joke throughout the army. If I ever go back to Spain I shall make a point of having a cup of coffee in Huesca.\nHuesca is also famous for the legend of the Bell of Huesca.\nTwin towns - sister cities.\nThe following are Sister cities of Huesca:\nTransportation.\nThe Autov\u00eda A-23 runs through Huesca, connecting the city with Zaragoza. While under construction as of 2018, the Autov\u00eda A-22 also connects Huesca to Lleida. The two highways will eventually connect.\nHuesca has been served by Huesca\u2013Pirineos Airport since 1930, but the airport does not currently have any scheduled commercial passenger services. The nearest airports are Zaragoza Airport, located south west and Lleida-Alguaire Airport, located to the south east of Huesca.\nHuesca railway station is served by regional and AVE trains to destinations including Zaragoza, Canfranc, Madrid and Jaca.\nSports.\nIn 2018, SD Huesca, became the town's first football team to be promoted to La Liga. They became the 63rd team to play in the league, and their stadium's maximum capacity was the smallest in the 2018\u201319 La Liga.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It had a population of 35,900 as of 2022, making it the least populated provincial capital in Spain. It is noted for its harsh climate, with a wide daily variation on temperatures and its renowned \"jam\u00f3n serrano\" (cured ham), its pottery, its surrounding archaeological sites, rock outcrops containing some of the oldest dinosaur remains of the Iberian Peninsula, and its famous events: \"\" during the weekend (Friday to Monday) closest to 10 July and \"Bodas de Isabel de Segura\" around the third weekend of February.\nTeruel is regarded as the \"town of Mud\u00e9jar\" (Moorish-influenced architecture) due to numerous buildings designed in this style. All of them are comprised in the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO.\nTeruel's remote and mountainous location above sea level and its low population has led to relative isolation within Spain. A campaign group with the slogan \"Teruel existe\" (\"Teruel exists\") was founded in 1999 to press for greater recognition and investment in the town and the province. Due in part to the campaign, transport connections to Teruel were improved with the construction of a motorway between Zaragoza and Sagunto. However, Teruel remains the only provincial capital in peninsular Spain without a direct road or railway link to the national capital, Madrid. A running joke in the Spanish online satirical publication El Mundo Today is that Teruel does not exist.\nHistory.\nThe area around Teruel has been populated since the times of the Celtiberians, who called it Turboleta. The place-name Turboleta could come from the Basque-Iberian term \"itur\" + \"olu\" + \"eta\" (place of the water source, spring), according to the theory of Basque-Iberism. The area was later occupied by the Romans, who left remains in nearby towns, such as Cella.\nSome authors claim that in the location of the current city of Teruel (specifically its Jewish quarter) was originally called Tirwal, a name that would have come from the Arabic word meaning \"tower.\" A Muslim enclave is said to have existed in that location in the year 935. However, the corresponding archaeological sites found there belong to a defensive structure, not a population center.\nOn 1 October 1171, King Alfonso II captured Tirwal. He was threatened by the Almohads\u2019 capture of Valencia, and wanted to strengthen the southern border of his kingdom. In the same year, he founded the city of Teruel, granting it fueros and privileges to facilitate the repopulation of the area.\nThe foundation of Teruel marked an unprecedented change in the political and territorial structure of southern Aragon. The predominance of Albarrac\u00edn and Alfambra during the Muslim era was replaced by that of the newly-founded cities, Teruel in particular, to the detriment of Alfambra, which would remain in the background under the organizing principle of manorialism.\nAccording to one legend, Teruel was founded when all the wise and important people of the town came together to look for signs and omens. The omen they found favorable was a bull, mooing from atop a high place with a star shining on it from above. The high place where they found the bull was eventually made into the town\u2019s main square. According to some authors, the name of the city has its origins in this meeting, since the combination of the words \u201cbull\u201d (\"toro\") and the name of the star, \"Actuel,\" would make \"Toroel,\" which could become \"Toruel.\" The legend of this encounter also explains the star and bull on the city\u2019s flag and coat of arms.\nThe inhabitants of Teruel intervened in the conquest of Valencia, which had been in the hands of the Muslims, and in the War of the Two Peters against the Kingdom of Castile. The population was granted the title of city in 1347 by Pedro IV of Aragon for their support in the Battle of \u00c9pila. In the Middle Ages, the Jewish and Mudejar communities attained considerable importance within the social and economic life of the city, since their aljamas were consolidated towards the end of the 13th century.\nThe Jewish Quarter of Teruel still preserves its name, and many archaeological sites have been found there. In the Middle Ages, Teruel possessed a prominent Jewish community, which was robust during the centuries Muslims were in power and enjoyed several privileges. Later on after the Christian reconquest of Spain, the Jewish community paid a yearly tax of 300 sueldos (in the 14th century). Its members were engaged in commerce and industry, especially in wool-weaving. During the persecutions of 1391 many of them were killed, while others accepted Christianity in order to save their lives.\nTeruel was fought over in the Spanish Civil War, and much of the city was destroyed. The Battle of Teruel in December 1937-February 1938, was one of the bloodiest of the war. The town changed hands several times, first falling to the Republicans and eventually being re-taken by the Nationalists. In the course of the fighting, Teruel was subjected to heavy artillery and aerial bombardment. The two sides suffered up to 140,000 casualties between them in the three-month battle. The Nationalists won a decisive victory.\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Teruel has a cold semi-arid climate (\"BSk\"). Summer temperatures are warm to hot, although there is much daily variation, and winters are cold, with low minimum temperatures sometimes dropping to . The lowest amount of rainfall is in winter and the highest in late spring and mid autumn.\nThe temperature records registered at the Observatory of Teruel were on August 14, 2021 and on January 12, 2021.\nMain sights.\nThe beauty of the town's cultural inheritance, which has some Islamic influence, has been recognised by UNESCO, which includes four churches in the World Heritage Site Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon, notably the town's ornate cathedral in the Mud\u00e9jar style.\nOne of Teruel's best known monuments is very small statue of a bull on top of a tall column, known as \"El Torico\" (\"the little bull\"). It is located in the main square, \"Plaza Carlos Castell\", more commonly known as the \"Plaza del Torico\" in the middle of the town center.\nOther sights include:\nOn the outskirts of Teruel is Din\u00f3polis Teruel, a combined theme park and museum centred on dinosaurs. Promoted as a paleontological park, it includes a life-size robotic model of a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\". Din\u00f3polis also owns three other museums in the surrounding area, which display the remains of dinosaurs discovered in the region. The chimney of the Teruel Power Plant is one of the tallest freestanding structures in Western Europe.\nEducation and research.\nA branch of the University of Zaragoza is located in Teruel. The Aragon Center for Physics of the Cosmos (CEFCA in Spanish), which conducts research in astrophysics and cosmology is also located in Teruel. CEFCA operates the Astrophysical Observatory of Javalambre (OAJ), which is located in the south of the Teruel province and recognized as a national Unique Scientific and Technical Infrastructure.\nTransportation.\nTeruel Airport opened in 2013, after being repurposed from an original military airbase; it is primarily an aircraft storage and maintenance facility, with no passenger traffic. The nearest passenger airport is Valencia Airport, which is located south east of Teruel.\nSport.\nThe 3rd Stage of The 2024 La Vuelta Femenina finished at Teruel on April 30.

{"id": "68300", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68300", "title": "Dominance (genetics)", "text": "One gene variant masking the effect of another in the other copy of the gene\nIn genetics, dominance is the phenomenon of one variant (allele) of a gene on a chromosome masking or overriding the effect of a different variant of the same gene on the other copy of the chromosome. The first variant is termed dominant and the second is called recessive. This state of having two different variants of the same gene on each chromosome is originally caused by a mutation in one of the genes, either new (\"de novo\") or inherited. The terms autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive are used to describe gene variants on non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) and their associated traits, while those on sex chromosomes (allosomes) are termed X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive or Y-linked; these have an inheritance and presentation pattern that depends on the sex of both the parent and the child (see Sex linkage). Since there is only one Y chromosome, Y-linked traits cannot be dominant or recessive. Additionally, there are other forms of dominance, such as incomplete dominance, in which a gene variant has a partial effect compared to when it is present on both chromosomes, and co-dominance, in which different variants on each chromosome both show their associated traits.\nDominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics. Letters and Punnett squares are used to demonstrate the principles of dominance in teaching, and the upper-case letters are used to denote dominant alleles and lower-case letters are used for recessive alleles. An often quoted example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape in peas. Peas may be round, associated with allele R, or wrinkled, associated with allele \"r\". In this case, three combinations of alleles (genotypes) are possible: RR, Rr, and rr. The RR (homozygous) individuals have round peas, and the rr (homozygous) individuals have wrinkled peas. In Rr (heterozygous) individuals, the R allele masks the presence of the \"r\" allele, so these individuals also have round peas. Thus, allele R is dominant over allele r, and allele r is recessive to allele R.\nDominance is not inherent to an allele or its traits (phenotype). It is a strictly relative effect between two alleles of a given gene of any function; one allele can be dominant over a second allele of the same gene, recessive to a third, and co-dominant with a fourth. Additionally, one allele may be dominant for one trait but not others. Dominance differs from epistasis, the phenomenon of an allele of one gene masking the effect of alleles of a \"different\" gene.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nGregor Johann Mendel, \"The Father of Genetics\", promulgated the idea of dominance in the 1860s. However, it was not widely known until the early twentieth century. Mendel observed that, for a variety of traits of garden peas having to do with the appearance of seeds, seed pods, and plants, there were two discrete phenotypes, such as round versus wrinkled seeds, yellow versus green seeds, red versus white flowers or tall versus short plants. When bred separately, the plants always produced the same phenotypes, generation after generation. However, when lines with different phenotypes were crossed (interbred), one and only one of the parental phenotypes showed up in the offspring (green, round, red, or tall). However, when these hybrid plants were crossed, the offspring plants showed the two original phenotypes, in a characteristic 3:1 ratio, the more common phenotype being that of the parental hybrid plants. Mendel reasoned that each parent in the first cross was a homozygote for different alleles (one parent AA and the other parent aa), that each contributed one allele to the offspring, with the result that all of these hybrids were heterozygotes (Aa), and that one of the two alleles in the hybrid cross dominated expression of the other: A masked a. The final cross between two heterozygotes (Aa X Aa) would produce AA, Aa, and aa offspring in a 1:2:1 genotype ratio with the first two classes showing the (A) phenotype, and the last showing the (a) phenotype, thereby producing the 3:1 phenotype ratio.\nMendel did not use the terms gene, allele, phenotype, genotype, homozygote, and heterozygote, all of which were introduced later. He did introduce the notation of capital and lowercase letters for dominant and recessive alleles, respectively, still in use today.\nIn 1928, British population geneticist Ronald Fisher proposed that dominance acted based on natural selection through the contribution of modifier genes. In 1929, American geneticist Sewall Wright responded by stating that dominance is simply a physiological consequence of metabolic pathways and the relative necessity of the gene involved.\nTypes of dominance.\nComplete dominance (Mendelian).\nIn complete dominance, the effect of one allele in a heterozygous genotype completely masks the effect of the other. The allele that masks are considered \"dominant\" to the other allele, and the masked allele is considered \"recessive\".\nWhen we only look at one trait determined by one pair of genes, we call it monohybrid inheritance. If the crossing is done between parents (P-generation, F0-generation) who are homozygote dominant and homozygote recessive, the offspring (F1-generation) will always have the heterozygote genotype and always present the phenotype associated with the dominant gene.\nHowever, if the F1-generation is further crossed with the F1-generation (heterozygote crossed with heterozygote) the offspring (F2-generation) will present the phenotype associated with the dominant gene \u00be times. Although heterozygote monohybrid crossing can result in two phenotype variants, it can result in three genotype variants - \u00a0homozygote dominant, heterozygote and homozygote recessive, respectively.In dihybrid inheritance we look at the inheritance of two pairs of genes simultaneous. Assuming here that the two pairs of genes are located at non-homologous chromosomes, such that they are not coupled genes (see genetic linkage) but instead inherited independently. Consider now the cross between parents (P-generation) of genotypes homozygote dominant and recessive, respectively. The offspring (F1-generation) will always heterozygous and present the phenotype associated with the dominant allele variant. However, when crossing the F1-generation there are four possible phenotypic possibilities and the phenotypical ratio for the F2-generation will always be 9:3:3:1.\nIncomplete dominance (non-Mendelian).\nIncomplete dominance (also called \"partial dominance\", \"semi-dominance\", \"intermediate inheritance\", or occasionally incorrectly \"co-dominance\" in reptile genetics) occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygous genotype is distinct from and often intermediate to the phenotypes of the homozygous genotypes. The phenotypic result often appears as a blended form of characteristics in the heterozygous state. For example, the snapdragon flower color is homozygous for either red or white. When the red homozygous flower is paired with the white homozygous flower, the result yields a pink snapdragon flower. The pink snapdragon is the result of incomplete dominance. A similar type of incomplete dominance is found in the four o'clock plant wherein pink color is produced when true-bred parents of white and red flowers are crossed. In quantitative genetics, where phenotypes are measured and treated numerically, if a heterozygote's phenotype is exactly between (numerically) that of the two homozygotes, the phenotype is said to exhibit \"no dominance\" at all, i.e. dominance exists only when the heterozygote's phenotype measure lies closer to one homozygote than the other.\nWhen plants of the F1 generation are self-pollinated, the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F2 generation will be 1:2:1 (Red:Pink:White).\nCo-dominance (non-Mendelian).\nCo-dominance occurs when the contributions of both alleles are visible in the phenotype and neither allele masks another.\nFor example, in the ABO blood group system, chemical modifications to a glycoprotein (the H antigen) on the surfaces of blood cells are controlled by three alleles, two of which are co-dominant to each other (\"IA\", \"IB\") and dominant over the recessive \"i\" at the ABO locus. The \"IA\" and \"IB\" alleles produce different modifications. The enzyme coded for by \"IA\" adds an N-acetylgalactosamine to a membrane-bound H antigen. The \"IB\" enzyme adds a galactose. The \"i\" allele produces no modification. Thus the \"IA\" and \"IB\" alleles are each dominant to \"i\" (\"IAIA\" and \"IAi\" individuals both have type A blood, and \"IBIB\" and \"IBi\" individuals both have type B blood), but \"IAIB\" individuals have both modifications on their blood cells and thus have type AB blood, so the \"IA\" and \"IB\" alleles are said to be co-dominant.\nAnother example occurs at the locus for the beta-globin component of hemoglobin, where the three molecular phenotypes of \"HbA/HbA\", \"HbA/HbS\", and \"HbS/HbS\" are all distinguishable by protein electrophoresis. (The medical condition produced by the heterozygous genotype is called \"sickle-cell trait\" and is a milder condition distinguishable from \"sickle-cell anemia\", thus the alleles show \"incomplete dominance\" concerning anemia, see above). For most gene loci at the molecular level, both alleles are expressed co-dominantly, because both are transcribed into RNA.\nCo-dominance, where allelic products co-exist in the phenotype, is different from incomplete dominance, where the quantitative interaction of allele products produces an intermediate phenotype. For example, in co-dominance, a red homozygous flower and a white homozygous flower will produce offspring that have red and white spots. When plants of the F1 generation are self-pollinated, the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F2 generation will be 1:2:1 (Red:Spotted:White). These ratios are the same as those for incomplete dominance. Again, this classical terminology is inappropriate \u2013 in reality, such cases should not be said to exhibit dominance at all.\nRelationship to other genetic concepts.\nDominance can be influenced by various genetic interactions and it is essential to evaluate them when determining phenotypic outcomes. Multiple alleles, epistasis, pleiotropic genes, and polygenic characteristics are some factors that might influence the phenotypic outcome.\nMultiple alleles.\nAlthough any individual of a diploid organism has at most two different alleles at a given locus, most genes exist in a large number of allelic versions in the population as a whole. This is called polymorphism, and is caused by mutations. Polymorphism can have an effect on the dominance relationship and phenotype, which is observed in the ABO blood group system. The gene responsible for human blood type have three alleles; A, B, and O, and their interactions result in different blood types based on the level of dominance the alleles expresses towards each other.\nEpistasis.\nEpistasis is interactions between multiple alleles at different loci. More specifically, epistasis is when one gene can mask the phenotype of a gene at a completely different locus. Therefore, several genes can influence the phenotype expressed. Epistasis is slightly different from dominance in the fact that dominance is an allele-to-allele interaction at one locus while epistasis is a gene-to-gene interaction at different loci. The dominance relationship between alleles involved in epistatic interactions can influence the observed phenotypic ratios in offspring.\nAn example of epistasis can be seen in Labrador retriever coat colors. One gene at one locus codes for the color of hair but another gene at a different locus determines if the color is even deposited in the hair. Recessive epistasis is seen in this example due to recessive alleles for color desposition masking both the dominant black (B) allele and recessive brown (b) allele at the first locus to express a yellow coat in the Labrador retriever. The yellow color comes from no pigment being deposited in the hair shaft. \nOther examples of epistasis interactions are dominant epistasis and duplicate recessive epistasis. Each type of epistasis is a modification of the dihyrbid ratio of 9:3:3:1.\nPleiotropic genes.\nPleiotropic genes are genes where one single gene affects two or more characteristics. An example of this concept is Marfan Syndrome which is a mutation of the FBN1 gene. The effects this causes are a person's appearance being tall and long limbed. They can also have Scoliosis, Ectopia Lentis, and larger than normal aortas. Pleiotropy shares a relationship with Epistasis. While pleiotropy represents one single gene, epistasis is multiple genes interacting with one another to cause different traits to arise.\u00a0 it is helpful to recognize how Epistasis could affect viewing pleiotropic genes if different traits arise or mask themselves to varying degrees.\nPolygenic characteristics.\nPolygenic characteristics are those affected by multiple genes at different loci. These different genes interact in a way to produce a quantitative characteristic, which is a characteristic that presents a wide variety phenotypes, such as height in humans. The greater the number of genes that interact to influence this characteristic, the greater the number of different phenotypes possible due to more possible genotypes. Many more characteristics also appear to be affected by more than one gene located on different loci, including diabetes and some autoimmune diseases. \u00a0\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Similar to the mitpa\u1e25at/tichel or snood worn by religiously observing married Jewish women, certain headcoverings worn by some Christian women, such as the hanging veil, apostolnik and kapp, and the dupatta favored by many North Indian Hindu and Sikh women, the hijab comes in various forms. The term describes a scarf that is wrapped around the head, covering the hair, neck, and ears while leaving the face visible. The use of the hijab, voluntarily and involuntarily, has grown globally since the 1970s, with religious Muslims viewing it as a symbol of modesty and faith; it is also worn as a form of adornment. There is consensus among mainstream Islamic religious scholars that covering the head is required.\nThe term was originally used to denote a partition and was sometimes used for Islamic rules of modesty. The Qur'an never uses the word \"hijab\" (lit. 'barrier') to refer to women's clothing, but rather discusses the attire of women using other terms Jilb\u0101b and \"khim\u0101r\" (generic headscarf).\nThere is variation in interpretations regarding the extent of covering required. Some legal systems accept the hijab as an order to cover everything except the face and hands, whilst others accept it as an order to cover the whole body, including the face and hands, via niqab. These guidelines are found in texts of hadith and fiqh developed after the revelation of the Qur'an. Some state that these guidelines are aligned with Qur'anic verses (ayahs) about hijab.\nIslamic veiling practices vary globally based on local laws and customs. In some regions, the hijab is mandated by law, while in others, its use is subject to restrictions or bans.\nWomen currently face pressure from other people, schools, and world governments, western or otherwise, regarding their choice to wear or not wear the hijab.\nTerminology and usage.\nThe Arabic word hijab () (lit. 'curtain, cloth barrier') is the verbal noun originating from the verb (hajaba), from the triliteral root (H-J-B), which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of hide, conceal, block. The term was originally used to denote a partition and was sometimes later used for Islamic rules of modesty. While one usage in the Quran refers to the curtain separating Muhammad's wives from visitors, other usages refers to a metaphysical barrier separating man or the world from God. \nThe Quran does not use the word hijab for women's clothing, but uses other terms such as jilbab (as an outer garment recommendation) and khimar (for discussions see below) in various contexts. The word in Turkish expresses an emotional state, shame, that is not related to clothing.\nIn Islamic scripture.\nQur'an.\nA verse in the Surah Al-A'raf-26 gives the simplest and most fundamental purpose of dressing as covering one's ugly parts and emphasizes that fear of God is more important than covering oneself. There are seven verses in the Quran that refer in some way to women's clothing, and the two discussed below are ostensibly related to the form of clothing; The clearest verses on this topic are Surah An-Nur https://, telling both men and women to dress and act modestly, with more detail on women's position.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and not to reveal their ornaments except what normally appears. Let them draw their veils over their chests, and not reveal their \u02f9hidden\u02fa adornments except to their husbands, their fathers, their fathers-in-law, their sons, their stepsons, their brothers, their brothers\u2019 sons or sisters\u2019 sons, their fellow women, those \u02f9bondwomen\u02fa in their possession, male attendants with no desire, or children who are still unaware of women\u2019s nakedness... \nThe \"ornaments\" in the verse has been interpreted and presented by some scholars as the parts that are adorned, and by others as the female body, with the potential to encompass the entire body. Meanwhile modesty is exalted in the Islamic understanding, the opposite behavior is despised as fahisha by Islamic scholars alike as emblematic of a state of spiritual ignorance Jahiliyyah. In Luxenberg's Syro-Aramaic Reading analysis on Qur'an, the part \"Let them draw their veils over their chests\" means literally as \"snap their belts around their waists\", an idiom, the belt was a symbol for chastity and does not order any organ to be covered with cloth. According to him, the meanings of the words in the relevant part of the verse are as follows: Khimar; cummerbund, jyb; sinus, sac, ; \"let them hit.\" (See also:Revisionist school of Islamic studies)\nA statement \u0131n Al-A\u1e25z\u0101b: 59 is as follows; &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;O Prophet, tell your wives, your daughters, and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (the plural form of jilbab ()) over themselves. That is more suitable \"so that they will be recognized and not be harmed\". And Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\nThis was a statement that tells women to wear their \"outer garments\" when going out for various needs (such as defecation), interpreted by some as a command and by others as a recommendation of protective measures against sexual harassment in Medina. \nThose who perceived the statement as a command were also divided into two; while most scholars consider it won't to include face, a small group arguing that \"the purpose of the veil is to prevent women from being recognized\", hence the face is included. The statement in question is as follows: () literally \"so that they will be recognized and not be harmed.\" In order to understand the expression, some narrations can give clues about the sociological infrastructure of the period. It is reported that Umar prohibited female slaves from resembling free women by covering their hair, no different from earlier social practices in which noble women who could wear ornate female headdresses were easily distinguished from slaves as in Mesopotamia, Assyria and ancient Greece. According to well-known explanation of the verse, by Al-Qurtubi the verse was an expression directed towards free and Muslim women, not slaves or non-Muslim women, for which Tabari cites Ibn Abbas. Ibn Kathir states that the \"jilbab\" was distinguishing free Muslim women from those of Jahiliyyah, so other men know they are free women and not slaves or prostitutes, so they are not harassed.\nSome later scholars like Ibn Hayyan, Ibn Hazm and Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani questioned the quoted explanation. Their reasons were that slaves were not explicitly excluded in the verse or hadith, and that they could attract lust more easily, and that the prohibition of adultery and molestation should also apply to slaves. What is said about the dimensions of the Jilbab varies; While Qurtubi reports that \"jilbab\" covers the whole body, Ibn Arabi considered that excessive covering would make impossible for a woman to be recognised, which the verse mentions.\nDuring Muhammad's lifetime.\nThe word \"\u1e25ij\u0101b\" in the Qur'an refers not to women's clothing but to a spatial partition or curtain as in other early Islamic texts in literal usage while in other cases the word denotes separation between deity and mortals (42:51), wrongdoers and righteous (7:46, 41:5), believers and unbelievers (17:45), and light from darkness (38:32). Available evidence suggests that veiling was not introduced into Arabia by Muhammad, but already existed there, particularly in the towns, although it was probably not as widespread as in the neighbouring countries such as Syria and Palestine. Similarly to the practice among Greeks, Byzantines, Jews, and Assyrians, its use was associated with high social status.\nThe current understanding of hijab can be traced back to the verse in Sura 33:53 which is believed to have been revealed in 627; states, \"And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts\". As Muhammad's influence increased, he entertained more and more visitors in the mosque, which was then his home. Often, these visitors stayed the night only feet away from his wives' apartments. It is commonly understood that this verse was intended to protect his wives from these strangers. Leila Ahmed adds that Muhammad's concubines did not wear veils, while his wives did, and emphasizes that the term \"darabat'\u00fcl hijab\" was used among Muslims over time to mean \"she entered among Muhammad's wives.\"\nSome have also offered different interpretations of this barrier; A visual barrier between Muhammad's family and the surrounding community, a physical barrier is used to create a space that provides comfort and privacy for individuals, and an ethical barrier, such as in the expression \"purity of hearts\" in reference to Muhammad's wives and the Muslim men to make something forbidden.\nHadith.\nThe Hadiths sources specify the details of hijab for men and women, exegesis of the Qur'anic verses attributed to the sahabah, and are a major source which Muslim legal scholars used to derive rulings. Sahih al-Bukhari records Aisha saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;`Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say to Allah's Messenger \"Let your wives be veiled\" But he did not do so. The wives of the Prophet used to go out to answer the call of nature at night only at Al-Manasi.' Once Sauda, the daughter of Zam`a, went out and she was a tall woman. `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her while he was in a gathering, and said, \"I have recognized you, O Sauda!\" He said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil. So Allah revealed the Verse of veiling.\nAisha also reported that when Quran https:// was revealed,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Although these narrations imply black clothing, other narrations indicate wives of Muhammad also wore other colored-clothes like yellow or rose.\nDress code in sharia.\nClassical fiqh have differed as how to understand Qur'anic verses on clothing; Sunni&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ and Shia scholars say hijab is mandatory, while Ismaili, accounting for ~0.25% of all Muslims, do not. Besides that traditional scholars had different opinions on covering the hands and face. Muslim scholars usually require women to cover everything but their hands and face in public, but do not require the \"niqab\" (a face covering worn by some Muslim women). In nearly all Muslim cultures, pre-pubescent girls are not required to wear a hijab. \nIn private, and in the presence of close relatives (\"mahrams\"), rules on dress relax. However, in the presence of the husband, most scholars stress the importance of mutual freedom and pleasure of the husband and wife.\nSome scholars argue that beyond the body of a woman, her voice is also a part of her \"awrah\" and should not be heard by men outside her immediate family. They cite some hadiths citing women's voices as a source of temptation and fitna (charmingness, attractiveness) and should be kept private and some verse interpretations.\nSunni.\nIn Sunni tradition, scholarly consensus (\"ijma\"') has discerned hijab is mandatory. The four major Sunni schools of thought (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali) believe that it is obligatory for free women to cover their hair, and the entire body except her face and hands, while in the presence of people of the opposite sex other than close family members.\nAccording to Hanafis, these requirements extend to being around non-Muslim women as well, for fear that they may describe her physical features to unrelated men. The Sunni Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas in Saudi Arabia, and Muhammad ibn Adam Al-Kawthari also believe women should cover their head.\nMen must cover from their belly buttons to their knees, though the schools differ on whether this includes covering the navel and knees or only what is between them.\nShia.\nIn Shia jurisprudence, by consensus, it is obligatory for women to cover their hair, and the entire body except her hands and face, while in the presence of people of the opposite sex other than close family members.\nThe major and most important Shia hadith collections such as Nahj Al-Balagha and Kitab Al-Kafi for the most part do not give any details about hijab requirements. However a quotation from the Shia Fiqh book Man La Yahduruhu al-Faqih Musa al-Kadhim in reply to his brother makes reference to female hijab requirements during the salat (prayer), stating \"She covers her body and head with it then prays. And if her feet protrude from beneath, and she doesn't have the means to prevent that, there is no harm\".\nModern approaches.\nModern approaches to this issue emerge under the influence of a series of social and intellectual developments, from the re-evaluation of religious sources and the questioning of sources that establish a androcentric / misogynist religious understanding to the protection of women's individual dignity, freedom and rights.\nClothing does not play a key role in Quranism. All Quranist movements agree that Islam has no sets of traditional clothing, except for the rules described in the Quran. Therefore, beards and the hijab are not necessary.\nModernist thinkers including Karen Armstrong, Reza Aslan and Leila Ahmed, believe the requirements of the hijab were initially intended solely for Muhammad's wives, serving to preserve their sanctity. This was because Muhammad conducted religious and civic matters in the mosque next to his home. Leila Ahmed further explains that Muhammad aimed at fostering a sense of privacy and protecting the intimate space of his wives from the constant presence of the bustling community at their doorstep. They argue that the term \"darabat al-hijab\" ('taking the veil') was used synonymously and interchangeably with \u2018becoming Prophet Muhammad's wife\u2019 and that during Muhammad's life no other Muslim woman wore the hijab. Aslan suggests that Muslim women started to wear the hijab to emulate Muhammad's wives, who are revered as \"Mothers of the Believers\" in Islam.\nKhaled Abou El Fadl argues that all Islamic moderates agree that, in all cases, the decision whether to wear the hijab should be a woman's autonomous decision\nand that her choice must be respected because the moderate pro-choice position is based on the Quranic teachings that there ought to be no compulsion in religion.\nSome traditionalist Muslim scholars accept the contemporary views and arguments as those hadith sources are not sahih and ijma would no longer be applicable if it is argued by scholars (even if it is argued by only one scholar). Notable examples of traditionalist Muslim scholars who accept these contemporary views include the Indonesian scholar Quraish Shihab.\nHistory.\nPre-Islamic veiling practices.\nVeiling did not originate with the advent of Islam. Statuettes depicting veiled priestesses date back as far as 2500 BC. Elite women in ancient Mesopotamia and in the Byzantine, Greek, and Persian empires wore the veil as a sign of respectability and high status. In ancient Mesopotamia, Assyria had explicit sumptuary laws detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society. Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so. Veiling was thus not only a marker of aristocratic rank, but also served to \"differentiate between 'respectable' women and those who were publicly available\".\nStrict seclusion and the veiling of matrons were also customary in ancient Greece. Between 550 and 323 BCE, prior to Christianity, respectable women in classical Greek society were expected to seclude themselves and wear clothing that concealed them from the eyes of strange men. Roman pagan custom included the practice of the head covering worn by the priestesses of Vesta (Vestal Virgins).\nIt is not clear whether the Hebrew Bible contains prescriptions with regard to veiling, but rabbinic literature presents it as a question of modesty (\"tzniut\"). Modesty became an important rabbinic virtue in the early Roman period, and it may have been intended to distinguish Jewish women from their non-Jewish counterparts in Babylonian and later in Greco-Roman society. According to rabbinical precepts, married Jewish women have to cover their hair (cf. \"Mitpa\u1e25at\"). The surviving representations of veiled Jewish women may reflect general Roman customs rather than particular Jewish practices. According to Fadwa El Guindi, at the inception of Christianity, Jewish women were veiling their heads and faces.\nThe best-known view on Christian headcovering is delineated in the Bible within the passage in 1 Corinthians 11:4\u20137, which states that \"every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head\". The early Church Fathers, including Tertullian of Carthage, Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus of Rome, John Chrysostom and Augustine of Hippo attested in their writings that Christian women should wear a headcovering, while men should pray with their heads uncovered. There is archaeological evidence demonstrating that headcovering was observed as an ordinance by women in early Christianity, and the practice of Christian headcovering continues among female adherents of many Christian denominations today, especially among Anabaptist Christians, as well as among certain Eastern Orthodox Christians, Oriental Orthodox Christians and Reformed Christians, among others.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, some Hindu women cover their heads and face with a veil in a practice known as \"ghoonghat\".\nIntermixing of populations resulted in a convergence of the cultural practices of Greek, Persian, and Mesopotamian empires and the Semitic peoples of the Middle East. Veiling and seclusion of women appear to have established themselves among Jews and Christians before spreading to urban Arabs of the upper classes and eventually among the urban masses. In the rural areas it was common to cover the hair, but not the face.\nAccording to Leila Ahmed, the rigid norms pertaining to veiling and seclusion of women found in Christian Byzantine literature had been influenced by ancient Persian traditions, and there is evidence to suggest that they differed significantly from actual practice. Leila Ahmed argues that \"Whatever the cultural source or sources, a fierce misogyny was a distinct ingredient of Mediterranean and eventually Christian thought in the centuries immediately preceding the rise of Islam.\"\nLater pre-modern history.\nDuring the history of slavery in the Muslim world, it is known that female slaves did show themselves unveiled. Slave women were visually identified by their way of dress. While Islamic law dictated that a free Muslim woman should veil herself entirely, except for her face and hands, in order to hide her awrah (intimate parts) and avoid sexual harassment, the awrah of slave women were defined differently, and she was only to cover between her navel and her knee. \nThis difference became even more prominent during the Abbasid Caliphate, when free Muslim women, in particular those of the upper classes, were subjected to even more sex segregation and harem seclusion, in contrast to the qiyan slave artists, who performed unveiled in male company.\nThe practice of veiling was borrowed from the elites of the Byzantine and Persian empires, where it was a symbol of respectability and high social status, during the Arab conquests of those empires. Reza Aslan argues that \"The veil was neither compulsory nor widely adopted until generations after Muhammad's death, when a large body of male scriptural and legal scholars began using their religious and political authority to regain the dominance they had lost in society as a result of the Prophet's egalitarian reforms\".\nBecause Islam identified with the monotheistic religions of the conquered empires, the practice was adopted as an appropriate expression of Qur'anic ideals regarding modesty and piety. Veiling gradually spread to upper-class Arab women, and eventually it became widespread among Muslim women in cities throughout the Middle East. Veiling of Arab Muslim women became especially pervasive under Ottoman rule as a mark of rank and exclusive lifestyle, and Istanbul of the 17th century witnessed differentiated dress styles that reflected geographical and occupational identities. Women in rural areas were much slower to adopt veiling because the garments interfered with their work in the fields. Since wearing a veil was impractical for working women, \"a veiled woman silently announced that her husband was rich enough to keep her idle.\"\nBy the 19th century, upper-class urban Muslim and Christian women in Egypt wore a garment which included a head cover and a \"burqa\" (muslin cloth that covered the lower nose and the mouth). The name of this garment, \"harabah\", derives from early Christian and Judaic religious vocabulary, which may indicate the origins of the garment itself. Up to the first half of the twentieth century, rural women in the Maghreb and Egypt put on a form of \"niqab\" when they visited urban areas, \"as a sign of civilization\".\nModern history.\nWestern clothing largely dominated fashion in Muslim countries in the 1960s and 1970s. For example, in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, some women wore short skirts, flower printed hippie dresses, or flared trousers. This changed following the military dictatorship in Pakistan, and Iranian revolution of 1979, when traditional conservative attire including the abaya, jilbab and niqab made a comeback. There were demonstrations in Iran in March 1979 after the hijab law, decreeing that women in Iran would have to wear scarves to leave the house, was brought in. However, this phenomenon did not happen in all countries with a significant Muslim population; in Turkey there has been a decline on women wearing the hijab in recent years, although under Erdo\u011fan Turkey is becoming more conservative and Islamic, as Turkey repeals the 1982 headscarf ban in public sector, and the founding of new fashion companies catering to women who want to dress more conservatively.\nEgyptian leader President Gamal Abdel Nasser claimed that, in 1953, he was told by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood organization that they wanted to enforce the wearing of the hijab, to which Nasser responded, \"Sir, I know you have a daughter in college, and she doesn't wear a headscarf or anything! Why don't you make her wear the headscarf? So you can't make one girl, your own daughter, wear it, and yet you want me to go and make ten million women wear it?\"\nThe late-twentieth century saw a resurgence of the hijab in Egypt after a long period of decline as a result of westernization. Already in the mid-1970s some college aged Muslim men and women began a movement meant to reunite and rededicate themselves to the Islamic faith. This movement was named the Sahwah, or awakening, and sparked a period of heightened religiosity that began to be reflected in the dress code.\nThe uniform adopted by the young female pioneers of this movement was named al-Isl\u0101m\u012b (Islamic dress) and was made up of an \"al-jilb\u0101b\u2014an unfitted, long-sleeved, ankle-length gown in austere solid colors and thick opaque fabric\u2014and al-khim\u0101r, a head cover resembling a nun's wimple that covers the hair low to the forehead, comes under the chin to conceal the neck, and falls down over the chest and back\". In addition to the basic garments that were mostly universal within the movement, additional measures of modesty could be taken depending on how conservative the followers wished to be. Some women choose to also utilize a face covering (niq\u0101b) that leaves only eye slits for sight, as well as both gloves and socks in order to reveal no visible skin.\nSoon this movement expanded outside of the youth realm and became a more widespread Muslim practice. Women viewed this way of dress as a way to both publicly announce their religious beliefs as well as a way to simultaneously reject Western influences of dress and culture that were prevalent at the time. Despite many criticisms of the practice of hijab being oppressive and detrimental to women's equality, many Muslim women view the way of dress to be a positive thing. It is seen as a way to avoid harassment and unwanted sexual advances in public and works to desexualize women in the public sphere in order to instead allow them to enjoy equal rights of complete legal, economic, and political status. This modesty was not only demonstrated by their chosen way of dress but also by their serious demeanor which worked to show their dedication to modesty and Islamic beliefs.\nControversy erupted over the practice. Many people, both men and women from backgrounds of both Islamic and non-Islamic faith questioned the hijab and what it stood for in terms of women and their rights. There was questioning of whether in practice the hijab was truly a female choice or if women were being coerced or pressured into wearing it.\nAs the awakening movement gained momentum, its goals matured and shifted from promoting modesty towards more of a political stance in terms of retaining support for Pan-Islamism and a symbolic rejection of Western culture and norms. Today the hijab means many different things for different people. For Islamic women who choose to wear the hijab it allows them to retain their modesty, morals and freedom of choice.\nAfter the September 11 attacks, the discussion and discourse on the hijab in Western nations intensified as Islamic traditions and theology came under greater scrutiny, with Hijabis facing extensive discrimination. According to the Harvard University Pluralism Project: \"Some Muslim women cover their head only during prayer in the mosque; other Muslim women wear the hijab; still others may cover their head with a turban or a loosely draped scarf.\"\nContemporary practice.\nThe styles and practices of hijab vary widely across the world. An opinion poll conducted in 2014 by The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research asked residents of seven Muslim-majority countries (Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia, Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia) which style of women's dress they considered to be most appropriate in public. The survey found that the headscarf (in its tightly- or loosely-fitting form) was chosen by the majority of respondents in Egypt, Iraq, Tunisia and Turkey. The response rate for people of Turkey was just about 60%. In Saudi Arabia, 63% gave preference to the \"niqab\" face veil; in Pakistan the \"niqab\", the full-length \"chador\" robe and the headscarf, received about a third of the votes each; while in Lebanon half of the respondents in the sample (which included Christians and Druze) opted for no head covering at all. The survey found \"no significant difference\" in the preferences between surveyed men and women, except in Pakistan, where more men favoured conservative women's dress. However, women more strongly support women's right to choose how to dress. People with university education are less conservative in their choice than those without one, and more supportive of women's right to decide their dress style, except in Saudi Arabia.\nSome fashion-conscious women have been turning to non-traditional forms of hijab such as turbans. While some regard turbans as a proper head cover, others argue that it cannot be considered a proper Islamic veil if it leaves the neck exposed.\nIn Iran, where wearing the hijab is legally required, many women push the boundaries of the state-mandated dress code, risking a fine or a spell in detention. The former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani had vowed to rein in the morality police and their presence on the streets has decreased since he took office, but the powerful conservative forces in the country have resisted his efforts, and the dress codes are still being enforced, especially during the summer months. After Ebrahim Raisi became president, he started imposing hijab laws strictly, announcing use of facial recognition in public transport to enforce hijab law. An Iranian woman, Mahsa Amini, died in custody of 'morality police' after they arrested her on new stricter hijab laws, which led to widespread protests. Women's resistance in Iran is gaining traction as an increasing number of women challenge the mandatory wearing of the hijab. Smith (2017) addressed the progress that Iranian women have made in her article, \"Iran surprises by realizing Islamic dress code for women,\" published by \"The Times\", a news organization based in the UK. The Iranian government has enforced their penal dress codes less strictly and instead of imprisonment as a punishment have implemented mandatory reform classes in the liberal capital, Tehran. General Hossein Rahimi, the Tehran's police chief stated, \"Those who do not observe the Islamic dress code will no longer be taken to detention centers, nor will judicial cases be filed against them\" (Smith, 2017). The remarks of Tehran's recent police chief in 2017 reflect political progress in contrast with the remarks of Tehran's 2006 police chief. Iranian women activists have made a headway since 1979 relying on fashion to enact cultural and political change.\nIn Turkey the hijab was formerly banned in private and state universities and schools. The ban applied not to the scarf wrapped around the neck, traditionally worn by Anatolian villager women, but to the head covering pinned neatly at the sides, called \"t\u00fcrban\" in Turkey, which has been adopted by a growing number of educated urban women since the 1980s. As of the mid-2000s, over 60% of Turkish women covered their head outside home. However the majority of those wear a traditional, non-Islamic head covering and only 11% wore a \"t\u00fcrban\". The ban was lifted from universities in 2008, from government buildings in 2013, and from schools in 2014.\nThe hijab is also a common cultural practice for Muslims in the West. For example, in a 2016 Environics poll, a large majority (73%) of Canadian Muslim women reported wearing some sort of head-covering in public (58% wear the hijab, 13% wear the chador and 2% wear the niqab). Wearing a head covering in public had increased since the 2006 survey. Women who wear the Hijab may be called \"hijabi\".\nMeanwhile, in a Pew Research Center poll from 2011, most Muslim American women also reported wearing hijab, 36% indicating they wore hijab whenever they were in public, with an additional 24% saying they wore it most or some of the time; 40% said they never wore hijab.\nAround the world.\nSome governments encourage and even oblige women to wear the hijab, while others have banned it in at least some public settings. In many parts of the world women also experience informal pressure for or against wearing the hijab, including physical attacks.\nLegal enforcement.\nIn Gaza, there was a campaign by religious conservatives such as Hamas to impose the hijab on women during the First Intifada. In 1990, the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) declared that it rejected the imposition of a hijab policy for women, and targeted those who seek to impose the hijab, but that declaration was argued to have come too late, as many women had already yielded to the pressure in order to avoid harassment. After assuming the government in the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Hamas sought to enforce Islamic law, imposing the hijab on women at courts, institutions and schools.\nIran transitioned from banning veils in 1936 to mandating Islamic dress for women following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. By 1980, veiling was required in government and educational settings, with the 1983 penal code imposing 74 lashes for not adhering to the hijab, though the exact requirements were unclear. This led to public tensions and vigilante actions regarding proper hijab. Subsequent regulations in 1984 and 1988 clarified dress-code standards, and the current penal code prescribes fines or prison terms for failing to observe hijab, without detailing its specific form.\nThe enforcement of the dress code in Iran has fluctuated between strict and relaxed over the years, leading to ongoing debate between conservatives and reformists like Hassan Rouhani. The United Nations Human Rights Council has urged Iran to uphold the rights of those advocating for dress code reforms. The government officially promotes stricter veiling, citing both Islamic principles and pre-Islamic Iranian culture.\nRuhollah Khomeini maintained that women do not have to wear a full-body cover. He stated that women can choose any kind of attire they like so long as it covers them properly and they have a hijab. His successor, Ali Khamenei, stated that the hijab does not hinder participation in social, political, or academic activities. In 2024, the former president of Iran Hassan Rouhani criticised the reinstatement of Iran's morality police and the implementation of the \"Noor plan\" by law enforcement authorities. He expressed shock over the hijab law approved by the Guardian Council which prescribed severe punishment for those violating it, saying that it \"aligns neither with the Constitution, nor with justice, nor with the Qur'an and Islamic culture.\"\nThe Indonesian province of Aceh encourages Muslim women to wear hijab in public. Indonesia's central government granted Aceh's local government the right to impose Sharia in 2001, although that no local regulations should conflict with Indonesian national laws, in a deal aiming to put an end to the separatist movement in the province.\nSaudi Arabia formally required women to cover their hair and wear a full-body garment, though enforcement varies. Saudi women typically wear the abaya, while foreigners may choose long coats. Regulations are enforced by religious police, which once faced criticism for their role in a fire rescue where schoolgirls' lack of hijabs was reportedly a factor, leading to 15 deaths. \nDuring the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the wearing of the hijab is mandated for women. The requirement extends to covering not only their heads but also their faces, as it was believed that doing so would prevent any perceived impropriety and maintain modesty in society.\nLegal bans.\nMuslim world.\nThe tradition of veiling hair in Persian culture has ancient pre-Islamic origins, but the widespread custom was ended by Reza Shah's government in 1936, as the hijab was considered to be incompatible with modernization and he ordered \"unveiling\" act or Kashf-e hijab. In some cases the police arrested women who wore the veil and would forcibly remove it. These policies had popular support but outraged the Shi'a clerics, to whom appearing in public without their cover was tantamount to nakedness. Some women refused to leave the house out of fear of being assaulted by Reza Shah's police. In 1941, the compulsory element in the policy of unveiling was abandoned.\nTurkey had a ban on headscarves at universities until recently. In 2008, the Turkish government attempted to lift a ban on Muslim headscarves at universities, but were overturned by the country's Constitutional Court. In December 2010, however, the Turkish government ended the headscarf ban in universities and schools. The ban for civil servants remains in place.\nIn Tunisia, women were banned from wearing the hijab in state offices in 1981; in the 1980s and 1990s, more restrictions were put in place.\nIn June 2024, Tajikistan's parliament passed a bill banning \"foreign clothing\" and religious celebrations for children during the Islamic holidays of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. The upper house, Majlisi Milli, approved the legislation on 19 June, following approval by the lower house, Majlisi Namoyandagon, on 8 May. The bill specifically targets the hijab, a traditional Islamic headscarf. This formalization of restrictions comes after years of Tajikistan unofficially discouraging Islamic attire, including headscarves and bushy beards. In 2007, the Ministry of Education banned both Islamic clothing and Western-style miniskirts in schools, a policy later extended to all public institutions. Minister of Culture Shamsiddin Orumbekzoda told Radio Free Europe that Islamic dress was \"really dangerous\". Under previous laws, women wearing hijabs are already banned from entering the country's government offices.\nEurope.\nIn the former Soviet Union, a broad atheistic Sovietization campaign was undertaken by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to remove all manifestations of gender inequality within the Union Republics of Central Asia, targeting prevalent practices among Soviet Muslims, such as female veiling practices.\nOn 15 March 2004, France passed a law banning \"symbols or clothes through which students conspicuously display their religious affiliation\" in public primary schools, middle schools, and secondary schools. In the Belgian city of Maaseik, the niq\u0101b has been banned since 2006. On 13 July 2010, France's lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a bill that would ban wearing the Islamic full veil in public. It became the first European country to ban the full-face veil in public places, followed by Belgium, Latvia, Bulgaria, Austria, Denmark and some cantons of Switzerland in the following years.\nBelgium banned the full-face veil in 2011 in places like parks and on the streets. In September 2013, the electors of the Swiss canton of Ticino voted in favour of a ban on face veils in public areas. In 2016, Latvia and Bulgaria banned the burqa in public places. In October 2017, wearing a face veil became also illegal in Austria. This ban also includes scarves, masks and clown paint that cover faces to avoid discriminating against Muslim dress. In 2016, Bosnia-Herzegovina's supervising judicial authority upheld a ban on wearing Islamic headscarves in courts and legal institutions, despite protests from the Muslim community that constitutes 40% of the country. In 2017, the European Court of Justice ruled that companies were allowed to bar employees from wearing visible religious symbols, including the hijab. However, if the company has no policy regarding the wearing of clothes that demonstrate religious and political ideas, a customer cannot ask employees to remove the clothing item. In 2018, the Danish parliament passed a law banning the full-face veil in public places.\nIn 2016, more than 20 French towns banned the use of the burqini, a style of swimwear intended to accord with rules of hijab. Dozens of women were subsequently issued fines, with some tickets citing not wearing \"an outfit respecting good morals and secularism\", and some were verbally attacked by bystanders when they were confronted by the police. Enforcement of the ban also hit beachgoers wearing a wide range of modest attire besides the burqini. Media reported that in one case the police forced a woman to remove part of her clothing on a beach in Nice. The Nice mayor's office denied that she was forced to do so and the mayor condemned what he called the \"unacceptable provocation\" of wearing such clothes in the aftermath of the Nice terrorist attack.\nA team of psychologists in Belgium have investigated, in two studies of 166 and 147 participants, whether the Belgians' discomfort with the Islamic hijab, and the support of its ban from the country's public sphere, is motivated by the defence of the values of autonomy and universalism (which includes equality), or by xenophobia/ethnic prejudice and by anti-religious sentiments. The studies have revealed the effects of subtle prejudice/racism, values (self-enhancement values and security versus universalism), and religious attitudes (literal anti-religious thinking versus spirituality), in predicting greater levels of anti-veil attitudes beyond the effects of other related variables such as age and political conservatism.\nIn 2019, Austria banned the hijab in schools for children up to ten years of age. The ban was motivated by the equality between men and women and improving social integration with respect to local customs. Parents who sent their child to school with a headscarf would be fined 440 euro. The ban was overturned in 2020 by the Austrian Constitutional Court.\nIn 2019, Staffanstorp Municipality in Sweden banned all veils for school pupils up to sixth grade.\nIndia.\nIn India, Muslim women are allowed to wear the hijab and/or burqa anytime, anywhere. However, in January 2022, a number of colleges in the South Indian state of Karnataka stopped female students wearing the hijab from entering the campus, following which the state government issued a circular banning 'religious clothes' in educational institutions where uniforms are prescribed. On 15 March 2022, the Karnataka High Court, in a verdict, upheld the hijab ban in educational institutions where uniforms are prescribed, arguing that the practice is non-essential in Islam. The hijab ban was condemned inside India and abroad by officials in countries including the United States, Bahrain and Pakistan, as well as by Human Rights Watch, and by figures like Malala Yousafzai.\nA study published by human rights body People's Union for Civil Liberties reported that the move to ban hijab has widened the social divide and increased fear among Muslims in Karnataka.\nChina.\nIn Xinjiang province, the Chinese government has banned women from wearing veils as part of a major crackdown on what it sees as religious extremism from Muslim Uyghurs.\nUnofficial pressure to wear hijab.\nIn Srinagar, the capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, a previously unknown militant group calling itself Lashkar-e-Jabbar claimed responsibility for a series of acid attacks on women who did not wear the burqa in 2001, threatening to punish women who do not adhere to their vision of Islamic dress. Women of Kashmir, most of whom are not fully veiled, defied the warning, and the attacks were condemned by prominent militant and separatist groups of the region.\nSome women in Jordan have reported unofficial pressure to wear a hijab in 2018.\nUnofficial pressure against wearing the hijab.\nIn recent years, women wearing the hijab have been subjected to verbal and physical attacks worldwide, particularly following terrorist attacks. Louis A. Cainkar writes that the data suggest that women in hijab rather than men are the predominant target of anti-Muslim attacks, not because they are more easily identifiable as Muslims, but because they are seen to represent a threat to the local moral order that the attackers are seeking to defend. Some women stop wearing the hijab out of fear or following perceived pressure from their acquaintances, but many refuse to stop wearing it out of religious conviction, even when they are urged to do so for self-protection.\nKazakhstan has no official ban on wearing the hijab, but those who wear it have reported that authorities use a number of tactics to discriminate against them.\nIn 2015, authorities in Uzbekistan organized a \"deveiling\" campaign in the capital city Tashkent, during which women wearing the hijab were detained and taken to a police station. Those who agreed to remove their hijab were released \"after a conversation\", while those who refused were transferred to the counterterrorism department and given a lecture. Their husbands or fathers were then summoned to convince the women to obey the police. This followed an earlier campaign in the Fergana Valley.\nAfter the election of Shavkat Mirziyoyev as President of Uzbekistan in December 2016, Muslims were given the opportunity to openly express their religious identity, which manifested itself in the wider spread of hijabs in Uzbekistan. In July 2021, the state allowed the wearing of the hijab in public places.\nIn Kyrgyzstan in 2016, the government sponsored street banners aiming to dissuade women from wearing the hijab.\nWorkplace discrimination against hijab-wearing women.\nDiscrimination against Muslims often affects women more due to the hijab making them more visible, leading to workplace prejudice, particularly after the rise of Islamophobia post-9/11. Hijab-wearing Muslim women face both overt and covert discrimination in job applications and workplace environments, with covert bias often resulting in more hostile treatment. Perceived discrimination can harm well-being, but may also be overcome by religious pride and community; studies show hijab-wearing women often find greater strength and belonging despite challenges.\nThe issue of discrimination against Muslims affects Muslim women more due to the hijab making them more identifiable compared to Muslim men. Particularly after the September 11 attacks and the coining of the term Islamophobia, some of Islamophobia's manifestations are seen within the workplace. Women wearing the hijab are at risk of discrimination in their workplace because the hijab helps identify them for anyone who may hold Islamophobic attitudes. Their association with the Islamic faith automatically projects any negative stereotyping of the religion onto them. As a result of the heightened discrimination, some hijab-wearing Muslim women in the workplace resort to taking off their hijab in hopes to prevent any further prejudice acts.\nA number of hijab-wearing women who were interviewed expressed that perceived discrimination also poses a problem for them. To be specific, Muslim women shared that they chose not to wear the headscarf out of fear of future discrimination.\nThe discrimination hijab-wearing Muslim women face goes beyond affecting their work experience; it also interferes with their decision to uphold religious obligations. As a result, hijab-wearing Muslim women in the United States have worries regarding their ability to follow their religion, because it might mean they are rejected employment.\nA study by Ali et al. (2015) found a relationship between the discrimination Muslims face at work and their job satisfaction. In other words, the discrimination hijab-wearing Muslim women face at work is associated with their overall feeling of contentment of their jobs, especially compared to other religious groups.\nHijab-wearing Muslim women not only experience discrimination whilst in their job environment; they also experience discrimination in their attempts to get a job. An experimental study conducted on potential hiring discrimination among Muslims found that in terms of overt discrimination there were no differences between Muslim women who wore traditional Islamic clothing and those who did not. However, covert discrimination was noted towards Muslim who wore the hijab, and as a result were dealt with in a hostile and rude manner. While observing hiring practices among 4,000 employers in the U.S., experimenters found that employers who self-identified as Republican tended to avoid making interviews with candidates who appeared Muslim on their social network pages.\nOne instance that some view as hijab discrimination in the workplace that gained public attention and made it to the Supreme Court was \"EEOC v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch\". The U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission took advantage of its power granted by Title VII and made a case for a young hijabi female who applied for a job, but was rejected due to her wearing a headscarf which violated Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's pre-existing and longstanding policy against head coverings and all black garments.\nDiscrimination levels differ depending on geographical location; for example, South Asian Muslims in the United Arab Emirates do not perceive as much discrimination as their South Asian counterparts in the U.S. Although, South Asian Muslim women in both locations are similar in describing discrimination experiences as subtle and indirect interactions. The same study also reports differences among South Asian Muslim women who wear the hijab, and those who do not. For non-hijabis, they reported to have experienced more perceived discrimination when they were around other Muslims.\nPerceived discrimination is detrimental to well-being, both mentally and physically. However, perceived discrimination may also be related to more positive well-being for the individual. A study in New Zealand concluded that while Muslim women who wore the headscarf did in fact experience discrimination, these negative experiences were overcome by much higher feelings of religious pride, belonging, and centrality.\nWorld Hijab Day.\nThe World Hijab Day (WHD), which is an annual event founded by Bangladeshi American Nazma Khan in 2013, takes place on 1 February each year in 140 countries worldwide.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Jack Albertson as Ed Brown (the Man), the cantankerous owner of a run-down garage in an East Los Angeles barrio, and Freddie Prinze (until Prinze's suicide in the third season) as Chico Rodriguez, an upbeat, optimistic young Mexican American who comes in looking for a job. It was the first American television series set in a Mexican-American neighborhood. Albertson won an Emmy as best actor in a comedy series in 1976.\nConception.\nThe series was created by James Komack who produced other successful TV shows such as \"The Courtship of Eddie's Father\" and \"Welcome Back, Kotter\". Comedians Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong (better known as the comedic duo Cheech &amp; Chong) have stated that Komack followed the comedians on tour for three months; Chong wrote in his 2009 book \"Cheech &amp; Chong: The Unauthorized Autobiography\" that Komack based the show on Cheech and Chong skits titled \"The Old Man in the Park\" and \"Pedro and Man\" and had acknowledged that fact to Chong after the television series' release. Cheech and Chong have both stated that Komack had originally approached them to star in the show, but they turned down the offer, preferring to stick to films.\nKomack told the Associated Press that he first tried working with Cheech and Chong on a show about a Chicano and a Nisei. Komack said he decided to make the show about a young Chicano and a \"seventh-generation WASP\" after he and the comedy team \"couldn't get it together\".\nNBC suggested someone like Jack Albertson as Ed/\"The Man\", and Komack approached him. Though not impressed with the pilot script, Albertson agreed on the trust of Komack's reputation. Freddie Prinze was discovered by Komack who received a recommendation from a friend who saw Prinze's appearance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" in December 1973. Komack thought he would be perfect for the role of Chico Rodriguez. Though initially rejected by NBC executives, he stood out against two other finalists in testing.\nIn the opening of the sitcom \u201cChico and the Man,\u201d which ran from 1974 to 1978, starring Freddie Prinze, featured b-roll footage of the Gypsy Rose, also known as the \u201cMost famous lowrider in the world.\u201d It's a 1964 Impala that has been in many museums and has been inducted into the National Historic Vehicle Register. \"Chico and the Man\" gave the viewer a glimpse of what Lowrider culture was like in East LA and LA in the 70s\nSynopsis.\nA hard-drinking widower, Ed stubbornly refuses to fit in with the changing East L.A. neighborhood and has alienated most of the people who live around him. He uses ethnic slurs and berates Chico, a Latino, in an effort to get him to leave when Chico comes looking for a job. Yet Chico sees something in Ed, and sneaks back in at night to clean up the garage and move into an old van that Ed has parked inside. As Ed sees all the effort Chico has put in, he begins to warm up to Chico. Over the course of the show, Ed grows to see Chico as family, although Ed denies this on several occasions.\nThe chemistry between Jack Albertson's \"Ed\" and Freddie Prinze's \"Chico\" was a major factor in making the show a hit in its first two seasons. It debuted in the top 10 and remained in the top 30 for its second season.\nAs the show progressed, Chico's background was revealed as being Mexican on his father's side and Puerto Rican on his mother's side, and (in a nod to Prinze's faux-Hungarian ancestry) \"...\u00a0my grandmother speaks a little Hungarian!\" (though Prinze's paternal ancestry was actually German, in his stage-act he would claim his father was Hungarian, thereby allowing him to comically refer to himself as \"Hungarican\"). Chico was revealed to have spent part of his childhood in Hungary following the death of his mother, being raised by his aunt Connie (a character who appeared in two other episodes). Chico attempts to explain his situation to Ed by portraying it as the dilemma of his distant cousin in Hungary, torn between the farmer for whom he now works and whom he has grown to love, and another farmer who has offered him a better job. During this scene and this episode, the love between these disparate characters was made clear for the first time, which Chico's cousin Carlos (played by actor Richard Yniguez) notes when he releases Chico from his promise. By the second season, Ed begins to see that he is a part of a bigger world, although he still complains about it. By this time he has found himself a girlfriend by the name of Flora (played by Carole Cook).\nThe theme song was written and performed by Jos\u00e9 Feliciano.\nPrinze's death.\nAfter struggling with depression and drug use, Freddie Prinze shot himself on January 28, 1977. He was taken off life support and died the following day at the age of 22.\nThe last episode to star Prinze, \"Ed Talks to God\", was taped several hours before Prinze's death.\nPost-Prinze episodes.\nAfter Prinze's death, the producers considered canceling the show, but opted instead to try replacing the character. To write Chico out of the script, they had the other characters comment that he had gone to visit his father in Mexico. The third season finished out with three episodes without Chico, focusing on the other characters in the show.\nIn the opening episode of the fourth season, a replacement for Chico was introduced. Instead of an adult, the producers brought in 12-year-old Raul, played by Gabriel Melgar. His first appearance came when Ed and Louie go on a fishing trip to Tijuana and find the Mexican orphan hiding out in their trunk on their return. At the end of this episode, Ed is putting Raul to bed and accidentally calls him Chico. Raul corrects him and Ed remarks, \"You're all Chicos to me.\" Ed eventually adopts Raul, only to have Raul's overprotective Aunt Charo \u2013 played by actress/singer Charo \u2013 come from Spain and try to become a part of the \"family\", as well.\nA two-part episode ran in the final season in which Raul discovers Chico's belongings in a closet. Ed catches Raul playing Chico's guitar and Ed smashes it on the van in anger. Raul believes Ed does not love him anymore and runs away to Mexico. Ed goes after him and finally explains to Raul that Chico died, but did not say how, putting a measure of closure on the fate of Chico in the series.\nIn January 1978, after one further episode, NBC placed \"Chico and the Man\" on hiatus. The show returned in June, and the unaired episodes were broadcast through the summer of 1978, although one episode remained unaired during the final network run.\nToward the end of the show's final season, actress Julie Hill was added to the cast as Monica, Ed's attractive 18-year-old adopted niece. She had come to Los Angeles to break into show business, and lived in Chico's old van while awaiting her big break. \"Chico and the Man\" was canceled at the end of the fourth season. The show's ratings declined steadily after Prinze's death and never recovered.\nSupporting cast.\nThe show also had a veteran and talented supporting cast. Scatman Crothers portrayed Louie Wilson, Ed's friend and garbageman; Bonnie Boland played Mabel, the mail lady; Isaac Ruiz portrayed Mando, Chico's friend; and Ronny Graham played Rev. Bemis. Also, Della Reese played Della Rogers, Ed's neighbor and landlady, and Jeannie Linero appeared in several episodes as one of Chico's more constant girlfriends, nurse Liz Garcia.\nNotable guest stars.\nOther notable guest stars included: \nSyndication.\nWith 88 episodes, the series fell short of the 100 episodes most syndicators desired for a full rollout, and Prinze's death caused a sudden shift in the series that further made the show undesirable for reruns. The series has been shown in syndication in only few markets and only for a relatively short period. NBC broadcast repeats of \"Chico and the Man\" briefly on weekday mornings from May 9 to December 2, 1977.\nNickelodeon\u2019s TV Land network also broadcast reruns during 2001 as did ION Television in 2007. AmericanLife TV Network also aired this series previously, as well as WGN-TV in Chicago.\nIn Canada, the show previously appeared on Sun TV (CKXT-TV) in Toronto.\nIn Italy, aired on Rete 4 in 1984.\nFrom 2005 to 2009, episodes of the show were available on AOL's now-defunct video website called In2TV.\nThe complete series began streaming on Tubi in December 2023.\nHome media.\nOn September 27, 2005, six episodes of \"Chico and the Man\" were released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' \"Television Favorites\" compilation series and the episodes are as follows:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Albertson was a Tony, Oscar, and Emmy winning actor, which ranks him among a rare stature of 24 actors who have been awarded the \"Triple Crown of Acting\".\nFor his performance as John Cleary in the 1964 play \"The Subject Was Roses\" and its 1968 film adaptation, he won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This again places him among a select status as one of eleven peers who have won both awards for the same role. His other roles include Grandpa Joe in \"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory\" (1971), Manny Rosen in \"The Poseidon Adventure\" (1972), and Ed Brown in the television sitcom \"Chico and the Man\" (1974\u20131978), for which he won an Emmy. For his contributions to the television industry, Albertson was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1977 at 6253 Hollywood Boulevard.\nEarly life.\nAlbertson was born on June 16, 1907, in Malden, Massachusetts, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants Flora (n\u00e9e Craft) and Leopold Albertson. His older sister was actress Mabel Albertson. Their mother, a stock actress, supported the family by working in a shoe factory. Until the age of 22, Albertson was known as \"Harold Albertson\". His father abandoned his mother before Jack was born, and the boy was raised by his stepfather, Alex Erlich, a barber.\nDuring a 1972 \"New York Daily News\" interview with Sidney Fields, Albertson reminisced:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I was bright but disruptive. I didn't do homework. To cover, I made wisecracks and funny faces at the teachers. They told me to take my business elsewhere.\" Albertson dropped out of high school, ending his formal education after a single year. He worked at several different jobs including: the local General Electric plant; in one of many shoe factories in the Lynn, Massachusetts area; and as a rack boy in neighborhood pool parlors, where he was a fairly good pool hustler, although he was always on guard to avoid playing anyone who could \"out-hustle\" him. The pool hall provided Albertson with an opportunity to learn a few tap dance routines from his fellow hustlers.\nWhen he was eighteen, he began to be paid for his prize winning shows. His sister Mabel taught him the first \"time steps\" in tap dancing, and he picked up additional routines by watching vaudeville acts that played his hometown. Around this time, he started singing with a group called \"The Golden Rule Four,\" who held their practice sessions beneath a railroad bridge.\nCareer.\nBroadway.\nAlbertson joined the vaudeville road troupe known as the Dancing Verselle Sisters. He then worked in burlesque as a hoofer (soft shoe dancer) and straight man to Phil Silvers on the \"Minsky's Burlesque Circuit\". Besides vaudeville and burlesque, he appeared on the stage in many Broadway plays and musicals, including \"High Button Shoes\", \"Top Banana\", \"The Cradle Will Rock\", \"Make Mine Manhattan\", \"Show Boat\", \"Boy Meets Girl\", \"Girl Crazy\", \"Meet the People\", \"The Sunshine Boys\" \u2013 for which he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor, and \"The Subject Was Roses\" \u2013 for which he won a Tony for Best Supporting Actor.\nFilm.\nAlbertson appeared in more than 30 films. He had an early minor role in \"Miracle on 34th Street\" as a postal worker who redirects dead letters addressed to \"Santa Claus\" to the courthouse where Kris Kringle is on trial. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the 1968 film \"The Subject Was Roses\". He later apologized to child actor and fellow nominee Jack Wild for winning the award; Albertson expected Wild to win for his role in \"Oliver!\" Also nominated was Albertson's later \"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory\" co-star Gene Wilder, for his role in \"The Producers\".\nAlbertson appeared as Charlie Bucket's Grandpa Joe in \"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory\" (1971), and in \"The Poseidon Adventure\" (1972), where he played Manny Rosen, husband to Belle, played by Shelley Winters.\nAlbertson said that his one regret was that he did not reprise his role in the movie version of \"The Sunshine Boys\". When producer Ray Stark acquired the film rights from Neil Simon in 1973, Albertson was expected to play the part, but by the time MGM had bought the rights in 1974 and was preparing to begin filming in February 1975, Albertson was not available because he was appearing on \"Chico and the Man\" on TV.\nRadio.\nAlbertson was a radio performer early in his career. Among the shows he appeared on were \"Just Plain Bill\", \"Lefty\", \"That's My Pop\" and \"The Jack Albertson Comedy Show\". In the late 1940s he was for a time a regular on the \"Milton Berle Show\".\nTelevision.\nAlbertson appeared in many television series, such as \"Hey, Jeannie!\" with Jeannie Carson, the syndicated Western series \"Frontier Doctor\" with Rex Allen, Rod Cameron's syndicated crime drama \"State Trooper\", and the 1961\u20131962 drama series \"Bus Stop\". He guest-starred on the David Janssen crime-drama series \"Richard Diamond, Private Detective\".\nFrom 1960 to 1961, Albertson was cast in three episodes of \"Pete and Gladys\", with Harry Morgan and Cara Williams. On January 2, 1961, Albertson was cast as Sampson J. Binton, with DeForest Kelley as Alex Jeffords, in \"Listen to the Nightingale\", the series finale of \"Riverboat\", starring Darren McGavin. Albertson had a recurring role as the neighbor Walter Burton in eight episodes of the 1962 ABC sitcom \"Room for One More\", with Andrew Duggan and Peggy McCay. He had recurring roles in \"Ensign O'Toole\" (1962\u201363) and \"Run, Buddy, Run\" (1966). Between 1961 and 1964, Albertson appeared seven times on \"Mister Ed\" as Paul Fenton, brother-in-law (later just brother) to Wilbur Post's next-door-neighbor Kay, appearing as a stopgap regular for several episodes after the death of Larry Keating in 1963.\nOther 1960s series on which Albertson appeared were: NBC's sitcom \"Happy\", starring Ronnie Burns; \"Glynis\", starring Glynis Johns; and Keith Andes, which aired for 13 weeks in the fall of 1963. Albertson appeared in two episodes of \"The Twilight Zone\". In a 1967 episode of \"The Andy Griffith Show\", he played the ne'er-do-well cousin, Bradford J. Taylor, of series character Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). He also appeared in a 1969 episode of the TV series \"The Virginian\" entitled \"Girl in the Shadows.\" He appeared in The Big Valley episode \"The Battle of Mineral Springs\" (1969). In 1970, Albertson appeared as Billy \"Moose\" Valentine in The Men From Shiloh, the rebranded name for \"The Virginian\" in the episode titled \"With Love, Bullets and Valentines\".\nFrom 1971 to 1972, he co-starred, with actor Sam Groom, in the Canadian TV series \"Dr. Simon Locke\". He then co-starred as \"The Man\" Ed Brown on the popular series \"Chico and the Man\" with Freddie Prinze. He stayed for its entire run from 1974 to 1978. He earned an Emmy Award for that role in 1976, which was his second; his first was for an appearance on the variety show \"Cher\" in 1975.\nPersonal life.\nHe resided for many years in West Hollywood, California. In 1978, he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, but kept this information private and continued to act. Two of his last roles were in the television movies, \"My Body, My Child\" (1982) and \"Grandpa, Will You Run with Me?\" (1983), both filmed in 1981 and released posthumously. His final theatrical role was as the hunter, Amos Slade, in Disney's 24th animated feature, \"The Fox and the Hound\", originally released in the summer of 1981, four months before his death.\nHe and his wife, June, had one daughter, Maura Dhu, who is married to actor Wes Studi.\nDeath.\nOn the morning of November 25, 1981, Albertson died at his Los Angeles home in the Hollywood Hills at the age of 74 from colon cancer. He and his elder sister, \"Bewitched\" actress Mabel Albertson (who died 10\u00a0months later from Alzheimer's disease), were cremated and their ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RSI) on behalf of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR). It is the only time that the contest has been hosted by a solo male presenter.\nInspired principally by the Italian Sanremo Music Festival, held annually since 1951, the concept of a televised European song contest, initially proposed by Italian broadcaster (RAI), was formulated by an EBU committee led by Swiss broadcaster and executive Marcel Bezen\u00e7on. Following approval at the EBU's General Assembly in 1955, the rules and structure of the contest were agreed upon. Several of the rules utilised in this first contest would subsequently be altered for future editions, and it remains the only edition in which each country was represented by two songs, with a voting process which was held in secret and where juries could vote for the entries from their own country.\nBroadcasters from seven countries participated in the inaugural edition of the contest, and the first winner was the host country Switzerland, with the song \"\" performed by Lys Assia. The result was determined by an assembled jury composed of two jurors from each country, with each juror giving each song a score between one and ten. Only the winning country and song were announced at the conclusion of the event, with the results of the remaining participants unknown. Even though it was broadcast on television via the Eurovision network and radio in ten countries, no video footage of the event is known to exist, with the only video available being of the reprise performance from an independent archiver; the majority of the broadcast is, however, available in audio.\nOrigins.\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was formed in 1950 among 23 organisations with the aim of facilitating creative cooperation and the exchange of television programmes. The word \"Eurovision\" was first used as a telecommunications term in the United Kingdom in 1951, in reference to a programme by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) being relayed by Dutch television, and was subsequently used as the title for the union's new transmission network upon its creation in 1954. Following the formation of the EBU, a number of notable events were transmitted through its networks in several European countries, including Belgium, France, West Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. A series of international exchange programmes were subsequently organised for 1954, with this \"European Television Season\" relayed live across Europe through the Eurovision network.\nFollowing this series of transmissions, a \"Programme Committee\" was set up within the EBU to investigate new initiatives for cooperation between broadcasters each year, with Marcel Bezen\u00e7on of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR) serving as the committee's first president. This committee agreed to study the concept for a new televised European song contest during a meeting in January 1955, a concept initially proposed by the Italian broadcaster (RAI) and inspired by its both the Sanremo Music Festival, held annually since 1951, and the Venice International Song Festival held in 1955 on the radio. The new European contest was subsequently approved at the EBU's annual General Assembly in October 1955, leading to the creation of the \"European Grand Prix\".\nLocation.\nThe first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland, following an offer by the SRG SSR to stage the event at the EBU's General Assembly in October 1955. In addition, Switzerland was a logical choice from a technical perspective for the hosting of what was a live, simultaneous, cross-border transmission, as its geographically central location in Europe facilitated terrestrial broadcasts across the continent, as well as being the location of the EBU's headquarters. The selected venue for the contest was the , a casino and former theatre situated on Lake Lugano. It had a capacity of 700 seats. 400 seats in the stalls were reserved for invited guests whereas tickets for the balcony were on sale from 17 May 1956 for . The theatre, used for theatrical and musical performances, ballroom dance and other shows, closed shortly after featuring its last performance in April 1997 before being demolished in 2001 to make room for the extension of the casino.\nParticipants.\nBroadcasters from seven countries participated in this first contest\u00a0\u2013 Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and West Germany (identified simply as \"Germany\" in the contest). Those from Austria and Denmark are believed to have also been interested in participating; however, they reportedly missed the cut-off point for entry. These two, as well as the BBC in the United Kingdom, would broadcast the contest along with those in the participating countries, with the BBC having chosen to not send an entry for this event in favour of organising its own contest, the \"Festival of British Popular Songs\".\nTwo of the performers, Switzerland's Lys Assia and Luxembourg's Mich\u00e8le Arnaud, performed both entries for their respective countries. Assia, as well as the Netherlands' Corry Brokken and Belgium's Fud Leclerc, would return to compete in the contest in future editions, with Assia returning in 1957 and 1958, Brokken also returning in 1957 and 1958, and Leclerc returning in 1958, 1960, and 1962.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction and format.\nA planning sub-group, headed by Eduard Hass of SRG SSR, was formed following the sign-off on the organisation of the event to build out the rules of the competition. Taking inspiration from the Sanremo Music Festival and the Venice International Song Festival as a basis in planning the new contest, the group made several amendments and additions to these rules to suit its international nature. Ideas suggested but ultimately rejected during this planning phase included featuring each song a second time with a piano accompaniment instead of orchestral backing, as well as technical initiatives such as a separate producer from each participating broadcaster involved in the contest's organisation. Prize money for the winners was also ruled out at this stage. The rules of the contest were finalised and distributed to EBU members in early 1956. The rules set out in detail the criteria for the participating songs and performers; production details and requirements; timelines for the submission of materials by the participating broadcasters; the method by which the winning song would be determined; details related to the financing of the event; and the responsibilities which lay with the host broadcaster and the participating broadcasters.\nThe inaugural Eurovision Song Contest was produced by the Italian-language radio broadcaster (RSI), in cooperation with the television service of SRG SSR, which brought a television production truck from Zurich to Lugano. Franco Marazzi served as director of the event on behalf of RSI, with Rolf Liebermann overseeing the production and the jury deliberations on behalf of the EBU as its executive supervisor and jury president.\nEach participating broadcaster submitted into the contest a maximum of two songs not exceeding three to three-and-a-half minutes in duration, which must have been solely original compositions. They had sole discretion on how to select their entries for the contest but were strongly encouraged by the EBU to hold their own national contests to determine their representatives. Each song was accompanied by a 24-piece orchestra, with members of the Radiosa Orchestra supplemented by strings of the Italian Swiss Radio Symphony Orchestra, presided over by the contest's musical director, Fernando Paggi; the contest's musical director was also available to conduct the performances of the participating entries if a separate conductor was not otherwise appointed by that country.\nBroadcasters were required to submit to the EBU by 10 May 1956 scores for their participating songs for use by the orchestra, audio recordings of each song, and copies of the songs lyrics in the original language, as well as translations into French or English to aid the jury members and commentators. The confirmed selection of each country's musical director (if separate to that of the host) was required to be communicated between 21 and 24 May. According to the rules, the order in which the countries and songs were performed was to be determined artistically by the host broadcaster, with input and support by the musical directors from each country. However, a draw determining the order of countries seems to have taken place in Gardone a few days prior to the contest. Rehearsals in the contest venue with the competing artists and the orchestra began on 21 May 1956.\nFollowing the performance of all songs, the winner was determined by an assembled jury composed of two individuals from each country, with each individual member rating secretly each song between one and ten, including those representing their own country, with higher scores given to more appreciated songs. The jury followed the contest in the bridge room in the same venue in Lugano through a small television screen, replicating the conditions as close as possible to how viewers at home would watch the contest. The winning song was thus that which gained the highest score from the votes cast by all jury members. In the event of a tie between two or more entries all songs with the highest score would have been declared winners.\nIn news reports at the time, according to one Dutch juror, the jury members were removed from the jury room once they had cast their votes and were therefore unable to follow the tabulation of the final results. The jury members from Luxembourg were unable to attend the contest in Lugano, and subsequently the EBU allowed two Swiss nationals to vote in their place. This would remain the only contest in which many of these rules would be utilised, and several changes were made ahead of the 1957 contest. These included restricting each country to only one song, expanding the number of performers allowed to participate for each country, introducing a more visible voting system, and restricting each country from voting for their own entry.\nContest overview.\nThe contest was held on 24 May 1956, beginning at 21:00 (CET) with an approximate duration of 1 hour 40 minutes. The event was hosted in Italian by Lohengrin Filipello. This remains the only time in which the contest was hosted by a solo male presenter, and one of only two contests not to feature a female presenter, alongside the 2017 contest held 61 years later. Additionally this would remain the only contest to feature a male presenter for 22 years, until the 1978 contest featured a male and female presenting duo.\nDuring the interval between the final competing act and the announcement of the winner, performances by and were featured to entertain the audience, with the latter performing \"Guerre de Troie\" and \"Ma mie, ma caravelle\" along with other works. Upon the announcement of the results, the winning artist returned to the stage for a reprise performance of the winning song to end the broadcast.\nThe winning song was \"\", composed by G\u00e9o Voumard, written by \u00c9mile Gardaz, performed by Lys Assia and representing the host country Switzerland. During the reprise performance of the winning song, Assia became emotional and suffered a lapse in memory of the song's lyrics, subsequently requesting a restart by the orchestra. After the show, a reception for the participating delegations was held in the upper hall of Teatro Kursaal on behalf of the host city Lugano, the canton of Ticino, and SRG SSR.\nThe full results of the contest were not revealed, with only the winning song named at the end of the show by the jury president Rolf Liebermann; the full breakdown of the scores of each juror has not been retained by the EBU, and is presumed lost. Attempts to reconstruct the voting through interviews with jury members have also failed to reveal a reliable result. An article in Italian newspaper published on 25 May 1956, the day after the contest, reported that Switzerland's winning entry received a score of 102 in total, while in a post-contest interview with Stelio Molo, the director-general of SRG SSR, published in the Italian magazine in the weeks following the contest, the gap between the first- and second-placed songs was revealed by Molo to be two points, and that the remaining entries also finished close to the winner. These claims have not been corroborated by the contest's organisers in the years since.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Winner\nBroadcasts.\nBroadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. In addition to the television channels of the seven participating broadcasters and three non-participating passive broadcasters, the contest was also broadcast live on seven radio networks and recorded for later transmission by another 13. The United Kingdom's BBC took only partial live transmission of the event, joining 45 minutes into the contest and only showing the second set of entries from each country. Due to a technical fault, the transmission of images was interrupted during Math\u00e9 Alt\u00e9ry's performance for about three minutes on German, Danish, and French television.\nNo video footage of the whole contest is known to exist, with the only known footage being clips of the reprise performance of the winning song via newsreel and other recordings. As such, this is one of only two editions of the contest, along with the 1964 contest, to not have video recordings of the full event retained. Audio of most of the contest has, however, survived, with only the majority of the contest's interval acts currently lost. Attempts to find audiovisual materials related to the contest have yielded some results in recent years, including a large cache of photographs and some video footage taken by Swiss photographer Vincenzo Vicari from inside the venue.\nBroadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The practice of honoring monarchs with temple names began during the Shang dynasty in China and had since been adopted by other dynastic regimes in the Sinosphere, with the notable exception of Japan. Temple names should not be confused with era names (\u5e74\u865f), regnal names (\u5c0a\u865f) or posthumous names (\u8b1a\u865f).\nModern academia usually refers to the following rulers by their temple names: Chinese monarchs from the Tang to the Yuan dynasties, Korean rulers of the Goryeo (until AD 1274) and Joseon dynasties, and Vietnamese rulers of the L\u00fd, Tr\u1ea7n, and Later L\u00ea dynasties (with the H\u1ed3 and Later Tr\u1ea7n dynasties as exceptions).\nNumerous individuals who did not rule as monarch during their lifetime were posthumously elevated to the position of monarch by their descendants and honored with temple names. For example, Cao Cao was posthumously honored as an emperor and given the temple name \"Taizu\" by Cao Pi of the Cao Wei dynasty. Meanwhile, several individuals who were initially assigned temple names had their titles revoked, as was the case for Emperor Huan, whose temple name, \"Weizong\", was abolished by Emperor Xian of the Eastern Han dynasty. In other cases, numerous individuals were honored with more than one temple name by intentional changes or being accorded different titles by different individuals. For instance, the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty was originally honored as \"Taizong\" by the Hongxi Emperor, but his temple name was later amended to \"Chengzu\" by the Jiajing Emperor. There were also instances of individuals ruling as the sovereign of a particular realm but being accorded a temple name by another realm, as was the case for M\u00f6ngke of the Mongol Empire, who was later honored as \"Xianzong\" by Emperor Shizu of the Yuan dynasty.\nEtymology.\nThe \"temple\" in \"temple name\" (\u5edf\u865f) refers to the grand temples (\u592a\u5edf) built by each dynasty for the purpose of ancestor worship. The temple name of each monarch was recorded on their respective ancestral tablet placed within the grand temple.\nHistory.\nTemple names trace their origins to the Shang dynasty of China. In earlier times, temple names were exclusively assigned to competent rulers after their death.\nThe temple name system established during the Shang period utilized only four adjectives:\nChinese monarchs of the Zhou dynasty were given posthumous names but not temple names. During the Qin dynasty, the practices both of assigning temple names and posthumous names was abandoned. The Han dynasty reintroduced both titles, although temple names were assigned sporadically and remained more exclusive than posthumous names. It was also during the Han era that other adjectives aside from the four listed above began appearing in temple names. Numerous Han emperors had their temple names removed by Emperor Xian of Han, Liu Xie, in AD 190.\nInitially, in deciding whether a monarch should be honored as \"\u7956\" (\"z\u01d4\"; \"progenitor\") or \"\u5b97\" (\"z\u014dng\"; \"ancestor\"), a principle was strictly adhered to: \"\u7956\" was to be given to accomplished rulers while \"\u5b97\" was to be assigned to virtuous rulers. However, this principle was effectively abandoned during the Sixteen Kingdoms era with the ubiquitous usage of \"\u7956\" by various non-Han regimes.\nTemple names became widespread from the Tang dynasty onwards. Apart from the final ruler of a dynasty, monarchs who died prematurely, or monarchs who were deposed, most Chinese monarchs were given temple names by their descendants.\nThe practice of honoring rulers with temple names had since been adopted by other dynastic regimes within the East Asian cultural sphere, including those based on the Korean Peninsula and in Vietnam. Japan, while having adopted both posthumous names and era names from China, did not assign temple names to its monarchs.\nStructure.\nMost temple names consist of two Chinese characters, unlike the more elaborate posthumous names. In extremely rare cases, temple names could consist of three characters.\nThe first character is an adjective, chosen to reflect the circumstances of the monarch's reign. The vocabulary may overlap with that of the posthumous names' adjectives; however, for one sovereign, the temple name's adjective character usually does not repeat as one of the many adjective characters in his posthumous name.\nThe last character is either \"\u7956\" or \"\u5b97\":\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68315", "revid": "43598336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68315", "title": "Protagonist", "text": "Main character of a creative work\nA protagonist (from grc \" \u00a0'one who plays the first part, chief actor') is the main character of a story. The protagonist makes key decisions that affect the plot, primarily influencing the story and propelling it forward, and is often the character who faces the most significant obstacles and choices. If a story contains a subplot, or is a narrative made up of several stories, then each subplot may have its own protagonist.\nThe protagonist is the character whose fate is most closely followed by the reader or audience, and who is opposed by the antagonist. The antagonist provides obstacles and complications and creates conflicts that test the protagonist, revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist's character, and having the protagonist develop as a result. A particularly noble, virtuous, or accomplished protagonist is commonly called a \"hero,\" though the terms are not synonyms.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"protagonist\" comes from grc \" \"\" ()\"\u00a0'actor who plays the chief or first part', combined of (, 'first') and (, 'actor, competitor'), which stems from (, 'contest') via (, 'I contend for a prize').\nAncient World.\nThe earliest known example of a protagonist can be found in the Epic of Gilgamesh, dated around the 3rd millennium BCE. However, the term originated only later with the dramatic performances of Ancient Greece. At first these involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus, but then, according to Aristotle's \"Poetics\", a poet named Thespis introduced the idea of one actor stepping out and engaging in a dialogue with the chorus. This was the invention of tragedy, and occurred about 536 B.C. Then the poet Aeschylus, in his plays, introduced a second actor, inventing the idea of dialogue between two characters. Sophocles then wrote plays that included a third actor.\nA description of the protagonist's origin cited that during the early period of Greek drama, the protagonist served as the author, the director, and the actor and that these roles were only separated and allocated to different individuals later. There is also a claim that the poet did not assign or create the protagonist as well as other terms for actors such as \"deuteragonist\" and \"tritagonist\" primarily because he only gave actors their appropriate part. However, these actors were assigned their specific areas at the stage with the protagonist always entering from the middle door or that the dwelling of the deuteragonist (second most important character) should be on the right hand, and the tritagonist (third most important character), the left.\nIn Ancient Greece, the protagonist is distinguished from the term \"hero\", which was used to refer to a human who became a semi-divine being in the narrative.\nTypes.\nHero/Heroine.\nIn literary terms, a hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) protagonist is typically admired for their achievements and noble qualities. Heroes are lauded for their strength, courage, virtuousness, and honor, and are considered to be the \"good guys\" of the narrative.\nExamples include DC Comics' Superman (hero) and Katniss Everdeen from \"The Hunger Games\" (heroine).\nAntihero.\nAn antihero (sometimes spelled as anti-hero) or antiheroine is a main character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism, courage, and morality.\nExamples include Holden Caulfield from \"The Catcher in the Rye\", Scarlett O'Hara from \"Gone With the Wind\", Jay Gatsby from \"The Great Gatsby\", and Walter White from Breaking Bad.\nTragic hero.\nA tragic hero is the protagonist of a tragedy.\nExamples include Oedipus from \"Oedipus Rex\" and Prince Hamlet from Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\".\nVillain protagonist.\nThe protagonist is not always conventionally good. Contrasting the hero protagonist, a villain protagonist is a protagonist who is a villain, driving the story forward regardless of the evil qualities the main character has. These traits can include being cruel, malicious, and wicked.\nExamples include Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita\", Richard III in the eponymous play by William Shakespeare, and Frank Underwood in \"House of Cards\".\nSupporting protagonist.\nWhen a supporting protagonist appears, the story is told from the perspective of a character who appears to be minor. This character may be more peripheral from the events of the story and are not as involved within the \"main action\" of the plot. The supporting protagonist may be telling the story while viewing another character as the main influence of the plot.\nOne example is Nick in \"The Great Gatsby\".\nFurther examples.\nEuripides' play \"Hippolytus\" may be considered to have two protagonists, though one at a time. Phaedra is the protagonist of the first half, who dies partway through the play. Her stepson, the titular Hippolytus, assumes the dominant role in the second half of the play.\nIn Henrik Ibsen's play \"The Master Builder\", the protagonist is the architect Halvard Solness. The young woman, Hilda Wangel, whose actions lead to the death of Solness, is the antagonist.\nIn Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet\", Romeo is the protagonist. He is actively in pursuit of his relationship with Juliet, and the audience is invested in that story. Tybalt, as an antagonist, opposes Romeo and attempts to thwart the relationship.\nIn Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\", Prince Hamlet, who seeks revenge for the murder of his father, is the protagonist. The antagonist is the character who most opposes Hamlet, Claudius (though, in many ways, Hamlet is his own antagonist).\nSometimes, a work will have a false protagonist, who may seem to be the protagonist, but then may disappear unexpectedly. The character Marion in Alfred Hitchcock's film \"Psycho\" (1960) is an example.\nA novel may contain a number of narratives, each with its own protagonist. Alexander Solzhenitsyn's \"The First Circle\", for example, depicts a variety of characters imprisoned and living in a gulag camp. Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\" depicts fifteen major characters involved in or affected by a war.\nThough many people equate protagonists with the term hero and possessing heroic qualities, it is not necessary, as even villainous characters can be protagonists. For example Michael Corleone from \"The Godfather\" (1972\u20131990) film series (1978\u20131983).\nIn some cases, the protagonist is not a human: in Richard Adams' novel \"Watership Down,\" a group of anthropomorphised rabbits, led by the protagonist Hazel, escape their warren after seeing a vision of its destruction, starting a perilous journey to find a new home.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Specifically, it transfers thermal energy by means of a heat pump and refrigeration cycle, cooling one space and warming the other. In winter, a heat pump can move heat from the cool outdoors to warm a house; in summer, it may also be designed to move heat from the house to the warmer outdoors. As it transfers rather than generates heat, it is more energy-efficient than heating by gas boiler.\nIn a typical vapour-compression heat pump, a gaseous refrigerant is compressed so its pressure and temperature rise. When the pump operates as a heater in cold weather, the warmed gas flows to a heat exchanger in the indoor space, where some of its thermal energy is transferred to that space, causing the gas to condense into a liquid. The liquified refrigerant flows to a heat exchanger in the outdoor space, where the pressure falls, the liquid evaporates, and the temperature of the gas falls. Now colder than the temperature of the outdoor space being used as a heat source, it can again take up energy from the heat source, be compressed, and repeat the cycle.\nAir source heat pumps are the most common models, while other types include ground source heat pumps, water source heat pumps, and exhaust air heat pumps. Large-scale heat pumps are also used in district heating systems.\nBecause of their high efficiency and the increasing share of fossil-free sources in electrical grids, heat pumps are playing a role in climate change mitigation. At a cost of 1\u00a0kWh of electricity, they can transfer 1 to 4.5\u00a0kWh of thermal energy into a building. The carbon footprint of heat pumps depends on how electricity is generated, but they usually reduce emissions. Heat pumps could satisfy over 80% of global space and water heating needs with a lower carbon footprint than gas-fired condensing boilers: however, in 2021 they only met 10%.\nOperation.\nHeat flows spontaneously from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. Heat does not flow spontaneously from lower temperature to higher, but it can be made to flow in this direction if work is performed. The work required to transfer a given amount of heat is usually much less than the amount of heat; this is the motivation for using heat pumps in applications such as the heating of water and the interior of buildings. \nThe heat pump works by the use of reverse valves inside a heat pump, enabling a switch from cooling to heating. With this technology, it directs the cold refrigerant into the indoor coil (usually the unit inside a closet or in the attic), with the fan then blowing warm air into the coil to absorb the heat, making the air cool. \nThe amount of work required to provide an amount of heat Q to a higher-temperature reservoir such as the interior of a building, while extracting heat from a lower-temperature reservoir such as ambient air is:\nformula_1\nwhere\nThe coefficient of performance of a heat pump is greater than one so the work required is less than the heat released, making a heat pump a more efficient form of heating than electrical resistance heating. As the temperature of the higher-temperature reservoir increases in response to the heat flowing into it, the coefficient of performance decreases, causing an increasing amount of work to be required for each unit of heat being transferred.\nThe coefficient of performance, and the work required by a heat pump can be calculated easily by considering an ideal heat pump operating on the reversed Carnot cycle:\nThis is the theoretical amount of heat pumped but in practice it will be less for various reasons, for example if the outside unit has been installed where there is not enough airflow. More data sharing with owners and academics\u2014perhaps from heat meters\u2014could improve efficiency in the long run.\nHistory.\nMilestones:\n William Cullen demonstrates artificial refrigeration.\n Jacob Perkins patents a design for a practical refrigerator using dimethyl ether.\n Lord Kelvin describes the theory underlying heat pumps.\n Peter von Rittinger develops and builds the first heat pump.\n In the period before 1875, heat pumps were for the time being pursued for vapour compression evaporation (open heat pump process) in salt works with their obvious advantages for saving wood and coal. In 1857, Peter von Rittinger was the first to try to implement the idea of vapor compression in a small pilot plant. Presumably inspired by Rittinger's experiments in Ebensee, Antoine-Paul Piccard from the University of Lausanne and the engineer J. H. Weibel from the Weibel\u2013Briquet company in Geneva built the world's first really functioning vapor compression system with a two-stage piston compressor. In 1877 this first heat pump in Switzerland was installed in the Bex salt works.\n Aurel Stodola constructs a closed-loop heat pump (water source from Lake Geneva) which provides heating for the Geneva city hall to this day.\n During the First World War, fuel prices were very high in Switzerland but it had plenty of hydropower.18 In the period before and especially during the Second World War, when neutral Switzerland was completely surrounded by fascist-ruled countries, the coal shortage became alarming again. Thanks to their leading position in energy technology, the Swiss companies Sulzer, Escher Wyss and Brown Boveri built and put in operation around 35 heat pumps between 1937 and 1945. The main heat sources were lake water, river water, groundwater, and waste heat. Particularly noteworthy are the six historic heat pumps from the city of Zurich with heat outputs from 100\u00a0kW to 6\u00a0MW. An international milestone is the heat pump built by Escher Wyss in 1937/38 to replace the wood stoves in the City Hall of Zurich. To avoid noise and vibrations, a recently developed rotary piston compressor was used. This historic heat pump heated the town hall for 63 years until 2001. Only then was it replaced by a new, more efficient heat pump.\n John Sumner, City Electrical Engineer for Norwich, installs an experimental water-source heat pump fed central heating system, using a nearby river to heat new Council administrative buildings. It had a seasonal efficiency ratio of 3.42, average thermal delivery of 147\u00a0kW, and peak output of 234\u00a0kW.\n Robert C. Webber is credited as developing and building the first ground-source heat pump.\n First large scale installation\u2014the Royal Festival Hall in London is opened with a town gas-powered reversible water-source heat pump, fed by the Thames, for both winter heating and summer cooling needs.\n The Kigali Amendment to phase out harmful refrigerants takes effect.\nTypes.\nHeat recovery ventilation.\nExhaust air heat pumps extract heat from the exhaust air of a building and require mechanical ventilation. Two classes exist:\nWater-source.\nA water-source heat pump works in a similar manner to a ground-source heat pump, except that it takes heat from a body of water rather than the ground. The body of water does, however, need to be large enough to be able to withstand the cooling effect of the unit without freezing or creating an adverse effect for wildlife. The largest water-source heat pump was installed in the Danish city of Esbjerg in 2023.\nOthers.\nA thermoacoustic heat pump operates as a thermoacoustic heat engine without refrigerant but instead uses a standing wave in a sealed chamber driven by a loudspeaker to achieve a temperature difference across the chamber.\nElectrocaloric heat pumps are solid state.\nApplications.\nThe International Energy Agency estimated that, as of 2021, heat pumps installed in buildings have a combined capacity of more than 1000 GW. They are used for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and may also provide domestic hot water and tumble clothes drying. The purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates.\nSpace heating and sometimes also cooling.\nIn HVAC applications, a heat pump is typically a vapor-compression refrigeration device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of \"heat flow\" (thermal energy movement) may be reversed. The reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building.\nBecause the two heat exchangers, the condenser and evaporator, must swap functions, they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes. Therefore, the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating (SEER in the US) or European seasonal energy efficiency ratio of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than those of two separately optimized machines. For equipment to receive the US Energy Star rating, it must have a rating of at least 14 SEER. Pumps with ratings of 18 SEER or above are considered highly efficient. The highest efficiency heat pumps manufactured are up to 24 SEER.\nHeating seasonal performance factor (in the US) or Seasonal Performance Factor (in Europe) are ratings of heating performance. The SPF is Total heat output per annum / Total electricity consumed per annum in other words the average heating COP over the year.\nWindow mounted heat pump.\nWindow mounted heat pumps run on standard 120v AC outlets and provide heating, cooling, and humidity control. They are more efficient with lower noise levels, condensation management, and a smaller footprint than window mounted air conditioners that just do cooling.\nWater heating.\nIn water heating applications, heat pumps may be used to heat or preheat water for swimming pools, homes or industry. Usually heat is extracted from outdoor air and transferred to an indoor water tank.\nDistrict heating.\nLarge (megawatt-scale) heat pumps are used for district heating. However as of 2022[ [update]] about 90% of district heat is from fossil fuels. In Europe, heat pumps account for a mere 1% of heat supply in district heating networks but several countries have targets to decarbonise their networks between 2030 and 2040. Possible sources of heat for such applications are sewage water, ambient water (e.g. sea, lake and river water), industrial waste heat, geothermal energy, flue gas, waste heat from district cooling and heat from solar seasonal thermal energy storage. Large-scale heat pumps for district heating combined with thermal energy storage offer high flexibility for the integration of variable renewable energy. Therefore, they are regarded as a key technology for limiting climate change by phasing out fossil fuels. They are also a crucial element of systems which can both heat and cool districts.\nIndustrial heating.\nThere is great potential to reduce the energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions in industry by application of industrial heat pumps, for example for process heat. Short payback periods of less than 2 years are possible, while achieving a high reduction of CO2 emissions (in some cases more than 50%). Industrial heat pumps can heat up to 200\u00a0\u00b0C, and can meet the heating demands of many light industries. In Europe alone, 15\u00a0GW of heat pumps could be installed in 3,000 facilities in the paper, food and chemicals industries.\nPerformance.\nThe performance of a heat pump is determined by the ability of the pump to extract heat from a low temperature environment (the \"source\") and deliver it to a higher temperature environment (the \"sink\"). Performance varies, depending on installation details, temperature differences, site elevation, location on site, pipe runs, flow rates, and maintenance. \nHeat pumps operate at their highest efficiency when the temperature difference between the heat source and the heat sink is minimal. As a result, they perform best in moderate climates and lose efficiency as outdoor temperatures drop. Consumer performance ratings are designed to reflect these variations under different conditions.\nCommon performance metrics are the SEER (in cooling mode) and seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) (commonly used just for heating), although SCOP can be used for both modes of operation. Larger values of either metric indicate better performance. When comparing the performance of heat pumps, the term \"performance\" is preferred to \"efficiency\", with coefficient of performance (COP) being used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input. An electrical resistance heater has a COP of 1.0, which is considerably lower than a well-designed heat pump which will typically have a COP of 3 to 5 with an external temperature of 10\u00a0\u00b0C and an internal temperature of 20\u00a0\u00b0C. Because the ground is a constant temperature source, a ground-source heat pump is not subjected to large temperature fluctuations, and therefore is the most energy-efficient type of heat pump.\nThe \"seasonal coefficient of performance\" (SCOP) is a measure of the aggregate energy efficiency measure over a period of one year which is dependent on regional climate. One framework for this calculation is given by the Commission Regulation (EU) No. 813/2013.\nA heat pump's operating performance in cooling mode is characterized in the US by either its energy efficiency ratio (EER) or seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER), both of which have units of BTU/(h\u00b7W) (note that 1 BTU/(h\u00b7W)\u00a0= 0.293 W/W) and larger values indicate better performance.\nCarbon footprint.\nThe carbon footprint of heat pumps depends on their individual efficiency and how electricity is produced. An increasing share of low-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar will lower the impact on the climate.\nIn most settings, heat pumps will reduce CO2 emissions compared to heating systems powered by fossil fuels. In regions accounting for 70% of world energy consumption, the emissions savings of heat pumps compared with a high-efficiency gas boiler are on average above 45% and reach 80% in countries with cleaner electricity mixtures. These values can be improved by 10 percentage points, respectively, with alternative refrigerants. In the United States, 70% of houses could reduce emissions by installing a heat pump. The rising share of renewable electricity generation in many countries is set to increase the emissions savings from heat pumps over time.\nHeating systems powered by green hydrogen are also low-carbon and may become competitors, but are much less efficient due to the energy loss associated with hydrogen conversion, transport and use. In addition, not enough green hydrogen is expected to be available before the 2030s or 2040s.\nOperation.\nVapor-compression uses a circulating refrigerant as the medium which absorbs heat from one space, compresses it thereby increasing its temperature before releasing it in another space. The system normally has eight main components: a compressor, a reservoir, a reversing valve which selects between heating and cooling mode, two thermal expansion valves (one used when in heating mode and the other when used in cooling mode) and two heat exchangers, one associated with the external heat source/sink and the other with the interior. In heating mode the external heat exchanger is the evaporator and the internal one being the condenser; in cooling mode the roles are reversed.\nCirculating refrigerant enters the compressor in the thermodynamic state known as a saturated vapor and is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, compressed vapor is then in the thermodynamic state known as a superheated vapor and it is at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed with either cooling water or cooling air flowing across the coil or tubes. In heating mode this heat is used to heat the building using the internal heat exchanger, and in cooling mode this heat is rejected via the external heat exchanger.\nThe condensed, liquid refrigerant, in the thermodynamic state known as a saturated liquid, is next routed through an expansion valve where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in the adiabatic flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant. The auto-refrigeration effect of the adiabatic flash evaporation lowers the temperature of the liquid and-vapor refrigerant mixture to where it is colder than the temperature of the enclosed space to be refrigerated.\nThe cold mixture is then routed through the coil or tubes in the evaporator. A fan circulates the warm air in the enclosed space across the coil or tubes carrying the cold refrigerant liquid and vapor mixture. That warm air evaporates the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture. At the same time, the circulating air is cooled and thus lowers the temperature of the enclosed space to the desired temperature. The evaporator is where the circulating refrigerant absorbs and removes heat which is subsequently rejected in the condenser and transferred elsewhere by the water or air used in the condenser.\nTo complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor from the evaporator is again a saturated vapor and is routed back into the compressor.\nOver time, the evaporator may collect ice or water from ambient humidity. The ice is melted through defrosting cycle. An internal heat exchanger is either used to heat/cool the interior air directly or to heat water that is then circulated through radiators or underfloor heating circuit to either heat or cool the buildings.\nImprovement of coefficient of performance by subcooling.\nHeat input can be improved if the refrigerant enters the evaporator with a lower vapor content. This can be achieved by cooling the liquid refrigerant after condensation. The gaseous refrigerant condenses on the heat exchange surface of the condenser. To achieve a heat flow from the gaseous flow center to the wall of the condenser, the temperature of the liquid refrigerant must be lower than the condensation temperature.\nAdditional subcooling can be achieved by heat exchange between relatively warm liquid refrigerant leaving the condenser and the cooler refrigerant vapor emerging from the evaporator. The enthalpy difference required for the subcooling leads to the superheating of the vapor drawn into the compressor. When the increase in cooling achieved by subcooling is greater that the compressor drive input required to overcome the additional pressure losses, such a heat exchange improves the coefficient of performance.\nOne disadvantage of the subcooling of liquids is that the difference between the condensing temperature and the heat-sink temperature must be larger. This leads to a moderately high pressure difference between condensing and evaporating pressure, whereby the compressor energy increases.\nRefrigerant choice.\nPure refrigerants can be divided into organic substances (hydrocarbons (HCs), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), and HCFOs), and inorganic substances (ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O)). Their boiling points are usually below \u221225\u00a0\u00b0C.\nIn the past 200 years, the standards and requirements for new refrigerants have changed. Nowadays low global warming potential (GWP) is required, in addition to all the previous requirements for safety, practicality, material compatibility, appropriate atmospheric life, and compatibility with high-efficiency products. By 2022, devices using refrigerants with a very low GWP still have a small market share but are expected to play an increasing role due to enforced regulations, as most countries have now ratified the Kigali Amendment to ban HFCs. Isobutane (R600A) and propane (R290) are far less harmful to the environment than conventional hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and are already being used in air-source heat pumps. Propane may be the most suitable for high temperature heat pumps. Ammonia (R717) and carbon dioxide (R-744) also have a low GWP. As of 2023[ [update]] smaller CO2 heat pumps are not widely available and research and development of them continues. A 2024 report said that refrigerants with GWP are vulnerable to further international restrictions.\nUntil the 1990s, heat pumps, along with fridges and other related products used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as refrigerants, which caused major damage to the ozone layer when released into the atmosphere. Use of these chemicals was banned or severely restricted by the Montreal Protocol of August 1987.\nReplacements, including R-134a and R-410A, are hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) with similar thermodynamic properties with insignificant ozone depletion potential (ODP) but had problematic GWP. HFCs are powerful greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change. Dimethyl ether (DME) also gained in popularity as a refrigerant in combination with R404a. More recent refrigerants include difluoromethane (R32) with a lower GWP, but still over 600.\nDevices with R-290 refrigerant (propane) are expected to play a key role in the future. The 100-year GWP of propane, at 0.02, is extremely low and is approximately 7000 times less than R-32. However, the flammability of propane requires additional safety measures: the maximum safe charges have been set significantly lower than for lower flammability refrigerants (only allowing approximately 13.5 times less refrigerant in the system than R-32). This means that R-290 is not suitable for all situations or locations. Nonetheless, by 2022, an increasing number of devices with R-290 were offered for domestic use, especially in Europe.\nAt the same time, HFC refrigerants still dominate the market. Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant. Replacements such as R-32 and R-410A are being promoted as environmentally friendly but still have a high GWP. A heat pump typically uses 3\u00a0kg of refrigerant. With R-32 this amount still has a 20-year impact equivalent to 7 tons of CO2, which corresponds to two years of natural gas heating in an average household. Refrigerants with a high ODP have already been phased out.\nGovernment incentives.\nFinancial incentives aim to protect consumers from high fossil gas costs and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and are currently available in more than 30 countries around the world, covering more than 70% of global heating demand in 2021.\nAustralia.\nFood processors, brewers, petfood producers and other industrial energy users are exploring whether it is feasible to use renewable energy to produce industrial-grade heat. Process heating accounts for the largest share of onsite energy use in Australian manufacturing, with lower-temperature operations like food production particularly well-suited to transition to renewables.\nTo help producers understand how they could benefit from making the switch, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) provided funding to the Australian Alliance for Energy Productivity (A2EP) to undertake pre-feasibility studies at a range of sites around Australia, with the most promising locations advancing to full feasibility studies.\nIn an effort to incentivize energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact, the Australian states of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland have implemented rebate programs targeting the upgrade of existing hot water systems. These programs specifically encourage the transition from traditional gas or electric systems to heat pump based systems.\nCanada.\nIn 2022, the Canada Greener Homes Grant provides up to $5000 for upgrades (including certain heat pumps), and $600 for energy efficiency evaluations.\nChina.\nPurchase subsidies in rural areas in the 2010s reduced burning coal for heating, which had been causing ill health.\nIn the 2024 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) titled \"The Future of Heat Pumps in China,\" it is highlighted that China, as the world's largest market for heat pumps in buildings, plays a critical role in the global industry. The country accounts for over one-quarter of global sales, with a 12% increase in 2023 alone, despite a global sales dip of 3% the same year.\nHeat pumps are now used in approximately 8% of all heating equipment sales for buildings in China as of 2022, and they are increasingly becoming the norm in central and southern regions for both heating and cooling. Despite their higher upfront costs and relatively low awareness, heat pumps are favored for their energy efficiency, consuming three to five times less energy than electric heaters or fossil fuel-based solutions. Currently, decentralized heat pumps installed in Chinese buildings represent a quarter of the global installed capacity, with a total capacity exceeding 250 GW, which covers around 4% of the heating needs in buildings.\nUnder the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which aligns with China's carbon neutrality goals, the capacity is expected to reach 1,400 GW by 2050, meeting 25% of heating needs. This scenario would require an installation of about 100 GW of heat pumps annually until 2050. Furthermore, the heat pump sector in China employs over 300,000 people, with employment numbers expected to double by 2050, underscoring the importance of vocational training for industry growth. This robust development in the heat pump market is set to play a significant role in reducing direct emissions in buildings by 30% and cutting PM2.5 emissions from residential heating by nearly 80% by 2030.\nEuropean Union.\nTo speed up the deployment rate of heat pumps, the European Commission launched the Heat Pump Accelerator Platform in November 2024. It will encourage industry experts, policymakers, and stakeholders to collaborate, share best practices and ideas, and jointly discuss measures that promote sustainable heating solutions.\nUnited Kingdom.\nUntil 2027 fixed heat pumps have no Value Added Tax (VAT). As of 2022[ [update]] the installation cost of a heat pump is more than a gas boiler, but with the \"Boiler Upgrade Scheme\" government grant and assuming electricity/gas costs remain similar their lifetime costs would be similar on average. However lifetime cost relative to a gas boiler varies considerably depending on several factors, such as the quality of the heat pump installation and the tariff used. In 2024 England was criticised for still allowing new homes to be built with gas boilers, unlike some other counties where this is banned.\nUnited States.\nThe High-efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program was created in 2022 to award grants to State energy offices and Indian Tribes in order to establish state-wide high-efficiency electric-home rebates. Effective immediately, American households are eligible for a tax credit to cover the costs of buying and installing a heat pump, up to $2,000. Starting in 2023, low- and moderate-level income households will be eligible for a heat-pump rebate of up to $8,000.\nIn 2022, more heat pumps were sold in the United States than natural gas furnaces.\nIn November 2023 Biden's administration allocated 169 million dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act to speed up production of heat pumps. It used the Defense Production Act to do so, in a stated bid to advance national security.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68318", "revid": "1316979520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68318", "title": "Battle of the Boyne", "text": "1690 Irish Williamite-Jacobite War battle\nThe Battle of the Boyne ( ) took place in 1690 between the forces of the deposed King James II, and those of King William III who, with his wife Queen Mary II (his cousin and James's daughter), had acceded to the Crowns of England and Scotland in 1689. The battle was fought across the River Boyne close to the town of Drogheda in the Kingdom of Ireland, modern-day Ireland, and resulted in a victory for William. This turned the tide in James's failed attempt to regain the British crown and ultimately aided in ensuring the continued Protestant ascendancy in Ireland.\nThe battle took place on 1 July 1690 O.S. William's forces defeated James's army, which consisted mostly of raw recruits. Although the Williamite War in Ireland continued until the signing of the Treaty of Limerick in October 1691, James fled to France after the Boyne, never to return.\nBackground.\nThe battle was a major encounter in James's attempt to regain the thrones of England and Scotland, resulting from the Invitation to William and William's wife, Mary, from the 'immortal seven' English peers to take the throne to defend Protestantism. But the conflict had broader and deeper European geopolitical roots, of the League of Augsburg and the Grand Alliance against the expansionist ambitions of Catholic Louis XIV of France, or of the House of Bourbon against the House of Habsburg. If the battle is seen as part of the War of the Grand Alliance, Pope Alexander VIII was an ally of William and a friend to James; the Papal States were part of the Grand Alliance with a shared hostility to the Catholic Louis XIV of France, who at the time was attempting to establish dominance in Europe and to whom James was an ally.\nThe previous year William had sent the Duke of Schomberg to take charge of the Irish campaign. He was a 74-year-old professional soldier who had accompanied William during the Glorious Revolution. He brought an army of 20,000 men, which arrived at Bangor. Under his command, affairs had remained static and very little had been accomplished, partly because the English troops suffered severely from fever and the army's move south was blocked by Jacobite forces; both sides camped for the winter.\nIn an Irish context, the war was a sectarian and ethnic conflict, in many ways a re-run of the Irish Confederate Wars of 50 years earlier. For the Jacobites, the war was fought for Irish sovereignty, religious tolerance for Catholicism, and land ownership. The Catholic upper classes had lost or had been forced to exchange almost all their lands after Cromwell's conquest, as well as the right to hold public office, practice their religion, and sit in the Irish Parliament. To these ends, under Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnel, they had raised an army to restore James II after the Glorious Revolution. Sir James Fitz Edmond Cotter being the commander-in-chief of all King James's forces in the counties of Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary. By 1690, they controlled all of Ireland except for Derry and Enniskillen.\nThe majority of Irish people were Jacobites and supported James II due to his 1687 Declaration of Indulgence or, as it is also known, the Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination.\nConversely, for the Williamites in Ireland, the war was about maintaining Protestant rule in Ireland. They feared for their lives and their property if James and his Catholic supporters were to rule Ireland, nor did they trust the promise of tolerance, seeing the Declaration of Indulgence as a ploy to re-establish Catholicism as the sole state religion. James had already antagonised English Protestants with his actions. In particular, they dreaded a repeat of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, which had been marked by widespread killing. For these reasons, Protestants fought \"en masse\" for William of Orange. Many Williamite troops at the Boyne, including their very effective irregular cavalry, were Ulster Protestants, who called themselves \"Enniskilliners\" and were referred to by contemporaries as \"Scots-Irish\". These \"Enniskilliners\" were mostly the descendants of Anglo-Scottish border reivers; large numbers of these reivers had settled around Enniskillen in County Fermanagh.\nCommanders.\nThe opposing armies in the battle were led by the Roman Catholic king James II of England and Ireland (VII of Scotland) and, opposing him, his nephew and son-in-law, the Protestant king William III (\"William of Orange\") who had deposed James the previous year. James's supporters controlled much of Ireland and the Irish Parliament. James also enjoyed the support of his cousin, Louis XIV, who did not want to see a hostile monarch on the throne of England. Louis sent 6,000 French troops to Ireland to support the Irish Jacobites. William was already Stadtholder of the Netherlands and was able to call on Dutch and allied troops from Europe as well as England and Scotland.\nJames was a seasoned officer who had proved his bravery when fighting in Europe, notably at the Battle of the Dunes. However, recent historians have suggested that he was prone to panicking under pressure and making rash decisions, which it has been suggested may have been due to poor health associated with the Stuart line.\nWilliam, although a seasoned commander, had yet to win a major battle. William's success against the French had been reliant upon tactical manoeuvres and good diplomacy rather than force. His diplomacy had assembled the League of Augsburg, a multi-national coalition formed to resist French aggression in Europe. From William's point of view, his taking power in England and the ensuing campaign in Ireland was just another front in the war against France in general, and Louis XIV in particular.\nJames II's subordinate commanders were Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, who was Lord Deputy of Ireland and James's most powerful supporter in Ireland; Sir James Fitz Edmond Cotter, Brigadier General in command of all the Jacobite forces in counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Tipperary, and an intimate of James II; and the French general Lauzun. William's commander-in-chief was the Duke of Schomberg. Born in Heidelberg, Germany, Schomberg had fought for a few different countries and had formerly been a Marshal of France, but, being a Huguenot, was compelled to leave France in 1685 because of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\nArmies.\nThe Williamite army at the Boyne was about 36,000 strong, composed of troops from many countries; Only around half of them were British. Around 20,000 troops had been in Ireland since 1689, commanded by Schomberg. William himself had landed in Carrickfergus on 14 June O.S. He met Schomberg at nearby Whitehouse, and then proceeded south through Belfast. Loughbrickland was the rallying point of the scattered divisions of the army. He arrived there with another 16,000 in June 1690. On 30 June O.S. William had reached the top of a hill near the southern border of County Louth.\nWilliam's troops were generally far better trained and equipped than James's. The best Williamite infantry were from Denmark (7000) and the Netherlands (6000), professional soldiers equipped with the latest flintlock muskets. The Danish infantry was commanded by General Ernst von Tettau. There was also a large (3000) contingent of French Huguenot troops fighting with the Williamites. William did not yet have a high opinion of his English and Scottish troops, with the exception of the Ulster Protestant \"skirmishers\" who had held Derry in the previous year; the English and Scottish troops were felt at this stage to be politically unreliable, since James had been their legitimate monarch up to a year before. Moreover, they had only been raised recently and had seen little action. However, this battle would give William cause to evaluate them more favourably, due to the impressive behaviour of the English troops, such as the Duke of Beaufort's Regiment of Foot.\nJames\u2019s flag was erected at the town of Donore, on the opposite side of the river Boyne. The Jacobites were 23,500 strong. James had several regiments of French troops, but most of his manpower was provided by Irish Catholics, with some English and Scottish Jacobites also present. The Jacobites' Irish cavalry, who were recruited from among the dispossessed Irish gentry, proved themselves to be high-calibre troops during the course of the battle. However, the Irish infantry, predominantly peasants who had been pressed into service, were not trained soldiers. They had been hastily trained, poorly equipped, and only a minority of them had functional muskets. In fact, some of them carried only farm implements such as scythes at the Boyne. Furthermore, the Jacobite infantry who actually had firearms were all equipped with the obsolete matchlock musket. The French and Irish troops wore a white rallying mark, as a compliment to the Bourbons and to distinguish them from the Williamites.\nBattle.\nWilliam sailed from Hoylake in Cheshire, landing at Carrickfergus, County Antrim on 14 June O.S. and marched south. Referring to Dublin, he was heard to remark that \"the place was worth fighting for\". James chose to place his line of defence on the River Boyne, around from Dublin. The Williamites reached the Boyne on 29 June. The day before the battle, William himself had a narrow escape when he was wounded in the shoulder by Jacobite artillery while surveying the fords over which his troops would cross the Boyne.\nThe battle itself was fought on 1 July O.S. (11 July N.S.), for control of a ford on the Boyne near Drogheda, about north-west of the hamlet of Oldbridge. As a diversionary tactic, William sent about a quarter of his men under the cover of morning mist to cross the river at Roughgrange, about west of Donore and about south-west of Oldbridge. The Duke of Schomberg's son, Meinhardt, led this crossing, which a small force of Irish dragoons in picquet under Neil O'Neill unsuccessfully opposed. James thought that he might be outflanked and sent a large part of his army, including his best French troops along with most of his artillery, to counter this move. What neither side had realised was that there was a deep, swampy ravine at Roughgrange. Because of this ravine, the opposing forces there could not engage each other, but literally sat out the battle as artillery engaged. The Williamite forces went on a long detour march which, later in the day, almost saw them cut off the Jacobite retreat at the village of Naul.\nAt the main ford near Oldbridge, William's infantry, led by the elite Dutch Blue Guards under Solms, forced their way across the river, using their superior firepower to slowly drive back the Jacobite foot soldiers, but were pinned down when the Jacobite cavalry, commanded by James II's son James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick, counter-attacked. Having secured the village of Oldbridge, the Williamite infantry tried to hold off successive Jacobite Irish cavalry attacks with disciplined volley fire, but many were scattered and driven into the river, with the exception of the Blue Guards. When William saw his Dutch Guards isolated on the enemy side of the river and without any protection from natural obstacles he was extremely worried according to an eyewitness: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But when he saw them stand their ground and fire by platoons, so that the horse were forced to run away in great disorder, he breathed out\u2026, and said he had seen his Guards do that which he had never seen foot do in his life. The Blue Guards had formed up in three separate squares and were, by using platoon fire, able to drive away the Jacobite cavalry. The Williamites were not able to resume their advance until their own horsemen managed to cross the river and, after being badly mauled, particularly the Huguenots, managed to hold off the Jacobite cavalry. William's second-in-command, the Duke of Schomberg, and George Walker were killed in this phase of the battle. The Irish cavalry finally gave up when Danish infantry commanded by Wurttemberg and cavalry led by Godert de Ginkel (about 11 or 12 squadrons), who had both crossed the river further downstream, advanced towards them.\nThe Jacobites retired in good order. William had a chance to trap them as they retreated across the River Nanny at Duleek, but his troops were held up by a successful rear-guard action. The Dutch secretary of King William, Constantijn Huygens Jr., has given a good description (in Dutch) of the battle and its aftermath, including subsequent cruelties committed by the victorious soldiers.\nThe casualty figures of the battle were quite low for a battle of such a scale\u2014of the 50,000 or so participants, about 2,000 died. Three quarters of the dead were Jacobites. William's army had far more wounded. At the time, most casualties of battles tended to be inflicted in the pursuit of an already-beaten enemy; this did not happen at the Boyne, as the counter-attacks of the skilled Jacobite cavalry screened the retreat of the rest of their army, and in addition William was always disinclined to endanger the person of James, since he was the father of his wife, Mary. The Jacobites were badly demoralised by the order to retreat, which lost them the battle. Many of the Irish infantrymen deserted, abandoning clothing in their escape. The Williamites triumphantly marched into Dublin two days after the battle. The Jacobite army abandoned the city and marched to Limerick, behind the River Shannon, where they were unsuccessfully besieged.\nSoon after the battle, William issued the Declaration of Finglas, offering full pardons to ordinary Jacobite soldiers, but not to their leaders.\nAftermath.\nThe battle was overshadowed in Britain by the defeat of an Anglo-Dutch fleet by the French on the previous day at the Battle of Beachy Head, a far more serious event in the short term; but on the continent the Battle of the Boyne was treated as an important victory. Its importance lay in the fact that it was the first proper victory for the League of Augsburg, a precarious alliance between the Vatican and Protestant countries. The victory motivated more nations to join the alliance and in effect ended the fear of a French conquest of Europe.\nThe Boyne also had strategic significance for both England and Ireland. It marked the beginning of the end of James's hope of regaining his throne by military means and probably assured the triumph of the Glorious Revolution. In Scotland, news of this defeat temporarily silenced the Highlanders supporting the Jacobite rising, which had been led by Bonnie Dundee who was killed the previous July at the Battle of Killiecrankie. The battle was a general victory for William. Owing to the political situation mentioned above, Catholic institutions amongst William's continental allies hailed his victory with bell-ringing.\nThe battle caused the Jacobites to abandon the city of Dublin, which was occupied by William's forces, without a fight. Despairing of his hopes for victory, James II fled to Duncannon and returned to exile in France, even though his army left the field relatively unscathed. James's loss of nerve and speedy exit from the battlefield enraged his Irish supporters and he was derisively nicknamed \"S\u00e9amus a' chaca\" (\"James the shit\") in Irish. The war in Ireland had not ended, however. The Franco-Irish Jacobite army regrouped in Limerick and fought off a Williamite assault on the city in late August. It was not until the following year and battle of Aughrim that their forces were broken and after another siege of Limerick, they surrendered to William's general Godard de Ginkel. The war in Ireland formally ended with the Treaty of Limerick in 1691. This allowed over 14,000 Irish soldiers under Patrick Sarsfield, to leave for France and allowed most Irish Catholic land owners to keep their land provided they swore allegiance to William of Orange. However, the Protestant dominated Irish Parliament rejected these terms, not ratifying the treaty until 1697\u2014and then not in full\u2014and imposed a tough Penal Code resented by Irish Catholics for many years.\nCommemoration.\nOriginally, the Twelfth of July commemoration was that of the Battle of Aughrim, symbolising British Protestants' victory in the Williamite war in Ireland. At Aughrim, which took place a year after the Boyne, the Jacobite army was destroyed, deciding the war in the Williamites' favour. The Boyne, which, in the old Julian calendar, took place on 1 July O.S., was treated as less important, third after Aughrim and the anniversary of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 on 23 October O.S.\nIn 1752, the Gregorian calendar was also adopted in Ireland. However, even after this date, \"The Twelfth\" continued to be commemorated at Aughrim, on 12 July NS, following the usual historical convention of commemorating events of that period within Great Britain and Ireland by mapping the Julian date directly onto the modern Gregorian calendar date (as happens for example with Guy Fawkes Night on 5 November). But, after the Orange Order was founded in 1795 amid sectarian violence in County Armagh, the two events were combined in the late 18th century.\n\"The Twelfth\" in Northern Ireland today.\nThe Battle of the Boyne remains a controversial topic today in Northern Ireland, where some Protestants remember it as the great victory over Catholics that resulted in the sovereignty of Parliament and the Protestant monarchy.\nIn recent decades, \"The Twelfth\" has often been marked by confrontations, as members of the Orange Order attempt to celebrate the date by marching past or through what they see as their traditional route. Some of these areas, however, now have a nationalist majority who object to marches passing through what they see as their areas.\nMany nationalists still see these marches as provocative, whilst Unionist marchers insist that it is part of their historical right to celebrate. Since the start of the Troubles, the celebrations of the battle have been seen as playing a critical role in the awareness of those involved in the unionist/nationalist tensions in Northern Ireland. Better policing and improved dialogue between the sides in the 21st century have made for more peaceful parades.\n\"The Eleventh Night\" in Northern Ireland.\nThere are also traditions set to happen on 11 July, the eve of the Twelfth Night, known as the Eleventh Night. On this night, Protestants ignite bonfires all over Northern Ireland to celebrate the commencement of the Twelfth Night.\nThe reason they use bonfires to symbolize the event dates back to the pagan celebrations of Midsummer, Bealtaine and Samhain, where fire is used as a symbol of celebration.\nMany object to the use of bonfires in Loyalist celebrations today, especially because many bonfires now include \"the burning of flags, effigies and election posters.\"\nBattlefield preservation.\nThe site of the Battle of the Boyne sprawls over a wide area west of the town of Drogheda in Ireland. In the County Development Plan for 2000, Meath County Council rezoned the land at the eastern edge of Oldbridge, at the site of the main Williamite crossing, to residential status. A subsequent planning application for a development of over 700 houses was granted by Meath County Council and this was appealed against by local historians to An Bord Plean\u00e1la (The Planning Board). In March 2008, after an extremely long appeal process, An Bord Plean\u00e1la approved permission for this development to proceed. Further plans have been submitted for hundreds more homes and a link to the River Boyne Boardwalk.\nThe Battle of the Boyne Visitor Centre at Oldbridge house is run by the Office of Public Works, an agency of the Irish government, and is about to the west of the main river crossing point. The battle's other main combat areas, at Duleek, Donore and Plattin, along the Jacobite line of retreat, are marked with tourist information signs.\nOn 4 April 2007, in a sign of improving relations between unionist and nationalist groups, the newly elected First Minister of Northern Ireland, the Reverend Ian Paisley, was invited to visit the battle site by the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern later in the year. Following the invitation, Paisley commented that \"such a visit would help to demonstrate how far we have come when we can celebrate and learn from the past so the next generation more clearly understands\". On 10 May, the visit took place, and Paisley presented the Taoiseach with a Jacobite musket in return for Ahern's gift at the St Andrews talks of a walnut bowl made from a tree from the site. A new tree was also planted in the grounds of Oldbridge House by the two politicians to mark the occasion.\nNotes.\nExplanatory footnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Along with Dolores Huerta and lesser known Gilbert Padilla, he co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), which later merged with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) to become the United Farm Workers (UFW) labor union. Ideologically, his worldview combined left-wing politics with Catholic social teachings.\nBorn in Yuma, Arizona, to a Mexican-American family, Chavez began his working life as a manual laborer before spending two years in the U.S. Navy. Relocating to California, where he married, he got involved in the Community Service Organization (CSO), through which he helped laborers register to vote. In 1959, he became the CSO's national director, a position based in Los Angeles. In 1962, he left the CSO to co-found the NFWA, based in Delano, California, through which he launched an insurance scheme, a credit union, and the \"El Malcriado\" newspaper for farmworkers. Later that decade, he began organizing strikes among farmworkers, most notably the successful Delano grape strike of 1965\u20131970. Amid the grape strike, his NFWA merged with Larry Itliong's AWOC to form the UFW in 1967. Influenced by the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, Chavez emphasized direct nonviolent tactics, including pickets and boycotts, to pressure farm owners into granting strikers' demands. He imbued his campaigns with Roman Catholic symbolism, including public processions, Masses, and fasts. He received much support from labor and leftist groups but was monitored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nIn the early 1970s, Chavez sought to expand the UFW's influence outside California by opening branches in other U.S. states. Viewing illegal immigrants as a major source of strike-breakers, he also pushed a campaign against illegal immigration into the U.S., which generated violence along the U.S.-Mexico border and caused schisms with many of the UFW's allies. Interested in co-operatives as a form of organization, he established a remote commune at Keene. His increased isolation and emphasis on unrelenting campaigning alienated many California farmworkers who had previously supported him, and by 1973 the UFW had lost most of the contracts and membership it won during the late 1960s. His alliance with California Governor Jerry Brown helped ensure the passing of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, although the UFW's campaign to get its measures enshrined in California's constitution failed. Influenced by the Synanon religious organization, Chavez re-emphasized communal living and purged perceived opponents. Membership of the UFW dwindled in the 1980s, with Chavez refocusing on anti-pesticide campaigns and moving into real-estate development, generating controversy for his use of non-unionized laborers.\nChavez became a controversial figure. UFW critics raised concerns about his autocratic control of the union, the purges of those he deemed disloyal, and the personality cult built around him, while farm owners considered him a communist subversive. He became an icon for organized labor and leftist groups in the U.S. Posthumously, he became a \"folk saint\" among Mexican Americans. His birthday is a federal commemorative holiday in several U.S. states, while many places are named after him, and in 1994 he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nEarly life.\nChildhood: 1927\u20131945.\nCesario Estrada Chavez was born in Yuma, Arizona on March 31, 1927. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Cesario Chavez, a Mexican who had crossed into Texas in 1898. Cesario had established a successful wood haulage business near Yuma, and in 1906 bought a farm in the Sonora Desert's North Gila Valley. Cesario had brought his wife Dorotea and eight children with him from Mexico; the youngest, Librado, was Cesar's father. Librado married Juana Estrada Chavez in the early 1920s. Born in Ascensi\u00f3n, Chihuahua, she had crossed into the U.S. with her mother as a baby. They lived in Picacho, California before moving to Yuma, where Juana worked as a farm laborer and then an assistant to the chancellor of the University of Arizona. Librado and Juana's first child, Rita, was born in August 1925, with their first son, Cesar, following nearly two years later. Chavez also had three younger siblings. In November 1925, Librado and Juana bought a series of buildings near the family home which included a pool hall, store, and living quarters. They soon fell into debt and were forced to sell these assets. By April 1929, they moved into the \"galera\" storeroom of Librado's parental home, then owned by the widowed Dorotea.\nChavez was raised in what his biographer Miriam Pawel called \"a typical extended Mexican family\"; she noted that they were \"not well-off, but they were comfortable, well-clothed, and never hungry\". The family spoke Spanish, and he was raised as a Roman Catholic, with his paternal grandmother Dorotea largely overseeing his religious instruction. His mother Juana engaged in forms of folk Catholicism, being a devotee of Santa Eduviges. As a child, Chavez was nicknamed \"Manzi\" in reference to his fondness for manzanilla tea. To entertain himself, he played handball and listened to boxing matches on the radio. One of five children, he had two sisters, Rita and Vicki, and two brothers, Richard and Librado.\nCesario began attending Laguna Dam School in 1933; there, the speaking of Spanish was forbidden and Cesario was expected to change his name to Cesar. After Dorotea died in July 1937, the Yuma County local government auctioned off her farmstead to cover back taxes, and despite Librado's delaying tactics, the house and land were sold in 1939. This was a seminal experience for Cesar, who regarded it as an injustice against his family, with the banks, lawyers, and Anglo-American power structure as the villains of the incident. Influenced by his Roman Catholic beliefs, he increasingly came to see the poor as a source of moral goodness in society.\nThe Chavez family joined the growing number of American migrants who were moving to California amid the Great Depression. First working as avocado pickers in Oxnard and then as pea pickers in Pescadero, the family made it to San Jose, where they first lived in a garage in the city's impoverished Mexican district. They moved regularly, and on weekends and holidays, Cesar joined his family in working as an agricultural laborer. In California, he moved schools many times, spending the longest time at Miguel Hidalgo Junior School; here, his grades were generally average, although he excelled at mathematics. At school, he faced ridicule for his poverty, while more broadly, he experienced anti-Latino prejudice from many European-Americans, with many establishments refusing to serve non-white customers. He graduated from junior high in June 1942, after which he left formal education and became a full-time farm laborer.\nEarly adulthood: 1946\u20131953.\nIn 1944, Chavez enlisted in the U.S. Navy, and was sent to Naval Training Center San Diego. In July, he was stationed at the U.S. base in Saipan, and six months later moved to Guam, where he was promoted to the rank of seaman first class. He was then stationed to San Francisco, where he decided to leave the Navy, receiving an honorable discharge in 1946. Relocating to Delano, California, where his family had settled, he returned to working as an agricultural laborer.\nIn 1947, Chavez joined the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU), which, until its 1947 affiliation with the American Federation of Labor, was the Southern Tenant Farmers Union (STFU). (Later, the NFLU became the National Agricultural Workers Union.) That year, he was picketing cotton fields in Corcoran, near Delano, for the NFLU. The union had called a strike against the DiGiorgio grape fields in 1947. As in the STFU's strikes against cotton plantations in Arkansas, strikers formed \"caravans\" and marched around the perimeter of the DiGiorgio property, asking its workers to join them. Chavez led one of those caravans.\nChavez entered a relationship with Helen Fabela, who soon became pregnant. They married in Reno, Nevada in October 1948; it was a double wedding, with Chavez's sister Rita marrying her fianc\u00e9 at the same ceremony. By early 1949, Chavez and his new wife had settled in the Sal Si Puedes neighborhood of San Jose, where many of his other family members were now living. Their first child, Fernando, was born there in February 1949; a second, Sylvia, followed in February 1950; and then a third, Linda, in January 1951. The latter had been born shortly after they had relocated to Crescent City, where Chavez was employed in the lumber industry. They then returned to San Jose, where Chavez worked as an apricot picker and then as a lumber handler for the General Box Company.\nThere, he befriended two social justice activists, Fred Ross and Father Donald McDonnell, both European-Americans whose activism was primarily within the Mexican-American community. Chavez helped Ross establish a chapter of his Community Service Organization (CSO) in San Jose, and joined him in voter registration drives. He was soon voted vice president of the CSO chapter. He also helped McDonnell construct the first purpose-built church in Sal Si Puedes, the Our Lady of Guadalupe church, which opened in December 1953. In turn, McDonnell lent Chavez books, encouraging the latter to develop a love of reading. Among the books were biographies of the saint Francis of Assisi, the U.S. labor organizers John L. Lewis and Eugene V. Debs, and the Indian independence activist Mahatma Gandhi, introducing Chavez to the ideas of nonviolent protest.\nEarly activism.\nWorking for the Community Service Organization: 1953\u20131962.\nIn late 1953, Chavez was laid off by the General Box Company. Ross then secured funds so that the CSO could employ Chavez as an organizer, traveling around California setting up other chapters. In this job, he traveled across Decoto, Salinas, Fresno, Brawley, San Bernardino, Madera, and Bakersfield. Many of the CSO chapters fell apart after Ross or Chavez ceased running them, and to prevent this Saul Alinsky advised them to unite the chapters, of which there were over twenty, into a self-sustaining national organization. In late 1955, Chavez returned to San Jose to rebuild the CSO chapter there so that it could sustain an employed full-time organizer. To raise funds, he opened a rummage store, organized a three-day carnival and sold Christmas trees, although often made a loss.\nIn early 1957, he moved to Brawley to rebuild the chapter there. His repeated moving meant that his family were regularly uprooted; he saw little of his wife and children, and was absent for the birth of his sixth child.\nChavez grew increasingly disillusioned with the CSO, believing that middle-class members were becoming increasingly dominant and were pushing its priorities and allocation of funds in directions he disapproved of; he for instance opposed the decision to hold the organization's 1957 convention in Fresco's Hacienda Hotel, arguing that its prices were prohibitive for poorer members. Amid the wider context of the Cold War and McCarthyite suspicions that leftist activism was a front for Marxist-Leninist groups, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began monitoring Chavez and opened a file on him.\nAt Alinsky's instigation, the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA) paid $20,000 to the CSO for the latter to open a branch in Oxnard; Chavez became its organizer, working with the largely Mexican farm laborers. In Oxnard, Chavez worked to encourage voter registration. He repeatedly heard concerns from local Mexican-American laborers that they were being routinely passed over or fired so that employers could hire cheaper Mexican guest workers, or \"braceros\", in violation of federal law. To combat this practice, he established the CSO Employment Committee that launched a \"registration campaign\" through which unemployed farm workers could sign their name to highlight their desire for work.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI guess the best thing is to keep organizing new groups until they become rotten with personalities, then just move over and begin another group. I really don't know. The only one suggestion I have is to make sure there is always one person who is in charge... I think this way the work of the group moves forward always.\n\u2014 Cesar Chavez, on avoiding the pitfalls of the CSO\nThe Committee targeted its criticism at Hector Zamora, the director of the Ventura County Farm Labor Association, who controlled most of the jobs in the area. It used sit-ins of workers to raise the profile of their cause, a tactic also used by proponents of the civil rights movement in the southern U.S. at that time. It had some success in getting companies to replace \"braceros\" with unemployed Americans. Its campaign also ensured that federal officials began properly investigating complaints about the use of \"braceros\" and received assurances from the state farm placement service that they would seek out unemployed Americans rather than automatically hiring \"bracero\" labor. In May, the Employment Committee was formerly transferred from the CSO to the UPWA.\nIn 1959, Chavez moved to Los Angeles to become the CSO's national director. He, his wife, and now eight children settled into the largely Mexican neighborhood of Boyle Heights. He found the CSO's financial situation was bad, with even his own salary in jeopardy. He laid off several organizers to keep the organization afloat. He tried to organize a life insurance scheme among CSO members to raise funds, but this project failed to materialize. Under Chavez, the CSO secured financing from wealthier donors and organizations, usually to finance specific projects for a set period of time. The California American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) for instance paid it $12,000 to conduct voter registration schemes in six counties with high Mexican populations. The wealthy benefactor Katy Peake then offered it $50,000 over three years to organize California's farm workers. Under Chavez's leadership, the CSO assisted the successful campaign to get the government to extend the state pension to non-citizens who were permanent residents. At the ninth annual CSO convention in March 1962, Chavez resigned.\nFounding the National Farm Workers Association: 1962\u20131965.\nIn April 1962, Chavez and his family moved to Delano, California, an agricultural community in the southern San Joaquin Valley, where they rented a house on Kensington Street. He was intent on forming a labor union for farm workers but, to conceal this aim, told people that he was simply conducting a census of farm workers to determine their needs. He began devising the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), referring to it as a \"movement\" rather than a trade union. He was aided in this project both by his wife and by Dolores Huerta; according to Pawel, Huerta became his \"indispensable, lifelong ally\". Other key supporters of his project were the Reverend Jim Drake and other members of the California Migrant Ministry; although as a Roman Catholic Chavez was initially suspicious of these Protestant preachers, he came to view them as key allies.\nChavez spent his days traveling around the San Joaquin Valley, meeting with workers and encouraging them to join his association. At the time, he lived off a combination of unemployment benefit, his wife's wage as a farmworker, and donations from friends and sympathizers. On September 30, 1962, he formalized the Association at a convention in Fresno. There, delegates elected Chavez as the group's general-director. They also agreed that, once the association had a life insurance policy up and running, members would start paying monthly dues of $3.50. The group adopted the motto \"viva la causa\" (\"long live the cause\") and a flag featuring a black eagle on a red and white background. At the organization's constitutional convention held in Fresno in January 1963, Chavez was elected president, with Huerta, Julio Hernandez, and Gilbert Padilla its vice presidents.\nChavez wanted to control the NFWA's direction and to that end ensured that the role of the group's officers was largely ceremonial, with control of the group being primarily in the hands of the staff, headed by himself. At the NFWA's second convention, held in Delano in 1963, Chavez was retained as its general director while the role of the presidency was scrapped. That year, he began collecting membership dues, before establishing an insurance policy for FWA members. Later in the year he launched a credit union for NFWA members, having gained a state charter after the federal government refused him one. The NFWA attracted volunteers from other parts of the country. One of these, Bill Esher, became editor of the group's newspaper, \"El Malcriado\", which soon after launching increased its print run from 1,000 to 3,000 to meet demand.\nThe NFWA was initially based out of Chavez's house although in September 1964 it moved its headquarters to an abandoned Pentecostal church in Albany Street, West Delano. During its second full year in operation the association more than doubled both its income and its expenditures. As it became more secure, it began to plan for its first strike. In April 1965, rose grafters approached the organization and requested help in organizing their strike for better working conditions. The strike targeted two companies, Mount Arbor and Conklin. Aided by the NFWA, the workers struck on May 3, and after four days the growers agreed to raise wages, after which the strikers returned to work. Following this success, Chavez's reputation began to filter through leftist activist circles across California.\nDelano Grape Strike.\nStart of the Delano Grape Strike: 1965\u20131966.\nIn September 1965, Filipino American farm workers, organized by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), initiated the Delano grape strike to protest for higher wages. Chavez and his largely Mexican American supporters voted to support them. The strike covered an area of over ; Chavez divided the picketers among four quadrants, each with a mobile crew led by a captain. As the picketers urged those who continued to work to join them on strike, the growers sought to provoke and threaten the strikers. Chavez insisted that the strikers must never respond with violence. The picketers also protested outside strike-breakers' homes, with the strike dividing many families and breaking friendships. Police monitored the protests, photographing many of those involved; they also arrested various strikers. To raise support for those arrested, Chavez called for donations at a speech in Berkeley's Sproul Plaza in October; he received over $1,000. Many growers considered Chavez a communist, and the FBI launched an investigation into both him and the NFWA.\nIn December, the United Automobile Workers (UAW) president Walter Reuther joined Chavez in a pro-strike protest march through Delano. This was the first time that the strike attracted national media attention. Reuther then pledged that the UAW would donate $5,000 a month to be shared between the AWOC and NFWA. Chavez also met with representatives of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which became an important ally of the strikers. Influenced by the civil rights movement's successful use of boycott campaigns, Chavez decided to launch his own, targeting companies which owned Delano vineyards or sold grapes grown there. The first target selected, in December 1965, was the Schenley liquor company, which owned one of the area's smaller vineyards. Chavez organized pickets to take place in other cities where Schenley's grapes were being delivered for sale.\nBy 1965, Chavez was aware that the numbers joining the picket lines had declined; although hundreds of pickers had initially struck, some had returned to their jobs, found employment elsewhere, or moved away from Delano. To keep the pickets going, Chavez invited left-wing activists from elsewhere to join them; many, particularly university students, came from the San Francisco Bay Area. Recruitment was fueled by coverage of the strike in the SNCC's newspaper, \"The Movement\", and the Marxist \"People's World\" newspaper. By late fall 1966, a protest camp had formed in Delano, opening its own medical clinic and children's nursery. Protesters were entertained by Luis Valdez's El Teatro Campesino, which put on skits with a political message. Within the protest movement there were some tensions between the striking farm-workers and the influx of student radicals.\nGrowing success: 1966\u20131967.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWE SHALL OVERCOME. Across the San Joaquin Valley, across California, across the entire Southwest of the United States, wherever there are Mexican people, wherever there are farm workers, our movement is spreading like flames across [a] dry plain. Our PILGRIMAGE is the MATCH that will light our cause for all farm workers to see what is happening here, so that they may do as we have done. The time has come for the liberation of the poor farm worker. History is on our side. MAY THE STRUGGLE GO ON! VIVA LA CAUSA!\n\u2014 Luis Valdez's \"Plan de Delano\", read aloud at each stop along Chavez's march to Sacramento\nIn March 1966, the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor held three hearings in California. The third, which took place in Delano, was attended by Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who toured a labor camp with Chavez and addressed a mass meeting. As the strike began to flag in winter, Chavez decided on a march of to the state capitol at Sacramento. This would pass through dozens of farmworker communities and attract attention for their cause. In March, the procession started out with about fifty marchers who left Delano.\nChavez imbued the march with Roman Catholic significance. Marchers carried crucifixes and a banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe and used the slogan \"Peregrinaci\u00f3n, Penitencia, Revoluci\u00f3n\" (\"Pilgrimage, Penitence, Revolution\"). Portraying the march as an act of penance, he argued that the image of his personal suffering\u2014his feet became painful and for part of the journey he had to walk with a cane\u2014would be useful for the movement. At each stop, they read aloud a \"Plan de Delano\" written by Valdez, deliberately echoing the \"Plan de Ayala\" of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. At Easter, the marchers arrived in Sacramento, where over 8,000 people amassed in front of the state capitol. Chavez briefly addressed the crowd.\nDuring the march, Chavez had been approached by Schenley's lawyer, Sidney Korshak. They agreed to contract negotiations within 60 days. Chavez then declared an end to the Schenley boycott; instead, the movement would switch the boycott to the DiGiorgio Corporation, a major Delano land owner. DiGiorgio then called an election among their vineyard workers, hoping to challenge the NFWA's influence. A more conservative union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, was competing against the NFWA in the DiGiorgio workers' election. After DiGiorgio altered the terms of the election to benefit a Teamster victory, Chavez removed the NFWA from the ballot and urged his supporters to abstain. When the vote took place in June 1966, nearly half of eligible workers abstained, allowing a Teamster victory. Chavez then appealed to Pat Brown, the Governor of California, to intervene. Brown agreed, wanting the endorsement of the Mexican American Political Association. He declared the DiGiorgio election invalid and called for an August rerun to be supervised by the American Arbitration Association. On September 1, Chavez's union was declared the victor in the second election. DiGiorgio subsequently largely halted grape production in Delano. The focus then shifted to Giumarra, the largest grape grower in the San Joaquin Valley. In August 1967, Chavez announced a strike against them followed by a boycott of their grapes.\nAn agreement was reached that Chavez's NFWA would merge with the AWOC, resulting in a new United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC). AWOC's Larry Itliong became the new group's assistant director, although soon felt marginalized by Chavez. UFWOC was also made an organizing committee of the AFL-CIO; this ensured that it would become a formal part of the U.S. labor movement and would receive a monthly subsidy. Not all of Chavez's staff agreed with the merger; many of its more left-wing members mistrusted the growing links with organized labor, particularly due to the AFL-CIO's anti-communist views. The UFWOC was plagued by ethnic divisions between its Filipino and Mexican members, although it continued to attract new volunteers. The majority of the volunteers were whites brought into the movement via left-wing and religious groups, or as part of social service internships. Chavez brought new people, such as LeRoy Chatfield, Marshall Ganz, and the lawyer Jerry Cohen, into his inner circle. His old friend Fred Ross had also joined. Soon, the secretary\u2013treasurer Antonio Orendain was left as the only Mexican migrant in the union's senior ranks.\nIn June 1967, Chavez launched his first purge of the union to remove those he deemed disruptive or disloyal to his leadership. His cover story was that he wanted to eject members of the Communist Party USA and related far-left groups, although the FBI's report at the time found no evidence of communist infiltration of the union. Some longstanding members, such as Esher, left because they disapproved of these purges. Tensions between Chavez and the Teatro had been building for some time; the Teatro's members were among those highly critical of the union's new links with the AFL-CIO. Chavez was concerned that the Teatro had become a rival to his prominent standing in the movement and was questioning his actions. Chavez asked the Teatro to disband, at which it split from the union and went on a tour of the U.S.\nForty Acres and public fasts: 1967\u20131968.\nThe union purchased land known as The Forty Acres for their new headquarters. Chavez hoped for it to be a \"spiritual\" center where union members would relax; he designed it to have a swimming pool, a chapel, a market, and a gas station, as well as gardens with outdoor sculptures. He wanted the main building to be decorated inside with Gandhi quotations in English and Spanish. Meanwhile, Chavez was increasingly concerned that his supporters might turn to violence. Members had engaged in the destruction of property, something they regarded as not breaching the movement's ethos on non-violence. Chavez's cousin Manuel had tampered with refrigerator units on trains, so that grapes being shipped out of Delano spoiled before reaching their destination; Chavez noted that \"He's done all the dirty work for the union. There's a lot of fucking dirty work, and he did it all.\" In February 1968, the Giumarra company obtained a contempt citation against the union, claiming that its members had used threatening and intimidating behavior against its employees and had placed roofing nails at the entrances to its ranches.\nIn February 1968, Chavez began a fast; he publicly stated that in doing so he was reaffirming his commitment to peaceful protest and presented it as a form of penance. He stated that he would remain at Forty Acres for the duration of his fast, which at this point had only a gas station there. Many members of the union were critical of what they saw as a stunt; Itliong was annoyed that Chavez had not consulted the union's board before making his declaration. The union introduced a motion urging Chavez to cancel his plan, although this failed. Father Mark Day announced that a Mass would be held every night at Forty Acres. These attracted many of Chavez's supporters, with the gas station decorated as an impromptu shrine. Sympathetic Protestant clergy and Jewish rabbis also spoke at these Masses. After three weeks, Chavez's doctors urged him to end the fast. He agreed to do so at a public event on March 10. He invited Robert Kennedy to be the guest of honor at this event. Kennedy arrived at the event, which was attended by thousands of observers as well as the national press, and there they shared bread.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nYou stand today as a living example of the Gandhian tradition with its great force for social progress and its healing spiritual powers. My colleagues and I commend you for your bravery, salute you for your indefatigable work against poverty and injustice, and pray for your health and your continuing service as one of the outstanding men of America.\n\u2014 Martin Luther King's telegram to Chavez after the latter announced his fast in February 1968\nNot long after, Kennedy announced his candidacy to be the Democratic Party's next presidential candidate. He asked Chavez to run as a delegate in the California primary. Throughout May, Chavez traveled across California, urging farmworkers and registered Democrats to back Kennedy. His activism was a contributing factor to Kennedy's victory in that state. It was at the victory celebration in Los Angeles, an event attended by Chavez, that Kennedy was assassinated on June 5. Chavez then attended Kennedy's New York funeral as a pallbearer. Kennedy's assassination came two months after that of Martin Luther King, generating growing concerns among the union that Chavez would also be targeted by those who opposed him.\nIn May, Chavez appeared on the \"Today\" television show and announced a boycott of all grapes produced in California. The boycotters' message was that consumers should avoid buying California grapes so that farmworkers would get better wages and working conditions. Supporters across the country picketed stores selling California grapes and disrupted annual meetings of several supermarket chains. Chavez hoped that by putting pressure on the supermarkets, they in turn would pressure the grape growers to give in to strikers' demands. The growers hired a public relations firm to counteract the boycott, warning stores that if they gave in to the boycott they would soon be faced with similar boycotts for many other products. The growers also turned to the newly elected Governor of California, Ronald Reagan, who in turn sought the support of the Teamsters.\nChavez's back pain worsened and in September 1968 he was hospitalized at O'Connor Hospital in San Jose. He followed this with a recuperation stay at St Anthony's Seminary in Santa Barbara. He returned home, but finding it too crowded moved in to Forty Acres. Due to a donation from the United Auto Workers, the union had erected an office and meeting hall here, with a trailer being used as a medical clinic; it was still far from Chavez's original vision. He used his image of physical suffering as a tactic in his cause, although some of his inner circle thought his pain to be at least partially psychosomatic. By 1968, Chavez was a national celebrity. Journalists increasingly approached him for interviews; he granted particularly close access to Peter Matthiessen and Jacques E. Levy, both of whom wrote favorable books about him. In July 1969, Chavez's portrait appeared on the front of \"Time\" magazine. Within the union, personal loyalty to Chavez became increasingly important; tensions between him and Itliong grew.\nEnd of the Grape Strike: 1969\u20131970.\nIn March 1969, the doctor Janet Travell visited Chavez and determined that fused vertebrae were the source of his back pain. She prescribed various exercises and other treatments which he found eased his pain. Between September and December, Chavez traveled the country in a Winnebago speaking at dozens of fundraisers and rallies for the grape boycott. At a speech in Washington D.C., he came out publicly against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, a topic he had previously avoided speaking on, because his son Fernando had been arrested as a conscientious objector.\nIn the late 1970s, Chavez also sought to advance his control over the California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA), a group which advocated for farmworkers. Chavez demanded that the CRLA make its staff available for union work and that it would allow the union's attorneys to decide which cases the CRLA would pursue. Under the leadership of Cruz Reynoso, a former Chavez ally, the CRLA refused. Pawel believed that these attempts reflected Chavez's desire to be seen as the only voice for farmworkers.\nChavez negotiated with Lionel Steinberg, a grape grower in the Coachella area. They signed contracts allowing Steinberg's products to be sold with a union logo on them, indicating that they would be exempt from the boycott. Other Coachella growers regarded Steinberg as a traitor for negotiating with Chavez but ultimately followed suit, resulting in contracts being signed with the union. In July 1969, the Delano growers agreed to negotiate. Chavez insisted that their negotiations also cover issues at the Delano High School, where several pupils, including his own daughter Eloise, had been suspended or otherwise disciplined for protesting in support of the boycott. On July 29, 1970, the Delano growers signed contracts with the union at the Forty Acres Hall, in front of press. These contracts agreed to wage rises for pickers, the introduction of a health plan, and new safety measures regarding the use of pesticides on the crop.\nLater activism.\nSalinas Lettuce Strike: 1970\u20131971.\nIn July 1970, the Grower-Shipper Association representing lettuce growing companies in California's Salinas Valley renegotiated its contracts with the Teamsters, allowing the latter union to represent their employees. Chavez was angry at this, traveling to Salinas to talk with the lettuce cutters, many of whom were dissatisfied with the way that the Teamsters represented them. In August, thousands of cutters marched into Salinas, converging at Hartnell College where Chavez addressed them. Rallying against the Teamsters, he emphasized that their union was run by white people, in contrast to the largely non-white makeup of the lettuce cutters. There, the cutters voted to go on strike. Over the coming days, many of them joined the UFW. Chavez decided that the strike should initially target the valley's largest lettuce grower, Interharvest, which was owned by the United Fruit Company. Seeking to avoid industrial action, the Teamsters set up a meeting with Chavez, where they eventually reached an agreement. The Teamsters agreed to relinquish their contracts with the Grower-Shipper Association, opening the way for the Salinas lettuce cutters to choose the UFW as their representative.\nThe Salinas lettuce growers secured a temporary restraining order preventing a strike, at which Chavez initiated another protest fast. Amid a ten-day truce, he reached an agreement with Interharvest but not the other Salinas growers. Thus, the strike against them began on August 24, when cutters started picketing the lettuce fields. Lettuce production slumped by three quarters and prices of lettuces doubled. Various restraining orders were issued against the picketers, and when they broke them they were fined; the UFW paid many of these, as well as financially supporting the strikers in other ways. This proved expensive for the union, and Chavez decided that the pickets could not be maintained. Instead he decided to switch towards a boycott of Salinas lettuce. Chavez selected the Bud Antle company as the first target of the boycott campaign.\nBud Antle secured an injunction legally preventing a boycott against them, but Chavez continued regardless. Due to this, Chavez was charged, found guilty of contempt of court, and sentenced to ten days imprisonment in the Monterey County jail. During Chavez's imprisonment, supporters held a round-the-clock vigil outside the jail. Among those who visited him were Martin Luther King's widow Coretta Scott King, and Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy. She took part in a rally which included a Roman Catholic Mass; it was opposed by a group of local counter-protesters who opposed the concentration of leftist activism in their community. These events attracted national media attention. Soon after, the California Supreme Court voted to dissolve key aspects of Bud Antle's injunction and ordered Chavez's release.\nChavez wanted a more remote base for his movement than Forty Acres, especially one where he could experiment with his ideas about communal living. To this end, the Hollywood movie producer Edward Lewis, a wealthy supporter of Chavez's, fronted the purchase of an old tuberculosis sanatorium in Keene, along the foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains, for the union. Chavez named this new base Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de la Paz (\"Our Lady Queen of Peace\"), although it became commonly known just as \"La Paz\". Renovating the existing buildings, he invited various families to come and live there. In creating this commune, he drew on Gandhi's experiments with \"ashrams\" in India; he envisioned it as a retreat center where workers could come for three day retreats modeled on the Roman Catholic \"cursillo\". La Paz became the union's new headquarters, something that various backers and funders were critical of due to its remote location; Chavez said that this was necessary for his security, particularly following allegations of a plot against his life. At night, the perimeter of the commune was patrolled by armed guards. The organization at La Paz was often chaotic, with frustrated detractors in the movement referring to it as \"Magic Mountain\". Amid his growing frustrations with Chavez's leadership, Itliong resigned in October 1971.\nExpanding beyond California: 1972.\nArizona became the first state to pass a bill that was designed to keep the UFW out of their state; this would criminalize boycotts and make union elections among farm-workers almost impossible. In response, Chavez drove to Arizona and demanded a meeting with Governor Jack Williams, who refused. They subsequently launched a campaign to gain a recall election to remove Williams from office. This started the UFW's first major farm-worker campaign outside California. Farmworkers rallied outside Williams' office while Chavez embarked on a fast in the Santa Rita Center, a hall used by a local Chicano group. On the nineteenth day of his fast, Chavez was hospitalized. He then broke the fast at a memorial Mass on the anniversary of Robert Kennedy's death, where he was joined by the folk singer Joan Baez. It was during the Arizona campaign that the UFW started using the slogan \"Si Se Puede\" (\"It Can be Done\"), which subsequently became closely associated with it.\nChavez increasingly pushed for the UFW to become a national organization, with a token presence being established in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Texas, and Florida. Parts of the union expressed concern that it was now overstretching its resources. Chavez also pushed for the California Migrant Ministry, which supported the UFW, to transform into a National Farm Worker Ministry (NFWM), insisting that the UFW should have the power to veto decisions made by the NFWM.\nAt the AFL-CIO's request, Chavez had suspended the Salinas lettuce boycott, but prepared to relaunch it eight months later as the growers had only conceded to one of their demands. Tensions grew between the UFW and AFL-CIO, with the latter's president George Meany concerned that if the UFW broke the law by extending its boycott to cover supermarket chains then the AFL-CIO could be held liable. As a result, Chavez formally requested a charter so that the UFW could become an independently chartered union separate from the AFL-CIO; he was loath to do so as it meant losing the AFL-CIO's subsidy.\nWhile Chavez had been focusing on Salinas, his brother Richard had been tasked with overseeing the UFW's activities in Delano. In early 1972, Richard visited Chavez and confronted him about the problems in Delano, telling him that the union was losing support among farmworkers and that they were in danger of losing the contracts when they came up for renewal. In Richard's opinion, Chavez was losing touch with the union's membership. There was anger that members were expected to pay monthly dues to the union when their work was usually seasonal; there was also frustration at the union's $1-a-week voluntary fund to support the Salinas strikers. Part of the membership thought that Chavez's new isolation at La Paz was leading him to take decisions unpopular with the farmworkers. There were concerns about the inept and inexperienced volunteers, mostly English-speaking European-Americans, who were running the UFW's hiring halls; growers were complaining that these volunteers were often hostile and uncooperative. Union branches had been ordering members to miss work to engage in political rallies and Salinas picket lines, further angering growers. Chavez responded to these criticisms by reassigning his brother away from Delano. In late 1972, Richard and Huerta, his partner at the time, briefly left the UFW in frustration with Chavez's leadership. Other senior members continued to warn Chavez about the same issues that Richard did, but Chavez dismissed their concerns as grower propaganda.\nCalifornia growers then organized a ballot on Proposition 22 for November 1972 which would ban boycott campaigns in the state. Chavez tasked LeRoy Chatfield with running the campaign against it; at the ballot, Proposition 22 lost by 58 percent to 42 percent.\nIn April 1973, the UFW's contact with grape growers in the Delano area expired. At this, Chavez called a strike in the Coachella Valley. The Teamsters union saw this as an opportunity to replace the UFW in representing the region's farmworkers. The Teamsters organized counter-protests; their picketers were often armed and violent clashes between members of the two unions broke out. The UFW used these instances of Teamster violence to rally public support for their cause. The AFL-CIO was concerned by this clash between unions, and Meany struck a deal with Chavez that they would provide the UFW with renewed financial support if it pushed for state legislation to govern the rights of farmworkers to organize. Chavez agreed; although he did not want such a law and he thought that Governor Reagan would never agree to it anyway. The AFL-CIO gave the UFW $1.6 million, allowing the latter to pay Salinas picketers $75 and later $90 a week.\nAmid the Delano strike, one of the UFW strikers, the Yemeni migrant Nagi Moshin Daifullah, died after an altercation with a police officer breaking up a bar-room fight. The UFW portrayed Daifullah as a martyr for the cause and over 5000 people marched at his funeral, with Chavez fasting for three days. Chavez then called off the Delano strike, stating that he would do so until the federal government guaranteed the safety of UFW protesters; the government believed that this was a cover to conceal the financial problems that the strike was causing the UFW. By this point, the UFW had lost much of its membership, and most of its California contracts, to the Teamsters. Many farmworkers found that while the Teamsters appeared less interested in workers' rights, they did not expect their employees to spend their weekends on political campaigns and boycotts as the UFW did.\nImmigration and legislative campaigns: 1973\u20131975.\nIn September 1973, the UFW's first constitutional convention was held in Fresno, representing the final step in the organization becoming a full union. A new constitution was announced that gave the group's president, a post occupied by Chavez, significant powers; he feared that greater democracy would paralyze the group. At the convention, the UFW agreed to scrap monthly membership fees in favor of charging members 2 percent of their annual income. It also announced that volunteers who had worked for the UFW for more than six months could become members with voting rights. Previously, membership had been restricted primarily to farmworkers. The new executive committee, which included Huerta and Richard Chavez, was racially mixed, although some members expressed dissatisfaction that it did not contain more Mexican Americans. By 1974, the UFW was again broke and its boycott was floundering. That year, \"The New York Times Magazine\" opened with a headline: \"Is Chavez Beaten?\". Chavez flew to Europe to urge the unions there to block the imported goods that the UFW were sending there. He traveled through London, Oslo, Stockholm, Geneva, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Brussels, and Paris, although he found that the unions were cautious about joining his campaign. In Rome, he met with Pope Paul VI, who commended his activism.\nChavez increasingly blamed the failure of the UFW strike on illegal immigrants who were brought in as strikebreakers. He made the unsubstantiated claim that the CIA was involved in part of a conspiracy to bring illegal migrants into the country so that they could undermine his union. He launched the \"Illegals Campaign\" to identify illegal migrants so that they could be deported, appointing Liza Hirsch to oversee the campaign. In Chavez's view, \"if we can get the illegals out of California, we will win the strike overnight.\" This was a reiteration of an early view he expressed concerning the problems the UFW boycott faced in 1972. Chavez believed that any strike undertaken by agricultural workers could be undermined by \"wetbacks\" and \"illegal immigrants\". Huerta urged him not to refer to migrants who had come to the U.S. illegally as \"illegals\" but Chavez refused, stating: \"a spade's a spade.\" Some UFW field offices refused to collaborate with the campaign, and the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) refused to allow its interns to work on it, at which Chavez cut the UFW's links with the NLG.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nChavez pulled up to my Laurel Canyon house in an old car with a German shepherd dog named Huelga\u2014Spanish for strike. We talked for several hours about whether the proposed state law or any labor law could actually help farm workers. Chavez repeatedly said that his boycott was a much better organizing tool because the law would always be corrupted by the powerful economic interests that control politics. I argued with him and said that a law would be his best protection. He finally agreed but remained skeptical.\n\u2014 Jerry Brown on his relationship with Chavez\nWhile Chavez had been in Europe, his cousin Manuel Chavez had established a UFW patrol, or \"wet line\", along Arizona's border with Mexico to stop illegal migrants crossing into the United States. There were rumors that this patrol was employing violence against these migrants, beating and robbing them and in one case castrating a man. These allegations soon appeared in the local press. A Mexican investigation determined that the UFW had bribed San Luis city officials to prevent them from interfering in these activities along the border. A Mexican union, the Confederation of Mexican Workers, broke its links with the UFW over the issue. Chavez dismissed the reports of violence as the smears of paid provocateurs, a claim which many of his supporters accepted. Chavez protected Manuel, while the executive board kept silent on his activities, regarding him as useful. The Chicano activist Bert Corona staged a protest against the UFW wet line, at which Chavez directed Jerry Cohen to launch an investigation into the funding of Corona's group.\nIn 1974, Chavez proposed the idea of a Poor People's Union with which he could reach out to poor white communities in the San Joaquin Valley who were largely hostile to the UFW. Meanwhile, the UFW announced that it would launch a boycott of the Gallo Wine company. In February 1975, the UFW organized a four-day march from San Francisco to the Gallo headquarters in Modesto, where a crowd of around 10,000 protesters amassed. The Modesto march had been a means of trying to rekindle the successes of the late 1960s and a public display of strength despite the setbacks that the UFW had experienced.\nIn November 1974, the Democratic Party's candidate, the modern liberal Jerry Brown, was elected governor of California. At this point, farm-worker's rights took center stage in the state's political agenda. Chavez met with Brown and together they developed a strategy: Brown would introduce a bill to improve farmworkers' rights, at which the UFW would support a more radical alternative. Brown would then negotiate a law with other stakeholders that included all the UFW's bottom lines. The purpose of this law would be to guarantee farmworkers the right to a secret ballot in which they could decide which union, if any, should represent them in their negotiations with their employer. Brown signed the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act (ALRA) into law in June 1975. This was widely seen as a UFW victory, as California now had the most favorable labor bill in the country. Chavez nevertheless worried that it would kill the movement's spirit, stating that the cause would now lose \"the essential fight of recognition, which is the one that appeals to the human mind and the heart\", instead focusing on more prosaic issues such as wages and benefits.\nProposition 14: 1976\u20131977.\nThe ALRA law created a state agency, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB), to oversee union elections among farmworkers. Brown appointed a five-person board to lead the ALRB which was sympathetic to Chavez; it included the former UFW official LeRoy Chatfield. As the UFW prepared for the elections in the fields, Chavez organized a \"1000 mile march\" from the San Diego border up the coast in July 1975. During the march, he stopped to attend the second UFW convention. For the campaign, the UFW hired 500 organizers, many of them farmworkers. The UFW won more elections than it lost, although in instances where it went head-to-head with the Teamsters, the latter beat the UFW. This indicated that the UFW's greatest strengths were among vegetable and citrus growers, rather than in their original heartlands of the Delano vineyards. The Teamster victories in the Delano vineyards angered Chavez, who insisted that there had not been free elections there. Chavez criticised the ALRB and launched a targeted campaign against Walter Kintz, the ALRB's general counsel, demanding his resignation. He also put pressure on Governor Brown to remove Kintz.\nUFW organizers moved to follow their electoral victories by signing contracts with the growers; the UFW needed these contracts to stabilize its finances. Meanwhile, to develop the UFW's administration, Chavez hired the management consultant Crosby Milne, whose ideas led to a restructuring of the union. These reforms further centralized the union's powers among the executive committee. The changes involved decision-making powers being delegated from Chavez to the department heads, although Chavez\u2014who liked to oversee everything personally\u2014found this difficult to adhere to in practice. As part of these reforms, Chavez continued to call on the union's leaders to all relocate to La Paz, which many were reluctant to do. In July 1976, Chavez traveled to New York to attend the Democratic Party's National Congress, at which he gave a speech nominating Brown as the party's presidential candidate. Brown would come third in the contest, which would be won by Jimmy Carter. Carter went on to win the 1976 election, initiating an administration that was keen to fund UFW projects.\nIn 1976, the ALRB ran out of its budgeted money for the year. The California legislature refused to allocate more money, so the ALRB closed shop for the year. Seeking to get the farmworkers' rights introduced by ALRA enshrined in California's constitution, in early 1976 UFW activists put forward the idea of Proposition 14, which would go forward to the electorate later that year. Chavez thought that Proposition 14 had little chance of being passed by the electorate and was concerned that devoting its resources to the campaign would be financially costly for the UFW. Brown also warned them not to, arguing that it would backfire on farmworkers by polarizing communities. Despite these concerns, Fred Ross urged the union to take on the issue, and after much debate, the UFW's executive board voted to involve itself in the 'vote yes' campaign on Proposition 14. Growers responded with a well-funded multi-media campaign that emphasized the claim that the measure would give unions the right to trespass on private property. When it went to the electorate in November 1976, Proposition 14 was defeated by a measure of two-to-one. Although this defeat had little serious impact on the UFW, Chavez took it as a very public rejection of him personally.\nChavez blamed the defeat on the UFW's national boycott director, Nick Jones, who had been the only staff member to publicly voice disquiet over the Proposition 14 campaign. He claimed that Jones and the New York boycott director, Charlie March, had been part of a far-left conspiracy to undermine the UFW. Under pressure, in November 1976, Jones resigned; in a letter to the executive board he stated that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the direction in which Chavez was taking the union. Chavez also fired Joe Smith, the editor of \"El Macriado\", after accusing him of deliberately undermining the newspaper. He then ordered Ross and Ganz to interrogate everyone who worked on the campaign, ostensibly to decide on new assignments but also to route out alleged malcontents, agitators, and spies. Many of those involved in running the UFW's boycott expressed concerns about a McCarthyite-style atmosphere developing within the union, and Chavez's purge attracted press attention. As the criticisms of his leadership intensified, Chavez responded with further purges, inspired by those in China's Cultural Revolution. He became convinced that there was a far-left conspiracy, whose members he called the \"assholes\" or \"them\", who were trying to undermine the UFW. At a La Paz meeting in April 1977, later called \"the Monday Night Massacre\", Chavez called together a range of individuals whom he denounced as malcontents or spies. They were verbally abused by members of the executive board and ejected from the community. He later accused Philip Vera Cruz, the oldest member of the executive board, of also being part of the conspiracy, and forced him out.\nChavez reversed many of the changes he had implemented under Milne's guidance, with executive board members being reassigned to cover geographic areas rather than having union-wide responsibilities. Milne, who had been living at La Paz, soon left, with Chavez later alleging he had been part of a conspiracy against the union. UFW had also entered into a negotiation with the Teamsters union, a process led by Cohen. The two unions reached an agreement by which the UFW would cease bringing litigation against the Teamsters if the latter ceased operating among farm-workers altogether. This left the UFW as the only dominant union among the farmworkers. The Teamsters agreed because farmworkers were a marginal group for them; their typically low incomes also meant that farmworkers did not generate sufficient funds for the union to warrant its ongoing and costly clashes with the UFW.\nLinks with Synanon and Ferdinand Marcos: 1977.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI'm going to tell you something. It's not threatening, it's just plain fucking fact. If this union doesn't turn around and become a movement, I want no part of it. I'll help and everything, but I don't want to be in charge. I want to do something else. I tell you because that's the way I feel.\n\u2014 Chavez arguing with the executive board to reform the UFW in 1977\nChavez told the executive committee that radical change was necessary in the UFW; he stated that they could be either a union or a movement, but not both. If the former, they would have to start paying wages to their staff rather than relying on volunteers, which at that time they were not in a financial position to do. He instead urged them to become a movement, which he argued meant establishing communal settlements for members, drawing on a Californian religious organization, Synanon, as an exemplar. Chavez had become increasingly interested in Synanon, a drug-treatment organization that had declared itself a religion in 1975 and which operated out of a compound east of Fresno. He admired Synanon's leader Charles Dederich, and the way that the latter controlled his planned community. In Chavez's opinion, Dederich was \"a genius in terms of people\".\nIn February 1977, Chavez took the UFW's executive board on a visit to the Synanon compound. There, they took part in a therapy system based on Dederich's own process, \"the Game\", as part of which each \"player\" was singled out in turn to receive harsh, profanity-laced criticism from the rest of the community. Dederich had told Chavez that \"the Game\" was key to reshaping the UFW, and the latter decided that he wanted everyone at La Paz to play it. He received tacit agreement from the executive board, although some of its members privately opposed the measure. The Game took place at La Paz on Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings, and at its height, about 100 people were taking part in it each week. There it was used to shape behavior and punish nonconformity. Many individuals dreaded the humiliation it involved, disliked the obscenities that were part of it, and found going through it to be a traumatic experience. Chavez remained enthusiastic about the Game, calling it \"a good tool to fine-tune the union\". Many of those close to Chavez, including his wife and Richard Chavez, refused to take part. The farmworkers were not informed about the Game. Various long-term supporters of the UFW, including various clerical figures, visited La Paz at this time and left alarmed by how it had changed.\nSynanon provided the UFW with $100,000 worth of cars and materials; building links with Chavez's movement burnished Dederich's reputation with rich liberals who were among Synanon's core constituency. Dederich suggested that Synanon and the UFW establish a joint communal farm, and although the option was explored, it did not materialize. Following Dederich's advice, Chavez began grooming young people who had grown up in the movement to remain committed to him and his ideals. He created a curriculum for them to follow, which included the Game. Whereas Chavez had previously refused to accept government money, he now applied for over $500,000 in grants for a school and other projects. Formal celebrations and group rituals became an important part of life at La Paz, while Chavez also declared that on Saturday mornings all residents of La Paz should work in the vegetable and flower gardens to improve sociability. A rule was passed that everyone at La Paz had to wear a UFW button at all times on penalty of a fine. After attending a course in Los Angeles, Chavez began claiming that he could heal people by laying on his hands.\nIn the field elections, the UFW was largely rebuffed by Filipino-American workers. Seeking to remedy this, in 1977 Chavez traveled to the Philippines as the guest of its president, Ferdinand Marcos. There, he was treated as a high-ranking dignitary, and received both an award from Marcos and an honorary doctorate from the Far Eastern University in Manila. He then spoke to a reporter from \"The Washington Post\" where he spoke positively about Marcos' introduction of martial law. This generated outcry in the U.S., especially among religious groups, who argued that Chavez was overlooking the human rights abuses taking place under Marcos' administration. Chavez then organized an event on Delano for five senior Filipino government officially to speak to an assembled audience. The incident eroded support among religious organizations, a key constituency for Chavez and the UFW.\n\"Time\" magazine published a story reporting on violence and child abuse at Synanon, which it termed a \"kooky cult\". Synanon launched a boycott of \"Time\" in response, with Chavez urging the UFW to support it, stating that they should assist their friends and help protect religious freedom. Los Angeles police then raided Synanon's compound and revealed evidence that Dederich had sanctioned the use of violence against the group's critics and ex-members; several senior members were also found guilty of murdering a lawyer representing ex-Synanon members. Shortly after, the Peoples Temple run by the civil rights activist Jim Jones, a group which had been closely linked with California's leftist movement, committed mass suicide at their Jonestown community. A Democratic assemblyman soon issued a press release comparing the cult surrounding Chavez to the Peoples Temple. The UFW stopped using the Game in response to these developments; Chavez's calls for it to resume were rejected by other senior members.\nThe UFW continued to rely on voluntary labor, only paying a small number of employees, such as lawyers. When the union's lawyers, who were paid, asked for a raise, it generated a major debate among the executive committee. Chavez framed the issue along the lines of whether the UFW should start paying wages to everyone or instead continue to rely on volunteers. The executive committee split largely on generational lines, with older members backing Chavez's desire to remain a voluntary organization, and this attitude narrowly prevailed. Medina, one of only two former farmworkers on the board, resigned over the issue. Drake also resigned.\nHalf of the lawyers left straight away, and the others in the coming weeks as the UFW switched to a voluntary legal department; the new volunteers were largely inexperienced. It was also in 1977 that the UFW declared that contributions to the union's political fund would become mandatory for members; this was then used to support political groups and candidates considered sympathetic to the UFW's interests.\nLater life.\nGrowing schisms: 1978\u20131982.\nIn June 1978, Chavez joined a picket in Yuma as part of his cousin Manuel's Arizona melon strike. This broke an injunction and Chavez was thrown into the county jail for a night. By 1978, there was growing anger at the UFW among vegetable workers; they were frustrated by its incompetency, especially in the running of its medical plan. In the 22 farmworker elections that took place between June and September 1978, the UFW lost two-thirds. To stop the loss of its contracts and members, Chavez launched his Plan de Flote, an initiative to regain the trust of the vegetable pickers. Chavez organized a new strike over wages, hoping that salary increases would stem the UFW's losses; the union made its wage demands in January 1979, days after its contracts had expired. Eleven lettuce growers in the Salinas and Imperial Valleys were included in the strike, which caused lettuce prices to soar.\nDuring the strike, the picketers trespassed on the Mario Saikhon company fields and attempted to drive away those still working. The foreman and other employees opened fire and one picketer, Rufino Contreras, was killed. Chavez urged the strikers not to resort to violence and with Contreras' father led a three-mile candlelit funerary procession, attended by 7000 people. In June, Ganz and other strike organizers planned a show of strength whereby strikers rushed onto the Salinas field to cause disruption. This generated violent clashes; several people sustained stab wounds and 75 were arrested. Vegetable growers accused Chavez of terrorism over the incident; Chavez criticized Ganz for organizing this without his approval. He then led a 12-day march from San Francisco to San Jose, beginning a fast on the sixth day. Arriving in Salinas, he met with strike leaders at a UFW convention. He argued that the strike was proving too costly for the UFW\u2014it cost the union between $300,000 and $400,000 a month\u2014and that they should end the strike and switch to a boycott campaign. The strike leaders rejected these suggestions. To end the strike, in August and September, several growers signed contracts with the UFW but many held out and the union was broke. Chavez continued arguing for a boycott, suggesting that the union could use alcoholics from the cities to run the boycott campaign, an idea most of the executive board rejected.\nUnder the new contracts, the growers agreed to pay for paid workers' representatives whose job it would be to ensure a smooth relationship between the growers and the UFW. Chavez brought these paid representatives to La Paz for a five-day training session in May 1980. Ganz, who was becoming increasingly distant from Chavez, helped tutor them. Chavez called all staff to a meeting at La Paz in May 1981, where he again insisted that the UFW was being infiltrated by spies seeking to undermine it and overthrow him. He arranged for more of his loyalists to be put on the executive board, which now had no farmworkers sitting on it. At the UFW's Fresno convention in September 1981, the paid representatives nominated some of their own choices, rather than Chavez's, to go on the board. Chavez's supporters responded with leaflets claiming that the paid representatives were puppets of \"the two Jews\", Ganz and Cohen, who were trying to undermine the union. This brought allegations of antisemitism against Chavez. Seeking to undermine the paid representatives, Chavez proposed a measure that if 8% of workers at a ranch signed a petition, the representatives of that ranch would be obliged to vote for Chavez's chosen candidates. The measure passed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNow we come to this 1981 convention facing yet another assault on our beloved union. An assault even more menacing than the past conventions. More menacing because it is clandestinely organized by those forces whose every wish and desire is our destruction. Obstruction by those evil forces visible and invisible who work at every chance to destroy us\u2014the growers, the teamsters, disaffected former staff, scoundrels, and God knows who, some unwittingly trying to each the same goal\u2014that is to bury our beloved union.\n\u2014 Chavez at the 1981 convention\nBy October, all of those who had opposed Chavez's choices at the convention had been fired. They responded by launching a fast in protest outside the UFW's Salinas office. Nine of them then sued Chavez in a federal court, claiming that he had no right to fire them from positions that they had been elected to represent by their peers in the fields. Chavez responded with a counter-suit, suing them for libel and slander. He acknowledged to a reporter that in doing so, he was trying to intimidate the protester's lawyer, something which brought negative publicity for the UFW. One of the protesters, Chava Bustamante, got work with the California Rural Legal Assistance group, at which the UFW began picketing their offices, trying to get Bustamante fired. In court, Chavez denied that the paid representatives were ever elected, alleging that they were appointed by him personally, but produced no evidence to support this claim. The US District Court Judge William Ingram rejected Chavez's argument, ruling that the sacking of the paid representatives had been unlawful. The UFW appealed the ruling, which dragged out for years, until the paid representatives ran out of funds to continue.\nOpposition to Chavez's hostility to illegal migrants led senior UFW members in Texas and Arizona to break from the union and form their own groups, such as the Texas Farm Workers Union and the Maricopa County Organizing Project. Chavez and his cousin Manuel went to Texas to try and rally opposition to the schism. Manuel also went to Arizona, where he introduced a range of measures to undermine the new group. This led to the investigative journalist Tom Barry looking into Manuel's activities. It was revealed that under a pseudonym he had become a melon grower in Mexico, and that he was initiating strikes among U.S. melon pickers as a means of improving the market for his own produce. The UFW's reputation was further damaged after the magazine \"Reason\" exposed that the union had improperly spent nearly $1 million in federal funds. Federal and national investigations followed, confirming these allegations. The government asked the UFW to return over $250,000 in funds while the Internal Revenue Service ruled that the union owed $390,000 in back social security and federal unemployment taxes.\nIn 1982, the UFW held a celebration of the twentieth anniversary of its first convention at San Jose. It was in October that year that Chavez's father died, with the funeral being held in San Jose. Chavez was also involving himself in a broader range of leftist events. He co-chaired Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda's fund-raising dinner for their Campaign for Economic Democracy. In the summer of 1982 he also appeared at Peace Sunday, an anti-nuclear event. The UFW had established itself as one of the largest political donors in California. Its political donations were often concealed from the public, funneled through intermediary committees. It donated thousands of dollars to Howard Berman's campaign to unseat Leo McCarthy as the Speaker of the California State Assembly because of McCarthy's role in defeating Proposition 14. Many Democrats feared that Berman would be beholden to Chavez and so backed Willie Brown, who won. The UFW subsequently also donated to Willie Brown.\nThe Chicano Lobby and commercial activities: 1983\u20131989.\nThe UFW's membership, and the subsequent membership dues they paid, continued to decline. In January 1983, UFW contracts covered 30,000 jobs but by January 1986 this had fallen to 15,000. In 1982, the dues that membership brought in were $2.9 million although this had fallen to $1 million three years later. By the early 1980s, there was a burgeoning Latino middle-class in the U.S. Although Chavez hated the aspirational approach that had encouraged working-class Latinos to become middle-class, he recognized that this offered the UFW a wider support base. At the 1983 UFW convention, he announced the formation of a new non-profit organization, the Chicano Lobby. At the Lobby's launch, addresses were given by the San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros and the newly elected president of the Mexican American Political Association, Chavez's eldest son Fernando. To cope with its declining membership, the UFW sought to build its political influence. In November 1984, Chavez gave a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California. The UFW launched a print shop, with politicians who were eager to court the Latino vote increasingly used.\nChavez launched a boycott of grapes and Red Coach Lettuce because their parent company, Bruce Church, had refused to sign a contract with the UFW. Chavez launched a boycott of Lucky, a California supermarket chain. His strategy was to convince the supermarket that the UFW could damage its patronage among Latinos. Chavez had observed that the Christian Right was beginning to use new computer technologies to reach potential supporters and decided that the UFW should do the same. Through this, they were better able to target specific groups whom they regarded as sympathetic to their cause: Hispanics, middle-class African Americans, and liberal professionals living in the major cities. As part of its boycott, the UFW also bought television commercials, which it used to help raise money.\nFrom the mid-1980s, Chavez increasingly focused the UFW's campaigns on opposing the use of pesticides in the fields, which he argued posed a danger both to farmworkers and to consumers. The UFW raised over $100,000, as well as donated equipment, to launch its own pesticide research lab, but this never opened. In his anti-pesticide campaigns he gained support from Ralph Nader. Chavez linked this approach in with the ongoing boycott of Bruce Church, arguing that if consumers boycotted the company's products, the growers would stop using pesticides. The UFW claimed that the high rates of childhood cancer in McFarland represented evidence of how pesticides impacted humans; they used footage of some of these children in a 17-minute video, \"The Wrath of Grapes\". Many of the parents were angered and several sued the UFW, claiming that the union was exploiting their children for its own agenda. UFW activists also turned up at the funeral procession of a 14-year old who had died from cancer, where they carried union flags; the child's furious mother demanded that they leave.\nIn 1982, Jerry Brown ceased to be governor of California. He was replaced by the Republican George Deukmejian, who had the backing of the state's growers; under Deukmejian, the ALRB's influence eroded. In 1987, the UFW was found liable for $1.7 million in damages to the Maggio company for the illegal actions that the union carried out against it during their 1979 strike. As the UFW's boycott of Bruce Church products failed to gain traction, in July 1988 Chavez launched another public fast at Forty Acres. Three of Robert Kennedy's children visited, generating media attention for the fast. After 19 days, Chavez broke the fast at a ceremony attended by the Democratic politician Jesse Jackson. The fast was followed by further purges at La Paz as Chavez accused more people of being saboteurs. Hartmire was among those pushed out, resigning in January 1989. Some of those at La Paz left before Chavez could target them, and the commune became increasingly depopulated. Chavez meanwhile continued to receive awards and honors. In November 1989, the Mexican government awarded him the Order of the Aztec Eagle, during which he had a private audience with Mexican President Carlos Salinas. In October 1990, Coachella became the first district to name a school after Chavez; he attended the dedication ceremony.\nWith membership dues declining, the UFW increasingly turned to commercial activities as a means of raising funds. It began marketing UFW branded merchandise through El Taller Grafico Speciality Advertising (ETG), which had Chavez as its chair. Chavez also set himself up as a housing developer, working in partnership with the Fresno businessman Celestino Aguilar. Together they bought properties undergoing foreclosure, renovated them, before selling them on. They ultimately moved from foreclosures to high-end custom built houses and subsidized apartment blocks. To conceal the UFW's involvement in these projects, Chavez and Aguilar formed the company American Liberty Investments. They also established the Ideal Minimart Corporation, which built two strip malls and operated a check-cashing store. Richard's company, Bonita Construction, was hired for some of the work. The \"Fresno Bee\" subsequently reported that most of the UFW's housing projects had been built by non-union contractors. The trade unions representing the building unions expressed outrage at the news, highlighting that they had previously given financial support to the UFW. \"The New Yorker\" later termed the incident an \"embarrassment\".\nFinal years: 1990\u20131993.\nIn the early 1990s, the UFW continued to market Chavez as a heroic figure, especially on university and college campuses. In 1990, he appeared at 64 events, earning an average of $3,800 for each appearance. In 1991, he launched a \"Public Action Speaking Tour\" of U.S. colleges and universities. His standard speech at these events covered the problems facing farmworkers, the dangers of pesticides, the alliance of agribusiness and the Republican Party, and his view that boycotts and marches were a better means of achieving change than electoral politics.\nChavez's mother died in December 1991, aged 99. The following year, in September 1992, Chavez's mentor Ross died. Chavez gave the eulogy at his funeral. Chavez's final years saw the UFW's involvement in a legal battle with Bruce Church. The company had sued the union, claiming it libeled them and had illegally threatened supermarkets to stop them selling Red Coach lettuce. In 1988, a jury returned a $5.4 million verdict against the UFW, but this verdict was thrown out in the appeals court. The case was then remanded for trial on narrower grounds. Chavez was called to testify in front of a Yuma court in 1993. The stakes were high; a verdict against the UFW would have been financially devastating.\nDuring the case, Chavez stayed at the home of a San Luis supporter. It was there that he died in bed on April 23. He was aged 66. Chavez's body was flown to Bakersfield aboard a chartered plane. The autopsy proved inconclusive, with the family stating that he had died of natural causes. Chavez had already stipulated that he wanted his brother Richard to build his coffin, and that his funeral should take place at Forty Acres. There, his body lay in state, where tens of thousands of people visited it. A funeral procession took place in Delano, with 120 pallbearers taking turns to carry the coffin. Chavez was then buried in a private ceremony at La Paz.\nPersonal life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe union's survival, its very existence, sent out a signal to all Hispanics that we were fighting for our dignity. That we were challenging and overcoming injustice, that we were empowering the least educated among us, the poorest among us. The message was clear. If it could happen in the fields, it could happen anywhere: in the cities, in the courts, in the city councils, in the state legislatures. I didn't really appreciate it at the time, but the coming of our union signalled the start of great changes among Hispanics that are now only beginning to be seen.\n\u2014 Cesar Chavez, 1984\nWhen Chavez returned home from his service in the military in 1948, he married his high school sweetheart, Helen Fabela. The couple moved to San Jose, California. With his wife, he had eight children: Fernando (b.1949), Sylvia (b.1950), Linda (b.1951), Eloise (b.1952), Anna (b.1953), Paul (b.1957), Elizabeth (b.1958), and Anthony (b.1958). Helen avoided the limelight, a trait which Chavez admired. While he led the union, she focused on raising the children, cooking, and housekeeping. During the latter part of the 1970s, his infidelity with a range of women became common knowledge among senior UFW figures, who kept this knowledge quiet so as not to damage his reputation as a devoted Catholic family man. After Helen read a love letter written to Chavez by another woman, she temporarily left La Paz and lived with one of her daughters in Delano. Chavez's children resented the union and displayed little interest in it, although most ended up working for it. Of these children, Chavez's eldest son, Fernando, was the only one to graduate from college; Chavez's relationship with Fernando was strained, as he was frustrated with what he saw as his son's interest in becoming middle-class.\nChavez expressed traditional views on gender roles and was little influenced by the second wave feminism that was contemporary with his activism. In his movement, men took almost all the senior roles, with women largely being confined to background roles as secretaries, nurses, or in child-care; the main exception was Huerta. Chavez had a close working relationship with Huerta. They became mutually dependent, and although she did not hesitate to raise complaints with him, she also usually deferred to him. During their working relationship, they often argued, something which intensified in the latter part of the 1970s. Huerta stated that she was Chavez's \"whipping girl\" when he was under pressure. He never had close friendships outside of his family, believing that friendships distracted from his political activism.\nPhysically, Chavez was short, and had jet black hair. He was quiet, and Bruns described him as being \"outwardly shy and unimposing\". Like many farm laborers, he experienced severe back pain throughout his life. He could be self-conscious about his lack of formal education and was uncomfortable interacting with affluent people. When speaking with reporters, he sometimes mythologized his own life story.\nChavez was not a great orator; according to Pawel, \"his power lay not in words, but in actions\". She noted that he was \"not an articulate speaker\", and similarly, Bruns observed that he \"had no special talent as a public speaker\". He was soft-spoken, and according to Pawel had an \"informal, conversational style\", and was \"good at reading people\". He was unwilling to delegate or trust others. He preferred to tackle every task personally. He was also capable of responding quickly and decisively to events.\nBruns described Chavez as combining a \"remarkable tenacity with a sense of serenity\". A tireless worker, he was known for often working 18 hours a day; he used to start his working day at 3:30am and would often continue working until 10pm. He stated that \"I just sleep and eat and work. I do nothing else.\" Pawel stated that as a leader, Chavez was both \"charming, attentive, and humble\" as well as being \"single-minded, demanding, and ruthless\". When he wanted to criticize one of his volunteers or staff members he usually did so in private but on occasion could berate them in a public confrontation.\nHe described his own life's work as a crusade against injustice, and displayed a commitment to self-sacrifice. Pawel thought that \"Chavez thrived on the power to help people and the way that made him feel\". Ross, who was a friend and colleague of Chavez's for many years, noted that \"He would do in thirty minutes what it would take me or somebody else thirty days\". Pawel noted that Chavez was \"openly ruthless\" in his \"drive to be the one and only farm labor leader\". He was stubborn and would rarely back down once he had taken a stance. He would not accept criticism of himself, but would deflect it.\nChavez was a Catholic whose faith strongly influenced both his social activism and his personal outlook. He rarely missed Mass and liked to open all of his meetings with either a Mass or a prayer. Privately, he also liked to meditate. In 1970, he became a vegetarian, stating that \"I wouldn't eat my dog, you know. Cows and dogs are about the same.\" As part of this diet he also shunned most dairy products except cottage cheese. He credited this diet with easing his chronic back pain. He also avoided eating processed foods. Among his favorite foods were traditional Mexican and Chinese cuisines.\nChavez had a love of the music of Duke Ellington and big band music; he enjoyed dancing. He was also an amateur photographer, and a keen gardener, making his own compost and growing vegetables. For much of his adult life he kept German shepherd dogs for personal protection; two of those he kept at La Paz were named Boycott and Huelga. Chavez preserved many of his notes, letters, the minutes of meetings, as well as tape recordings of many interviewers, and at the encouragement of Philip P. Mason donated these to the Walter P. Reuther Library, where they are kept. He disliked telephone conversations, suspecting that his phone line was bugged. He tended to see problems faced by his movement not as evidence of innocent mistakes but as deliberate sabotage.\nChavez was self-educated, with Pawel noting that he was \"disinclined to analyze information\". Once Chavez accepted an idea, he could dedicate himself to it wholeheartedly.\nPolitical views.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe men and women who have suffered and endured much and not only because of our abject poverty but because we have been kept poor. The color of our skins, the languages of our cultural and native origins, the lack of formal education, the exclusion from the democratic process, the numbers of our slain in recent wars \u2014 all these burdens generation after generation have sought to demoralize us, to break our human spirit. But God knows we are not beasts of burden, we are not agricultural implements or rented slaves, we are men. And mark this well [..] we are men locked in a death struggle against man's inhumanity to man in the industry you represent. And this struggle itself gives meaning to our life and ennobles our dying.\n\u2014 Cesar Chavez's open letter to the grape industry amid the Grape Strike\nChavez described his movement as promoting \"a Christian radical philosophy\".\nAccording to Chavez biographer Roger Bruns, he \"focused the movement on the ethnic identity of Mexican Americans\" and on a \"quest for justice rooted in Catholic social teaching\". Chavez saw his fight for farmworkers' rights as a symbol for the broader cultural and ethnic struggle for Mexican Americans in the United States.\nChavez utilized a range of tactics drawing on Roman Catholic religion, including vigils, public prayers, a shrine on the back of his station wagon, and references to dead farmworkers as \"martyrs\". His point in doing so was not necessarily to proselytize, but to use the socio-political potential of Christianity for his own campaigns. Most of the farmworkers his union represented shared his Roman Catholicism and were happy to incorporate its religious practices into their marches, strikes, and other UFW activities. Chavez called on his fellow Roman Catholics to be more consistent in standing up for the religion's values. He stated that \"in a nutshell, what do we want the Church to do? We don't ask for more cathedrals. We don't ask for bigger churches or fine gifts. We ask for its presence with us, beside us, as Christ among us. We ask the Church to sacrifice with the people for social change, for justice, and for love of brother.\" Ospino stated that \"The combination of labor organizing strategies with explicit expressions of Catholic religiosity made Chavez's approach unique\" within the U.S. labor movement, although some of his associates, non-Catholics, and other parts of the labor movement were critical of his use of Catholic elements.\nChavez abhorred poverty, regarding it as dehumanizing, and wanted to ensure a better standard of living for the poor. He was frustrated that most farmworkers appeared more interested in money and did not appreciate the values that he espoused. He was concerned that, as he had seen with the CSO, individuals moving out of poverty often adopted middle-class values; he viewed the middle classes with contempt. He recognized that union activity was not a long-term solution to poverty across society and suggested that forming co-operatives therefore might be the best solution. In Chavez's view, workers' cooperatives offered a middle ground economic choice between the failed system of capitalism and the state socialism of Marxist-Leninist countries. His son Paul recalls \"My father's basic premise was that capitalism was not going to work because it was too harsh and always took advantage of those least able to defend themselves\". He also embraced ideals about communal living, and saw the La Paz commune he established in California as a model for others to follow.\nChavez kept a large portrait of Gandhi in his office, alongside another of Martin Luther King and busts of both John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln. Influenced by the ideas of Gandhi and King, Chavez emphasized non-violent confrontation as a tactic. He repeatedly referred to himself as the leader of the \"non-violent Viet Cong\", a reference to the Vietnamese Marxist-Leninist militia that the U.S. was combating in the Vietnam War. He was interested not only in Gandhi's ideas on non-violence but also in the Indian's voluntary embrace of poverty, his use of fasting, and his ideas about community. Fasting was important for Chavez. He saw it not as a tactic to pressure his opponents, but rather to motivate his supporters, keeping them focused on the cause and on avoiding violence. He also saw it as a sign of solidarity with the suffering of the people. Chavez was also interested in Gandhi's ideas about sacrifice, noting that \"I like the idea of sacrifice to do things. If they are done that way they are more lasting. If they cost more, then you will value them more.\"\nApart from Catholic social teaching, the movement of Chavez was also based on liberation theology, emphasizing liberation of the poor and self-sacrifice in the pursuit of justice. Liberation theology sought to centralize Catholic faith on the perspective and plight of the excluded, marginalized, poor and oppressed; basic points of liberation theology was the belief that God speaks directly for and to the poor, and that socioeconomic systems that oppress the poor are morally unacceptable. Gustavo Gutierrez, who provided much of the theoretical basis for liberation theology, stated that the \"theology of liberation represents the right of the poor to think\". Frederick John Dalton argues that Chavez was the reflection of liberation theology, writing: \"The moral vision of Cesar Chavez is the moral vision of a Mexican-American migrant farm worker and labor organizer with no formal education beyond the eighth grade. It is the moral vision of a man who knew the indignities of being impoverished and excluded. A field laborer of Mexican descent, he experienced life as a nonperson, as little more than an agricultural implement, a cost to be minimized.\" Similarly, Mark R. Day, a member of UFW, remarked that \"in many ways we were practicing liberation theology in Delano in the late 1960s.\"\nMany of the UFW's protests have been interpreted as representing not only farmworkers but the Mexican-American community more broadly, making a statement that Anglo-Americans must recognize Mexican-Americans as \"legitimate players in American life\". Chavez saw parallels in the way that African Americans were treated in the United States to the way that he and his fellow Mexican Americans were treated. He absorbed many of the tactics that African American civil rights activists had employed throughout the 1960s, applying them to his own movement. He was willing to take risks. Chavez recognized the impact that his farm-worker campaigns had had on the Chicano Movement during the early 1970s, although he kept his distance from the latter movement and many of its leaders. He condemned the violence that some figures in the Chicano Movement espoused.\nOn organization and leadership.\nChavez placed the success of the movement above all else; Pawel described him as \"the ultimate pragmatist\". He felt that he had to be both the leader and the organizer-in-chief of his movement because only he had the necessary commitment to the cause. He was interested in power and how to use it; although his role model in this was Gandhi, he also studied the ideas about power by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Adolf Hitler, and Mao Zedong, drawing ideas from each. His use of purges to expel people from his movement was influenced by Mao's Cultural Revolution, and he opened a June 1978 board meeting by reciting a poem by Mao. Chavez repeatedly referred to himself as a community organizer rather than as a labor leader and underscored that distinction. He wanted his organization to represent not just a union but a larger social movement. He was ambivalent about the national labor movement. He personally disliked many of the prominent figures within the American labor movement but, as a pragmatist, recognized the value of working with organized labor groups. He opposed the idea of paying wages to those who worked for the union, believing that it would destroy the spirit of the movement. He rarely fired people from their positions, but instead made their working situation uncomfortable so that they would resign.\nChavez's leadership style was authoritarian; he stated that when he launched his movement, he initially had \"total, absolute power\" over it. Bruns characterized the UFW under Chavez as an \"autocratic regime\". Ex-members of the group, such as Bustamante and Padilla described Chavez as a dictator within the union. Chavez felt unable to share the responsibilities of running his movement with others. In 1968, Fred Hirsch noted that \"one thing which characterizes Cesar's leadership is that he takes full responsibility for as much of the operation as he is physically capable of. All decisions are made by him.\" Itliong noted that \"Cesar is afraid that if he shares the authority with the people [...] they might run away from him.\" Pawel noted that Chavez wanted \"yes-men\" around him. He divided members of movements such as his into three groups: those that achieved what they set out to do, those that worked hard but failed what they set out to do, and those that were lazy. He thought that the latter needed to be expelled from the movement. He highly valued individuals who were loyal, efficient, and took the initiative. Explaining his attitudes toward activism, he told his volunteers that \"nice guys throughout the ages have done very little for humanity. It isn't the nice guy who gets things done. It's the hardheaded guy.\" He admitted that he could be \"a real bastard\" when dealing with movement members; Chavez told UFW volunteers that \"I'm a son of a bitch to work with.\" He would play different people against each other to get what he wanted, particularly to break apart allies who might form an independent power bloc that would threaten his domination of the movement.\nReception and legacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[Chavez's] dream was to found a labor union of farmworkers. He had no money, no political connections, and no experience. He was not a particularly dynamic personality and had no special talent as a public speaker. The dream, he knew, was almost fanciful. Nevertheless, through determination, grit, and a dogged will to win, he forged a movement that successfully challenged powerful entrenched economic and political interests and helped thousands of Mexican Americans to new cultural self-awareness.\n\u2014 Roger Bruns, 2005\nIn the popular imagination, Chavez and the movement he led became largely synonymous, although throughout his career, Chavez prompted strong reactions from others. Since his death, there has been a struggle to define his legacy.\nDuring his lifetime, many of Chavez's supporters idolized him, engaging in a form of hero worship. Bruns noted that many of his supporters \"nearly worshipped him as a folk hero\". In 1982, the American country music singer Kris Kristofferson called Chavez \"the only true hero we have walking on this Earth today.\" These supporters were known as \"Chavistas\"; many of them, especially those living at the La Paz commune, emulated his vegetarian diet. By the 1970s, he was increasingly referred to as a \"saint\" among those who supported him. In response to these claims, Chavez insisted that \"There is a big difference between being a saint and being an angel[...] Saints are known for being tough and stubborn.\" In 1972, John Zerzan described Chavez as presenting himself as \"a Christ-figure sacrificing all for his flock\" through his fasts, adding that Chavez took the form of a \"messianic leader\". The scholar of Latino studies Lilia Soto called him and Huerta \"freedom fighters\". He received a range of awards and accolades, which he claimed to hate. For these supporters, his visions for the future were regarded as inspirational. Bruns noted that he had \"a mesmerizing effect on the lives of thousands. They saw in him nobility, sacrifice, and the grit of the underdog who refuses to give up.\" Throughout his career as an activist, he received strong ecumenical support. The UFW gained the support of mainline Protestant groups in a way that previous farmworker movements never had.\nChavez was despised by many growers. John Giumarra Jr, of the Giumarra company, called Chavez a \"New Left guerrilla\", someone who wanted to topple \"the established structure of American democracy\". The FBI monitored him and many other senior figures in his movement, concerned that they were subversive. Having monitored him for over a decade, the FBI's dossier on Chavez grew to over 1,500 pages in length. They ultimately found no evidence suggesting he had communist leanings. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he received a series of death threats, and\u2014according to Bruns\u2014he often faced \"spiteful mobs and scurrilous race-baiting\".\nWithin Chavez's movement itself, there was concern and criticism of his methods. It the early 1970s, for instance, Chavez-supporter George Higgins wrote a private memo arguing that Chavez \"appealed very crassly\" to feelings of guilt among many \"Protestant social actionists\" and threatened them \"with the enmity of the poor\" if they failed to meet with Chavez's demands. Many ex-members of the UFW took the view that Chavez had been a poor administrator. Other labor unions had long been wary of Chavez's movement, with the UFW gaining a reputation for always wanting money but doing little to assist others. In the U.S. union movement, many skeptics believed that Chavez's idealism detracted from his effectiveness as a union leader. Paul Hall of the Seafarers International Union of North America met him in Washington, D.C., during the 1970s, at which he criticized Chavez for acting like a saint rather than a union leader, stating that he had become \"a fad \u2013 the poor man others can support to expiate their sins.\" Some Mexican-Americans were critical of Chavez, believing him an agitator and trouble-maker who was insufficiently patriotic in his views of the United States. Some critics believed that Chavez's activism was mobilized largely by the desire for personal gain and ambition.\nBruns noted that Chavez's movement was \"part of the fervor of change [in the United States] of the late 1960s\", alongside the civil rights movement and the campaign against the Vietnam War. The historian Ronald A. Wells described Chavez as \"one of the most important Christian activists in our time,\" while the theologian Hosffman Ospino called him \"one of the most influential social leaders in the history of the United States\". Pawel referred to Chavez as \"an improbable idol in an era of telegenic leaders and charismatic speakers\". The historian Nelson Lichtenstein commented that Chavez's UFW oversaw \"the largest and most effective boycott [in the United States] since the colonists threw tea into Boston Harbor\". Lichtenstein also stated that Chavez had become \"an iconic, foundational figure in the political, cultural, and moral history\" of the Latino American community. Many Latinos drew inspiration from his movement, including student activists \u2013 for instance, UCSC's Cesar Chavez Convocation. He has been described as a \"folk saint\" of the Mexican-American community. A poll conducted by the \"Los Angeles Times\" in 1983 found that Chavez was the Latino whom the Latinos of California most admired.\nThe scholar Steven Lloyd-Moffett argued that after Chavez's death, the \"liberal intelligentsia and Chicano activists\" came to dominate attempts to define his legacy and that they downplayed his firm commitment to Christianity so as to portray him as being motivated by \"a secular ideology of justice and non-violence\". When the Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama was campaigning for the presidency in 2008, he used \"S\u00ed se puede\"\u2014translated into English as \"Yes we can\"\u2014as one of his main campaign slogans. When Obama was seeking re-election in 2012, he visited Chavez's grave and placed a rose upon it, also declaring his Union Headquarters to be a national monument. Chavez's work has continued to exert influence on later activists. For instance, in his 2012 article in the \"Journal of the Society of Christian Ethics\", Kevin J. O'Brien argued that Chavez could be \"a vital resource for contemporary Christian ecological ethics\". O'Brien argued that it was both Chavez's focus on \"the moral centrality of human dignity\" as well as his emphasis on sacrifice that could be of use by Christians wanting to engage in environmentalist activism. The theologian Carlos R. Piar similarly stated that Hispanic people should look to Chavez as an exemplar for \"a way of being Christian in the United States.\"\nOrders, decorations, monuments, and honors.\nChavez received a range of awards, both during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1973, he received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, and in 1992 the \"Pacem in Terris\" Award, a Catholic award meant to honor \"achievements in peace and justice\". In August 1994, Chavez was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest honor for non-military personnel, by Democratic President Bill Clinton. Chavez's widow collected it from the White House. Clinton stated that Chavez had been a \"remarkable man\" and that \"he was for his own people a Moses figure.\" In 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger inducted Chavez into the California Hall of Fame. Asteroid 6982 Cesarchavez, discovered by Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory in 1993, was named in his memory; the official was published by the Minor Planet Center on August 27, 2019 (M.P.C. 115893). In March 2013, Google celebrated his 86th birthday with a Google Doodle.\nThe Reuther-Chavez Award was created in 2002 by Americans for Democratic Action \"to recognize important activist, scholarly and journalistic contributions on behalf of workers' rights, especially the right to unionize and bargain collectively.\" Colegio Cesar Chavez, named after Chavez while he was still alive, was a four-year \"college without walls\" in Mount Angel, Oregon, intended for the education of Mexican-Americans, that ran from 1973 to 1983. On May 18, 2011, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced that the Navy would be naming the last of 14 Lewis and Clark-class cargo ships after Cesar Chavez. The USNS \"Cesar Chavez\" was launched on May 5, 2012.\nIn 2004, the National Chavez Center was opened on the UFW national headquarters campus in Keene by the C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Foundation. It currently consists of a visitor center, memorial garden and his grave site. When it is fully completed, the site will include a museum and conference center to explore and share Chavez's work. On September 14, 2011, the U.S. Department of the Interior added the Nuestra Senora Reina de La Paz ranch to the National Register of Historic Places. On October 8, 2012, President Barack Obama designated the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument within the National Park system. California State University San Marcos' Chavez Plaza includes a statue to Chavez. In 2007, The University of Texas at Austin unveiled its own Cesar Chavez statue on campus. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 authorized the National Park Service to conduct a special resource study of sites that are significant to the life of Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement in the western United States. The study evaluated the significance and suitability of sites significant to Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement, and the feasibility and appropriateness of a National Park Service role in the management of any of these sites.\nCesar Chavez's birthday, March 31, is a holiday in California, Denver (Colorado), and Texas. It is intended to promote community service in honor of Chavez's life and work. Many, but not all, state government offices, community colleges, and libraries are closed. Many public schools in the three states are also closed. Chavez Day is an optional holiday in Arizona. Although it is not a federal holiday, President Barack Obama proclaimed March 31 \"Cesar Chavez Day\" in the United States, with Americans being urged to \"observe this day with appropriate service, community, and educational programs to honor C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez's enduring legacy\". The heavily Hispanic city of Laredo, Texas, observes \"Cesar Chavez Month\" during March. Organized by the local League of United Latin American Citizens, a citizens' march is held in downtown Laredo on the last Saturday morning of March to commemorate Chavez. In the Mission District, San Francisco a \"Cesar Chavez Holiday Parade\" is held on the second weekend of April, in honor of Cesar Chavez.\nChavez was referenced by Stevie Wonder in the song \"Black Man\" from the 1976 album \"Songs in the Key of Life\". The 2014 American film \"C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez\", starring Michael Pe\u00f1a as Chavez, covered Chavez's life in the 1960s and early 1970s. That same year, a documentary film, titled \"Cesar's Last Fast\", was released. He received belated full military honors from the U.S. Navy at his graveside on April 23, 2015, the 22nd anniversary of his death. In 2015, statues of Chavez and Huerta were erected above a pizzeria in Downtown Napa, financed by a wealthy private citizen, Michael Holcomb, rather than city authorities.\nThere is a portrait of Chavez in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. In 2003, the United States Postal Service honored Chavez with a postage stamp. A three-dimensional mural by artist Johanna Poethig, \"Tiene la lumbre por dentro\" (He Has the Fire Within Him) (2000) at Sonoma State University, honors Chavez and the Farm Workers Movement. The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) nominated him three times for the Nobel Peace Prize.\nAt the start of the presidency of Joe Biden, a bust of Chavez was placed on a table directly behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is the recipient of many accolades, including an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and a BAFTA Award.\nHer career began in the early 1960s on Broadway. She made her screen debut in 1967 in \"The Happening\", the same year she made \"Hurry Sundown\" with an all-star cast, and rose to fame with her portrayal of outlaw Bonnie Parker in Arthur Penn's \"Bonnie and Clyde\", for which she received her first Academy Award nomination. Her most notable films include the crime caper \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" (1968), the romantic drama \"The Arrangement\" (1969), the revisionist Western \"Little Big Man\" (1970), a two-part adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas classic \"The Three Musketeers\" (1973, with \"The Four Musketeers\" following in 1974), the neo-noir mystery \"Chinatown\" (1974) for which she earned her second Oscar nomination, the action-drama disaster \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974), the political thriller \"Three Days of the Condor\" (1975), the satire \"Network\" (1976) for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress, the thriller \"Eyes of Laura Mars\" (1978), and the sports drama \"The Champ\" (1979).\nHer career evolved to more mature character roles in subsequent years, often in independent features, beginning with her controversial portrayal of Joan Crawford in the 1981 biopic \"Mommie Dearest\". Her later films include \"Supergirl\" (1984), \"Barfly\" (1987), \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (1990), \"Arizona Dream\" (1994), \"Don Juan DeMarco\" (1995), \"The Twilight of the Golds\" (1997), \"Gia\" (1998) and \"The Rules of Attraction\" (2002). Dunaway has also performed on stage in several plays, including \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1961\u201363), \"After the Fall\" (1964), \"Hogan's Goat\" (1965\u201367), and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1973). She was awarded the Sarah Siddons Award for her portrayal of opera singer Maria Callas in \"Master Class\" (1996).\nProtective of her private life, she rarely gives interviews and makes very few public appearances. After romantic relationships with Jerry Schatzberg and Marcello Mastroianni, Dunaway married twice, first to singer Peter Wolf and then to photographer Terry O'Neill, with whom she had a son, Liam.\nEarly life and education.\nDunaway was born in Bascom, Florida, the daughter of Grace April (n\u00e9e Smith), a housewife, and John MacDowell Dunaway Jr., a career non-commissioned officer in the United States Army. Her parents married as teenagers in 1939 and they divorced in 1955. She has a younger brother, lawyer Mac Simmion Dunaway. She is of Ulster Scottish, Irish, and German descent. She spent her childhood traveling throughout the United States and Europe, including lengthy stays in Mannheim, Germany, and Dugway Proving Ground, Utah.\nDunaway took ballet, tap, piano, and singing lessons while she was growing up and she graduated from Leon High School in Tallahassee, Florida. She then studied at Florida State University and the University of Florida. Later, she graduated from Boston University with a degree in theatre. \nShe spent the summer before her senior year in a summer-stock company at Harvard's Loeb Drama Center, where one of her co-players was Jane Alexander, an actress and future head of the National Endowment for the Arts. During her senior year, she worked with director Lloyd Richards on a BU production of a new version of \"The Crucible\", where Arthur Miller saw her perform. Following graduation in 1962, at the age of 21, she took acting classes at the American National Theater and Academy, and was recommended to director Elia Kazan, who was in search of young talent for his Lincoln Center Repertory Company. She also studied acting at HB Studio in New York City.\nShortly after she graduated from Boston University, Dunaway appeared on Broadway as a replacement in Robert Bolt's drama \"A Man for All Seasons\". She subsequently appeared in Arthur Miller's \"After the Fall\" and the award-winning \"Hogan's Goat\" by Harvard professor William Alfred, who became her mentor and spiritual advisor. In her 1995 autobiography, Dunaway said of him: \"With the exception of my mother, my brother, and my beloved son, Bill Alfred has been without question the most important single figure in my lifetime. A teacher, a mentor, and I suppose the father I never had, the parent and companion I would always have wanted, if that choice had been mine. He has taught me so much about the virtue of a simple life, about spirituality, about the purity of real beauty, and how to go at this messy business of life.\"\nCareer.\n1967\u20131968: Early films and breakthrough.\nDunaway's first screen role was in the comedy crime film \"The Happening\" (1967), which starred Anthony Quinn. Her performance earned her good notices from critics; however, Roger Ebert of \"The Chicago Sun-Times\" panned the performance, saying that she \"exhibits a real neat trick of resting her cheek on the back of her hand.\" That same year, she had a supporting role in Otto Preminger's drama \"Hurry Sundown\", opposite Michael Caine and Jane Fonda. Filming proved to be difficult for Dunaway, as she clashed with Preminger, who she felt did not know \"anything at all about the process of acting.\" She later described this experience as a \"psychodrama that left me feeling damaged at the end of each day.\" Dunaway had signed a six-picture deal with Preminger, but decided during the filming to get her contract back. \"As much as it cost me to get out of the deal with Otto, if I'd had to do those movies with him, then I wouldn't have done \"Bonnie and Clyde\", or \"The Thomas Crown Affair\", or any of the movies I was suddenly in a position to choose to do. Beyond the movies I might have missed, it would have been a kind of Chinese water torture to have been stuck in five more terrible movies. It's impossible to assess the damage that might have done to me that early on in my career.\" Preminger's film did not meet critical or box office success, but Dunaway retained notice enough to earn a Golden Globe Award nomination for New Star of the Year.\nDunaway had tried to get an interview with director Arthur Penn when he was directing \"The Chase\" (1966), but was rebuffed by a casting director who did not think that she had the right face for the movies. When Penn saw her scenes from \"The Happening\" before its release, he decided to let her read for the role of the bank robber Bonnie Parker for his upcoming film, \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967). Casting for the role of Bonnie had proved to be difficult, and many actresses had been considered for the role, including Jane Fonda, Tuesday Weld, Ann-Margret, Carol Lynley, Leslie Caron, and Natalie Wood. Penn loved Dunaway and managed to convince actor and producer Warren Beatty, who played Clyde Barrow in the film, that she was right for the part. Besides Dunaway's being a comparative unknown, Beatty's concern was her \"extraordinary bone structure,\" which he thought might be inappropriate for Bonnie Parker, a local girl trying to look innocent while she held up small-town Texas banks. He changed his mind, though, after seeing some photographs of Dunaway taken by Curtis Hanson on the beach: \"She could hit the ball across the net, and she had an intelligence and a strength that made her both powerful and romantic.\" Dunaway only had a few weeks to prepare for the role, and when she was asked to lose weight to give her character a Depression-era look, she went on a starvation diet, stopped eating, and dropped .\nThe film was controversial on its original release for its supposed glorification of murderers and level of graphic violence, which was unprecedented at the time. It performed well at the box office and elevated Dunaway to stardom. Roger Ebert gave the film a rave review and wrote, \"The performances throughout are flawless. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, in the title roles, surpass anything they have done on the screen before, and establish themselves (somewhat to my surprise) as major actors.\" The film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and Dunaway received her first nomination for Best Actress. Her performance earned her a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer and a David di Donatello for Best Foreign Actress, and she was now among the most bankable actresses in Hollywood, as she later recalled. \"It put me firmly in the ranks of actresses that would do work that was art. There are those who elevate the craft of acting to the art of acting, and now I would be among them. I was the golden girl at that time. One of those women who was going to be nominated year after year for an Oscar and would win at least one. The movie established the quality of my work. \"Bonnie and Clyde\" would also turn me into a star.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That movie touched the core of my being. Never have I felt so close to a character as I felt to Bonnie. She was a yearning, edgy, ambitious southern girl who wanted to get out of wherever she was. I knew everything about wanting to get out, and the getting out doesn't come easy. But with Bonnie there was a real tragic irony. She got out only to see that she was heading nowhere and that the end was death.\u2014\u200a\nDunaway followed the success with another hit, \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" (1968), in which she played Vicki Anderson, an insurance investigator who becomes involved with Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen), a millionaire who attempts to pull off the perfect crime. Norman Jewison hired Dunaway after he saw scenes from \"Bonnie and Clyde\" before its release. As Arthur Penn had needed to persuade Warren Beatty to cast Dunaway, Jewison had to convince McQueen that she was right for the part. The film emphasized Dunaway's sensuality and elegance with a character who has remained an influential style icon. The role was complex requiring over 29 costume changes. \"Vicki's dilemma was, at the time, a newly emerging phenomenon for women: How does one do all of this in a man's world and not sacrifice one's emotional and personal life in the process?\" Despite his original reluctance to work with her, McQueen later called Dunaway the best actress he ever worked with. Dunaway was also very fond of McQueen. \"It was really my first time to play opposite someone who was a great big old movie star, and that's exactly what Steve was. He was one of the best-loved actors around, one whose talent more than equaled his sizable commercial appeal.\" The film was immensely popular and was famed for a scene where Dunaway and McQueen play a chess game and silently engage in a seduction of each other across the board.\n1969\u20131973: Career setbacks.\nFollowing the completion of \"The Thomas Crown Affair\", Dunaway leapfrogged France's new wave directors to begin filming in Italy Vittorio de Sica's romantic drama, \"A Place for Lovers\" (1968). This film was with Marcello Mastroianni, in which she played a terminally ill American fashion designer in Venice who has a whirlwind affair with a race-car driver. Although Dunaway had always wanted to avoid romances with her co-stars, she began a love affair with Mastroianni that lasted for two years. The film was an artistic disappointment and a commercial failure. In 1969, Dunaway appeared in \"The Arrangement\", a drama directed by Elia Kazan, based upon his novel of the same title, opposite Kirk Douglas. The film did poorly at the box office, receiving mostly negative reviews, although Dunaway was praised, with Roger Ebert writing that her acting \"is not only the equal of in \"Bonnie and Clyde\", but is, indeed, the only good acting she has done since\". Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote that she was \"looking so cool and elegant that the sight of her almost pinches the optic nerves\". Also in 1969, \"The Extraordinary Seaman\", a comedy adventure directed by John Frankenheimer and also starring David Niven that she shot right after \"Bonnie and Clyde\", was released to poor reviews and proved to be a commercial failure. Despite protests from her agent, Dunaway turned down many high-profile projects to spend time with Mastroianni.\nIn 1969, Dunaway took a supporting role as a favor to Arthur Penn in his Western, \"Little Big Man\". In a rare comic role, Dunaway played the sexually repressed wife of a minister who helps raise and seduce a boy raised by Native Americans, played by Dustin Hoffman. The film was widely praised by critics and was one of Dunaway's few commercial successes at this point. That same year, she appeared in the lead role in \"Puzzle of a Downfall Child\" (1970), an experimental drama directed by Jerry Schatzberg and inspired by the life of model Anne St. Marie. The film failed to generate commercial interest, though it earned for Dunaway a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama. The film remained in obscurity over 40 years, until it was revived at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival in honor of Dunaway. Involved in domestic issues in Italy with Mastroianni, after some months away from the industry, she finally found her next role in the Western \"Doc\" (1971), which tells the story of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and of one of its protagonists, Doc Holliday. During the filming, Dunaway realized how much she had missed working. That same year, she went on to make the French thriller \"The Deadly Trap\" with her Lincoln Center compatriot Frank Langella. Rather than working with a director from the already crested new wave, Jean-Luc Godard, who had originally made contributions to the first script of \"Bonnie and Clyde\", she worked with the French postwar director, who was held in the highest respect, Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment. Only five months after the first day of shooting, the film was screened at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival but was not entered into the main competition.\nNeither \"Doc\" nor \"The Deadly Trap\" had generated much attention, either critically or financially, so Dunaway accepted an offer to star in a movie for television, \"The Woman I Love\" (1972), in which she portrayed Wallis Simpson. She returned to film in 1973 with Stanley Kramer's drama, \"Oklahoma Crude\", opposite George C. Scott. It was an ambitious project in which Dunaway had to play another complex character, \"a woman who is caught between her ambition and her femininity. When the film opens, she is as tough as nails, a shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later woman. Along the way, she slowly opens herself up to her estranged father and a lover. I understood that dilemma well, the conflict between ambition and love, the fear of trusting someone else with your love.\" The film was a modest success, but Dunaway received good notices for her performance. In his review of the film, Roger Ebert noted how she had never topped the work she did in \"Bonnie and Clyde\", and said that her career had been \"rather absentminded\" ever since. He praised her performance in \"Oklahoma Crude\", saying that she played the role with \"a great deal of style,\" while adding, \"Perhaps she has decided to get back to acting.\"\nIn 1972, following the filming of \"Oklahoma Crude\", Dunaway returned to the stage in an adaptation of Harold Pinter's \"Old Times\". She found the stage more challenging than film. \"\"Old Times\" affected me in a lot of very complex ways. The play itself reminded me during a difficult point in my life that there are a million facets to life. There is never just one answer. Professionally, if I hadn't taken that step to go back to the stage, in a serious way, I think I would have suffered for it.\" The following year, Dunaway portrayed Blanche DuBois in a Los Angeles stage production of Tennessee Williams's \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". \"It was a fun performance for me, but hard, very draining. At the height of the madness each night, I would go from standing straight up to falling to my knees, in one swift move.\" Williams himself praised Dunaway for her performance, \"He told me later that he thought I was brave and adorable and reminded him of a precocious child, and that my performance ranked with the very best. It was high praise indeed coming from him.\" Also in 1973, Dunaway appeared as the villainous Milady de Winter in Richard Lester's \"The Three Musketeers\", based on Alexandre Dumas' novel of the same name, co-starring Michael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, and Charlton Heston. Eventually, producers decided to split the film into two parts: \"The Three Musketeers\" and \"The Four Musketeers\" (released in 1974). Critics and audiences alike praised the film for its action and its comic tone, and it was the first in a line of successful projects for Dunaway.\n1974\u20131981: Resurgence and acclaim.\nDirector Roman Polanski offered Dunaway the lead role of Evelyn Mulwray in his mystery neo-noir \"Chinatown\" (1974). Although its producer, Robert Evans, wanted Polanski to consider Jane Fonda for the role, arguing that Dunaway had a reputation for temperament, Polanski insisted on using Dunaway. She accepted the challenging and complex role of Mulwray, a shadowy \"femme fatale\" who knows more than she is willing to let Detective J.J. Gittes (played by Jack Nicholson) know. Dunaway got along well with Nicholson, describing him later as a \"soul mate\", but she clashed with Polanski, who had a reputation for being dictatorial and controlling on a set. \"Roman was very much an autocrat, always forcing things. It ranged from the physical to the mental. He was very domineering and abrasive, and made it clear he wanted to manipulate the performance. That approach has never worked with me.\"\nTwo weeks after the filming started, the two had a confrontation that became notorious. Polanski pulled one of Dunaway's hairs out of her head, without telling her, because it was catching the light. Dunaway was offended, describing his act as \"sadistic\" and left the set furious. \"It was not the hair, it was the incessant cruelty that I felt, the constant sarcasm, the never-ending need to humiliate me.\" Years later, both shared their admiration for each other, with Polanski saying that their feud was not important \u2013 \"It's the result that counts. And she was formidable,\" while Dunaway admitted that \"it was way too much made out of it,\" added that she enjoyed working with Polanski, calling him \"a great director,\" and stated, \"Chinatown\" was \"possibly the best film I ever made.\"\nDespite the complications on the set, the film was finished, released to glowing reviews, and ultimately became a classic. It made back its budget almost five times, and received 11 Academy Award nominations. Dunaway received a second Best Actress nomination, and also received a Golden Globe nomination and a BAFTA nomination. Upon the release of the film, producer Robert Evans was full of praise for Dunaway. \"She has everything\u2014beauty, talent, neurosis. She's one of the great strange ones. When the lights go out and that face comes out of the dark and she looks at you with those big mysterious eyes, I tell you, it's a very compelling thing. She has something we haven't seen on the screen for a long time. She has witchery. She's a \"femme fatale\".\"\nThat same year, Dunaway appeared in a television adaptation of \"After the Fall\" with Christopher Plummer. She played the lead role, which was for her \"like a dream come true. As with Bonnie, I knew the territory well. Maggie (her character) was a completely wounded soul, a girl who had grown up on the wrong side of the tracks.\" She next played Paul Newman's fianc\u00e9e, who is trapped in a burning skyscraper along with several hundred other people in the all-star disaster epic, \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974). The film became the highest-grossing film of the year, further cementing Dunaway as a top actress in Hollywood. Also in 1974, Dunaway married Peter Wolf, the lead singer of the rock group The J. Geils Band. At this time, she felt \"exhausted from the constant and intense pressures of the work,\" and at the last moment pulled out of \"The Wind and the Lion\" (1975), in which she was to costar with Sean Connery, to concentrate on her married life.\nHer next feature was Sydney Pollack's political thriller, \"Three Days of the Condor\" (1975). Her character was to be held hostage by a CIA analyst, played by Robert Redford, and Dunaway was required to display fear that she might be raped, but she had difficulty not breaking into laughter during the shoot, as \"the idea of being kidnapped and ravaged by Robert Redford was anything but frightening.\" The film was a critical and commercial success, and Dunaway's performance, which was praised by the critics, earned her a fifth Golden Globe nomination. In his review of the film, Roger Ebert called her character \"the very embodiment of pluck,\" and said that, \"She has three lines of dialogue that brings the house down. They're obscene and funny and poignant all at once, and Dunaway delivers them just marvelously.\" Dunaway took a break from acting and spent almost a year turning down projects. She passed on a role in Alfred Hitchcock's final film, the comic thriller \"Family Plot\", which she later lamented. She returned to the screen in 1976 with the Holocaust drama \"Voyage of the Damned\". The story was inspired by true events concerning the fate of the ocean liner carrying Jewish refugees from Germany to Cuba in 1939.\nThat same year, Dunaway appeared in the Paddy Chayefsky-scripted satire \"Network\" as the scheming TV executive Diana Christensen, a ruthless woman who will do anything for higher ratings. She loved the script and later said this was \"the only film I ever did that you didn't touch the script because it was almost as if it were written in verse.\" She pursued the role over the objections of her husband, Peter Wolf, and her confidant, William Alfred, who regarded Christensen as too heartless and were concerned that people would confuse her with the character. However, Dunaway believed it was \"one of the most important female roles to come along in years\" and went along with Chayevsky's conception and director Sidney Lumet's warning that she would not be allowed to sneak in any weeping or softness, and that it would remain on the cutting room floor if she did.\nThe film, a success in its own day, is frequently discussed today due to its almost prophetic take on the television industry. Dunaway's performance was lauded, with Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" saying that she \"in particular, is successful in making touching and funny a woman of psychopathic ambition and lack of feeling.\" Dunaway's performance in \"Network\" earned her many awards. She was named Best Actress in the Kansas City Film Critics Awards, and she received her sixth Golden Globe nomination for \"Network\" and was awarded Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. In early 1977, the Academy Awards nominated \"Network\" for ten awards, with Dunaway winning the Best Actress award.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I will never forget the moment, and the feeling, when I heard my name. It was, without question, one of the most wonderful nights of my life. The Oscar represented the epitome of what I had struggled for and dreamt about since I was a child. The emotional rush of getting this accolade, the highest one this industry can award you, just hit me like a bomb. It was the symbol of everything I ever thought I wanted as an actress.\u2014\u200a\nAlso in 1976, Dunaway appeared as the lead in the made-for-television movie, \"The Disappearance of Aimee\", in which she co-starred with Bette Davis. Following her Oscar win, Dunaway took another break from acting to figure out her personal life. As her marriage was falling apart, she began a relationship with English photographer Terry O'Neill, who took one of his most famous pictures, \"The Morning After\", showing Dunaway poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel with her Oscar the morning after the ceremony. In 1978, Dunaway returned to the screen in Irvin Kershner's thriller \"Eyes of Laura Mars\", about a fashion photographer who sees visions of a killer murdering people. The film was a success at the box office, and Dunaway received positive reviews for her performance, with Janet Maslin writing for \"The New York Times\" that she was \"perfect for her role.\" She played supporting roles in \"The Champ\" (1979), as the film offered her the chance to play the role of a mother, \"which was emotionally where I wanted to be in my life,\" and \"The First Deadly Sin\" (1980); she wanted to work with Frank Sinatra. In 1981, Dunaway played the title role in \"Evita Per\u00f3n\", a television miniseries based on the life of the famed First Lady of Argentina.\nThat same year, Dunaway portrayed actress Joan Crawford in the adaptation of her daughter Christina's controversial memoir, \"Mommie Dearest\", in which she had depicted her adoptive mother as an abusive tyrant who only adopted her four children to promote her acting career, making quite a stir as the first celebrity tell-all book. Anne Bancroft had been initially cast as Crawford, but Dunaway accepted the role after meeting producer Frank Yablans and director Frank Perry, who both assured her that they wanted to tell the real story of Joan Crawford, and not just a tabloid version of her life. \"Though Christina's book was obviously an exploitation book, the first one of its kind, my task was to portray a woman, a full woman who she was in all her facets, not just one. I tried to illuminate who this woman was. But it was more than just about being angry, it was about trying to examine and explore the forces that undermined her.\" To play the role, Dunaway researched Crawford's films and met with many of her friends and co-workers, including director George Cukor. Filming proved difficult for her, as she was almost never out of character. \"If your mind is on a woman who is dead and you're trying to find out who she was and do right by her, you do feel a presence. I felt it at home at night sometimes. It wasn't pleasant. I felt Joan was not at rest.\" After the infamous \"wire hangers\" tantrum scene, Dunaway was so hoarse from screaming that she lost her voice. Frank Sinatra drove her to see a throat specialist and shared his own tips on how to preserve her voice.\nThe film opened in 1981, and was a moderate commercial success despite negative reviews. Dunaway's uncanny performance earned her two Best Actress award nominations by the New York Film Critics Circle Awards and the National Society of Film Critics Awards, and was lauded by critics. Janet Maslin, while dismissing the film as incoherent, wrote that Dunaway's performance was \"a small miracle\" and praised her energy and commitment to the role. The frequently harsh Pauline Kael raved about Dunaway's performance, stating that she had reached new heights as an actress and surmised that it would be difficult for Dunaway to top her performance as Crawford. Vincent Canby also praised Dunaway, writing that \"\"Mommie Dearest\" doesn't work very well, but the ferocious intensity of Faye Dunaway's impersonation does, as does the film's point of view, which succeeds in making Joan Crawford into a woman far more complicated, more self-aware and more profoundly disturbed than the mother remembered in Christina Crawford's book.\" Director Sidney Lumet stated that it was \"a brilliant, an extraordinary performance. The courage of that evil that she brings to it, I think that's just major acting.\" Although the film became a cult classic as well as one of her most famous characters, Dunaway expressed her regrets for playing Crawford, as she felt \"it was meant to be a window into a tortured soul. But it was made into camp.\" She also blamed the film for hurting her career and almost never agreed to discuss it in interviews afterwards, typically saying that only God will ever know what passed between Joan and Christina.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I know you have a life, and you act many roles. But after \"Mommie Dearest\", my own personality and the memory of all my other roles got lost along the way in the mind of the public and in the mind of many in Hollywood. It was a performance. That's all that it was. For better or worse, the roles we play become a part of our persona, and the actress and the woman are identified with that persona. People thought of me as being like her. And that was the unfortunate reality for me about this project.\u2014\u200a\n1982\u20131999: Film, television, and theatre work.\nIn 1982, Dunaway appeared in a television adaptation of Clifford Odets's dramatic play \"The Country Girl\" as the wife of a washed-up alcoholic singer played by Dick Van Dyke, whom she later described as \"one of the sweetest and funniest men in the world\", but admitted \"Though it was a valiant effort on all our parts, and there were moments I thought were good and true, the remake fell short of our hopes and certainly of the original. But doing it helped remind of that I do love this business of acting, something the Crawford movie had come close to making me forget.\" That same year, she returned to the New York stage with William Alfred's second theatre project for her, \"The Curse of an Aching Heart\". In her role, she later felt she had been miscast, \"It was a little bit too star-heavy with me in it. The play would have been better with just the simplest of women.\" Despite her mixed feelings about it, her performance earned her good reviews from the critics, with Frank Rich writing for \"The New York Times\" that \"Miss Dunaway's absence from the theater has not dimmed her stage technique. She's usually in command.\"\nDuring this time, Dunaway moved to England with her partner Terry O'Neill, whom she married in 1982; being more interested in her married life, she only took on work that was convenient for her. That same year, she returned to the screen in Michael Winner's period melodrama \"The Wicked Lady\", in which she played a 17th-century highway robber. The film proved to be a critical and commercial failure. \"Though I loved making \"The Wicked Lady\", in the end, it just didn't have the juice it needed to be a hit. It seemed to never quite decide whether to be a farce or a drama, and so it failed by being neither.\"\nIn 1984, Dunaway played the lead villain in the superhero movie \"Supergirl\". She felt that \"the film was really just a send-up, a spoof, and I had a lot of fun with Selena (her character)\", but later admitted she was furious with the director Jeannot Szwarc, \"Every time I tried to do something funny, he wouldn't let me. He said, \"you have to be the straight person\". I always wanted to do comedy, but it's daunting when you've not done it before.\" Also in 1984, Dunaway appeared in a television miniseries, \"Ellis Island\", which earned her a second Golden Globe Award, for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film. The following year, she starred in the miniseries, \"Christopher Columbus\". She also appeared in two Agatha Christie adaptations, \"Ordeal by Innocence\" and \"Thirteen at Dinner\" (which was made for television). Though the work was involving, Dunaway struggled to find artistically fulfilling roles during this period in England. \"I missed doing movies. The television scripts I was getting were thin. There is no comparison between those and a \"Chinatown\" script.\" \"Though I had worked steadily in England, it felt as if I had disappeared completely. I was rapidly becoming invisible. I felt increasingly that my career was being limited to, and limited by, the projects that were being mounted there.\" Following her divorce from O'Neill in 1987, Dunaway returned to the United States and attempted to rebuild her career by appearing in several independent dramas.\nDunaway was widely praised for her performance as an alcoholic opposite Mickey Rourke in Barbet Schroeder's drama \"Barfly\" (1987). Based on a novel by Charles Bukowski, the film was very important to her, as she later explained, \"This character, who has given over her days and nights to a bottle, is my way back to the light. This is a role that I care deeply about. I haven't felt this passion for a character since \"Network\". I saw the promise of a comeback for me in the deglamorized face of Wanda, a woman of sweet vulnerability.\" The film was a small success at the box office but received excellent reviews from critics, with Pauline Kael writing that \"Dunaway plays the self-destructive Wanda with a minimum of fuss... she wins your admiration by the simplicity of her effects\", and Roger Ebert felt that both Rourke and Dunaway \"take their characters as opportunities to stretch as actors, to take changes and do extreme things\". Dunaway earned her sixth Golden Globe Award nomination. After \"Barfly\", which remained one of her favorite films, Dunaway tried to be careful about the roles she chose, but was also faced with the reality she had to work to support herself and her child.\nIn 1988, she appeared in the period drama \"The Gamble\", but felt that the best part of this experience turned out to be meeting her co-star Matthew Modine. The following year, she produced and starred in an adaptation for television of Olive Ann Burns' historical novel \"Cold Sassy Tree\". Dunaway co-starred with Richard Widmark and Neil Patrick Harris as an enchanting dressmaker who lightens up the lives of a young boy and his grandfather, whom she marries, to the town's disapproval. The film aired on TNT to great success and became one of Dunaway's favorite experiences. \"What gave \"Cold Sassy\" its heart were the people who were involved. It was an incredible collaboration, and I treasure the experience as much as the result, of which I am extremely proud.\" That same year, she agreed to take part in \"Wait Until Spring, Bandini\" with Joe Mantegna as a favor to Tom Luddy, who had produced \"Barfly\". Also in 1989, she appeared in the Italian drama \"Crystal or Ash, Fire or Wind, as Long as It's Love\", as she wanted to work with director Lina Wertm\u00fcller. In 1990, she was reunited with Robert Duvall, with whom she had co-starred in \"Network\", in Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff's adaptation of the Margaret Atwood novel, \"The Handmaid's Tale\". The film did not do well at the box office, but Dunaway's performance earned her good reviews. Roger Ebert wrote, \"Duvall and Dunaway provide the best moments in the movie, he by showing the unconscious egotism of the male libido, she by showing that in all times and all weathers, some kinds of women will gauge their happiness by the degree to which their family's exterior appearance matches the accepted values of society.\"\n\"Double Edge\" (1992) by Israeli director, writer, and actor Amos Kollek offered her a role she wanted to play, a \"New York Times\" reporter who has been sent to Jerusalem for three weeks to cover the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. All of these were smaller movies that never manage to draw the attention of a mass audience. The following year, Dunaway accepted a supporting role in the thriller \"The Temp\", as she felt the project had the potential to be a mainstream hit, and was a chance for her to reconnect with a larger audience. The film proved to be a critical and commercial failure. Four weeks before its release, Paramount decided to reshoot the final scene, much to Dunaway's displeasure, as her character was going to be turned into the murderer. \"Once again, I could see myself being thrown into playing the extreme \u2014\u200c what was initially conceived as a character in the tradition of Diana in \"Network\" was being turned into a high-gloss female executive/slasher. The new ending wasn't enough to salvage the film, though. By the final scene, it didn't matter who was the killer, the film had been dead for an hour at least.\" Also in 1993, Dunaway was cast as Johnny Depp's love interest in Emir Kusturica's surrealist comedy-drama \"Arizona Dream\". The film, in which she played a woman who dreams of building a flying machine, premiered in Europe to great acclaim, and received the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival. Dunaway was very proud of the film, and believed that her role could bring her career to greater heights than ever. However, Warner Bros. elected to re-edit Kusturica's film, cutting and changing it. Dunaway was dismayed to find that some of her best scenes were left out of the American version. Warner Bros. released the film in United States in 1994 to positive reviews, but little box-office attendance.\nThat same year, Dunaway was cast in the short-lived CBS sitcom \"It Had to Be You\". Both the show and Dunaway's performance were widely panned, and the series was cancelled after only four episodes. Around that time, she was contacted by NBC, who wanted her to take on the role of a female sleuth, more in the vein of \"Columbo\" than \"Murder, She Wrote\". As the prospective series was being developed, Dunaway contacted \"Columbo\" star Peter Falk, wanting his advice on how to approach playing the sleuth character. While discussing the role, Falk told Dunaway about a \"Columbo\" script that he had written himself. \"It's All in the Game\" featured a seductive woman who plays a game of cat-and-mouse with Lt. Columbo in the midst of a murder. Falk had written the script some years prior, saying that he could not find the right actress to take on the role. He offered it to her, and Dunaway accepted immediately. The 1993 TV movie proved a success and was nominated for several Golden Globe and Emmy Awards. Dunaway was recognized with the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series, saying it was at that moment when she felt like she was truly home. \"I was overwhelmed by the generosity of spirit my colleagues extended me that night. It was like being wrapped up in a warm embrace. Though this is more often than not a town of grand illusions and transitory friendships, the moment seemed heartfelt, and touched me deeply.\"\nWith the prospective detective show not working out, Dunaway became interested in returning to the stage. She auditioned to replace Glenn Close in the musical \"Sunset Boulevard\", a stage version of the 1950 film of the same name. Composer and producer Andrew Lloyd Webber cast Dunaway in the famed role of Norma Desmond, and Dunaway began rehearsing to take over the LA engagement when Close moved the show to Broadway. Tickets went on sale for Dunaway's engagement, but shortly after the rehearsals started, Webber and his associates announced that Dunaway was unable to sing to their desired standards. They announced that when Close finished her engagement, the show would shut down completely. Dunaway filed a lawsuit, claiming that Webber had damaged her reputation with his claims. The case went to court and a settlement was later reached, but Dunaway and the producers have not discussed it. In 1995, Dunaway reunited with Johnny Depp in the romantic comedy \"Don Juan DeMarco\", in which she played Marlon Brando's wife. A hit at the box office, the film was praised for its romance and the performances of the three main characters. That same year, Dunaway published \"Looking for Gatsby\", a memoir she co-wrote with Betsy Sharkey, which earned her great reviews. Mark Harris of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote in his review of the book that \"to read her accounts of her Oscar-nominated performances as the taut, sexy, neurotic \"femmes fatales\" of \"Bonnie and Clyde\", \"Chinatown\", and \"Network\" is to learn from an expert about the instincts, collaborations, and compromises that go into great film acting\".\nThe following year, Dunaway was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She starred in the family comedy \"Dunston Checks In\", the crime thriller \"The Chamber\", which reunited her with her \"Bonnie and Clyde\" co-star Gene Hackman, and in the directorial debut of actor Kevin Spacey, \"Albino Alligator\". Also in 1996, Dunaway returned to the stage, playing famed opera singer Maria Callas in the U.S. national tour of the Tony Award-winning play \"Master Class\" by Terrence McNally. Callas was one of Dunaway's favorite characters she ever played. \"That woman changed an art form, and not many people can say that. Callas is to opera what Fellini is to cinema.\" Similarities were made by the press between the career and personalities of Callas and Dunaway, as both were seen as perfectionists whose run-ins with directors had them castigated as prima donnas. \"I think the play is really about what it takes to do something in life, and it's original in that, because there's not a play I know of that has been written about that. This is about an uncompromising artist and a professional who will stop at almost nothing to serve the art that she loves. She said it over and over again in many of her interviews: \"It's not a question of discipline, it's a question of love, of what you do out of the passion for your art.\" And she's right. She was all about feeling \u2014\u200c that's why I love this role so much.\" The tour was a great success and earned Dunaway rave reviews for her performance, as well as the Sarah Siddons Award.\nHer performance as the matron of a wealthy Jewish family in turmoil in the drama \"The Twilight of the Golds\" (1997) earned her a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries. In 1998, she starred with Angelina Jolie in \"Gia\", a biographical film about the rise and fall of supermodel Gia Carangi. Playing the small but key role of Carangi's agent, Dunaway's performance was well reviewed and won her third Golden Globe Award. The following year, Dunaway appeared in the remake of \"The Thomas Crown Affair\", and Roger Ebert argued in his review of the film that she \"had more electricity in 1968 and still does\" compared to actress Rene Russo, who was cast in her original role. Also in 1999, Dunaway portrayed Yolande of Aragon in Luc Besson's historical drama \"\".\n2000\u20132015: Independent films and hiatus.\nIn 2000, Dunaway appeared in director James Gray\u2019s crime film \"The Yards\" as Charlize Theron's mother. Although failing to do well at the box office, the film was received with positive reviews. That same year, she turned down an opportunity to play a drug addict in \"Requiem for a Dream\" and the role went to Ellen Burstyn, who received an Academy Award nomination for her performance. In 2001, Dunaway's role in \"Running Mates\" earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. In 2002, she played Ian Somerhalder's rich Xanax-popping mother in Roger Avary's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel, \"The Rules of Attraction\". She served as a judge on the 2005 reality show \"The Starlet\", which sought the next young actress with the potential to become a major star. In 2006, Dunaway guest-starred in \"Kiss Kiss, Bye Bye\", an episode of the crime drama \"\" because she was a huge fan of the show. She also appeared on \"Touched by an Angel\", \"Alias\", and \"Grey's Anatomy\". In 2008, Dunaway agreed to star in a low-budget Welsh horror film, \"Flick\", for a fraction of her usual $1 million fee after falling in love with the script. She called the writer and director David Howard personally to accept the part of a one-armed American detective, saying it was \"a really original story\". The film premiered at the Raindance Film Festival. That same year, she criticized Hollywood's treatment of older women, saying: \"I am furious that they think I'm too old to play the love interest of guys like Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood. Why should I play sisters and mothers while guys like Jack and Clint, who are older than me, have on-screen lovers half their age?\"\nIn 2009, Dunaway began shooting a film version of the McNally play \"Master Class\" as Maria Callas, also starring Al Pacino (as Aristotle Onassis), Val Kilmer, Alan Cumming, her son Liam Dunaway O'Neill, and lyric soprano Danielle de Niese (the latter two as opera students). As film roles became more difficult to find, Dunaway bought the rights to the play after the 1997 tour, and announced her intention of writing, directing, and starring in the film. The production, however, was a disaster and financing the project was one of the many obstacles. \"I want to do it my way. I'm not going to sell it out to a studio. You have to raise money. You have to get private investors, and it takes a long time to get it right. It takes 10 years. People hear Faye Dunaway and think she has a lot of money, but I don't because I've spent a lot. Not tonnes. I spent what I want to spend on this movie and you have to have skin in this game. You have to take risks.\" In 2013, she confirmed that she had completed the first half of the film and planned to shoot the rest soon after. However, it was announced in June 2014 that after nearly 20 years of owning the film rights, Dunaway had decided to withdraw from the project.\nIn 2011, a photo of Dunaway taken by Jerry Schatzberg in 1970 was chosen as the 64th annual Cannes Film Festival poster backdrop. The festival organizers described it as a \"Model of sophistication and timeless elegance, it is an embodiment of the cinematic dream that the Festival de Cannes seeks to maintain\". During the festival, Dunaway and Schatzberg appeared at a special screening of \"Puzzle of a Downfall Child\", earning a standing ovation upon their entrance. In 2013, Dunaway was the first recipient of the Leopard Club Award and made a rare personal appearance at the Locarno International Film Festival to accept it. In 2014, Dunaway was recognized as the guest of honor by the Lumi\u00e8re Film Festival. Organizers praised the \"immense contribution she has made to the emergence of the independent American films of the '60s and '70s, and the contribution is of the highest caliber\". Her attendance at the festival was described as an \"exceptional event\". Dunaway received a standing ovation by a crowd of 5,000, and declared in an emotional speech following the tribute she received, \"My fans and my friends have supported me in this search for all these years, and I thank you from all of my heart, and without you, I would not be the same Faye Dunaway.\" In 2014, Dunaway had to pull out of a French drama called \"Macadam Stories\", in which she was going to play the lead, due to health issues, and was replaced by Isabelle Huppert. The following year, it was announced that Dunaway was writing a book about her experiences making \"Mommie Dearest\", but the project never materialized.\n2016\u2013present: Return to film and theatre.\nIn 2016, Dunaway made a rare public appearance at the TCM Classic Film Festival, in which she hosted a screening of \"Network\" and also joined in conversation with Ben Mankiewicz for a Q&amp;A session in which she discussed her decades-spanning career. Although she stated in a 2013 interview she felt her acting career was \"pretty much over\", Dunaway told Mankiewicz she had no intention to retire: \"We live for work. We live for what we do. I just want to keep working. It's where I'm happiest.\" That same year, she was cast in a supporting role in the second season of \"Hand of God,\" but was ultimately replaced by Linda Gray due to \"some scheduling conflicts and some other issues\" according to Ben Watkins, creator of the show. Also in 2016, Dunaway guest-starred as herself in the season-two finale of the mockumentary series \"Documentary Now!\". In 2017, Dunaway returned to acting with a cameo role in the horror-thriller \"The Bye Bye Man\", a small part in the Christian drama \"The Case for Christ\", and a supporting role in the psychological thriller \"Inconceivable\", which also starred Nicolas Cage and Gina Gershon. Critic Frank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" found it \"distressing that Dunaway can't find more dignified projects at this point in her estimable career\".\nAlso in 2017, Dunaway reunited with her \"Bonnie and Clyde\" co-star Warren Beatty at the 89th Academy Awards, in celebration of the film's 50th anniversary. After being introduced by Jimmy Kimmel, they were given a standing ovation as they walked out onto the stage to present the Best Picture Award. They were given the wrong envelope and Dunaway incorrectly announced \"La La Land\" as Best Picture, instead of the actual winner, \"Moonlight\". This became a social-media sensation, trending all over the world. Dunaway was left \"completely stunned\" when Oscars crew members came on stage to explain that there had been a mistake and later said she felt \"very guilty\" about the incident, describing it as \"one of the worst moments I've ever had\". That same year, Dunaway was honored at the Dallas International Film Festival where she was presented with the Dallas Star Award. In 2018, Dunaway and Beatty returned to present Best Picture at the 90th Academy Awards, earning a standing ovation upon their entrance, making jokes about the previous year's flub.\nIn 2019, more than 30 years since her performance in \"The Curse of the Aching Heart\", Dunaway planned to return to Broadway with an updated version of Matthew Lombardo's one-woman play \"Tea at Five\", which was first performed at Hartford Stage in 2002. She would portray Katharine Hepburn, being particularly drawn to the complexities of the play and the character, saying, \"Hepburn was a brilliant actress. Her aura on screen was unique. That, coupled with the wide array of roles she played, made her an inspiration to me and many others. She had a lot of class, too, and the innate ability to project intelligence, both on and off screen. You can't help but want to explore that and learn more about her.\" The three week try-out in Boston met with critical appreciation. Patti Hartigan of \"The Boston Globe\" felt that Dunaway gave a \"bravura performance\" and wrote that she \"inhabits the role and goes beyond mere mimicry. Of course, she captures the Voice \u2013 waspy, reedy, patrician \u2013 but she also brings a mix of fragility and strength to the role, maintaining the straight spine, but also letting that stiff upper lip quiver ever so slightly when grief overtakes her.\" Christopher Caggiano of \"The Arts Fuse\" gave the play a mixed review, but praised Dunaway, writing that she \"does manage to remind us why, despite her relative absence from the stage and the screen in the last 30 years, she remains a Hollywood legend. She has a palpable emotional intensity, and gives you the sense that entire scenes are playing out behind her eyes as part of her backstory. She's a legend for a reason.\"\n\"Tea at Five\" was pitched to be her triumphant return to Broadway, but following three weeks at the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston, Dunaway was released from the play, reportedly due to altercations between crewmembers and her. An assistant fired by Dunaway filed a lawsuit against the actress in August 2019 alleging homophobic verbal harassment.\nDunaway reunited with Kevin Spacey in 2022's \"The Man Who Drew God\", co-starring and directed by Franco Nero. \"Faye\", a documentary about Dunaway, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau, premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival and can be seen on HBO and Max. She was to next appear in the supernatural love story, \"Fate\", opposite Harvey Keitel. On October 3, 2024, Dunaway was announced as starring in the coming-of-age supernatural thriller, \"The Evilry\".\nLegacy and reputation.\nDunaway is regarded as one of the greatest and most beautiful actresses of her generation, as well as a powerful emblem of the New Hollywood. Director John Huston, who played Dunaway's father in \"Chinatown\", stated in a 1985 interview that he found her to be \"quite extraordinary\". Robert Evans, who produced \"Chinatown\", also described her as \"extraordinary\", and affirmed that \"no one could've played her part as well\". Stephen Rebello of \"Movieline\" wrote in a 2002 article, \"Though fiercely modern, an ideal female analog for screen machos like Steve McQueen and the young Jack Nicholson, she also radiated the stuff vintage movie stars are made of. Any actress today would be lucky to have a fraction of her films on her resume.\"\nCannes Film Festival artistic director Thierry Fremaux said, \"She has one of the most wonderful filmographies of any actress. Look at her movies from the '70s for example \u2013 she only made good choices. She's had an incredible career.\" Through her career, Dunaway worked with many of the 20th century's greatest directors\u2014Elia Kazan, Sidney Lumet, Arthur Penn, Roman Polanski, Sydney Pollack, and Emir Kusturica among them, and several of the films she starred in became classics. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked \"Bonnie and Clyde\", \"Chinatown\", and \"Network\" on their list of the 100 best American movies ever made. Her roles as Bonnie Parker and Joan Crawford were respectively named 32nd and 41st on the AFI's list of the fifty greatest screen characters in the villain category. Elizabeth Snead wrote in her review for \"USA Today\" of Dunaway's memoirs that she was \"the epitome of a modern, mature, sexy woman\" and Mark Harris of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that \"Faye Dunaway is a rarity in the land of stars (and star bios) \u2013 a tough, smart, committed pro\". In 1994, Dunaway was ranked 27th by \"People\" magazine on a list of the 50 most beautiful people and in 1997 she was ranked 65th by \"Empire\" on a list of the 100 top stars in film history.\nFamously demanding, with an attention to detail that sometimes drove co-stars and directors mad, Dunaway believed that she was often mistaken as being as cold and calculating as some of the women she portrayed. Her clashes with Roman Polanski on the set of \"Chinatown\" earned her a reputation for being difficult to work with. Upon the release of the film, Polanski told a reporter for \"Rolling Stone\" that he considered Dunaway \"a gigantic pain in the ass\", but added that he had \"never known an actress to take work as seriously as she does. I tell you, she is a maniac.\" Bette Davis described Dunaway as the worst person she had ever worked with in an interview with Johnny Carson in 1988, calling her \"totally impossible\", \"uncooperative\", and \"very unprofessional\". Dunaway denied Davis' claims in her autobiography, writing \"Watching her, all I could think of was that she seemed like someone caught in a death throe, a final scream against a fate over which no one has control. I was just the target of her blind rage at the one sin Hollywood never forgives in its leading ladies: growing old.\"\nIn his 1996 book \"Making Movies\", Sidney Lumet slammed Dunaway's reputation for being difficult as \"totally untrue\", and called her a \"selfless, devoted, and wonderful actress\". Director Elia Kazan described Dunaway as \"a supremely endowed, hungry, curious, bright young talent\", and added, \"Faye is a brilliant actress and a shy, highly-strung woman. She is intelligent, and she is strong-willed.\" Like Lumet, Kazan felt she was not difficult, but a perfectionist who was never satisfied. \"The artist is rarely, if ever, satisfied. The artist is frequently grateful and intermittently amazed, but he or she is never satisfied. That Faye is unlikely to be satisfied with her efforts\u2014or those with whom she works\u2014is not a caprice; it is not the willful misbehavior of a spoiled actress: This is how artists operate.\" Johnny Depp, who co-starred with Dunaway in \"Arizona Dream\" and \"Don Juan deMarco\", called her a misunderstood artist. \"She's just uncompromising as an actress, and I think that's a positive thing.\" Maria Elena Fernandez of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in a 2005 article about Dunaway that \"in her case, the behavior many call 'difficult' seems clearly linked more to passions than to ego\". In her autobiography \"Looking for Gatsby\", Dunaway confronted this reputation and described herself as a \"perfectionist\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;God is in the details. I want to get it right. The fact is a man can be difficult and people applaud him for trying to do a superior job. People say, 'Well gosh, he's got a lot of guts. He's a real man.' And a woman can try to get it right and she's 'a pain in the ass.' It's my nature to do really good jobs, and I would never have been successful if I hadn't.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1962, Dunaway started a romance with stand-up comedian Lenny Bruce. That relationship lasted a year. She was engaged to photographer Jerry Schatzberg from 1967 to 1968. The two remain friends, and Dunaway later starred in his directorial debut, \"Puzzle of a Downfall Child\" (1970). During the filming of \"A Place for Lovers\" (1968), Dunaway fell in love with her co-star, Marcello Mastroianni. The couple had a two-year live-in relationship. Dunaway wanted to marry and have children, but Mastroianni, still legally married, could not bear to hurt his estranged wife and refused, despite protests from his teenaged daughter Barbara and his close friend Federico Fellini. Dunaway decided to leave him and told a reporter at the time that she \"gave too much. I gave things I have to save for my work.\" She later recalled in her 1995 autobiography:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are days when I look back on those years with Marcello and have moments of real regret. There is that one piece of me that thinks that had we married, we might be married still. It was one of our fantasies, that we would grow old together. He thought we would be like Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, a love kept secret for a lifetime. Private and only belonging to the two of us.\nIn 1987, Mastroianni told \"People\" magazine that he never got over the breakup. \"She was the woman I loved the most,\" he said. \"I'll always be sorry to have lost her. I was whole with her for the first time in my life.\"\nDunaway dated her \"Doc\" co-star Harris Yulin from 1970 to 1972, after which she was briefly involved with producer Andrew Braunsberg. In 1974, she married Peter Wolf, the lead singer of the rock group The J. Geils Band. Their career commitments caused frequent separations, and the two divorced in 1979. She met her second husband, British photographer Terry O'Neill, when he was assigned by \"People\" magazine to take pictures of Peter Wolf and her in 1977. They married in 1982, and Dunaway credited O'Neill with being \"the one person responsible for helping me grow up to womanhood and a healthy sense of myself\". Their child, Liam Dunaway O'Neill, was born in 1980. In 2003, despite Dunaway's earlier indications that she had given birth to Liam, Terry O'Neill revealed that their son was adopted.\nAfter her divorce from O'Neill in 1987, Dunaway was linked to author Frederick Forsyth. She then had a three-year relationship with Warren Lieberfarb, Home Video president of Warner Bros., before going on to date Hook Herrera, a blues harpist with the band Hook and the Hitchhikers. Her most recent publicized romantic attachment was with French TV host Bernard Montiel in the mid-1990s. In a rare interview for \"Harper's Bazaar\" in 2016, Dunaway said she felt that \"it's important to have a partner, probably,\" but she described herself as \"a loner\" and added, \"I kind of like to be alone and do my work and, you know, be focused on my own things.\"\nDunaway is a devout Catholic, and she has said that she regularly attends morning Mass. She converted to Catholicism in 1996; until then, she had been a lifelong Protestant.\nDunaway revealed her bipolar disorder diagnosis and her history of alcoholism in her 2024 documentary, \"Faye\".\nCredits and accolades.\nSelect filmography\nSelect theatre roles:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is the eldest of nine children of Lenora Marie (n\u00e9e Criscione; 1923\u20132020) and Phillip Leslie Tomalin, an advertising executive, television producer, and one-time nightclub singer. She has four brothers: Phillip Leslie Jr., Terry (an outdoorsman, journalist, and community leader), Timothy, and O'Brian (owner of Building 8 Brewery in Northampton, Massachusetts); and four sisters: Meredith (or \"Merry\"), Bonnie Priscilla, Amanda, and Melissa (or \"Missy\"). Her father was of English, Irish, and Welsh ancestry. His English ancestors came from Hackney in London and his Welsh ancestors from Bridgend. On her mother's side, she is of Italian descent, with ancestors from the regions of Tuscany and Sicily. Her father worked for WOR-TV in New York City.\nWhen she was four years old, the Tomalin family moved from New York City to the newly developed Stephenville community, located in the northern area of Raritan (now Edison) Township, New Jersey. The family was raised Roman Catholic and she and her sisters attended the all-girls Saint Francis Grammar School in nearby Metuchen, while her brothers attended the all-boys Saint Matthews Grammar School in Edison Township. Her mother was a member and board director of the Stephenville Women's Club and the Terra Nova Garden Club. The family was also member to the Woodside Swim Club, a private swimming club and park in the Stephenville community, where Sarandon and her sisters won many swimming competitions. Sarandon graduated from Saint Francis Grammar School in 1960.\nSarandon attended Edison High School, a public school located in Edison Township. In 1962, while still in high school, she joined a band and dance group to entertain sick children at a nearby rehabilitation hospital. As a high school junior, she performed the lead in the play \"Lady Precious Stream\". As a senior, she played the title character in the comedy \"My Sister Eileen\", earning mentions in the local newspapers. In 1964, Sarandon was inducted into the National Honor Society.\nIn May 1964, the Tomalin family moved to the newly developed Chandler Hill community, east of Stephenville in Edison. Sarandon graduated from Edison High School in 1964. She attended the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. from 1964 to 1968, earning a Bachelor of Arts in drama, and studying under the drama coach Gilbert V. Hartke. During and shortly after college, she supported herself by emptying bedpans in a hospital, cutting hair, cleaning houses and working as a switchboard operator.\nCareer.\nIn 1968, Sarandon and her then-husband Chris appeared on stage at the Wayside Theatre in Middletown, Virginia. The following year, the couple went to a casting call for the motion-picture \"Joe\" (1970). Although he did not get a part, she was cast in a major role of a disaffected teen who disappears into the seedy underworld. Between 1970 and 1972, she appeared in the soap operas \"A World Apart\" and \"Search for Tomorrow\", playing Patrice Kahlman and Sarah Fairbanks, respectively. Her career gained momentum in 1974, when she starred in \"F. Scott Fitzgerald and 'The Last of the Belles\"', a highly rated made-for-television film, and Billy Wilder's screen adaptation of \"The Front Page\". In 1975, Sarandon appeared in the cult favorite \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and had the female lead in \"The Great Waldo Pepper\", opposite Robert Redford. She was twice directed by Louis Malle, in \"Pretty Baby\" (1978) and \"Atlantic City\" (1980). The latter earned Sarandon her first Academy Award nomination.\nHer most controversial film appearance was in Tony Scott's \"The Hunger\" (1983), a modern vampire story in which she had a sex scene with Catherine Deneuve. It was the first mainstream American film to feature such a scene between two star actresses. She appeared in the comedy-fantasy \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1987) alongside Jack Nicholson, Cher, and Michelle Pfeiffer. However, Sarandon did not become a \"household name\" until she appeared with Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins in the film \"Bull Durham\" (1988), a commercial and critical success. Roger Ebert praised Sarandon's performance in his review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\": \"I don't know who else they could have hired to play Annie Savoy, the Sarandon character who pledges her heart and her body to one player a season, but I doubt if the character would have worked without Sarandon's wonderful performance\".\nSarandon was nominated for an Academy Award four more times in the 1990s, as Best Actress as Louise Sawyer in \"Thelma &amp; Louise\" (1991), Michaela Odone in \"Lorenzo's Oil\" (1992), and Reggie Love in \"The Client\" (1994), finally winning for \"Dead Man Walking\" (1995) in which she played Sister Helen Prejean who regularly visits a convicted murderer on death row. Janet Maslin, in \"The New York Times\", wrote of her performance in the last film: \"Ms. Sarandon takes the kind of risk she took playing a stubbornly obsessed mother in \"Lorenzo's Oil.\" She's commandingly blunt, and she avoids cheapening her performance with the wrong kind of compassion. Her Sister Helen is repelled and alarmed by this man, but she's determined to help him anyway. That's what makes the film so unrelenting.\" Sarandon was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award in 1994. Additionally, she has received eight Golden Globe nominations, including for the films \"White Palace\" (1990), \"Stepmom\" (1998), \"Igby Goes Down\" (2002), and \"Bernard and Doris\" (2007).\nHer other movies include \"Bob Roberts\" (1992), \"Little Women\" (1994), \"James and the Giant Peach\" (1996), \"Anywhere but Here\" (1999), \"Cradle Will Rock\" (1999), ' (2000), \"Cats &amp; Dogs\" (2001), \"The Banger Sisters\" (2002), \"Shall We Dance\" (2004), \"Alfie\" (2004), \"Romance &amp; Cigarettes\" (2005), \"Elizabethtown\" (2005), \"Enchanted\" (2007), and 'Speed Racer\"\" (2008).

She appeared on \"Friends\", \"Malcolm in the Middle\", \"Mad TV\", \"Saturday Night Live\", \"Chappelle's Show\", \"30 Rock\", \"Rescue Me,\" and \"Mike &amp; Molly\".\nSarandon has contributed the narration to two dozen documentary films, many of which dealt with social and political issues. In addition, she has served as the presenter on many installments of the PBS documentary series, \"Independent Lens\".

In 2025, she made her UK stage debut in Tracy Letts\u2019s play \"Mary Page Marlowe\".\nPolitical views and activism.\nSarandon is known for her active support of progressive and left-wing political causes, ranging from donations to organizations such as EMILY's List to participating in a 1983 delegation to Nicaragua sponsored by MADRE, an organization that promotes \"social, environmental, and economic justice\". In 1999, she was appointed UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In that capacity, she has actively supported the organization's global advocacy, as well as the work of the Canadian UNICEF Committee. In 2006, she was one of eight women selected to carry in the Olympic flag at the Opening Ceremony of the 2006 Olympic Winter Games, in Turin, Italy. The same year, Sarandon received the Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award. Sarandon was appointed an FAO Goodwill Ambassador in 2010. She donated fruit trees to the New York City Housing Authority's Jamaica Houses in 2018 in the borough of Queens. Sarandon visited the housing complex in person to help plant the trees. In 2022, she joined as an ambassador to the HALO Trust, a mine clearance organization. In May 2024, she urged Irish voters to re-elect Mick Wallace and Clare Daly as MEPs.\nAnti-war activism.\nSarandon and Robbins both took an early stance against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with Sarandon stating that she was firmly against war as a pre-emptive strike. Prior to a 2003 protest sponsored by the United for Peace and Justice coalition, she said that many Americans \"do not want to risk their children or the children of Iraq\". Sarandon was one of the first to appear in a series of political ads sponsored by TrueMajority, an organization established by Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream founder Ben Cohen. Along with anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, Sarandon took part in a 2006 Mother's Day protest, which was sponsored by Code Pink. In January 2007, she appeared with Robbins and Jane Fonda at an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C. in support of a Congressional measure to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq.\nPresidential politics.\nDuring the 2000 election, Sarandon supported Ralph Nader's run for president, serving as a co-chair of the National Steering Committee of Nader 2000. During the 2004 election campaign, she withheld support for Nader's bid, being among several \"Nader Raiders\" who urged Nader to drop out and his voters offer their support for Democratic Party candidate John Kerry. After the 2004 election, Sarandon called for US elections to be monitored by international entities.\nIn the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Sarandon and Tim Robbins campaigned for John Edwards in the New Hampshire communities of Hampton, Bedford, and Dover. When asked at We Vote '08 Kickoff Party \"What would Jesus do this primary season\", Sarandon said, \"I think Jesus would be very supportive of John Edwards.\" She later endorsed Barack Obama.\nIn the 2012 U.S. presidential election Sarandon, along with film director Michael Moore, said that they were not thrilled with Obama's performance but hoped he would be re-elected. She said she and the administration haven't been allies. \"I wouldn't say the White House has taken me under its wing and made me one of its best buddies,\" Sarandon said.\nIn the 2016 United States presidential election, she made public her support for Senator Bernie Sanders. On March 28, 2016, in an interview on \"All In with Chris Hayes\", Sarandon indicated that she and other Sanders supporters might not support Hillary Clinton if Clinton were to be the Democratic nominee for president. She stated: \"You know, some people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately. If he gets in, then things will really explode.\" Hayes inquired as to whether it would be dangerous to allow Trump to become president, to which she replied: \"If you think that it's pragmatic to shore up the status quo right now, then you're not in touch with the status quo\". On October 30, 2016, she endorsed Green Party of the United States presidential candidate Jill Stein.\nIn an interview with \"The Guardian\" published on November 26, 2017, Sarandon said about Hillary Clinton: \"I did think she was very, very dangerous. We would still be fracking, we would be at war [if she were president]\".\nCivil rights.\nIn 1995, Sarandon was one of many Hollywood actors, directors and writers interviewed for the documentary \"The Celluloid Closet,\" which explores how Hollywood films have depicted homosexuality.\nSarandon and Robbins appeared at the 2000 Shadow Convention in Los Angeles to speak about drug offenders being unduly punished. In 2004, she served on the advisory committee for 2004 Racism Watch, an activist group.\nSarandon has become an advocate to end the death penalty and mass incarceration. She has joined the team of people fighting to save the life of Richard Glossip, a man on death row in Oklahoma. In May 2015, Sarandon launched a campaign with fundraising platform Represent.com to sell T-shirts to help finance the documentary \"Deep Run\", the story of a poor North Carolina teen undergoing a gender transition.\nSince 2011.\nOn March 12, 2011, Sarandon spoke before a crowd in Madison, Wisconsin protesting Governor Scott Walker and his Budget Repair Bill. On September 27, 2011, Sarandon spoke to reporters and interested parties at the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York City. Her use of the word \"Nazi\" to describe Pope Benedict XVI on October 15, 2011 generated complaints from Roman Catholic authorities and from the Anti-Defamation League, which called on Sarandon to apologize. Sarandon brought activist Rosa Clemente to the 75th Golden Globe Awards and participated in a rally against gun violence in June 2018.\nOn June 28, 2018, Sarandon was arrested during the Women Disobey protests, along with 575 other people, for protesting at the Hart Senate Office Building where a sit-in was being held against Donald Trump's migrant separation policy.\nOn May 27, 2021, Sarandon tweeted in support of the Palestinian people, in her words, \"fighting against the apartheid government of Netanyahu\", and of the Israeli people \"that they too, will enjoy peace\". She expressed support for Palestinian-American model Bella Hadid \"for having the bravery to stand in solidarity with her people\". She also co-signed an open letter criticizing Israel for labeling six Palestinian human rights groups as terror organizations, and quoted Desmond Tutu on the conflict saying that \"true peace can ultimately be built only on justice\". Sarandon was the executive producer for \"Soufra\", a documentary that covered the development of a food truck in the Bourj el Barajneh Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon.\nIn February 2022, some law enforcement organizations criticized Sarandon for sharing a tweet that described a photo of police officers honoring a killed officer as fascism. She later deleted the tweet and posted a message on Twitter to apologize.\nGaza war.\nIn November 2023, Sarandon spoke out against the Israeli government's actions during the Gaza war. At a pro-Palestinian rally in Union Square on November 17, Sarandon said: \"There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence.\" Four days later, she was dropped as a client by United Talent Agency. On December 1, Sarandon issued an apology for the phrasing of her comment, saying that \"it implies that until recently Jews have been strangers to persecution, when the opposite is true\". On March 12, 2025, Sarandon attended the detention hearing of Palestinian activist and US permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained by ICE, and stated her support for the free speech rights of Khalil and all US residents.\nFollowing the Israeli thwarting of several attempts to break its blockade of the Gaza Strip, Sarandon joined the steering committee for the Global Sumud Flotilla, which was the largest civilian-led aid flotilla to Gaza. It started sailing in August 2025 and was intercepted by Israel on October 2.\nPersonal life.\nWhile in college, she met fellow student Chris Sarandon; they married on September 16, 1967. They announced a trial separation in 1975 and divorced in 1979, but she retained his surname. From 1977 until 1980, Sarandon had a live-in relationship with director Louis Malle, after which she was sporadically involved with musician David Bowie and, briefly, actor Sean Penn.\nIn the mid-1980s, Sarandon dated Italian filmmaker Franco Amurri, with whom she had a daughter, Eva Amurri (born March 15, 1985). They met on the set of \"Tempest\" in 1981, but did not get together until she returned to Italy to shoot \"Mussolini and I\" three years later. In 2017, Sarandon revealed that she had had an affair with British actor Philip Sayer, who she further revealed had been gay.\nBeginning in 1988, Sarandon lived with actor Tim Robbins, whom she met while they were filming \"Bull Durham\". They have two sons: John \"Jack\" Henry (born May 15, 1989) and Miles (born May 4, 1992). Sarandon, like Robbins, is a lapsed Catholic, and they share liberal political views. They broke up in 2009.\nFollowing her breakup with Robbins, Sarandon began a relationship with Jonathan Bricklin, son of Malcolm Bricklin. They helped establish a chain of table tennis lounges named SPiN. Sarandon is the co-owner of its New York and Toronto locations. Sarandon and Bricklin broke up in 2015.\nIn 2006, Sarandon and ten relatives, including her son Miles, traveled to the United Kingdom to trace her family's Welsh genealogy. Their journey was documented by the BBC Wales programme, \"Coming Home: Susan Sarandon\". Much of the same research and content was featured in the American version of \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" She also received the Ragusani Nel Mondo prize in 2006; her Sicilian roots are in Ragusa, Italy.\nSarandon is bisexual, seemingly coming out during a September 2022 appearance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\". She also previously told \"Pride Source\" in 2017 that her sexuality was \"open\" and \"up for grabs\", and on a 2021 episode of the \"Divorced Not Dead\" podcast said of her dating interests, \"I don't care if it's a man or a woman. I mean, I'm open to all age, all color. And those for me, those things are just details.\"\nOther hobbies and ventures.\nIn 2009, Sarandon turned her hobby and love of ping pong into a table tennis club at SPiN NYC. Sarandon attributes her love of table tennis to its equalizing nature stating \"I love that it cuts across gender, and your body type, your age.\u201d\nAwards and nominations.\nSarandon received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Stockholm International Film Festival, was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2010, and received the Outstanding Artistic Life Award for her Outstanding Contribution to World Cinema at the 2011 Shanghai International Film Festival. In 2013, she was invited to inaugurate the 44th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa. In 2015, Sarandon received the Goldene Kamera international lifetime achievement award.\nSarandon has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for the following films:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (HR) on behalf of ARD.\nBroadcasters from ten countries participated in the contest, with Austria, Denmark, and the United Kingdom competing for the first time and joining the original seven participating countries from the first contest in 1956. A number of changes to the rules from the previous year's event were enacted, with each country now represented by only one song, which could be performed by up to two performers on stage. The voting system received an overhaul, with each country's jury now comprising ten individuals which awarded one vote each to their favourite song. The results of the voting were now conducted in public, with a scoreboard introduced to allow the process to be followed by viewers and listeners at home. Jurors were also for the first time not allowed to vote for the song from their own country.\nThe winner of the contest was the Netherlands, with the song \"\" performed by Corry Brokken. This was Brokken's second appearance as a participant, after previously representing the Netherlands in 1956; her victory marked the first of five Dutch wins in the contest as of 2025[ [update]].\nLocation.\nThe 1957 contest took place in Frankfurt, West Germany. The selected venue was the , a music hall and former broadcasting studio located in the Dornbusch district, and part of the wider Broadcasting House Dornbusch which serves as the headquarters and main broadcasting facility of the German public broadcaster for the state of Hesse, (HR). The contest was held in front of an audience of around 400 people.\nA new plan for staging the event was invoked ahead of the 1957 contest, with a different broadcaster organising the contest each year, after Switzerland's SRG SSR, which had both hosted the contest and provided the winning entry in 1956, declined to stage it for a second time. Germany was subsequently selected to host the second edition, after Hans-Otto Gr\u00fcnefeldt, TV program director at HR, offered to organise it on behalf of ARD. Frankfurt was selected as host city as early as June 1956 during an EBU meeting in Italy.\nParticipants.\nTen countries participated in the 1957 contest, with the seven countries which took part in the first contest being joined by Austria, Denmark and the United Kingdom in their first appearances. Austria and Denmark had originally planned to compete in 1956, but missed the cut-off date for entry. Initially, Monaco also figured on the list of participants for 1957, but disappeared from the list by 21 February 1957.\nTwo of the participating artists, Switzerland's Lys Assia and the Netherlands' Corry Brokken, had previously competed at the 1956 contest. Brokken was one of the two Dutch participants in that year's contest, competing with the song \", while Assia had performed both of Switzerland's entries, \" and \"\", the latter of which had won the contest.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFormat.\nThe contest was organised and broadcast by HR on behalf of ARD, with Michael Kehlmann serving as director and Willy Berking serving as musical director, leading the during the event. Its costs for broadcaster HR ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 DM. HR took charge of all financial costs, except costs regarding the individual participants (such as travel and accommodation) and costs regarding the international transmission via the Eurovision network. Each participating delegation was allowed to nominate its own musical director to lead the orchestra during the performance of its country's entry, with the host musical director also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor.\nThe stage built in the featured a wooden staircase for the artists and conductors to make their entrance, and a lyre-shaped background for the singers, which should symbolize the history of popular songs since the Middle Ages. The centre of the background contained a removable background, allowing for a different graphic to be used for each nation's performance. The background of the orchestra featured photographs from different European landmarks, such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Colosseum and the Arc de Triomphe. Curtains were used extensively as backgrounds and decorative elements. The entire contest, including the performances and voting, lasted around one hour in total. Held just over nine months after the inaugural contest, the contest date of 3 March remains the earliest date in the calendar year in which the contest has been held.\nA number of changes from the rules of the previous year's contest were enacted in 1957. Each country was now permitted to send only one song to compete, as opposed to the maximum of two in 1956. Up to two people were now allowed on stage during the performance, however no other vocal backing was allowed.\nA new voting system was introduced, with ten individuals in each country giving one vote to their favourite song. In an additional change to the 1956 rules, jurors were not allowed to vote for the song from their own country. A scoreboard was introduced for the first time, and the voting process was now included as part of the broadcast, rather than conducted in secret as in 1956. The inclusion of a voting sequence allowed for more transparency and helped to create dramatic tension. This new aspect of the contest was inspired by the United Kingdom's \"Festival of British Popular Songs\", which included voting by regional juries and the running total being shown on a scoreboard, a telerecording of which was viewed by EBU organisers. Each jury assembled in their own country to follow the contest on television and were then contacted by telephone by the contest's presenter in order to announce their votes, in a change from 1956 when the jurors were co-located to the contest venue. The participating broadcasters had to make sure that the television sets of the national juries were switched off during the voting to prevent jury members being influenced by other countries' results.\nEntries were required to not have been commercially released before 10 February 1957. Each song, as in 1956, was strongly recommended to last no longer than three to three minutes and 30 seconds, however several of the competing entries went beyond this limit. Italy's song, which lasted for five minutes and nine seconds, remains the longest song in the contest's history and, despite heavy protest, was not disqualified. Conversely, the United Kingdom's first entry lasted for one minute and 53 seconds in total, and remained the shortest song to compete in the contest until 2015. Subsequently the restriction on song length was more strictly monitored from 1958 onwards.\nBroadcasters were required to submit the lyrics, scores, and an audio recording of their entries by 17 February 1957. Copies of the lyrics as well as their translation into English or French were forwarded to the national juries and the commentators. The draw that determined the running order was held on 2 March 1957.\nContest overview.\nThe contest was held on 3 March 1957 at 21:00 (CET) and lasted 1 hour. The event was hosted by German actress Anaid Iplicjian.\nThe winner was the Netherlands represented by the song \"\", composed by Guus Jansen, written by Willy van Hemert and performed by Corry Brokken. Notable among this year's participants were Denmark's Birthe Wilke and Gustav Winckler, the first duo to compete in the contest, who made an impact with a passionate on-screen kiss at the end of their performance; and Germany's Margot Hielscher, the first Eurovision act to use a prop during their performance, in this instance a telephone.\nAn award was presented to the winning composer for the first time, taking the form of a medallion, which was awarded at the end of the broadcast by Eberhard Beckmann, director of . The medallion had been commissioned by Deutsches Fernsehen and designed by sculptor Hans Mettel. It featured the Eurovision logo and the words \"Grand Prix 1957\" on one side, and the mythological figure Europa on a bull on the other side.\nSpokespersons.\nEach participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1957 contest are listed below.\nDetailed voting results.\nThe announcement of the results from each country was conducted in reverse order to the order in which each country performed.\nBroadcasts.\nBroadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. In total, the contest was broadcast in 12 countries. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.\nThe 1957 contest is the earliest edition to exist in full in the EBU's archives, as the 1956 edition has survived solely through audio recordings, with some missing segments, and limited video footage of the winning reprise performance through newsreel and other recordings. Although the number of households which had access to a television in Europe continued to grow, this edition, as in the case of the 1956 contest, was still mainly accessed by spectators via radio.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68326", "revid": "157530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68326", "title": "Extended periodic table", "text": "Periodic table of the elements with eight or more periods\nExtended periodic table\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Periodic table (32 columns, micro)/styles.css\"/&gt;\n Element 119 (Uue, marked here) in period 8 (row 8) marks the start of theorisations.\nAn extended periodic table theorizes about chemical elements beyond those currently known and proven. The element with the highest atomic number known is oganesson (\"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0118), which completes the seventh period (row) in the periodic table. All elements in the eighth period and beyond thus remain purely hypothetical.\nElements beyond 118 would be placed in additional periods when discovered, laid out (as with the existing periods) to illustrate periodically recurring trends in the properties of the elements. Any additional periods are expected to contain more elements than the seventh period, as they are calculated to have an additional so-called \"g-block\", containing at least 18 elements with partially filled g-orbitals in each period. An \"eight-period table\" containing this block was suggested by Glenn T. Seaborg in 1969. The first element of the g-block may have atomic number 121, and thus would have the systematic name unbiunium. Despite many searches, no elements in this region have been synthesized or discovered in nature.\nAccording to the orbital approximation in quantum mechanical descriptions of atomic structure, the g-block would correspond to elements with partially filled g-orbitals, but spin\u2013orbit coupling effects reduce the validity of the orbital approximation substantially for elements of high atomic number. Seaborg's version of the extended period had the heavier elements following the pattern set by lighter elements, as it did not take into account relativistic effects. Models that take relativistic effects into account predict that the pattern will be broken. Pekka Pyykk\u00f6 and Burkhard Fricke used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to \"Z\" = 172, and found that several were displaced from the Madelung rule. As a result of uncertainty and variability in predictions of chemical and physical properties of elements beyond 120, there is currently no consensus on their placement in the extended periodic table.\nElements in this region are likely to be highly unstable with respect to radioactive decay and undergo alpha decay or spontaneous fission with extremely short half-lives, though element 126 is hypothesized to be within an island of stability that is resistant to fission but not to alpha decay. Other islands of stability beyond the known elements may also be possible, including one theorised around element 164, though the extent of stabilizing effects from closed nuclear shells is uncertain. It is not clear how many elements beyond the expected island of stability are physically possible, whether period 8 is complete, or if there is a period 9. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines an element to exist if its lifetime is longer than 10\u221214 seconds (0.01 picoseconds, or 10 femtoseconds), which is the time it takes for the nucleus to form an electron cloud.\nAs early as 1940, it was noted that a simplistic interpretation of the relativistic Dirac equation runs into problems with electron orbitals at \"Z\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a01/\u03b1\u00a0\u2248\u00a0137.036 (the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant), suggesting that neutral atoms cannot exist beyond element 137, and that a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals therefore breaks down at this point. On the other hand, a more rigorous analysis calculates the analogous limit to be \"Z\"\u00a0\u2248\u00a0168\u2013172 where the 1s subshell dives into the Dirac sea, and that it is instead not neutral atoms that cannot exist beyond this point, but bare nuclei, thus posing no obstacle to the further extension of the periodic system. Atoms beyond this critical atomic number are called \"supercritical\" atoms.\nHistory.\nElements beyond the actinides were first proposed to exist as early as 1895, when Danish chemist Hans Peter J\u00f8rgen Julius Thomsen predicted that thorium and uranium formed part of a 32-element period which would end at a chemically inactive element with atomic weight 292 (not far from the 294 for the only known isotope of oganesson). In 1913, Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg similarly predicted that the next noble gas after radon would have atomic number 118, and purely formally derived even heavier congeners of radon at \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0168, 218, 290, 362, and 460, exactly where the Aufbau principle would predict them to be. In 1922, Niels Bohr predicted the electronic structure of this next noble gas at \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0118, and suggested that the reason why elements beyond uranium were not seen in nature was because they were too unstable. The German physicist and engineer Richard Swinne published a review paper in 1926 containing predictions on the transuranic elements (he may have coined the term) in which he anticipated modern predictions of an island of stability: he first hypothesised in 1914 that half-lives should not decrease strictly with atomic number, but suggested instead that there might be some longer-lived elements at \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a098\u2013102 and \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0108\u2013110, and speculated that such elements might exist in the Earth's core, in iron meteorites, or in the ice caps of Greenland where they had been locked up from their supposed cosmic origin. By 1955, these elements were called \"superheavy\" elements.\nThe first predictions on properties of undiscovered superheavy elements were made in 1957, when the concept of nuclear shells was first explored and an island of stability was theorized to exist around element\u00a0126. In 1967, more rigorous calculations were performed, and the island of stability was theorized to be centered at the then-undiscovered flerovium (element 114); this and other subsequent studies motivated many researchers to search for superheavy elements in nature or attempt to synthesize them at accelerators. Many searches for superheavy elements were conducted in the 1970s, all with negative results. As of \u00a02022[ [update]], synthesis has been attempted for every element up to and including unbiseptium (\"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0127), except unbitrium (\"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0123), with the heaviest successfully synthesized element being oganesson in 2002 and the most recent discovery being that of tennessine in 2010.\nAs some superheavy elements were predicted to lie beyond the seven-period periodic table, an additional eighth period containing these elements was first proposed by Glenn T. Seaborg in 1969. This model continued the pattern in established elements and introduced a new g-block and superactinide series beginning at element\u00a0121, raising the number of elements in period 8 compared to known periods. These early calculations failed to consider relativistic effects that break down periodic trends and render simple extrapolation impossible, however. In 1971, Fricke calculated the periodic table up to \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0172, and discovered that some elements indeed had different properties that break the established pattern, and a 2010 calculation by Pekka Pyykk\u00f6 also noted that several elements might behave differently than expected. It is unknown how far the periodic table might extend beyond the known 118 elements, as heavier elements are predicted to be increasingly unstable. Glenn T. Seaborg suggested that practically speaking, the end of the periodic table might come as early as around \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0120 due to nuclear instability.\nPredicted structures of an extended periodic table.\nThere is currently no consensus on the placement of elements beyond atomic number 120 in the periodic table.\nAll hypothetical elements are given an International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) systematic element name, for use until the element has been discovered, confirmed, and an official name is approved. These names are typically not used in the literature, and the elements are instead referred to by their atomic numbers; hence, element 164 is usually not called \"unhexquadium\" or \"Uhq\" (the systematic name and symbol), but rather \"element 164\" with symbol \"164\", \"(164)\", or \"E164\".\nAufbau principle.\nAt element 118, the orbitals 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d and 7p are assumed to be filled, with the remaining orbitals unfilled. A simple extrapolation from the Aufbau principle would predict the eighth row to fill orbitals in the order 8s, 5g, 6f, 7d, 8p; but after element 120, the proximity of the electron shells makes placement in a simple table problematic.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Navbar-header/styles.css\"/&gt;Legend\nFricke.\nNot all models show the higher elements following the pattern established by lighter elements. Burkhard Fricke et al., who carried out calculations up to element 184 in an article published in 1971, also found some elements to be displaced from the Madelung energy-ordering rule as a result of overlapping orbitals; this is caused by the increasing role of relativistic effects in heavy elements (They describe chemical properties up to element 184, but only draw a table to element 172.)\nFricke et al.'s format is more focused on formal electron configurations than likely chemical behaviour. They place elements 156\u2013164 in groups 4\u201312 because formally their configurations should be 7d2 through 7d10. However, they differ from the previous d-elements in that the 8s shell is not available for chemical bonding: instead, the 9s shell is. Thus element 164 with 7d109s0 is noted by Fricke et al. to be analogous to palladium with 4d105s0, and they consider elements 157\u2013172 to have chemical analogies to groups 3\u201318 (though they are ambivalent on whether elements 165 and 166 are more like group 1 and 2 elements or more like group 11 and 12 elements, respectively). Thus, elements 157\u2013164 are placed in their table in a group that the authors do not think is chemically most analogous.\nNefedov.\nVadim Nefedov, Malvina Trzhaskovskaya, and Victor Yarzhemskii carried out calculations up to 164 (results published in 2006). They considered elements 158 through 164 to be homologues of groups 4 through 10, and not 6 through 12, noting similarities of electron configurations to the period 5 transition metals (e.g. element 159 7d49s1 vs Nb 4d45s1, element 160 7d59s1 vs Mo 4d55s1, element 162 7d79s1 vs Ru 4d75s1, element 163 7d89s1 vs Rh 4d85s1, element 164 7d109s0 vs Pd 4d105s0). They thus agree with Fricke et al. on the chemically most analogous groups, but differ from them in that Nefedov et al. actually place elements in the chemically most analogous groups. Rg and Cn are given an asterisk to reflect differing configurations from Au and Hg (in the original publication they are drawn as being displaced in the third dimension). In fact Cn probably has an analogous configuration to Hg, and the difference in configuration between Pt and Ds is not marked.\nPyykk\u00f6.\nPekka Pyykk\u00f6 used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0172 and their possible chemical properties in an article published in 2011. He reproduced the orbital order of Fricke et al., and proposed a refinement of their table by formally assigning slots to elements 121\u2013164 based on ionic configurations.\nIn order to bookkeep the electrons, Pyykk\u00f6 places some elements out of order: thus 139 and 140 are placed in groups 13 and 14 to reflect that the 8p1/2 shell needs to fill, and he distinguishes separate 5g, 8p1/2, and 6f series. Fricke et al. and Nefedov et al. do not attempt to break up these series.\nKulsha.\nComputational chemist Andrey Kulsha has suggested two forms of the extended periodic table up to 172 that build on and refine Nefedov et al.'s versions up to 164 with reference to Pyykk\u00f6's calculations. Based on their likely chemical properties, elements 157\u2013172 are placed by both forms as eighth-period congeners of yttrium through xenon in the fifth period; this extends Nefedov et al.'s placement of 157\u2013164 under yttrium through palladium, and agrees with the chemical analogies given by Fricke et al.\nKulsha suggested two ways to deal with elements 121\u2013156, that lack precise analogues among earlier elements. In his first form (2011, after Pyykk\u00f6's paper was published), elements 121\u2013138 and 139\u2013156 are placed as two separate rows (together called \"ultransition elements\"), related by the addition of a 5g18 subshell into the core, as according to Pyykk\u00f6's calculations of oxidation states, they should, respectively, mimic lanthanides and actinides. In his second suggestion (2016), elements 121\u2013142 form a g-block (as they have 5g activity), while elements 143\u2013156 form an f-block placed under actinium through nobelium.\nThus, period 8 emerges with 54 elements, and the next noble element after 118 is 172.\nSmits et al..\nIn 2023, Smits, D\u00fcllmann, Indelicato, Nazarewicz, and Schwerdtfeger made another attempt to place elements from 119 to 170 in the periodic table based on their electron configurations. The configurations of a few elements (121\u2013124 and 168) did not allow them to be placed unambiguously. Element 145 appears twice, some places have double occupancy, and others are empty.\nSearches for undiscovered elements.\nSynthesis attempts.\nAttempts have been made to synthesize the period 8 elements up to unbiseptium, except unbitrium. All such attempts have been unsuccessful. An attempt to synthesize ununennium, the first period 8 element, is ongoing as of 2025[ [update]].\nUnunennium (E119).\nThe synthesis of element 119 (ununennium) was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium-254 with calcium-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California:\nEs + Ca \u2192 302119* \u2192 no atoms\nNo atoms were identified, leading to a limiting cross section of 300 nb. Later calculations suggest that the cross section of the 3n reaction (which would result in 299119 and three neutrons as products) would actually be six hundred thousand times lower than this upper bound, at 0.5\u00a0pb.\nFrom April to September 2012, an attempt to synthesize the isotopes 295119 and 296119 was made by bombarding a target of berkelium-249 with titanium-50 at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. Based on the theoretically predicted cross section, it was expected that an ununennium atom would be synthesized within five months of the beginning of the experiment. Moreover, as berkelium-249 decays to californium-249 (the next element) with a short half-life of 327\u00a0days, this allowed elements 119 and 120 to be searched for simultaneously.\nBk + Ti \u2192 299119* \u2192 no atoms\nThe experiment was originally planned to continue to November 2012, but was stopped early to make use of the 249Bk target to confirm the synthesis of tennessine (thus changing the projectiles to 48Ca). This reaction of 249Bk + 50Ti was predicted to be the most favorable practical reaction for formation of element 119, as it is rather asymmetrical, though also somewhat cold. (254Es + 48Ca would be superior, but preparing milligram quantities of 254Es for a target is difficult.) Nevertheless, the necessary change from the \"silver bullet\" 48Ca to 50Ti divides the expected yield of element 119 by about twenty, as the yield is strongly dependent on the asymmetry of the fusion reaction.\nDue to the predicted short half-lives, the GSI team used new \"fast\" electronics capable of registering decay events within microseconds. No atoms of element 119 were identified, implying a limiting cross section of 70\u00a0fb. The predicted actual cross section is around 40\u00a0fb, which is at the limits of current technology.\nThe team at RIKEN in Wak\u014d, Japan began bombarding curium-248 targets with a vanadium-51 beam in January 2018 to search for element 119. Curium was chosen as a target, rather than heavier berkelium or californium, as these heavier targets are difficult to prepare. The 248Cm targets were provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. RIKEN developed a high-intensity vanadium beam. The experiment began at a cyclotron while RIKEN upgraded its linear accelerators; the upgrade was completed in 2020. Bombardment may be continued with both machines until the first event is observed; the experiment is currently running intermittently for at least 100 days a year. The RIKEN team's efforts are being financed by the Emperor of Japan. The team at the JINR plans to attempt synthesis of element 119 in the future, probably via the 243Am + 54Cr reaction, but a precise timeframe has not been publicly released.\nUnbinilium (E120).\nFollowing their success in obtaining oganesson by the reaction between 249Cf and 48Ca in 2006, the team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna started similar experiments in March\u2013April 2007, in hope of creating element 120 (unbinilium) from nuclei of 58Fe and 244Pu. Isotopes of unbinilium are predicted to have alpha decay half-lives of the order of microseconds. Initial analysis revealed that no atoms of element 120 were produced, providing a limit of 400\u00a0fb for the cross section at the energy studied.\nPu + Fe \u2192 302120* \u2192 no atoms\nThe Russian team planned to upgrade their facilities before attempting the reaction again.\nIn April 2007, the team at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, attempted to create element 120 using uranium-238 and nickel-64:\nU + Ni \u2192 302120* \u2192 no atoms\nNo atoms were detected, providing a limit of 1.6\u00a0pb for the cross section at the energy provided. The GSI repeated the experiment with higher sensitivity in three separate runs in April\u2013May 2007, January\u2013March 2008, and September\u2013October 2008, all with negative results, reaching a cross section limit of 90\u00a0fb.\nIn June\u2013July 2010, and again in 2011, after upgrading their equipment to allow the use of more radioactive targets, scientists at the GSI attempted the more asymmetrical fusion reaction:\nCm + Cr \u2192 302120 \u2192 no atoms\nIt was expected that the change in reaction would quintuple the probability of synthesizing element 120, as the yield of such reactions is strongly dependent on their asymmetry. Three correlated signals were observed that matched the predicted alpha decay energies of 299120 and its daughter 295Og, as well as the experimentally known decay energy of its granddaughter 291Lv. However, the lifetimes of these possible decays were much longer than expected, and the results could not be confirmed.\nIn August\u2013October 2011, a different team at the GSI using the TASCA facility tried a new, even more asymmetrical reaction:\nCf + Ti \u2192 299120* \u2192 no atoms\nThis was also tried unsuccessfully the next year during the aforementioned attempt to make element 119 in the 249Bk+50Ti reaction, as 249Bk decays to 249Cf. Because of its asymmetry, the reaction between 249Cf and 50Ti was predicted to be the most favorable practical reaction for synthesizing unbinilium, although it is also somewhat cold. No unbinilium atoms were identified, implying a limiting cross-section of 200\u00a0fb. Jens Volker Kratz predicted the actual maximum cross-section for producing element 120 by any of these reactions to be around 0.1\u00a0fb; in comparison, the world record for the smallest cross section of a successful reaction was 30\u00a0fb for the reaction 209Bi(70Zn,n)278Nh, and Kratz predicted a maximum cross-section of 20\u00a0fb for producing the neighbouring element 119. If these predictions are accurate, then synthesizing element 119 would be at the limits of current technology, and synthesizing element 120 would require new methods.\nIn May 2021, the JINR announced plans to investigate the 249Cf+50Ti reaction in their new facility. However, the 249Cf target would have had to be made by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, collaboration between the JINR and other institutes completely ceased due to sanctions. Consequently, the JINR now plans to try the 248Cm+54Cr reaction instead. A preparatory experiment for the use of 54Cr projectiles was conducted in late 2023, successfully synthesising 288Lv in the 238U+54Cr reaction, and the hope is for experiments to synthesise element 120 to begin by 2025.\nStarting from 2022, plans have also been made to use 88-inch cyclotron in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California, United States to attempt to make new elements using 50Ti projectiles. First, the 244Pu+50Ti reaction was tested, successfully creating two atoms of 290Lv in 2024. Since this was successful, an attempt to make element 120 in the 249Cf+50Ti reaction began in 2025. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), which previously collaborated with the JINR, is collaborating with the LBNL on this project.\nUnbiunium (E121).\nThe synthesis of element 121 (unbiunium) was first attempted in 1977 by bombarding a target of uranium-238 with copper-65 ions at the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany:\nU + Cu \u2192 303121* \u2192 no atoms\nNo atoms were identified.\nUnbibium (E122).\nThe first attempts to synthesize element 122 (unbibium) were performed in 1972 by Flerov et al. at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), using the heavy-ion induced hot fusion reactions:\nU + Zn \u2192 304, 306122* \u2192 no atoms\nThese experiments were motivated by early predictions on the existence of an island of stability at \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0184 and \"Z\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0120. No atoms were detected and a yield limit of 5\u00a0nb (5,000\u00a0pb) was measured. Current results (see flerovium) have shown that the sensitivity of these experiments were too low by at least 3 orders of magnitude.\nIn 2000, the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research performed a very similar experiment with much higher sensitivity:\nU + Zn \u2192 308122* \u2192 no atoms\nThese results indicate that the synthesis of such heavier elements remains a significant challenge and further improvements of beam intensity and experimental efficiency is required. The sensitivity should be increased to 1\u00a0fb in the future for better quality results.\nAnother unsuccessful attempt to synthesize element 122 was carried out in 1978 at the GSI Helmholtz Center, where a natural erbium target was bombarded with xenon-136 ions:\nEr + Xe \u2192 298, 300, 302, 303, 304, 306122* \u2192 no atoms\nIn particular, the reaction between 170Er and 136Xe was expected to yield alpha-emitters with half-lives of microseconds that would decay down to isotopes of flerovium with half-lives perhaps increasing up to several hours, as flerovium is predicted to lie near the center of the island of stability. After twelve hours of irradiation, nothing was found in this reaction. Following a similar unsuccessful attempt to synthesize element 121 from 238U and 65Cu, it was concluded that half-lives of superheavy nuclei must be less than one microsecond or the cross sections are very small. More recent research into synthesis of superheavy elements suggests that both conclusions are true. The two attempts in the 1970s to synthesize element 122 were both propelled by the research investigating whether superheavy elements could potentially be naturally occurring.\nSeveral experiments studying the fission characteristics of various superheavy compound nuclei such as 306122* were performed between 2000 and 2004 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions. Two nuclear reactions were used, namely 248Cm + 58Fe and 242Pu + 64Ni. The results reveal how superheavy nuclei fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (\"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a050, \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a082). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, suggesting a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.\nUnbiquadium (E124).\nScientists at GANIL (Grand Acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur National d'Ions Lourds) attempted to measure the direct and delayed fission of compound nuclei of elements with \"Z\" = 114, 120, and 124 in order to probe shell effects in this region and to pinpoint the next spherical proton shell. This is because having complete nuclear shells (or, equivalently, having a magic number of protons or neutrons) would confer more stability on the nuclei of such superheavy elements, thus moving closer to the island of stability. In 2006, with full results published in 2008, the team provided results from a reaction involving the bombardment of a natural germanium target with uranium ions:\nU + Ge \u2192 308, 310, 311, 312, 314124* \u2192 \"fission\"\nThe team reported that they had been able to identify compound nuclei fissioning with half-lives &gt; 10\u221218 s. This result suggests a strong stabilizing effect at \"Z\" = 124 and points to the next proton shell at \"Z\" &gt; 120, not at \"Z\" = 114 as previously thought. A compound nucleus is a loose combination of nucleons that have not arranged themselves into nuclear shells yet. It has no internal structure and is held together only by the collision forces between the target and projectile nuclei. It is estimated that it requires around 10\u221214\u00a0s for the nucleons to arrange themselves into nuclear shells, at which point the compound nucleus becomes a nuclide, and this number is used by IUPAC as the minimum half-life a claimed isotope must have to potentially be recognised as being discovered. Thus, the GANIL experiments do not count as a discovery of element 124.\nThe fission of the compound nucleus 312124 was also studied in 2006 at the tandem ALPI heavy-ion accelerator at the Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro (Legnaro National Laboratories) in Italy:\nTh + Se \u2192 312124* \u2192 \"fission\"\nSimilarly to previous experiments conducted at the JINR (Joint Institute for Nuclear Research), fission fragments clustered around doubly magic nuclei such as 132Sn (\"Z\" = 50, \"N\" = 82), revealing a tendency for superheavy nuclei to expel such doubly magic nuclei in fission. The average number of neutrons per fission from the 312124 compound nucleus (relative to lighter systems) was also found to increase, confirming that the trend of heavier nuclei emitting more neutrons during fission continues into the superheavy mass region.\nUnbipentium (E125).\nThe first and only attempt to synthesize element 125 (unbipentium) was conducted in Dubna in 1970\u20131971 using zinc ions and an americium-243 target:\nAm + Zn \u2192 309, 311125* \u2192 no atoms\nNo atoms were detected, and a cross section limit of 5 nb was determined. This experiment was motivated by the possibility of greater stability for nuclei around \"Z\"\u00a0~\u00a0126 and \"N\"\u00a0~\u00a0184, though more recent research suggests the island of stability may instead lie at a lower atomic number (such as copernicium, \"Z\" = 112), and the synthesis of heavier elements such as element 125 will require more sensitive experiments.\nUnbihexium (E126).\nThe first and only attempt to synthesize element 126 (unbihexium), which was unsuccessful, was performed in 1971 at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) by Ren\u00e9 Bimbot and John M. Alexander using the hot fusion reaction:\nTh + Kr \u2192 316126* \u2192 no atoms\nHigh-energy (13\u201315\u00a0MeV) alpha particles were observed and taken as possible evidence for the synthesis of element 126. Subsequent unsuccessful experiments with higher sensitivity suggest that the 10\u00a0mb sensitivity of this experiment was too low; hence, the formation of element 126 nuclei in this reaction is highly unlikely.\nUnbiseptium (E127).\nThe first and only attempt to synthesize element 127 (unbiseptium), which was unsuccessful, was performed in 1978 at the UNILAC accelerator at the GSI Helmholtz Center, where a natural tantalum target was bombarded with xenon-136 ions:\nTa + Xe \u2192 316, 317127* \u2192 no atoms\nSearches in nature.\nA study in 1976 by a group of American researchers from several universities proposed that primordial superheavy elements, mainly livermorium, elements 124, 126, and 127, could be a cause of unexplained radiation damage (particularly radiohalos) in minerals. This prompted many researchers to search for them in nature from 1976 to 1983. A group led by Tom Cahill, a professor at the University of California at Davis, claimed in 1976 that they had detected alpha particles and X-rays with the right energies to cause the damage observed, supporting the presence of these elements. In particular, the presence of long-lived (on the order of 109 years) nuclei of elements 124 and 126, along with their decay products, at an abundance of 10\u221211 relative to their possible congeners uranium and plutonium, was conjectured. Others claimed that none had been detected, and questioned the proposed characteristics of primordial superheavy nuclei. In particular, they cited that any such superheavy nuclei must have a closed neutron shell at \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0184 or \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0228, and this necessary condition for enhanced stability only exists in neutron deficient isotopes of livermorium or neutron rich isotopes of the other elements that would not be beta-stable unlike most naturally occurring isotopes. This activity was also proposed to be caused by nuclear transmutations in natural cerium, raising further ambiguity upon this claimed observation of superheavy elements.\nOn April 24, 2008, a group led by Amnon Marinov at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem claimed to have found single atoms of 292122 in naturally occurring thorium deposits at an abundance of between 10\u221211 and 10\u221212 relative to thorium. The claim of Marinov et al. was criticized by a part of the scientific community. Marinov claimed that he had submitted the article to the journals \"Nature\" and \"Nature Physics\" but both turned it down without sending it for peer review. The 292122 atoms were claimed to be superdeformed or hyperdeformed isomers, with a half-life of at least 100 million years.\nA criticism of the technique, previously used in purportedly identifying lighter thorium isotopes by mass spectrometry, was published in \"Physical Review C\" in 2008. A rebuttal by the Marinov group was published in \"Physical Review C\" after the published comment.\nA repeat of the thorium experiment using the superior method of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) failed to confirm the results, despite a 100-fold better sensitivity. This result throws considerable doubt on the results of the Marinov collaboration with regard to their claims of long-lived isotopes of thorium, roentgenium and element 122. It is still possible that traces of unbibium might only exist in some thorium samples, although this is unlikely.\nThe possible extent of primordial superheavy elements on Earth today is uncertain. Even if they are confirmed to have caused the radiation damage long ago, they might now have decayed to mere traces, or even be completely gone. It is also uncertain if such superheavy nuclei may be produced naturally at all, as spontaneous fission is expected to terminate the r-process responsible for heavy element formation between mass number 270 and 290, well before elements beyond 120 may be formed.\nA recent hypothesis tries to explain the spectrum of Przybylski's Star by naturally occurring flerovium and element 120.\nPredicted properties of eighth-period elements.\nElement 118, oganesson, is the heaviest element that has been synthesized. The next two elements, elements 119 and 120, should form an 8s series and be an alkali and alkaline earth metal, respectively. Beyond element 120, the superactinide series is expected to begin, when the 8s electrons and the filling of the 8p1/2, 7d3/2, 6f, and 5g subshells determine the chemistry of these elements. Complete and accurate CCSD calculations are not available for elements beyond 122 because of the extreme complexity of the situation: the 5g, 6f, and 7d orbitals should have about the same energy level, and in the region of element 160, the 9s, 8p3/2, and 9p1/2 orbitals should also be about equal in energy. This will cause the electron shells to mix so that the block concept no longer applies very well, and will also result in novel chemical properties that will make positioning some of these elements in a periodic table very difficult.\n\nChemical and physical properties.\nElements 119 and 120.\nThe first two elements of period\u00a08 will be ununennium and unbinilium, elements 119 and 120. Their electron configurations should have the 8s orbital being filled. This orbital is relativistically stabilized and contracted; thus, elements\u00a0119 and 120 should be more like rubidium and strontium than their immediate neighbours above, francium and radium. Another effect of the relativistic contraction of the 8s orbital is that the atomic radii of these two elements should be about the same as those of francium and radium. They should behave like normal alkali and alkaline earth metals (albeit less reactive than their immediate vertical neighbours), normally forming +1 and +2 oxidation states, respectively, but the relativistic destabilization of the 7p3/2 subshell and the relatively low ionization energies of the 7p3/2 electrons should make higher oxidation states like +3 and +4 (respectively) possible as well.\nSuperactinides.\nThe superactinides may range from elements 121 through 157, which can be classified as the 5g and 6f elements of the eighth period, together with the first 7d element. In the superactinide series, the 7d3/2, 8p1/2, 6f5/2 and 5g7/2 shells should all fill simultaneously. This creates very complicated situations, so much so that complete and accurate CCSD calculations have been done only for elements 121 and 122. The first superactinide, unbiunium or eka-actinium (element 121), should be similar to lanthanum and actinium: its main oxidation state should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just as in elements 119 and 120. Relativistic stabilization of the 8p subshell should result in a ground-state 8s28p1 valence electron configuration for element 121, in contrast to the ds2 configurations of lanthanum and actinium; nevertheless, this anomalous configuration does not appear to affect its calculated chemistry, which remains similar to that of actinium. Its first ionization energy is predicted to be 429.4\u00a0kJ/mol, which would be lower than those of all known elements except for the alkali metals potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium: this value is even lower than that of the period 8 alkali metal ununennium (463.1\u00a0kJ/mol). Similarly, the next superactinide, unbibium or eka-thorium (element 122), may be similar to cerium and thorium, with a main oxidation state of +4, but would have a ground-state 7d18s28p1 or 8s28p2 valence electron configuration, unlike thorium's 6d27s2 configuration. Hence, its first ionization energy would be smaller than thorium's (Th: 6.3\u00a0eV; element 122: 5.6\u00a0eV) because of the greater ease of ionizing unbibium's 8p1/2 electron than thorium's 6d electron. The collapse of the 5g orbital itself is delayed until around element 125 (unbipentium or eka-neptunium); the electron configurations of the 119-electron isoelectronic series are expected to be [Og]8s1 for elements 119 through 122, [Og]6f1 for elements 123 and 124, and [Og]5g1 for element 125 onwards.\nIn the first few superactinides, the binding energies of the added electrons are predicted to be small enough that they can lose all their valence electrons; for example, unbihexium (element 126) could easily form a +8 oxidation state, and even higher oxidation states for the next few elements may be possible. Element 126 is also predicted to display a variety of other oxidation states: recent calculations have suggested a stable monofluoride 126F may be possible, resulting from a bonding interaction between the 5g\u00a0orbital on element 126 and the 2p\u00a0orbital on fluorine. Other predicted oxidation states include +2, +4, and +6; +4 is expected to be the most usual oxidation state of unbihexium. The superactinides from unbipentium (element 125) to unbiennium (element 129) are predicted to exhibit a +6 oxidation state and form hexafluorides, though 125F6 and 126F6 are predicted to be relatively weakly bound. The bond dissociation energies are expected to greatly increase at element 127 and even more so at element 129. This suggests a shift from strong ionic character in fluorides of element 125 to more covalent character, involving the 8p orbital, in fluorides of element 129. The bonding in these superactinide hexafluorides is mostly between the highest 8p subshell of the superactinide and the 2p subshell of fluorine, unlike how uranium uses its 5f and 6d orbitals for bonding in uranium hexafluoride.\nDespite the ability of early superactinides to reach high oxidation states, it has been calculated that the 5g electrons will be most difficult to ionize; the 1256+ and 1267+ ions are expected to bear a 5g1 configuration, similar to the 5f1 configuration of the Np6+ ion. Similar behavior is observed in the low chemical activity of the 4f electrons in lanthanides; this is a consequence of the 5g orbitals being small and deeply buried in the electron cloud. The presence of electrons in g-orbitals, which do not exist in the ground state electron configuration of any currently known element, should allow presently unknown hybrid orbitals to form and influence the chemistry of the superactinides in new ways, although the absence of \"g\" electrons in known elements makes predicting superactinide chemistry more difficult.\nIn the later superactinides, the oxidation states should become lower. By element 132, the predominant most stable oxidation state will be only +6; this is further reduced to +3 and +4 by element 144, and at the end of the superactinide series it will be only +2 (and possibly even 0) because the 6f shell, which is being filled at that point, is deep inside the electron cloud and the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are bound too strongly to be chemically active. The 5g shell should be filled at element 144 and the 6f shell at around element 154, and at this region of the superactinides the 8p1/2 electrons are bound so strongly that they are no longer active chemically, so that only a few electrons can participate in chemical reactions. Calculations by Fricke et al. predict that at element 154, the 6f shell is full and there are no d- or other electron wave functions outside the chemically inactive 8s and 8p1/2 shells. This may cause element 154 to be rather unreactive with noble gas-like properties. Calculations by Pyykk\u00f6 nonetheless expect that at element 155, the 6f shell is still chemically ionizable: 1553+ should have a full 6f shell, and the fourth ionization potential should be between those of terbium and dysprosium, both of which are known in the +4 state.\nSimilarly to the lanthanide and actinide contractions, there should be a superactinide contraction in the superactinide series where the ionic radii of the superactinides are smaller than expected. In the lanthanides, the contraction is about 4.4\u00a0pm per element; in the actinides, it is about 3\u00a0pm per element. The contraction is larger in the lanthanides than in the actinides due to the greater localization of the 4f wave function as compared to the 5f wave function. Comparisons with the wave functions of the outer electrons of the lanthanides, actinides, and superactinides lead to a prediction of a contraction of about 2\u00a0pm per element in the superactinides; although this is smaller than the contractions in the lanthanides and actinides, its total effect is larger due to the fact that 32 electrons are filled in the deeply buried 5g and 6f shells, instead of just 14 electrons being filled in the 4f and 5f shells in the lanthanides and actinides, respectively.\nPekka Pyykk\u00f6 divides these superactinides into three series: a 5g series (elements 121 to 138), an 8p1/2 series (elements 139 to 140), and a 6f series (elements 141 to 155), also noting that there would be a great deal of overlapping between energy levels and that the 6f, 7d, or 8p1/2 orbitals could well also be occupied in the early superactinide atoms or ions. He also expects that they would behave more like \"superlanthanides\", in the sense that the 5g electrons would mostly be chemically inactive, similarly to how only one or two 4f electrons in each lanthanide are ever ionized in chemical compounds. He also predicted that the possible oxidation states of the superactinides might rise very high in the 6f series, to values such as +12 in element 148.\nAndrey Kulsha has called the elements 121 to 156 \"ultransition\" elements and has proposed to split them into two series of eighteen each, one from elements 121 to 138 and another from elements 139 to 156. The first would be analogous to the lanthanides, with oxidation states mainly ranging from +4 to +6, as the filling of the 5g shell dominates and neighbouring elements are very similar to each other, creating an analogy to uranium, neptunium, and plutonium. The second would be analogous to the actinides: at the beginning (around elements in the 140s) very high oxidation states would be expected as the 6f shell rises above the 7d one, but after that the typical oxidation states would lower and in elements in the 150s onwards the 8p1/2 electrons would stop being chemically active. Because the two rows are separated by the addition of a complete 5g18 subshell, they could be considered analogues of each other as well.\nAs an example from the late superactinides, element 156 is expected to exhibit mainly the +2 oxidation state, on account of its electron configuration with easily removed 7d2 electrons over a stable [Og]5g186f148s28p core. It can thus be considered a heavier congener of nobelium, which likewise has a pair of easily removed 7s2 electrons over a stable [Rn]5f14 core, and is usually in the +2 state (strong oxidisers are required to obtain nobelium in the +3 state). Its first ionization energy should be about 400\u00a0kJ/mol and its metallic radius approximately 170\u00a0picometers. With a relative atomic mass of around 445\u00a0Da, it should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 26\u00a0g/cm3.\nElements 157 to 166.\nThe 7d transition metals in period 8 are expected to be elements 157 to 166. Although the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are bound so strongly in these elements that they should not be able to take part in any chemical reactions, the 9s and 9p1/2 levels are expected to be readily available for hybridization. These 7d elements should be similar to the 4d elements yttrium through cadmium. In particular, element 164 with a 7d109s0 electron configuration shows clear analogies with palladium with its 4d105s0 electron configuration.\nThe noble metals of this series of transition metals are not expected to be as noble as their lighter homologues, due to the absence of an outer \"s\" shell for shielding and also because the 7d shell is strongly split into two subshells due to relativistic effects. This causes the first ionization energies of the 7d transition metals to be smaller than those of their lighter congeners.\nTheoretical interest in the chemistry of unhexquadium is largely motivated by theoretical predictions that it, especially the isotopes 472164 and 482164 (with 164 protons and 308 or 318 neutrons), would be at the center of a hypothetical second island of stability (the first being centered on copernicium, particularly the isotopes 291Cn, 293Cn, and 296Cn which are expected to have half-lives of centuries or millennia).\nCalculations predict that the 7d electrons of element 164 (unhexquadium) should participate very readily in chemical reactions, so that it should be able to show stable +6 and +4 oxidation states in addition to the normal +2 state in aqueous solutions with strong ligands. Element 164 should thus be able to form compounds like 164(CO)4, 164(PF3)4 (both tetrahedral like the corresponding palladium compounds), and 164(CN)22- (linear), which is very different behavior from that of lead, which element 164 would be a heavier homologue of if not for relativistic effects. Nevertheless, the divalent state would be the main one in aqueous solution (although the +4 and +6 states would be possible with stronger ligands), and unhexquadium(II) should behave more similarly to lead than unhexquadium(IV) and unhexquadium(VI).\nElement 164 is expected to be a soft Lewis acid and have Ahrlands softness parameter close to 4\u00a0eV. It should be at most moderately reactive, having a first ionization energy that should be around 685\u00a0kJ/mol, comparable to that of molybdenum. Due to the lanthanide, actinide, and superactinide contractions, element 164 should have a metallic radius of only 158\u00a0pm, very close to that of the much lighter magnesium, despite its expected atomic weight of around , which is about 19.5\u00a0times the atomic weight of magnesium. This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46\u00a0g\u00b7cm\u22123, over twice that of osmium, currently the most dense element known, at 22.61\u00a0g\u00b7cm\u22123; element 164 should be the second most dense element in the first 172 elements in the periodic table, with only its neighbor unhextrium (element 163) being more dense (at 47\u00a0g\u00b7cm\u22123). Metallic element 164 should have a very large cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) due to its covalent bonds, most probably resulting in a high melting point. In the metallic state, element 164 should be quite noble and analogous to palladium and platinum. Fricke et al. suggested some formal similarities to oganesson, as both elements have closed-shell configurations and similar ionisation energies, although they note that while oganesson would be a very bad noble gas, element 164 would be a good noble metal.\nElements 165 (unhexpentium) and 166 (unhexhexium), the last two 7d metals, should behave similarly to alkali and alkaline earth metals when in the +1 and +2 oxidation states, respectively. The 9s electrons should have ionization energies comparable to those of the 3s electrons of sodium and magnesium, due to relativistic effects causing the 9s electrons to be much more strongly bound than non-relativistic calculations would predict. Elements 165 and 166 should normally exhibit the +1 and +2 oxidation states, respectively, although the ionization energies of the 7d electrons are low enough to allow higher oxidation states like +3 for element 165. The oxidation state +4 for element 166 is less likely, creating a situation similar to the lighter elements in groups 11 and 12 (particularly gold and mercury). As with mercury but not copernicium, ionization of element 166 to 1662+ is expected to result in a 7d10 configuration corresponding to the loss of the s-electrons but not the d-electrons, making it more analogous to the lighter \"less relativistic\" group 12 elements zinc, cadmium, and mercury.\n\nElements 167 to 172.\nThe next six elements on the periodic table are expected to be the last main-group elements in their period, and are likely to be similar to the 5p elements indium through xenon. In elements 167 to 172, the 9p1/2 and 8p3/2 shells will be filled. Their energy eigenvalues are so close together that they behave as one combined p-subshell, similar to the non-relativistic 2p and 3p subshells. Thus, the inert-pair effect does not occur and the most common oxidation states of elements 167 to 170 are expected to be +3, +4, +5, and +6, respectively. Element 171 (unseptunium) is expected to show some similarities to the halogens, showing various oxidation states ranging from \u22121 to +7, although its physical properties are expected to be closer to that of a metal. Its electron affinity is expected to be 3.0\u00a0eV, allowing it to form H171, analogous to a hydrogen halide. The 171\u2212 ion is expected to be a soft base, comparable to iodide (I\u2212). Element 172 (unseptbium) is expected to be a noble gas with chemical behaviour similar to that of xenon, as their ionization energies should be very similar (Xe, 1170.4\u00a0kJ/mol; element 172, 1090\u00a0kJ/mol). The only main difference between them is that element 172, unlike xenon, is expected to be a liquid or a solid at standard temperature and pressure due to its much higher atomic weight. Unseptbium is expected to be a strong Lewis acid, forming fluorides and oxides, similarly to its lighter congener xenon.\nBecause of some analogy of elements 165\u2013172 to periods 2 and 3, Fricke et al. considered them to form a ninth period of the periodic table, while the eighth period was taken by them to end at the noble metal element 164. This ninth period would be similar to the second and third period in having no transition metals. That being said, the analogy is incomplete for elements 165 and 166; although they do start a new s-shell (9s), this is above a d-shell, making them chemically more similar to groups 11 and 12.\n\nBeyond element 172.\nBeyond element 172, there is the potential to fill the 6g, 7f, 8d, 10s, 10p1/2, and perhaps 6h11/2 shells. These electrons would be very loosely bound, potentially rendering extremely high oxidation states reachable, though the electrons would become more tightly bound as the ionic charge rises. Thus, there will probably be another very long transition series, like the superactinides.\nIn element 173 (unsepttrium), the outermost electron might enter the 6g7/2, 9p3/2, or 10s subshells. Because spin\u2013orbit interactions would create a very large energy gap between these and the 8p3/2 subshell, this outermost electron is expected to be very loosely bound and very easily lost to form a 173+ cation. As a result, element 173 is expected to behave chemically like an alkali metal, and one that might be far more reactive than even caesium (francium and element 119 being less reactive than caesium due to relativistic effects): the calculated ionisation energy for element 173 is 3.070\u00a0eV, compared to the experimentally known 3.894\u00a0eV for caesium. Element 174 (unseptquadium) may add an 8d electron and form a closed-shell 1742+ cation; its calculated ionisation energy is 3.614\u00a0eV.\nElement 184 (unoctquadium) was significantly targeted in early predictions, as it was originally speculated that 184 would be a proton magic number: it is predicted to have an electron configuration of [172] 6g5 7f4 8d3, with at least the 7f and 8d electrons chemically active. Its chemical behaviour is expected to be similar to uranium and neptunium, as further ionisation past the +6 state (corresponding to removal of the 6g electrons) is likely to be unprofitable; the +4 state should be most common in aqueous solution, with +5 and +6 reachable in solid compounds.\nEnd of the periodic table.\nThe number of physically possible elements is unknown. A low estimate is that the periodic table may end soon after the island of stability, which is expected to center on \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclide tables is restricted by the proton and the neutron drip lines and stability toward alpha decay and spontaneous fission. One calculation by Y. Gambhir \"et al.\", analyzing nuclear binding energy and stability in various decay channels, suggests a limit to the existence of bound nuclei at \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0146. Other predictions of an end to the periodic table include \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0128 (John Emsley) and \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0155 (Albert Khazan).\nElements above the atomic number 137.\nIt is a \"folk legend\" among physicists that Richard Feynman suggested that neutral atoms could not exist for atomic numbers greater than \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0137, on the grounds that the relativistic Dirac equation predicts that the ground-state energy of the innermost electron in such an atom would be an imaginary number. Here, the number 137 arises as the inverse of the fine-structure constant. By this argument, neutral atoms cannot exist beyond atomic number 137, and therefore a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals breaks down at this point. However, this argument presumes that the atomic nucleus is pointlike. A more accurate calculation must take into account the small, but nonzero, size of the nucleus, which is predicted to push the limit further to \"Z\"\u00a0\u2248\u00a0173.\nBohr model.\nThe Bohr model exhibits difficulty for atoms with atomic number greater than 137, for the speed of an electron in a 1s electron orbital, \"v\", is given by\nformula_1\nwhere \"Z\" is the atomic number, and \"\u03b1\" is the fine-structure constant, a measure of the strength of electromagnetic interactions. Under this approximation, any element with an atomic number of greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be traveling faster than \"c\", the speed of light. Hence, the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.\nRelativistic Dirac equation.\nThe relativistic Dirac equation gives the ground state energy as\nformula_2\nwhere \"m\" is the rest mass of the electron. For \"Z\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0137, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory, rather than bound, and there is no gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds 2\"mc\"2 for \"Z\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0\"Z\"cr probably between 168 and 172. For \"Z\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0\"Z\"cr, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron. This diving of the 1s subshell into the negative continuum has often been taken to constitute an \"end\" to the periodic table, but in fact it does not impose such a limit, as such resonances can be interpreted as Gamow states. Nonetheless, the accurate description of such states in a multi-electron system, needed to extend calculations and the periodic table past \"Z\"cr\u00a0\u2248\u00a0172, are still open problems.\nAtoms with atomic numbers above \"Z\"cr\u00a0\u2248\u00a0172 have been termed \"supercritical\" atoms. Supercritical atoms cannot be totally ionised because their 1s subshell would be filled by spontaneous pair creation in which an electron-positron pair is created from the negative continuum, with the electron being bound and the positron escaping. However, the strong field around the atomic nucleus is restricted to a very small region of space, so that the Pauli exclusion principle forbids further spontaneous pair creation once the subshells that have dived into the negative continuum are filled. Elements 173\u2013184 have been termed \"weakly supercritical\" atoms as for them only the 1s shell has dived into the negative continuum; the 2p1/2 shell is expected to join around element 185 and the 2s shell around element 245. Experiments have so far not succeeded in detecting spontaneous pair creation from assembling supercritical charges through the collision of heavy nuclei (e.g. colliding lead with uranium to momentarily give an effective \"Z\" of 174; uranium with uranium gives effective \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0184 and uranium with californium gives effective \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0190).\nEven though passing \"Z\"cr does not mean elements can no longer exist, the increasing concentration of the 1s density close to the nucleus would likely make these electrons more vulnerable to \"K\" electron capture as \"Z\"cr is approached. For such heavy elements, these 1s electrons would likely spend a significant fraction of time so close to the nucleus that they are actually inside it. This may pose another limit to the periodic table.\nBecause of the factor of \"m\", muonic atoms become supercritical at a much larger atomic number of around 2200, as muons are about 207 times as heavy as electrons.\nQuark matter.\nIt has also been posited that in the region beyond \"A\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0300, an entire \"continent of stability\" consisting of a hypothetical phase of stable quark matter, comprising freely flowing up and down quarks rather than quarks bound into protons and neutrons, may exist. Such a form of matter is theorized to be a ground state of baryonic matter with a greater binding energy per baryon than nuclear matter, favoring the decay of nuclear matter beyond this mass threshold into quark matter. If this state of matter exists, it could possibly be synthesized in the same fusion reactions leading to normal superheavy nuclei, and would be stabilized against fission as a consequence of its stronger binding that is enough to overcome Coulomb repulsion.\nCalculations published in 2020, suggest stability of up-down quark matter (udQM) nuggets against conventional nuclei beyond \"A\"\u00a0~\u00a0266, and also show that udQM nuggets become supercritical earlier (\"Z\"cr\u00a0~\u00a0163, \"A\"\u00a0~\u00a0609) than conventional nuclei (\"Z\"cr\u00a0~\u00a0177, \"A\"\u00a0~\u00a0480).\nNuclear properties.\nMagic numbers and the island of stability.\nThe stability of nuclei decreases greatly with the increase in atomic number after curium, element 96, so that all isotopes with an atomic number above 101 decay radioactively with a half-life under a day. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes. Nevertheless, because of reasons not very well understood yet, there is a slight increased nuclear stability around atomic numbers 110\u2013114, which leads to the appearance of what is known in nuclear physics as the \"island of stability\". This concept, proposed by University of California professor Glenn Seaborg, explains why superheavy elements last longer than predicted.\nCalculations according to the Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013Bogoliubov method using the non-relativistic Skyrme interaction have proposed \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0126 as a closed proton shell. In this region of the periodic table, \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0184, \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0196, and \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0228 have been suggested as closed neutron shells. Therefore, the isotopes of most interest are 310126, 322126, and 354126, for these might be considerably longer-lived than other isotopes. Element 126, having a magic number of protons, is predicted to be more stable than other elements in this region, and may have nuclear isomers with very long half-lives. It is also possible that the island of stability is instead centered at 306122, which may be spherical and doubly magic. Probably, the island of stability occurs around \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0114\u2013126 and \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0184, with lifetimes probably around hours to days. Beyond the shell closure at \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0184, spontaneous fission lifetimes should drastically drop below 10\u221215 seconds \u2013 too short for a nucleus to obtain an electron cloud and participate in any chemistry. That being said, such lifetimes are very model-dependent, and predictions range across many orders of magnitude.\nTaking nuclear deformation and relativistic effects into account, an analysis of single-particle levels predicts new magic numbers for superheavy nuclei at \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0126, 138, 154, and 164 and \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0228, 308, and 318. Therefore, in addition to the island of stability centered at 291Cn, 293Cn, and 298Fl, further islands of stability may exist around the doubly magic 354126 as well as 472164 or 482164. These nuclei are predicted to be beta-stable and decay by alpha emission or spontaneous fission with relatively long half-lives, and confer additional stability on neighboring \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0228 isotones and elements 152\u2013168, respectively. On the other hand, the same analysis suggests that proton shell closures may be relatively weak or even nonexistent in some cases such as 354126, meaning that such nuclei might not be doubly magic and stability will instead be primarily determined by strong neutron shell closures. Additionally, due to the enormously greater forces of electromagnetic repulsion that must be overcome by the strong force at the second island (\"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0164), it is possible that nuclei around this region only exist as resonances and cannot stay together for a meaningful amount of time. It is also possible that some of the superactinides between these series may not actually exist because they are too far from both islands, in which case the periodic table might end around \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0130. The area of elements 121\u2013156 where periodicity is in abeyance is quite similar to the gap between the two islands.\nBeyond element 164, the fissility line defining the limit of stability with respect to spontaneous fission may converge with the neutron drip line, posing a limit to the existence of heavier elements. Nevertheless, further magic numbers have been predicted at \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0210, 274, and 354 and \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0308, 406, 524, 644, and 772, with two beta-stable doubly magic nuclei found at 616210 and 798274; the same calculation method reproduced the predictions for 298Fl and 472164. (The doubly magic nuclei predicted for \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0354 are beta-unstable, with 998354 being neutron-deficient and 1126354 being neutron-rich.) Although additional stability toward alpha decay and fission are predicted for 616210 and 798274, with half-lives up to hundreds of microseconds for 616210, there will not exist islands of stability as significant as those predicted at \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0114 and 164. As the existence of superheavy elements is very strongly dependent on stabilizing effects from closed shells, nuclear instability and fission will likely determine the end of the periodic table beyond these islands of stability.\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines an element to exist if its lifetime is longer than 10\u221214 seconds, which is the time it takes for the nucleus to form an electron cloud. However, a nuclide is generally considered to exist if its lifetime is longer than about 10\u221222 seconds, which is the time it takes for nuclear structure to form. Consequently, it is possible that some \"Z\" values can only be realised in nuclides and that the corresponding elements do not exist.\nIt is also possible that no further islands actually exist beyond 126, as the nuclear shell structure gets smeared out (as the electron shell structure already is expected to be around oganesson) and low-energy decay modes become readily available.\nIn some regions of the table of nuclides, there are expected to be additional regions of stability due to non-spherical nuclei that have different magic numbers than spherical nuclei do; the egg-shaped 270Hs (\"Z\" = 108, \"N\" = 162) is one such deformed doubly magic nucleus. In the superheavy region, the strong Coulomb repulsion of protons may cause some nuclei, including isotopes of oganesson, to assume a bubble shape in the ground state with a reduced central density of protons, unlike the roughly uniform distribution inside most smaller nuclei. Such a shape would have a very low fission barrier, however. Even heavier nuclei in some regions, such as 342136 and 466156, may instead become toroidal or red blood cell-like in shape, with their own magic numbers and islands of stability, but they would also fragment easily.\nPredicted decay properties of undiscovered elements.\nAs the main island of stability is thought to lie around 291Cn and 293Cn, undiscovered elements beyond oganesson may be very unstable and undergo alpha decay or spontaneous fission in microseconds or less. The exact region in which half-lives exceed one microsecond is unknown, though various models suggest that isotopes of elements heavier than unbinilium that may be produced in fusion reactions with available targets and projectiles will have half-lives under one microsecond and therefore may not be detected. It is consistently predicted that there will exist regions of stability at \"N\" = 184 and \"N\" = 228, and possibly also at \"Z\" ~ 124 and \"N\" ~ 198. These nuclei may have half-lives of a few seconds and undergo predominantly alpha decay and spontaneous fission, though minor beta-plus decay (or electron capture) branches may also exist. Outside these regions of enhanced stability, fission barriers are expected to drop significantly due to loss of stabilization effects, resulting in fission half-lives below 10\u221218 seconds, especially in even\u2013even nuclei for which hindrance is even lower due to nucleon pairing. In general, alpha decay half-lives are expected to increase with neutron number, from nanoseconds in the most neutron-deficient isotopes to seconds closer to the beta-stability line. For nuclei with only a few neutrons more than a magic number, binding energy substantially drops, resulting in a break in the trend and shorter half-lives. The most neutron deficient isotopes of these elements may also be unbound and undergo proton emission. Cluster decay (heavy particle emission) has also been proposed as an alternative decay mode for some isotopes, posing yet another hurdle to identification of these elements.\nElectron configurations.\nThe following are expected electron configurations of elements 119\u2013174 and 184. The symbol [Og] indicates the probable electron configuration of oganesson (Z = 118), which is currently the last known element. The configurations of the elements in this table are written starting with [Og] because oganesson is expected to be the last prior element with a closed-shell (inert gas) configuration, 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f14 5d10 6p6 7s2 5f14 6d10 7p6. Similarly, the [172] in the configurations for elements 173, 174, and 184 denotes the likely closed-shell configuration of element 172.\nBeyond element 123, no complete calculations are available and hence the data in this table must be taken as tentative. In the case of element 123, and perhaps also heavier elements, several possible electron configurations are predicted to have very similar energy levels, such that it is very difficult to predict the ground state. All configurations that have been proposed (since it was understood that the Madelung rule probably stops working here) are included.\nThe predicted block assignments up to 172 are Kulsha's, following the expected available valence orbitals. There is, however, not a consensus in the literature as to how the blocks should work after element 138.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born in South Africa and raised in Derbyshire, he rose to prominence in the United Kingdom as a Shakespearean stage actor and went on to appear in more than 70 films, primarily costume dramas, swashbucklers, and, occasionally, horror films.\nRathbone frequently portrayed suave villains or morally ambiguous characters, such as Mr. Murdstone in \"David Copperfield\" (1935), Tybalt in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1936) and Sir Guy of Gisbourne in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). His most famous role was that of Sherlock Holmes in fourteen Hollywood films made between 1939 and 1946 and in a radio series.\nRathbone's later career included roles on Broadway, as well as self-ironic film and television work. In 1948, he shared the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play with two others. He was also nominated for two Academy Awards and honoured with three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nEarly life.\nRathbone was born in Johannesburg, South African Republic, to English parents. His mother, Anna Barbara (\"n\u00e9e\" George), was a violinist, and his father, Edgar Philip Rathbone, was a mining engineer and scion of the Liverpool Rathbone family. He had two older half-brothers, Harold and Horace, as well as two younger siblings, Beatrice and John. Basil was the great-grandson of the noted Victorian philanthropist, William Rathbone V, and thus a descendant of William Rathbone II.\nThe Rathbones fled to Britain when Basil was three years old after his father was accused by the Boers of being a spy following the Jameson Raid. Rathbone attended Repton School in Derbyshire from 1906 to 1910, where he excelled at sports and was given the nickname \"Ratters\" by schoolmates. Thereafter, he was briefly employed as an insurance clerk by the Liverpool and Globe Insurance Companies, to appease his father's wish for him to have a conventional career.\nOn 22 April 1911, Rathbone made his first appearance on stage at the Theatre Royal, Ipswich, Suffolk, as Hortensio in \"The Taming of the Shrew\", with his cousin Sir Frank Benson's No. 2 Company, under the direction of Henry Herbert. In October 1912, he went to the United States with Benson's company, playing roles such as Paris in \"Romeo and Juliet\", Fenton in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", and Silvius in \"As You Like It\". Returning to Britain, he made his first appearance in London at the Savoy Theatre on 9 July 1914, as Finch in \"The Sin of David\". That December, he appeared at the Shaftesbury Theatre as the Dauphin in \"Henry V\". During 1915, he toured with Benson and appeared with him at London's Court Theatre in December as Lysander in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\nMilitary service.\nDuring the First World War (in 1915), Rathbone was called up via the Derby Scheme into the British Army as a private with the London Scottish Regiment, joining a regiment that also included his future professional acting contemporaries Claude Rains, Herbert Marshall and Ronald Colman at different points during the conflict. After basic training with the London Scots in early 1916, he received a commission as a lieutenant in the 2/10th Battalion of the King's Liverpool Regiment (Liverpool Scottish), where he served as an intelligence officer, eventually attaining the rank of captain. \nRathbone was a two-time British Army Fencing Champion; a skill that served him well in the movies, it allowed him to teach swordsmanship to actors Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power.\nRathbone was deeply affected by the news that his younger brother John, a captain in the Dorsetshire Regiment, had been killed in action near Arras on 4 June 1918. In 2012 two letters Rathbone wrote to his family while he was serving on the Western Front were published. One reveals the anguish and anger he felt following the death of John:\nI want to tell him to mind his place. I think of his ridiculous belief that everything would always be well, his ever-hopeful smile, and I want to cuff him for a little fool. He had no business to let it happen and it maddens me that I shall never be able to tell him so, or change it or bring him back. I can't think of him without being consumed with anger at him for being dead and beyond anything I can do to him.\n\u2014 26 July 1918\nFollowing his brother's death, Rathbone appears to have become unconcerned about the dangers of serving at the front. Richard Van Emden in \"Famous 1914\u201318\" speculates that his extreme bravery may have been a form of guilt or a need for vengeance. He persuaded his superiors to allow him to scout enemy positions during daylight rather than at night, as was the usual practice to minimise the chance of detection. Rathbone wore a special camouflage suit that resembled a tree with a wreath of freshly plucked foliage on his head, and with burnt cork applied to his hands and face. As a result of these highly dangerous daylight reconnaissance missions in September 1918 he was awarded the Military Cross for \"conspicuous daring and resource on patrol\".\nCareer.\nTheatre.\nDuring the Summer Festival of 1919, he appeared at Stratford-upon-Avon with the New Shakespeare Company playing Romeo, Cassius, Ferdinand in \"The Tempest\" and Florizel in \"The Winter's Tale\"; in October he was at London's Queen's Theatre as the aide de camp in \"Napoleon\", and in February 1920 he was at the Savoy Theatre in the title role in \"Peter Ibbetson\" with huge success.\nDuring the 1920s, Rathbone appeared regularly in Shakespearean and other roles on the British stage. He began to travel and appeared at the Cort Theatre, New York City, in October 1923 in a production of Moln\u00e1r's play \"The Swan\" opposite Eva Le Gallienne, which made him a star on Broadway. He toured in the United States in 1925, appearing in San Francisco in May and the Lyceum Theatre, New York, in October. He was in the US again in 1927 and 1930 and again in 1931, when he appeared on stage with Ethel Barrymore. He continued his stage career in Britain, returning late in 1934 to the US, where he appeared with Katharine Cornell in several plays.\nRathbone was once arrested in 1926 along with every other member of the cast of \"The Captive\", a play in which his character's wife left him for another woman. Though the charges were eventually dropped, Rathbone was very angry about the censorship because he believed that homosexuality needed to be brought into the open.\nFilm.\nHe commenced his film career in Hollywood in 1921 in silent movies and appeared in 1923's \"The School for Scandal\", and in \"The Masked Bride\", plus a few other silents. His sound debut was in the first screen adaptation of Frederick Lonsdale's play opposite Norma Shearer, which was his last appearance as a romantic leading man. He portrayed detective Philo Vance in the 1930 film \"The Bishop Murder Case\", based on the best-selling novel. In the film, there is a coincidental reference to Sherlock Holmes. Like George Sanders and Vincent Price after him, Rathbone made a name for himself in the 1930s by playing suave villains in costume dramas and swashbucklers, including as the abusive stepfather Mr. Murdstone; as her distant husband, Karenin; as Pontius Pilate; ; , as the Marquis St. Evremonde; \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938) playing his best-remembered villain, Sir Guy of Gisbourne; \"The Adventures of Marco Polo\" (1938); and as Captain Esteban Pasquale. He also appeared in several early horror films: , as Richard III, and \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939), portraying the dedicated surgeon Baron Wolf von Frankenstein, son of the monster's creator, and, in 1949, was also the narrator for the segment \"The Wind in the Willows\" in the Disney animated feature, \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\".\nHe was admired for his athletic swordsmanship. (He listed fencing among his favourite recreations.) His character lost to Errol Flynn twice: in a duel on the beach in \"Captain Blood\" and in an elaborate fight sequence in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\". He was also involved in noteworthy sword fights in \"Tower of London\", \"The Mark of Zorro\", and \"The Court Jester.\"\nRathbone earned Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performances as Tybalt in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1936) and as King Louis XI in \"If I Were King\" (1938). In , he played one of his few heroic roles in the 1930s, as a Royal Flying Corps (RFC) squadron commander brought to the brink of a nervous breakdown by the strain and guilt of sending his battle-weary pilots off to near-certain death in the skies of 1915 France. Errol Flynn, Rathbone's perennial foe, starred in the film as his successor when Rathbone's character is promoted.\nAccording to Hollywood legend, Rathbone was Margaret Mitchell's first choice to play Rhett Butler in the film version of her novel \"Gone with the Wind\". Rathbone actively campaigned for the role.\nDespite his film success, Rathbone always insisted that he wished to be remembered for his stage career. He said that his favourite role was Romeo.\nThe Sherlock Holmes films.\nRathbone is most widely recognised for his many portrayals of Sherlock Holmes. In a radio interview, Rathbone recalled that Twentieth Century-Fox producer and director Gene Markey, lunching with producer-director-actor Gregory Ratoff and 20th Century-Fox mogul Daryl Zanuck at Lucey's Restaurant in Hollywood, proposed a film version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\". When asked who could possibly play Holmes, Markey incredulously replied, \"Who?! Basil Rathbone!\" The film was so successful that Fox produced a sequel that appeared later in 1939. Interest in Holmes cooled at Fox, but Universal Pictures picked up the character, and produced 12 Holmes features from 1942 to 1946. All of the Fox and Universal features co-starred Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson.\nThe first two films, \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" and \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" (both produced by Fox in 1939), were set in the late Victorian times of the original stories. The later instalments, produced by Universal, beginning with \"Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror\" (1942), were set in contemporary times, with the first three having World War II-related plots.\nConcurrent with the films, Rathbone and Bruce reprised their film roles in the radio series \"The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\", which began in October 1939. Rathbone appeared in the radio series as long as the film series was active, but, after the films lapsed in 1946, Rathbone ceded his radio part to Tom Conway. Conway and Bruce carried on with the series for two seasons, until both dropped out in July 1947.\nThe many Holmes sequels typecast Rathbone, and he was unable to free himself from the shadow of the Great Detective, despite appearing in other film roles. Resenting the typecasting, Rathbone refused to renew his contract at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and returned to Broadway. In later years, Rathbone willingly made the Holmes association, as in a TV sketch with Milton Berle in the early 1950s, in which he donned the deerstalker cap and Inverness cape. In the 1960s, dressed as Holmes, he appeared in a series of TV commercials for Getz Exterminators (\"Getz gets 'em, since 1888!'\").\nIn 1953, Rathbone played the detective in \"The Adventure of the Black Baronet\", an episode of the anthology television series \"Suspense\". Later that year, he also brought Holmes to the stage in a play written by his wife Ouida. Thomas Gomez, who had appeared as a Nazi ringleader in \"Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror\", played the villainous Professor Moriarty. Nigel Bruce was slated to portray Dr Watson once more but became too ill and the part was played by character actor Jack Raine. Bruce's absence depressed Rathbone, particularly after Bruce died on 8 October 1953, while the play was in rehearsals. The play ran for only three performances.\nLater career.\nIn the 1950s, Rathbone appeared in two spoofs of his earlier swashbuckling villains: \"Casanova's Big Night\" (1954) opposite Bob Hope and \"The Court Jester\" (1956) with Danny Kaye. He appeared frequently on TV game shows and continued to appear in major films, including the Humphrey Bogart comedy and John Ford's political drama .\nRathbone also appeared on Broadway numerous times in this period. In 1948, he shared the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance as the unyielding Dr. Austin Sloper in the original production of \"The Heiress\" and with Henry Fonda in \"Mister Roberts\" and Paul Kelly in \"Command Decision\". He also received accolades for his performance in Archibald Macleish's \"J.B.\", a modernisation of the Biblical trials of Job.\nThrough the 1950s and 1960s, he continued to appear in several dignified anthology programmes on television. To support his second wife's lavish tastes, he appeared as a panellist on the television game show \"The Name's the Same\" (in 1954), and took roles in cheap film thrillers of far lesser quality, such as \"The Black Sleep\" (1956), \"Queen of Blood\" (1966), \"The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini\" (1966, wherein the character 'Eric Von Zipper' played by Harvey Lembeck jokes, \"That guy looks like Sherlock Holmes\"), \"Hillbillys in a Haunted House\" (1967, also featuring Lon Chaney Jr and John Carradine), and his last film, a low-budget, horror film called \"Autopsy of a Ghost\" (1968).\nHe is also known for his spoken word recordings, including his interpretation of Clement C. Moore's \"The Night Before Christmas\". Rathbone's readings of the stories and poems of Edgar Allan Poe are collected together with readings by Vincent Price in Caedmon Audio's \"The Edgar Allan Poe Audio Collection\" on CD.\nIn four Caedmon albums, Rathbone revisited his characterisation of Sherlock Holmes. The first, \"The Speckled Band\" (Caedmon Records TC 1172, recorded in 1963), is a straight narration of the tale. In the rest, he changes his voice for each character, including a rendition of Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson.\nRathbone also made many other recordings, including \"Oliver Twist\", Prokofiev's \"Peter and the Wolf\" (with Leopold Stokowski conducting), and Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\".\nOn television, he appeared in two musical versions of Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\": one in 1954, in which he played Marley's Ghost opposite Fredric March's Scrooge, and the original 1956 live action version of \"The Stingiest Man in Town (1956)\", in which he starred as a singing Ebenezer Scrooge.\nIn the 1960s, he toured with a one-man show, \"In and Out of Character\" (the same title as his autobiography). He recited poetry and Shakespeare, accented by reminiscences from his life and career (including the humorous, \"I could have killed Errol Flynn any time I wanted to!\"). As an encore, he recited \"221B\", a poem written by writer-critic Vincent Starrett, one of the preeminent members of the Baker Street Irregulars whom Rathbone held in high regard.\nPrice and Rathbone appeared together, along with Boris Karloff, in \"Tower of London\" (1939) and \"The Comedy of Terrors\" (1963). The latter was the only film to feature the \"Big Four\" of American International Pictures' horror films: Price, Rathbone, Karloff and Peter Lorre. Rathbone appeared with Price in the final segment of Roger Corman's 1962 anthology film \"Tales of Terror\", a loose dramatisation of Poe's \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\".\nIn 1965, Belmont Books issued the anthology \"Basil Rathbone Selects Strange Tales\", a collection of horror stories by Poe, Hawthorne, Bulwer-Lytton, Charles Dickens, Allston Collins, Le Fanu, and Wilkie Collins. The volume features a cover portrait of Rathbone; however, the back cover's legend \"Produced by Lyle Kenyon Engel\" indicates the anthology probably was not edited by Rathbone. Canadian editor and book packager Engel packaged shows and magazines for other horror stars, including Boris Karloff.\nBasil Rathbone has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for films at 6549 Hollywood Boulevard; one for radio at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard; and one for television at 6915 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.\nPersonal life.\nRathbone married actress Ethel Marion Foreman (1887\u20131976) in 1914. They had one son, Rodion Rathbone (1915\u20131996), who had a brief Hollywood career under the name John Rodion. The couple divorced in 1926. In the same year, he married writer Ouida Berg\u00e8re; their infant child died in 1928. In 1939, the couple adopted a daughter, Cynthia Rathbone (1939\u20131969). The American actor Jackson Rathbone is a distant relation.\nRathbone bore a strong resemblance to his cousin, the actor Frank Benson. He was a first cousin once removed of the campaigning independent British MP Eleanor Rathbone.\nDuring Rathbone's Hollywood career Ouida Rathbone, who was also her husband's business manager, developed a reputation for hosting elaborate and expensive parties in their home, with many prominent and influential people on the guest lists. This trend inspired a joke in \"The Ghost Breakers\" (1940), a film in which Rathbone does not appear: during a tremendous thunderstorm in New York City Bob Hope observes that \"Basil Rathbone must be throwing a party.\" Actress Mrs Patrick Campbell described Rathbone as \"two profiles pasted together\". As cited in the same autobiography, Mrs Campbell later referred to him as \"a folded umbrella taking elocution lessons\".\nRathbone was a devout Anglican (or, in U.S. English, Episcopalian) and a member of the Episcopal Actors Guild.\nDeath.\nRathbone died suddenly of a heart attack in New York City on 21 July 1967 at the age of 75. His body was interred in a crypt in the Shrine of Memories Mausoleum at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68334", "revid": "50436820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68334", "title": "Desktop environment", "text": "Implementation of graphical user interface\nIn computing, a desktop environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer operating system that share a common graphical user interface (GUI), sometimes described as a graphical shell. The desktop environment was seen mostly on personal computers until the rise of mobile computing. Desktop GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files, while they usually do not provide access to all of the features found in the underlying operating system. Instead, the traditional command-line interface (CLI) is still used when full control over the operating system is required.\nA desktop environment typically consists of icons, windows, toolbars, folders, wallpapers and desktop widgets (see Elements of graphical user interfaces and WIMP). A GUI might also provide drag and drop functionality and other features that make the desktop metaphor more complete. A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting with the physical world, such as buttons and windows.\nWhile the term \"desktop environment\" originally described a style of user interfaces following the desktop metaphor, it has also come to describe the programs that realize the metaphor itself. This usage has been popularized by projects such as the Common Desktop Environment, KDE, and GNOME.\nImplementation.\nOn a system that offers a desktop environment, a window manager in conjunction with applications written using a widget toolkit are generally responsible for most of what the user sees. The window manager supports the user interactions with the environment, while the toolkit provides developers a software library for applications with a unified look and behavior.\nA windowing system of some sort generally interfaces directly with the underlying operating system and libraries. This provides support for graphical hardware, pointing devices, and keyboards. The window manager generally runs on top of this windowing system. While the windowing system may provide some window management functionality, this functionality is still considered to be part of the window manager, which simply happens to have been provided by the windowing system.\nApplications that are created with a particular window manager in mind usually make use of a windowing toolkit, generally provided with the operating system or window manager. A windowing toolkit gives applications access to widgets that allow the user to interact graphically with the application in a consistent way.\nHistory and common use.\nThe first desktop environment was created by Xerox and was sold with the Xerox Alto in the 1970s. The Alto was generally considered by Xerox to be a personal office computer; it failed in the marketplace because of poor marketing and a very high price tag. With the Lisa, Apple introduced a desktop environment on an affordable personal computer, which also failed in the market.\nThe desktop metaphor was popularized on commercial personal computers by the original Macintosh from Apple in 1984, and was popularized further by Windows from Microsoft since the 1990s. As of 2014[ [update]], the most popular desktop environments are descendants of these earlier environments, including the Windows shell used in Microsoft Windows, and the Aqua environment used in macOS. When compared with the X-based desktop environments available for Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and BSD, the proprietary desktop environments included with Windows and macOS have relatively fixed layouts and static features, with highly integrated \"seamless\" designs that aim to provide mostly consistent customer experiences across installations.\nMicrosoft Windows dominates in marketshare among personal computers with a desktop environment. Computers using Unix-like operating systems such as macOS, ChromeOS, Linux, BSD or Solaris are much less common; however, as of 2015[ [update]] there is a growing market for low-cost Linux PCs using the X Window System or Wayland with a broad choice of desktop environments. Among the more popular of these are Google's Chromebooks and Chromeboxes, Intel's NUC, the Raspberry Pi, etc.\nOn tablets and smartphones, the situation is the opposite, with Unix-like operating systems dominating the market, including the iOS (BSD-derived), Android, Tizen, Sailfish and Ubuntu (all Linux-derived). Microsoft's Windows phone, Windows RT and Windows\u00a010 are used on a much smaller number of tablets and smartphones. However, the majority of Unix-like operating systems dominant on handheld devices do not use the X11 desktop environments used by other Unix-like operating systems, relying instead on interfaces based on other technologies.\nDesktop environments for the X Window System.\nOn systems running the X Window System (typically Unix-family systems such as Linux, the BSDs, and formal UNIX distributions), desktop environments are much more dynamic and customizable to meet user needs. In this context, a desktop environment typically consists of several separate components, including a window manager (such as Mutter or KWin), a file manager (such as Files or Dolphin), a set of graphical themes, together with toolkits (such as GTK+ and Qt) and libraries for managing the desktop. All these individual modules can be exchanged and independently configured to suit users, but most desktop environments provide a default configuration that works with minimal user setup.\nSome window managers\u200d\u2014\u200csuch as IceWM, Fluxbox, Openbox, ROX Desktop and Window Maker\u200d\u2014\u200ccontain relatively sparse desktop environment elements, such as an integrated spatial file manager, while others like evilwm and wmii do not provide such elements. Not all of the program code that is part of a desktop environment has effects which are directly visible to the user. Some of it may be low-level code. KDE, for example, provides so-called KIO slaves which give the user access to a wide range of virtual devices. These I/O slaves are not available outside the KDE environment.\nIn 1996 the KDE was announced, followed in 1997 by the announcement of GNOME. Xfce is a smaller project that was also founded in 1996, and focuses on speed and modularity, just like LXDE which was started in 2006. A comparison of X Window System desktop environments demonstrates the differences between environments. GNOME and KDE were usually seen as dominant solutions, and these are still often installed by default on Linux systems. Each of them offers:\nIn the early 2000s, KDE reached maturity. The Appeal and ToPaZ projects focused on bringing new advances to the next major releases of both KDE and GNOME respectively. Although striving for broadly similar goals, GNOME and KDE do differ in their approach to user ergonomics. KDE encourages applications to integrate and interoperate, is highly customizable, and contains many complex features, all whilst trying to establish sensible defaults. GNOME on the other hand is more prescriptive, and focuses on the finer details of essential tasks and overall simplification. Accordingly, each one attracts a different user and developer community. Technically, there are numerous technologies common to all Unix-like desktop environments, most obviously the X Window System. Accordingly, the freedesktop.org project was established as an informal collaboration zone with the goal being to reduce duplication of effort.\nAs GNOME and KDE focus on high-performance computers, users of less powerful or older computers often prefer alternative desktop environments specifically created for low-performance systems. Most commonly used lightweight desktop environments include LXDE and Xfce; they both use GTK+, which is the same underlying toolkit GNOME uses. The MATE desktop environment, a fork of GNOME\u00a02, is comparable to Xfce in its use of RAM and processor cycles, but is often considered more as an alternative to other lightweight desktop environments.\nFor a while, GNOME and KDE enjoyed the status of the most popular Linux desktop environments; later, other desktop environments grew in popularity. In April 2011, GNOME introduced a new interface concept with its version 3, while a popular Linux distribution Ubuntu introduced its own new desktop environment, Unity. Some users preferred to keep the traditional interface concept of GNOME 2, resulting in the creation of MATE as a GNOME\u00a02 fork.\nExamples of desktop environments.\nThe most common desktop environment on personal computers is Windows Shell in Microsoft Windows. Microsoft has made significant efforts in making Windows shell visually pleasing. As a result, Microsoft has introduced theme support in Windows 98, the various Windows XP visual styles, the Aero brand in Windows Vista, the Microsoft design language (codenamed \"Metro\") in Windows 8, and the Fluent Design System and Windows Spotlight in Windows 10. Windows shell can be extended via Shell extensions.\nMany mainstream desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems, including KDE, GNOME, Xfce, and LXDE, use the X Window System or Wayland, any of which may be selected by users, and are not tied exclusively to the operating system in use. The desktop environment for macOS, which is also a Unix-like system, is Aqua, which uses the Quartz graphics layer, rather than using X or Wayland.\nA number of other desktop environments also exist, including (but not limited to) CDE, EDE, GEM, IRIX Interactive Desktop, Sun's Java Desktop System, Jesktop, Mezzo, Project Looking Glass, ROX Desktop, UDE, Xito, XFast. Moreover, there exists FVWM-Crystal, which consists of a powerful configuration for the FVWM window manager, a theme and further adds, altogether forming a \"construction kit\" for building up a desktop environment.\nX window managers that are meant to be usable stand-alone \u2014 without another desktop environment \u2014 also include elements reminiscent of those found in typical desktop environments, most prominently Enlightenment. Other examples include OpenBox, Fluxbox, WindowLab, Fvwm, as well as Window Maker and AfterStep, which both feature the NeXTSTEP GUI look and feel.\nThe Amiga approach to desktop environment was noteworthy: the original Workbench desktop environment in AmigaOS evolved through time to originate an entire family of descendants and alternative desktop solutions. Some of those descendants are the Scalos, the Ambient desktop of MorphOS, and the Wanderer desktop of the AROS open source OS. WindowLab also contains features reminiscent of the Amiga UI. Third-party Directory Opus software, which was originally just a navigational file manager program, evolved to become a complete Amiga desktop replacement called Directory Opus Magellan.\nOS/2 (and derivatives such as eComStation and ArcaOS) use the Workplace Shell. Earlier versions of OS/2 used the Presentation Manager.\nThe BumpTop project was an experimental desktop environment. Its main objective is to replace the 2D paradigm with a \"real-world\" 3D implementation, where documents can be freely manipulated across a virtual table.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Smith started her career as a \"Playboy\" magazine centerfold in May 1992 and won the title of 1993 Playmate of the Year. She later modeled for fashion companies, including Guess, H&amp;M, Lane Bryant and Heatherette.\nSmith dropped out of high school in 1984, married in 1985, and divorced in 1993. In 1994, her highly publicized second marriage to 89-year-old billionaire J. Howard Marshall resulted in speculation that she was a gold digger, which she denied. Following Marshall's death in 1995, Smith began a lengthy legal battle over a share of his estate. Her cases reached the Supreme Court of the United States: \"Marshall v. Marshall\" on a question of federal jurisdiction and \"Stern v. Marshall\" on a question of bankruptcy court authority. Smith died on February 8, 2007, in Hollywood, Florida, of a combined drug intoxication.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born Vickie Lynn Hogan on November 28, 1967, in Houston, Texas, the only daughter of Virgie Tabers Arthur (1951\u20132018) and Donald Eugene Hogan (1947\u20132009). Smith attended Mexia High School, in Mexia, Texas, transferring there from a Houston school. She had five half-siblings on her father's side. Smith was primarily raised by her mother and her family in Mexia.\nCareer.\nModeling.\nSmith started her career as a \"Playboy\" magazine centerfold in May 1992 and won the title of 1993 Playmate of the Year.\nSmith secured a contract to replace supermodel Claudia Schiffer in a Guess Jeans advertisement campaign featuring a series of sultry black-and-white photographs. During the Guess campaign, she took on the stage name \"Anna Nicole\". Guess photographers noticed Smith bore a striking resemblance to Jayne Mansfield and showcased her in several Mansfield-inspired photo sessions. In 1993, she modeled for the Swedish clothing company H&amp;M, which led to her picture being displayed on large billboards in Sweden and Norway. Smith was featured on the cover of \"Marie Claire\", shot by Peter Lindbergh in October 1993, and in \"GQ\" magazine. In 2004 she modelled for Heatherette.\nEndorsements.\nIn October 2003, she became a spokeswoman for TrimSpa, which allegedly helped her lose a reported . TrimSpa diet product company and Smith were sued in a class-action lawsuit alleging their marketing of a weight loss pill was false or misleading. TrimSpa filed for bankruptcy after Smith's death and was liquidated.\nIn March 2005, at the first MTV Australia Video Music Awards in Sydney's Luna Park, Smith spoofed Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction by pulling down her dress to reveal both breasts, each covered with the MTV logo.\nPersonal life.\nWhile working at Jim's Krispy Fried Chicken in Mexia, Smith met Billy Wayne Smith, a cook at the restaurant, and the couple married on April 4, 1985, when he was 16 and she was 17. She gave birth to their son, Daniel Wayne Smith, on January 22, 1986. Smith and her husband separated the following year and divorced in 1993.\nWhile performing at a Houston strip club in October 1991, Smith met 86-year-old petroleum tycoon J. Howard Marshall. On June 27, 1994, Smith and Marshall were married in Houston, resulting in speculation that she married him for his money. Marshall died on August 4, 1995, in Houston, at the age of 90.\nCourt cases and bankruptcy.\nIn October 1994, Smith initiated a $5 million lawsuit against the \"New York\" magazine, claiming that she did not authorize the use of her photo on the cover of its magazine titled \"White Trash Nation\" and that the article damaged her reputation. The lawsuit was settled.\nEven though Smith was not in Marshall's will, she claimed that in return for marriage, Marshall verbally promised her half of his estate, which primarily consisted of a 16% interest in Koch, Inc., then worth $1.6\u00a0billion. Smith's stepson E. Pierce Marshall disputed the claim. Smith temporarily joined forces with J.\u00a0Howard's other son, J. Howard Marshall III, who was disowned after attempting to take control of Koch. Howard III also claimed that his father had verbally promised him a portion of the estate; like Smith, Howard III was also left out of his father's will.\nIn 1996, Smith filed for bankruptcy in California as a result of an $850,000 default judgment against her for the sexual harassment of a nanny who cared for her son. Since any money potentially due to her from the Marshall estate was part of her potential assets, the bankruptcy court involved itself in the matter.\nIn September 2000, a Los Angeles bankruptcy judge awarded Smith $449,754,134.00, the amount that Marshall's interest in Koch appreciated during their marriage. However, in July 2001, Houston judge Mike Wood affirmed the jury's findings in the probate case by ruling that Smith was entitled to nothing. The judge ordered Smith to pay over $1\u00a0million to cover the legal costs and expenses of E.\u00a0Pierce Marshall. The conflict between the Texas probate court and California bankruptcy court judgments forced the matter into federal court.\nIn March 2002, a federal judge vacated the California bankruptcy court's ruling and issued a new ruling that reduced the award to $88\u00a0million. On December 30, 2004, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision on the grounds that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction to overrule the probate court's decision.\nIn September 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to hear the appeal of that decision. The George W. Bush administration directed Paul Clement, the United States Solicitor General, to intercede on Smith's behalf in the interest of expanding federal court jurisdiction over state probate disputes. On May 1, 2006, the Supreme Court unanimously decided in favor of Smith. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the opinion. The decision did not give Smith a portion of her husband's estate, but affirmed her right to pursue a share of it in federal court.\nOn June 20, 2006, E. Pierce Marshall died at age 67 from an infection. His widow and estate executor Elaine Tettemer Marshall, pursued the case on behalf of his estate. After Smith's death in 2007, the case continued on behalf of Smith's infant daughter, Dannielynn Birkhead. In March 2010, an appeals court upheld the verdict barring Smith from the estate. Following the decision, lawyers for Smith's estate appealed the decision to the entire Ninth Circuit. On May 6, 2010, the appeal was denied.\nIn June 2011, in the case of \"Stern v. Marshall\", the Supreme Court issued a ruling against Smith's estate, stating that the California bankruptcy court decision that gave her estate $475\u00a0million was made without subject-matter jurisdiction. The court agreed with the ruling of the Ninth Circuit that a bankruptcy court could not make a decision on an issue outside bankruptcy law. In August 2014, David O. Carter, a federal U.S. District Court judge in Orange County, California, rejected efforts to obtain about $44\u00a0million from the J.\u00a0Howard Marshall estate.\nBirth of daughter.\nA psychiatrist said she met with Smith in April 2006 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles while she was pregnant with her daughter, and that she believed that Smith had borderline personality disorder, and was addicted to prescription medications.\nOn June 1, 2006, Smith announced her pregnancy in a video clip on her official website. She gave birth to a daughter, Dannielynn, on September 7, 2006, in New Providence, The Bahamas. In an interview on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" after the death of Smith's son, attorney Howard K. Stern said that he and Smith had been in a relationship for \"a very long time\" and said he was the father. Entertainment photographer Larry Birkhead claimed that he was the baby's father and filed a lawsuit to establish paternity. The Bahamian birth certificate recorded the father as Stern.\nA judge in the United States ordered that DNA paternity tests be performed to determine Dannielynn's biological father. Following Smith's death, Birkhead's attorney asked for an emergency DNA sample to be taken from Smith's body. The request was denied by a judge who ordered that her body be preserved until February 20.\nOn February 9, 2007, Zsa Zsa Gabor's husband, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Prinz von Anhalt, stated that he had had a decade-long affair with Smith and could potentially be the father of her daughter. Smith's former bodyguard and chef, Alexander Denk, also claimed that he had an affair with Smith and that he, too, was potentially the father.\nAfter Smith's death, the TMZ website reported that she had been given a prescription for methadone under a false name while she was in her eighth month of pregnancy. The Medical Board of California launched a review into the matter. The prescribing doctor, Sandeep Kapoor, said the treatment he had administered was \"sound and appropriate\".\nIn April 2007, a Bahamian judge ruled that DNA tests had established Birkhead as the biological father. Birkhead subsequently applied for an amended birth certificate listing him as Dannielynn's father, paving the way for him to obtain a passport for the baby to leave with him for the United States. Stern did not contest the DNA results or the ruling, and Birkhead returned to the United States with the baby. Smith's mother, Virgie Arthur, appealed the ruling, but her appeal was denied and she was ordered to pay costs.\nDeath of son.\nOn September 10, 2006, Smith's twenty-year-old son Daniel Wayne Smith died in his mother's hospital room while visiting her and his half-sister Dannielynn, who was born three days earlier on September 7. An autopsy found that Daniel had died from a combination of drugs, including methadone and antidepressants. A Bahamian jury determined that he had died from an accidental drug overdose and recommended no criminal charges.\nA death certificate was issued on September 21, 2006. Daniel was buried at Lake View Cemetery in New Providence on October 19, 2006.\nAccording to Stern, Smith was devastated by her son's death. \"Anna and Daniel were inseparable. Daniel was without question the most important person in Anna's life,\" Stern said during his testimony at the trial regarding the right to control disposition of Smith's remains. \"At Daniel's funeral, she had them open the coffin and tried to climb inside. She said that 'if Daniel has to be buried, I want to be buried with him.' She was ready to go down with him.\" Stern said that, \"Anna saw herself as both mother and father to Daniel. From the time I met her, everything was for Daniel. I would say that physically, she died last week, but in a lot of ways, emotionally she died when Daniel died.\"\nCommitment ceremony with Stern.\nOn September 28, 2006, Smith and Stern exchanged vows and rings in an informal commitment ceremony in the Bahamas. Although they pledged their love and made a commitment to be there for each other before a Baptist minister, no marriage certificate was issued and the ceremony did not create a legal marriage. Regarding the questionable timing of the ceremony, Smith's attorney in Nassau said, \"They needed a little adrenaline boost because things have been so hectic and devastating in their life recently.\" Ceremony photos were sold through Getty Images to \"People\" magazine for $1\u00a0million.\nResidency in the Bahamas.\nSmith and Stern were reportedly staying in the Bahamas to avoid paternity testing of her daughter in the United States. In late 2006, Smith was granted permanent resident status in the Bahamas by Immigration Minister Shane Gibson. A local newspaper published photographs showing Smith lying clothed in bed in an embrace with Gibson. Gibson resigned after the wave of controversy over his relationship with Smith.\nThe basis of Smith's permanent residency status was the claim that she owned a $900,000 mansion, which she said was given to her by a former boyfriend, real estate developer Gaither Ben Thompson of South Carolina. Thompson asserted that he loaned Smith the finances to purchase the property, which she failed to repay, and that he was attempting to regain control of it. Thompson sued to evict Smith from the property in the Bahamas Court and received a default judgment against her. It was claimed that methadone was found in Smith's bedroom refrigerator while the mansion was being reclaimed. A photograph provided to TMZ of Smith's refrigerator showed a large bottle labelled methadone, vials of injectable vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), and numerous bottles of diet product SlimFast.\nDeath.\nOn February 8, 2007, Smith was found unresponsive in her room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Smith's bodyguard and his wife who was a registered nurse, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Smith was taken to Hollywood's Memorial Regional Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, at the age of 39.\nAn investigation was led by Broward County Medical Examiner and forensic pathologist Joshua Perper in conjunction with Seminole police and several independent forensic pathologists and toxicologists. Perper announced that Smith died of \"combined drug intoxication\" with the sleeping medication chloral hydrate as the \"major component\". No illegal drugs were found in her system. According to the official report, her death was not due to homicide, suicide or natural causes.\nSmith's death was ultimately ruled an accidental drug overdose of the sedative chloral hydrate that became increasingly toxic when combined with other prescription drugs in her system, specifically four benzodiazepines. Furthermore, she had taken diphenhydramine and topiramate. Despite rumors of methadone use involved in the death of Smith's son, Perper only found methadone in her bile, indicating it was probably ingested 2\u20133 days prior to her death, and therefore was not a contributing factor. The autopsy report indicates that abscesses on her buttocks, presumably from prior injections of vitamin B12 in the form of cyanocobalamin, as well as human growth hormone, and viral enteritis were contributory causes of death. Tests for influenza A and B were negative.\nEight of the eleven drugs in Smith's system, including the chloral hydrate, were prescribed to Stern, not Smith. Additionally, two of the prescriptions were written for \"Alex Katz\" and one was written for Smith's friend and psychiatrist Dr.Khristine Eroshevich. Perper acknowledged that all of the prescriptions were written by Dr.Eroshevich.\nSmith's funeral took place on March2, 2007, in the Bahamas.\nLast will and testament.\nSmith's will was prepared by attorney Eric Lund in 2001, in Los Angeles, California. Smith named her son Daniel as the sole beneficiary of her estate, specifically excluded other children and named Stern executor of the estate. It indicated personal property valued at $10,000 and real estate valued at $1.8\u00a0million, with a $1.1\u00a0million mortgage, at the time of her death. A petition to probate Smith's will was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, listing Birkhead as a party with interest to the estate.\nDefamation lawsuit by Smith's mother.\nIn 2008, John O'Quinn, lawyer for Smith's mother, Virgie Arthur, filed the underlying proceedings against \"Entertainment Tonight\", TMZ, CBS, journalist Art Harris, and several Texas bloggers, alleging that the defendants conspired to ruin her reputation through defamatory e-mails, blogs and website postings and harmed her efforts to seek custody and visitation of her granddaughter. The court jailed one blogger because she failed to turn over her computer as evidence. Arthur's defamation lawsuit was dismissed after TMZ, CBS, \"Entertainment Tonight\", Harris, and others won summary judgment.\nLegacy.\n\"Anna Nicole\", an opera by Mark-Anthony Turnage about Smith, premiered on February 17, 2011, at the Royal Opera House, to mixed reviews. Smith was the subject of the 2023 Netflix documentary \"\". Smith was also the subject of the biographical films \"The Anna Nicole Smith Story\" (2007) and \"The Anna Nicole Story\" (2013). In December 2023, it was announced that Sylvia Hoeks would portray Smith in the upcoming film \"Hurricana\".\nIn 2017, Smith's primary care physician Sandeep Kapoor published a memoir titled \"Trust Me, I'm a Doctor: My Life Before, During and After Anna Nicole Smith\". In February 2024, it was reported that Kal Penn would star as Kapoor in an upcoming film based on the book, titled \"Trust Me, I'm a Doctor\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

In England, he was coached by Sam Mussabini, later also the coach of Harold Abrahams.\nSeveral of the big names did not qualify for the final, but Walker did. His first round was a relatively easy victory run in 11.0 seconds. In the second round, Walker edged out William W. May of the United States while tying the Olympic record of 10.8 seconds. This qualified him for the final. There he competed against three North Americans, including James Rector of the United States, who had equalled the Olympic record in both of the qualifier rounds. Walker beat Rector in the final by about a foot and half, again equaling the Olympic record in 10.8 seconds.\nWalker was still the youngest winner of the Olympic 100 metres as of 2021[ [update]] (at 19 years and 128 days).\nDuring World War I, Walker served with the 7th Infantry in German South West Africa, before joining the South African Overseas Expeditionary Force in 1917, serving in France, during which time he received a gunshot wound to the head.

He has been a professor of applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since 2003. \nEarly life and education.\nShor was born on August 14, 1959, in New York City, to Joan Bopp Shor and S. W. Williston Shor. He grew up in Washington, D.C. and Mill Valley, California. While attending Tamalpais High School, he placed third in the 1977 USA Mathematical Olympiad. After graduation that year, he won a silver medal at the International Math Olympiad in Yugoslavia (the U.S. team achieved the most points per country that year). \nShor graduated from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1981 with a B.S. in mathematics. He was a Putnam Fellow in 1978. He then did doctoral study in applied mathematics at MIT, receiving a Ph.D. in 1985. His doctoral advisor was F. Thomson Leighton, and his thesis was on probabilistic analysis of bin-packing algorithms.\nCareer.\nAfter being awarded his PhD by MIT, he spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and then accepted a position at Bell Labs in New Providence, New Jersey. It was there that he developed Shor's algorithm. This development was inspired by Simon's problem. Shor first found an efficient quantum algorithm for the discrete log problem (which relates point-finding on a hypercube to a torus) and,\"Later that week, I was able to solve the factoring problem as well. There\u2019s a strange relation between discrete log and factoring.\"Both of these problems are examples of the HSP. For his work discovering the efficient quantum algorithms for factoring and discrete logarithm he was awarded the Nevanlinna Prize at the 23rd International Congress of Mathematicians in 1998 and the G\u00f6del Prize in 1999. In 1999, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. In 2017, he received the Dirac Medal of the ICTP and for 2019 the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences.\nShor began his MIT position in 2003. Currently, he is the Henry Adams Morss and Henry Adams Morss, Jr. Professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at MIT.

SmartSuite is not officially supported by IBM on versions of Windows after XP, but it does work very well on both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 11.\neComStation 1.0 included the OS/2 version of Smartsuite. It was an optional extra in later versions of eComStation. ArcaOS does not include Smartsuite, but is able to run it.\nIn 2007, IBM introduced a new office suite called IBM Lotus Symphony, unrelated to the Lotus Symphony integrated application suite that Lotus previously released.\nIn July 2012 the price for a user licence of Lotus SmartSuite 9.8 was US-$342.00 when purchased directly through the IBM website.\nIn May 2013, IBM announced the withdrawal of SmartSuite.

{"id": "68344", "revid": "36729223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68344", "title": "Bilirubin", "text": "Red pigment of the bile\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nBilirubin (BR) (adopted from German, originally bili, for bile, plus ruber, Latin for red) is a red-orange compound that occurs as the reduction product of biliverdin, a breakdown product of heme. It's further broken down in the colon to urobilinogen, most of which becomes stercobilin, causing the brown color of feces. Some unconverted urobilinogen, metabolised to urobilin, provides the straw-yellow color in urine.\nAlthough bilirubin is usually found in animals rather than plants, at least one plant species, \"Strelitzia nicolai\", is known to contain the pigment.\nStructure.\nBilirubin consists of an open-chain tetrapyrrole. It is formed by oxidative cleavage of a porphyrin in heme, which affords biliverdin. Biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin. After conjugation with glucuronic acid, bilirubin is water-soluble and can be excreted.\nBilirubin is structurally similar to the pigment phycobilin used by certain algae to capture light energy, and to the pigment phytochrome used by plants to sense light. All of these contain an open chain of four pyrrolic rings.\nLike these other pigments, some of the double-bonds in bilirubin isomerize when exposed to light. This isomerization is relevant to the phototherapy of jaundiced newborns: the E,Z-isomers of bilirubin formed upon light exposure are more soluble than the unilluminated Z,Z-isomer, as the possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonding is removed. Increased solubility allows the excretion of unconjugated bilirubin in bile.\nSome textbooks and research articles show the incorrect geometric isomer of bilirubin. The naturally occurring isomer is the Z,Z-isomer.\nFunction.\nBilirubin is created by the activity of biliverdin reductase on biliverdin, a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment that is also a product of heme catabolism. Bilirubin, when oxidized, reverts to become biliverdin once again. This cycle, in addition to the demonstration of the potent antioxidant activity of bilirubin, has led to the hypothesis that bilirubin's main physiologic role is as a cellular antioxidant. Consistent with this, animal studies suggest that eliminating bilirubin results in endogenous oxidative stress. Bilirubin's antioxidant activity may be particularly important in the brain, where it prevents excitotoxicity and neuronal death by scavenging superoxide during N-methyl-D-aspartic acid neurotransmission.\nMetabolism.\nBilirubin in plasma is mostly produced by the destruction of erythrocytes. Heme is metabolized into biliverdin (via heme oxygenase) and then into bilirubin (via biliverdin reductase) inside the macrophages.\nBilirubin is then released into the plasma and transported to the liver bound by albumin, since it is insoluble in water in this state. In this state, bilirubin is called unconjugated (despite being bound by albumin).\nIn the liver, unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin is up-taken by the hepatocytes and subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid (via the enzyme uridine diphosphate\u2013glucuronyl transferase). In this state, bilirubin is soluble in water and it is called conjugated bilirubin.\nConjugated (direct) bilirubin is excreted into the bile ducts and enters the duodenum. During its transport to the colon, it is converted into urobilinogen by the bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase. Most of the urobilinogen is further reduced into stercobilinogen and is excreted through feces (air oxidizes stercobilinogen to stercobilin, which gives feces their characteristic brown color).\nA lesser amount of urobilinogen is re-absorbed into portal circulation and transferred to the liver. For the most part, this urobilinogen is recycled to conjugated bilirubin and this process closes the enterohepatic circle. There is also an amount of urobilinogen which is not recycled, but rather enters the systemic circulation and subsequently the kidneys, where it is excreted. Air oxidizes urobilinogen into urobilin, which gives urine its characteristic color.\nIn parallel, a small amount of conjugated bilirubin can also enter the systemic circulation and get excreted through urine. This is exaggerated in various pathological situations.\nToxicity.\nHyperbilirubinemia.\nHyperbilirubinemia is a higher-than-normal level of bilirubin in the blood. \"Hyperbilirubinemia\" may refer to increased levels of conjugated, unconjugated or both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. The causes of hyperbilirubinemia can also be classified into prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic.\nPrehepatic causes are associated mostly with an increase of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. They include:\nIntrahepatic causes can be associated with elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin or both. They include:\nPost-hepatic causes are associated with elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin. These include:\nCirrhosis may cause normal, moderately high or high levels of bilirubin, depending on exact features of the cirrhosis.\nTo further elucidate the causes of jaundice or increased bilirubin, it is usually simpler to look at other liver function tests (especially the enzymes alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase), blood film examination (hemolysis, etc.) or evidence of infective hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, B, C, delta, E, etc.).\nJaundice.\nHemoglobin acts to transport oxygen which the body receives to all body tissue via blood vessels. Over time, when red blood cells need to be replenished, the hemoglobin is broken down in the spleen; it breaks down into two parts: heme group consisting of iron and bile, and protein fraction. While protein and iron are utilized to renew red blood cells, pigments that make up the red color in blood are deposited into the bile to form bilirubin. Jaundice leads to raised bilirubin levels that in turn negatively remove elastin-rich tissues. Jaundice may be noticeable in the sclera of the eyes at levels of about 2 to 3\u00a0mg/dl (34 to 51 \u03bcmol/L), and in the skin at higher levels.\nJaundice is classified, depending upon whether the bilirubin is free or conjugated to glucuronic acid, into conjugated jaundice or unconjugated jaundice.\nKernicterus.\nUnbound bilirubin (Bf) levels can be used to predict the risk of neurodevelopmental handicaps within infants. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a newborn can lead to accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood\u2013brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions that may lead to hyperbilirubinemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the feces (this is largely why the feces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme \u03b2-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation. In addition, recent studies point towards high total bilirubin levels as a cause for gallstones regardless of gender or age.\nHealth benefits.\nIn the absence of liver disease, high levels of total bilirubin confers various health benefits. Studies have also revealed that levels of serum bilirubin (SBR) are inversely related to risk of certain heart diseases. While the poor solubility and potential toxicity of bilirubin limit its potential medicinal applications, current research is being done on whether bilirubin encapsulated silk fibrin nanoparticles can alleviate symptoms of disorders such as acute pancreatitis. In addition to this, there have been recent discoveries linking bilirubin and its \u03b5-polylysine-bilirubin conjugate (PLL-BR), to more efficient insulin medication. It seems that bilirubin exhibits protective properties during the islet transplantation process when drugs are delivered throughout the bloodstream.\nBlood tests.\nBilirubin is degraded by light. Blood collection tubes containing blood or (especially) serum to be used in bilirubin assays should be protected from illumination. For adults, blood is typically collected by needle from a vein in the arm. In newborns, blood is often collected from a heel stick, a technique that uses a small, sharp blade to cut the skin on the infant's heel and collect a few drops of blood into a small tube. Non-invasive technology is available in some health care facilities that will measure bilirubin by using a bilirubinometer which shines light onto the skin and calculates the amount of bilirubin by analysing how the light is absorbed or reflected. This device is also known as a transcutaneous bilirubin meter.\nBilirubin (in blood) is found in two forms:\nNote: Conjugated bilirubin is often incorrectly called \"direct bilirubin\" and unconjugated bilirubin is incorrectly called \"indirect bilirubin\". Direct and indirect refer solely to how compounds are measured or detected in solution. Direct bilirubin is any form of bilirubin which is water-soluble and is available in solution to react with assay reagents; direct bilirubin is often made up largely of conjugated bilirubin, but some unconjugated bilirubin (up to 25%) can still be part of the \"direct\" bilirubin fraction. Likewise, not all conjugated bilirubin is readily available in solution for reaction or detection (for example, if it is hydrogen bonding with itself) and therefore would not be included in the direct bilirubin fraction.\nTotal bilirubin (TBIL) measures both BU and BC. Total bilirubin assays work by using surfactants and accelerators (like caffeine) to bring all of the different bilirubin forms into solution where they can react with assay reagents. Total and direct bilirubin levels can be measured from the blood, but indirect bilirubin is calculated from the total and direct bilirubin.\nIndirect bilirubin is fat-soluble and direct bilirubin is water-soluble.\nTotal bilirubin.\nTotal bilirubin = direct bilirubin + indirect bilirubin\nElevation of both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin is more indicative of serious liver injury than is elevation in ALT alone, as postulated in Hy's law that elucidates the relation between the lab test results and drug-induced liver injury\nIndirect (unconjugated).\nThe measurement of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is underestimated by measurement of indirect bilirubin, as unconjugated bilirubin (without/yet glucuronidation) reacts with diazosulfanilic acid to create azobilirubin which is measured as direct bilirubin.\nDirect.\nDirect bilirubin = Conjugated bilirubin + delta bilirubin\nConjugated.\nIn the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by the enzyme glucuronyltransferase, first to bilirubin glucuronide and then to bilirubin diglucuronide, making it soluble in water: the conjugated version is the main form of bilirubin present in the \"direct\" bilirubin fraction. Much of it goes into the bile and thus out into the small intestine. Though most bile acid is reabsorbed in the terminal ileum to participate in enterohepatic circulation, conjugated bilirubin is not absorbed and instead passes into the colon.\nThere, colonic bacteria deconjugate and metabolize the bilirubin into colorless urobilinogen, which can be oxidized to form urobilin and stercobilin. Urobilin is excreted by the kidneys to give urine its yellow color and stercobilin is excreted in the feces giving stool its characteristic brown color. A trace (~1%) of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation to be re-excreted in the bile.\nConjugated bilirubin's half-life is shorter than delta bilirubin.\nDelta bilirubin.\nAlthough the terms direct and indirect bilirubin are sometimes used interchangeably with conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, the direct fraction actually includes both conjugated bilirubin and delta bilirubin.\nDelta bilirubin is albumin-bound conjugated bilirubin. In the other words, delta bilirubin is the kind of bilirubin covalently bound to albumin, which appears in the serum when hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin is impaired in patients with hepatobiliary disease. Furthermore, direct bilirubin tends to overestimate conjugated bilirubin levels due to unconjugated bilirubin that has reacted with diazosulfanilic acid, leading to increased azobilirubin levels (and increased direct bilirubin).\n\u03b4 bilirubin = total bilirubin \u2013 (unconjugated bilirubin + conjugated bilirubin)\nHalf-life.\nThe half-life of delta bilirubin is equivalent to that of albumin since the former is bound to the latter, yields 2\u20133 weeks.\nA free-of-bound bilirubin has a half-life of 2 to 4 hours.\nMeasurement methods.\nOriginally, the Van den Bergh reaction was used for a qualitative estimate of bilirubin.\nThis test is performed routinely in most medical laboratories and can be measured by a variety of methods.\nTotal bilirubin is now often measured by the 2,5-dichlorophenyldiazonium (DPD) method, and direct bilirubin is often measured by the method of Jendrassik and Grof.\nBlood levels.\nThe bilirubin level found in the body reflects the balance between production and excretion. Blood test results are advised to always be interpreted using the reference range provided by the laboratory that performed the test. The SI units are \u03bcmol/L. Typical ranges for adults are:\nUrine tests.\nUrine bilirubin may also be clinically significant. Bilirubin is not normally detectable in the urine of healthy people. If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a pathological process. Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble and so is not excreted in the urine. Testing urine for both bilirubin and urobilinogen can help differentiate obstructive liver disease from other causes of jaundice.\nAs with billirubin, under normal circumstances, only a very small amount of urobilinogen is excreted in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, some of the conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing an increase in the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase of urobilinogen in the urine. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.\nHistory.\nIn ancient history, Hippocrates discussed bile pigments in two of the four humours in the context of a relationship between yellow and black biles. Hippocrates visited Democritus in Abdera who was regarded as the expert in melancholy \"black bile\".\nRelevant documentation emerged in 1827 when M. Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard examined the biliary tract of an elephant that had died at a Paris zoo. He observed dilated bile ducts were full of yellow magma, which he isolated and found to be insoluble in water. Treating the yellow pigment with hydrochloric acid produced a strong green color. Thenard suspected the green pigment was caused by impurities derived from mucus of bile.\nLeopold Gmelin experimented with nitric acid in 1826 to establish the redox behavior in change from bilirubin to biliverdin, although the nomenclature did not exist at the time. The term biliverdin was coined by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius in 1840, although he preferred \"bilifulvin\" (yellow/red) over \"bilirubin\" (red). The term \"bilirubin\" was thought to have become mainstream based on the works of Staedeler in 1864 who crystallized bilirubin from cattle gallstones.\nRudolf Virchow in 1847 recognized hematoidin to be identical to bilirubin. It is not always distinguished from hematoidin, which one modern dictionary defines as synonymous with it but another defines as \"apparently chemically identical with bilirubin but with a different site of origin, formed locally in the tissues from hemoglobin, particularly under conditions of reduced oxygen tension.\" The synonymous identity of bilirubin and hematoidin was confirmed in 1923 by Fischer and Steinmetz using analytical crystallography.\nIn the 1930s, significant advances in bilirubin isolation and synthesis were described by Hans Fischer, , and others, and pioneering work pertaining to endogenous formation of bilirubin from heme was likewise conducted in the same decade. The suffix IX\u03b1 is partially based on a system developed Fischer, which means the bilin's parent compound was protoporphyrin IX cleaved at the alpha-methine bridge (see protoporphyrin IX nomenclature).\nOrigins pertaining to the physiological activity of bilirubin were described by Ernst Stadelmann in 1891, who may have observed the biotransformation of infused hemoglobin into bilirubin possibly inspired by Ivan Tarkhanov's 1874 works. suggested the source of endogenous bilirubin to be from hemoglobin in 1932. Plieninger and Fischer demonstrated an enzymatic oxidative loss of the alpha-methine bridge of heme resulting in a bis-lactam structure in 1942. It is widely accepted that Irving London was the first to demonstrate endogenous formation of bilirubin from hemoglobin in 1950, and Sjostrand demonstrated hemoglobin catabolism produces carbon monoxide between 1949 and 1952. 14C labeled protoporphyrin biotransformation to bilirubin evidence emerged in 1966 by Cecil Watson. Rudi Schmid and Tenhunen discovered heme oxygenase, the enzyme responsible, in 1968. Earlier in 1963, Nakajima described a soluble \"heme alpha-methnyl oxygeanse\" which what later determined to be a non-enzymatic pathway, such as formation of a 1,2-Dioxetane intermediate at the methine bridge resulting in carbon monoxide release and biliverdin formation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The user can choose between various third-party window managers, which differ from one another in several ways, including:\nHow X window managers work.\nWhen a window manager is running, some kinds of interaction between the X server and its clients are redirected through the window manager. In particular, whenever an attempt to show a new window is made, this request is redirected to the window manager, which decides the initial position of the window. Additionally, most modern window managers are reparenting, which usually leads to a banner being placed at the top of the window and a decorative frame being drawn around the window. These two elements are controlled by the window manager rather than the program. Therefore, when the user clicks or drags these elements, it is the window manager that takes the appropriate actions (such as moving or resizing the window).\nWindow managers are also responsible for icons. Indeed, icons do not exist at the X Window System core protocol level. When the user requests a window to be iconified, the window manager unmaps it (makes it non-visible) and takes the appropriate actions to show an icon in its place. Most modern window managers do not literally show icons to represent iconified windows anymore. Often, an auxiliary toolbar program will allow access to iconified windows.\nWhile the main aim of a window manager is to manage the windows, many window managers have additional features such as handling mouse clicks in the root window, presenting panes and other visual elements, handling some keystrokes (e.g., Alt-F4 may close a window), deciding which application to run at start-up, etc.\nStandardized protocols exist to allow normal clients to communicate with the window manager. The original one is Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM) but this has been superseded by the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH). These protocols allow clients to request titles for windows and icons, check if a window is iconified which might be docked or minimized, and possibly customize windows decorations, what virtual desktop the window occupies. Additional information from the window manager is available through the core protocol including the visibility of windows such as if a window is hidden on a different Virtual desktop, and figuring out the adjustments for the window manager frames.\nTypes of window managers.\nStacking window managers.\nA stacking window manager renders the windows one-by-one onto the screen at specific co-ordinates. If one window's area overlaps another, then the window \"on top\" overwrites part of the other's visible appearance. This results in the appearance familiar to many users in which windows act a little bit like pieces of paper on a desktop, which can be moved around and allowed to overlap.\nIn contrast to \"compositing\" window managers (see below), the lack of separate off-screen buffers can mean increased efficiency, but effects such as translucency are not possible.\nStacking window managers include Amiwm, Blackbox, CTWM, Enlightenment, Fluxbox, FLWM, FVWM, IceWM, MWM, Openbox, TWM and Window Maker.\nTiling window managers.\nA tiling window manager is a window manager with an organization of the screen into mutually non-overlapping frames (hence the name tiling), as opposed to the traditional approach of coordinate-based stacking of objects (windows) that tries to emulate the desk paradigm.\nTiling window managers include awesome, dwm, ion, larswm, ratpoison, Stumpwm, wmii, i3, xmonad, and XWEM.\nCompositing window managers.\nA compositing window manager may appear to the user similar to a stacking window manager. However, the individual windows are first rendered in individual buffers, and then their images are composited onto the screen buffer; this two-step process means that visual effects (such as shadows, translucency) can be applied. It also means that compositing window managers are inherently more resource-hungry than an equivalently-powerful stacking window manager. For this reason, some window managers for X do not support compositing by default, such as Openbox.\nHistorically, the Amiga in 1985, OSX in 2001, Java Looking Glass in 2003, and the Windows Longhorn demo in 2003 (delayed until Vista in 2007) preceded compositing efforts under X11. Compositing window managers for X include:\nCompositing support can be added to non-compositing window managers, through the use of compositors such as \"compton\".\nVirtual window managers.\nA virtual window manager is a window manager that uses virtual screens, whose resolution can be higher than the resolution of one's monitor/display adapter thus resembling a two dimensional virtual desktop with its viewport. This environment is very useful when one wishes to have a large number of windows open at the same time. A number of virtual window managers have been made, including FVWM, Tvtwm, HaZe and others.\nExtensible window managers.\nSome window managers are extensible, or programmable, by user scripts.\nIn these window managers, users can define new actions or override the default, or reactions to various events, like window size and position changes, window creation and deletion, key and mouse input, timer, etc. They often provide on-the-fly code execution, too.\nSome examples of such window managers and the used languages are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been adapted for film twice, in 1946 and again in 1978. The story is set in Los Angeles.\nThe story is noted for its complexity, with characters double-crossing one another and secrets being exposed throughout the narrative. The title is a euphemism for death; the final pages of the book refer to a rumination about \"sleeping the big sleep\".\nIn 1999, the book was voted 96th of \"Le Monde\"'s \"100 Books of the Century\". In 2005, it was included in \"Time\" magazine's \"List of the 100 Best Novels\".\nPlot.\nPhilip Marlowe, a heavy-drinking, laconic private investigator in Los Angeles, is called to the home of the wealthy and elderly General Sternwood. He wants Marlowe to deal with an attempt by a bookseller named Arthur Geiger to blackmail his wild young daughter, Carmen. She had previously been blackmailed by a man named Joe Brody. Sternwood mentions that his other, older daughter Vivian is in a loveless marriage with an Irish bootlegger named Rusty Regan, who has disappeared. On Marlowe's way out, Vivian wonders if he was hired to find Regan, but Marlowe will not say.\nMarlowe investigates Geiger's bookstore and meets Agnes, the clerk. He determines that the store is an illegal pornography-lending library. He follows Geiger home, stakes out his house and sees Carmen enter. Later, Marlowe hears a scream, followed by gunshots and two cars speeding away. He rushes in to find Geiger dead and Carmen drugged and naked, in front of a camera with no photographic plate. Marlowe takes her home but when he returns, Geiger's body is gone; he quickly leaves. The next day, the police call Marlowe and let him know the Sternwoods' car was found driven off a pier, with their chauffeur, Owen Taylor, dead inside. It appears that Owen was hit on the head before the car entered the water. The police also ask if Marlowe is looking for Regan.\nMarlowe stakes out Geiger's bookstore and sees its inventory being moved to Brody's home. Vivian comes to his office and says Carmen is being blackmailed with the nude photos from the previous night. She also mentions gambling at the casino of Eddie Mars and volunteers that Eddie's wife, Mona, ran off with Rusty. Marlowe revisits Geiger's house and finds Carmen trying to get inside. They look for the photos, but she pretends ignorance of the previous night. Eddie suddenly enters; he says he is Geiger's landlord and is looking for him. Eddie demands to know why Marlowe is there; Marlowe takes no notice and states that he is no threat to him.\nMarlowe goes to Brody's home and finds him with Agnes, the bookstore clerk. Marlowe tells Brody that he knows they are taking over the bookstore and blackmailing Carmen with the nude photos. Carmen appears with a gun and demands the photos, but Marlowe takes the weapon and makes her leave. He interrogates Brody further and pieces together the story: Geiger was blackmailing Carmen; Owen Taylor did not like this and killed Geiger, taking the film of Carmen. Brody was staking out Geiger's house during the murder and pursued Owen, knocked him out, stole the film and possibly pushed the car off the pier. Suddenly, the doorbell rings and Brody is shot dead; Marlowe gives chase and catches Geiger's male lover, Carol Lundgren, who shot Brody thinking he had killed Geiger. He had also hidden Geiger's body, so he could remove his own belongings before the police learned of the murder.\nThe case is seemingly over, but Marlowe is nagged by Rusty\u2019s disappearance. The police accept that he simply ran off with Mona, since she is also missing, and since Eddie would not risk committing a murder in which he would be the obvious suspect. Eddie calls Marlowe to his casino and seems to be nonchalant about everything. Vivian is also there, and Marlowe senses something between her and Eddie. Marlowe drives her home and she tries to seduce him, but he rejects her advances. When he gets home, he finds Carmen has crept into his bed, and he rejects her as well.\nA man named Harry Jones, Agnes' new partner, approaches Marlowe and offers to tell him Mona's location. Marlowe plans to meet him later, but Eddie\u2019s henchman, Lash Canino, is suspicious of Jones and Agnes' intentions and kills Jones first. Marlowe manages to meet Agnes anyway and receives the information. He goes to the location in Realito, a repair shop with a home at the back, but Canino \u2013 with the help of Art Huck, the garage man \u2013 jumps him and knocks him out. When Marlowe awakens, he is tied up and Mona is there with him. She says she has not seen Rusty in months; she only hid out to help Eddie and insists he did not kill Rusty. She frees Marlowe, and he shoots and kills Canino.\nThe next day, Marlowe visits Sternwood, who remains curious about Rusty's whereabouts and offers Marlowe an additional $1,000 if he is able to locate him. On the way out, Marlowe returns Carmen's gun to her, and she asks him to teach her how to shoot. They go to an abandoned field, where she tries to kill him, but he has loaded the gun with blanks and merely laughs at her; the shock causes Carmen to have an epileptic seizure. Marlowe brings her back and tells Vivian he has guessed the truth: Carmen came on to Rusty and he spurned her, so she killed him. Eddie, who had been backing Geiger, helped Vivian conceal the killing by helping to dispose of Rusty's body, inventing a story about his wife running off with Rusty, and then blackmailing her himself. Vivian says she did it to keep it all from her father, so he would not despise his own daughters, and promises to have Carmen institutionalized.\nWith the case now over, Marlowe goes to a local bar and orders several double Scotches. While drinking, he begins to think about Mona \"Silver-Wig\" Mars, but never sees her again.\nBackground.\n\"The Big Sleep\", like most of Chandler's novels, was written by what he called \"cannibalizing\" his short stories. Chandler would take stories he had already published in the pulp magazine \"Black Mask\" and rework them into a coherent novel. For \"The Big Sleep\", the two main stories that form the core of the novel are \"Killer in the Rain\" (published in 1935) and \"The Curtain\" (published in 1936). Although the stories were independent and shared no characters, they had some similarities that made it logical to combine them. In both stories there is a powerful father who is distressed by his wayward daughter. Chandler merged the two fathers into a new character and did the same for the two daughters, resulting in General Sternwood and his wild daughter Carmen. Chandler also borrowed small parts of two other stories, \"Finger Man\" and \"Mandarin's Jade\".\nThis process \u2014 especially in a time when cutting and pasting was done by cutting and pasting paper \u2014 sometimes produced a plot with a few loose ends. An unanswered question in \"The Big Sleep\" is who killed the chauffeur. When Howard Hawks filmed the novel, his writing team was perplexed by that question, in response to which Chandler replied that he had no idea. This exemplifies a difference between Chandler's style of crime fiction and that of previous authors. To Chandler, plot was less important than atmosphere and characterisation. An ending that answered every question while neatly tying every plot thread mattered less to Chandler than interesting characters with believable behaviour.\nWhen Chandler merged his stories into a novel, he spent more effort on expanding descriptions of people, places, and Marlowe's thinking than getting every detail of the plot perfectly consistent. In \"The Curtain\", the description of Mrs. O'Mara's room is just enough to establish the setting: This room had a white carpet from wall to wall. Ivory drapes of immense height lay tumbled casually on the white carpet inside the many windows, which stared towards the dark foot-hills. The air beyond the glass was dark too. It had not started to rain, yet there was a feeling of pressure in the atmosphere.In \"The Big Sleep\", Chandler expanded this description of the room and used new detail (e.g. the contrast of white and \"bled out\", the coming rain) to foreshadow the fact that Mrs. Regan (Mrs. O'Mara in the original story) is covering up the murder of her husband by her sister and that the coming rainstorm will bring more deaths: The room was too big, the ceiling was too high, the doors were too tall, and the white carpet that went from wall to wall looked like a fresh fall of snow at Lake Arrowhead. There were full-length mirrors and crystal doodads all over the place. The ivory furniture had chromium on it, and the enormous ivory drapes lay tumbled on the white carpet a yard from the windows. The white made the ivory look dirty and the ivory made the white look bled out. The windows stared towards the darkening foothills. It was going to rain soon. There was pressure in the air already.Of the historical plausibility of Geiger's character, Jay A. Gertzman wrote:Erotica dealers with experience had to be tough, although not necessarily predatory, and the business was not for the timid or scrupulous. But the criminality of erotica dealers did not extend beyond bookselling into organized racketeering; Al Capone and Meyer Lansky were not role models. A figure like A. G. Geiger, the dirty-books racketeer in Raymond Chandler's \"Big Sleep\" (1939) who supplements his business activities as owner of a pornographic lending library in Hollywood by arranging sex orgies and blackmailing rich customers, is a fascinating but lurid exaggeration. However susceptible film personalities were to blackmail, it was not the m\u00e9tier of book dealers.\n\"The Big Sleep\" takes place in the 1930s, and thus its story was also largely influenced by the very real massive social upheaval during the interwar period. During the harsh 1930s, the American people lost much faith in the government due to their repeated intervention failures, experienced the rise of gang violence from Prohibition, and endured the severe decline of public welfare from disasters such as the Great Depression and Dust Bowl. Chandler himself was fired from his job at an oil company in 1932, which would lead him to begin writing in the grittier and more cynical hard-boiled genre that mirrored the hardships of its time. In American essayist Herbert Ruhm's introduction to the \"Black Mask,\" a hard-boiled magazine that Chandler initially wrote for, Ruhm found that: \"...the streets of the cities best reflected the moral disorder of the era. Events were depicted in language of these streets; mean, slangy, prejudiced, sometimes witty and always tough.\"\nThrough this time of suffering, people began flocking towards big cities such as Los Angeles\u2014also the setting of \"The Big Sleep\u2014\"for work, which consequently made cities hotspots for the new meshing of demographic and socioeconomic changes. As a result, roots of modernity and mass culture began to form in America, slowly eroding old social norms such as the traditional views of masculinity and family. This plays heavily into Chandler's depiction of Marlowe as a chivalrous lone wolf of the old guard, futilely trying to change the world around him.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Big Sleep\" has achieved critical acclaim. On November 5, 2019, \"BBC News\" listed \"The Big Sleep\" on its list of the 100 most influential novels. In a 2014 retrospective, \"The Guardian\" ranked it No. 62 on its list of the 100 best novels. The book review site \"The Pequod\" rated the book a 9.5 (out of 10.0), saying, \"This is one of Raymond Chandler's best books \u2026 The real pleasures lie not in the story, but in Chandler's atmospheric settings.\" \"The New York Times\" also praised the book: \"As a study in depravity, the story is excellent, with Marlowe standing out as almost the only fundamentally decent person in it.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Humans, like most animals, have no mechanism to regulate excess iron, simply losing a limited amount through various means like sweating or menstruating.\nExcess iron accumulates in tissues and organs, disrupting their normal function. The most susceptible organs include the liver, heart, pancreas, skin, joints, gonads, thyroid and pituitary gland; patients can present with cirrhosis, polyarthropathy, hypogonadism, heart failure, or diabetes.\nThere are five types of hereditary hemochromatosis: type 1, 2 (2A, 2B), 3, 4 and 5, all caused by mutated genes. Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1 is the most frequent, and uniquely related to the HFE gene. It is most common among those of Northern European ancestry, in particular those of Celtic descent.\nThe disease follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene involved in each cell to develop the condition. In most cases, when a person has this autosomal recessive condition, their parents act as carriers. Carriers possess one copy of the mutated gene but do not manifest any signs or symptoms associated with the disease, and are referred to as carriers. The unaffected carrier parents play an integral role in transmitting one copy of the mutated gene to their child, who ultimately develops the disease. However, carriers may experience iron overload themselves at a later stage if certain factors come into play. Still, in most cases, they remain asymptomatic throughout their lives unless other genetic or environmental factors contribute to excessive iron accumulation within their bodies.\nSigns and symptoms.\nHaemochromatosis is protean in its manifestations, \"i.e.\", often presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of other diagnoses that affect specific organ systems. Many of the signs and symptoms below are uncommon, and most patients with the hereditary form of haemochromatosis do not show any overt signs of disease nor do they have premature morbidity, if they are diagnosed early, but, more often than not, the condition is diagnosed only at autopsy.\nPresently, the classic triad of cirrhosis, bronze skin, and diabetes is less common because of earlier diagnosis.\nThe more common clinical manifestations include:\nLess common findings including:\nIn the hereditary hemochromatosis (HH or HHC), males are usually diagnosed after their forties and fifties, and women some decades later, during menopause. The severity of clinical disease varies considerably. Some evidence suggests that hereditary haemochromatosis patients affected with other liver ailments such as hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease have worse liver disease than those with either condition alone. Also, juvenile form of primary haemochromatosis (Hemochromatosis type 2) present in childhood with the same consequences of iron overload.\nEnd-organ damage.\nIron is stored in the liver, pancreas and heart.\nLong-term effects of haemochromatosis on these organs can be serious, even fatal when untreated.\nSince the liver is a primary storage area for iron and naturally accumulates excess iron over time, it is likely to be damaged by iron overload.\nToxins may accumulate in the blood and eventually affect mental functioning due to increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy.\nTogether, they can increase the risk of liver cancer to one in three persons.\nIf excess iron in the heart interferes with its ability to circulate enough blood, a number of problems can occur, including (potentially fatal) congestive heart failure. The condition may be reversible when haemochromatosis is treated and excess iron stores are reduced. Arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm can cause heart palpitations, chest pain, and light-headedness, and is occasionally life-threatening. This condition can often be reversed with treatment.\nThe pancreas, which also stores iron, is very important in the body's mechanisms for sugar metabolism. Diabetes affects the way the body uses blood sugar (glucose), and diabetes is, in turn, the leading cause of new blindness in adults and may be involved in kidney failure.\nHaemochromatosis may lead to cirrhosis and its complications, including bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) and stomach (gastric varices) and severe fluid retention in the abdomen (ascites).\nSeverity of periodontal disease is associated with high transferrin saturation in haemochromatosis patients.\nGenetics.\nThe regulation of dietary iron absorption is complex and understanding is incomplete. One of the better-characterized genes responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis is \"HFE\" on chromosome 6, which codes for a transmembrane protein involved in the induction of hepcidin expression upon high iron load. The \"HFE\" gene has three often observed genetic variants:\nThe worldwide prevalence rates for H63D, C282Y and S65C (minor allele frequencies) are 10%, 3% and 1% respectively.\nThe C282Y allele is a transition point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 845 in \"HFE\", resulting in a missense mutation that replaces the cysteine residue at position 282 with a tyrosine amino acid. Heterozygotes for either allele can manifest clinical iron overload, if they have two of any alleles. This makes them compound heterozygous for haemochromatosis and puts them greatly at risk of storing excess iron in the body. Homozygosity for the C282Y genetic variant is the most common genotype responsible for clinical iron accumulation, though heterozygosity for C282Y/H63D variants, so-called compound heterozygotes, results in clinically evident iron overload. Considerable debate exists regarding the penetrance\u2014the probability of clinical expression of the trait given the genotype\u2014 for clinical disease in homozygotes. Most males homozygous for \"HFE\" C282Y show at least one manifestation of iron-storage disease by middle age. Individuals with the relevant genetic variants may never develop iron overload. Phenotypic expression is present in 10-33% of C282Y homozygotes with less than 10% going on to experience severe iron overload and organ damage, and biochemical expression is present in 38-50%.\nThe H63D variant is just a gene polymorphism, and if there are no other changes, it may not have clinical significance. In a 2014 study, H63D homozygosity was associated with an elevated mean ferritin level, but only 6.7% had documented iron overload at follow-up. As about the people with one copy of the H63D alteration (heterozygous carriers), this genotype is very unlikely to cause a clinical presentation, there is no predictable risk of iron overload. Besides that, two 2020 studies revealed that the frequency of homozygous or heterozygous H63D variant is significantly higher in elite endurance athletes comparing to ethnically matched controls, and is associated with high V\u0307O2max in male athletes.\nEach patient with the susceptible genotype accumulates iron at different rates depending on iron intake, the exact nature of the genetic variant, and the presence of other insults to the liver, such as alcohol and viral disease. As such, the degree to which the liver and other organs are affected is highly variable and is dependent on these factors and co-morbidities, as well as age at which they are studied for manifestations of disease. Penetrance differs between populations.\nDisease-causing genetic variants of the \"HFE\" gene account for 90% of the cases of non-transfusion iron overload.\nThis gene is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus.\nPathophysiology.\nSince the regulation of iron metabolism is still poorly understood, a clear model of how haemochromatosis operates is still not available. A working model describes the defect in the \"HFE\" gene, where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, \"HFE\" facilitates the binding of transferrin, which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, \"HFE\" is only part of the story, since many patients with mutated \"HFE\" do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal \"HFE\" genotype. A possible explanation is the fact that \"HFE\" normally plays a role in the production of hepcidin in the liver, a function that is impaired in \"HFE\" mutations.\nPeople with abnormal iron regulatory genes do not reduce their absorption of iron in response to increased iron levels in the body. Thus, the iron stores of the body increase. As they increase, the iron which is initially stored as ferritin is deposited in organs as haemosiderin and this is toxic to tissue, probably at least partially by inducing oxidative stress. Iron is a pro-oxidant. Thus, haemochromatosis shares common symptomology (e.g., cirrhosis and dyskinetic symptoms) with other \"pro-oxidant\" diseases such as Wilson's disease, chronic manganese poisoning, and hyperuricaemic syndrome in Dalmatian dogs. The latter also experience \"bronzing\".\nDiagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of haemochromatosis is often made following the incidental finding on routine blood screening of elevated serum liver enzymes or elevation of the transferrin saturation or elevated serum ferritin. Arthropathy with stiff joints, diabetes, or fatigue, may be the presenting complaint.\nBlood tests.\nSerum ferritin and fasting transferrin saturation are commonly used as screening for haemochromatosis. Transferrin binds iron and is responsible for iron transport in the blood. Measuring ferritin provides a crude measure of iron stores in the body. Fasting transferrin saturation values in excess of 45%, and the serum ferritin more than 250\u00a0ug/L in males and 200\u00a0ug/L in females are recognized as a threshold for further evaluation of haemochromatosis. Other source says that the normal values for males are 30-400\u00a0ng/mL and for female, 13-150\u00a0ng/mL. Fasting transferrin saturation is a better test to detect HH. Transferrin saturation greater than 62% is suggestive of homozygosity for mutations in the HFE gene.\nFerritin, a protein synthesized by the liver, is the primary form of iron storage within cells and tissues. Measuring ferritin provides a crude estimate of whole-body iron stores, though is raised in many conditions, particularly inflammatory conditions. Examples of causes for raised serum ferritin include but are not limited to: infection, chronic alcohol consumption (mainly &gt;20g/day), liver disease, cancer, porphyria, Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, hyperthyroidism, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, several blood transfusions, too many iron supplements, aceruloplasminemia, atransferrinemia, hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome and others. Proinflammatory states account for up to 90% of raised ferritin. Serum ferritin in excess of 1000\u00a0ng/mL of blood is almost always attributable to haemochromatosis.\nLiver biopsy.\nLiver biopsies involve taking a sample of tissue from the liver, using a thin needle. The amount of iron in the sample is then quantified and compared to normal, and evidence of liver damage, especially cirrhosis, is measured microscopically. Formerly, this was the only way to confirm a diagnosis of haemochromatosis. Risks of biopsy include bruising, bleeding, and infection. Now, when a history, measures of transferrin saturation and ferritin, and MRI (R2*/T2*) point to haemochromatosis, a liver biopsy is not necessary to quantify the amount of accumulated iron. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for detecting and quantifying hepatic fibrosis.\nMRI.\nMRI-based testing is a noninvasive and accurate alternative to measure liver iron concentrations (LIC) and hepatic fibrosis.\nOther imaging.\nClinically, the disease may be silent, but characteristic radiological features may point to the diagnosis. The increased iron stores in the organs involved, especially in the liver and pancreas, result in characteristic findings on unenhanced CT, but it is not good for detecting tissue iron. Haemochromatosis arthropathy includes degenerative osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis. The distribution of the arthropathy is distinctive, but not unique, frequently affecting the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand. The arthropathy can, therefore, be an clue as to the diagnosis of haemochromatosis.\nFunctional testing.\nBased on the history, a physician might consider specific tests to monitor organ dysfunction, such as an echocardiogram for heart failure, or blood glucose monitoring for patients with haemochromatosis diabetes.\nStages.\nThe American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases suggests the following three stages for the condition (identified by the European Association for the Study of Liver Diseases):\nIndividuals at each stage do not necessarily progress on to the next stage, and end stage disease is more common in males.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nOther causes of excess iron accumulation exist, which have to be considered before haemochromatosis type 1 is diagnosed.\nScreening.\nStandard diagnostic measures for haemochromatosis, transferrin saturation and ferritin tests, are not a part of routine medical testing. Screening for haemochromatosis is recommended if the patient has a parent, child, or sibling with the disease.\nRoutine screening of the general population for hereditary haemochromatosis is generally not done. Mass genetic screening has been evaluated by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, among other groups, which recommended against genetic screening of the general population for hereditary haemochromatosis because the likelihood of discovering an undiagnosed patient with clinically relevant iron overload is less than one in 1,000. Although strong evidence shows that treatment of iron overload can save lives in patients with transfusional iron overload, no clinical study has shown that for asymptomatic carriers of hereditary haemochromatosis treatment with venesection (phlebotomy) provides any clinical benefit. Recently, patients are suggested to be screened for iron overload using serum ferritin as a marker. If serum ferritin exceeds 1000\u00a0ng/mL, iron overload is very likely the cause.\nTreatment.\nPhlebotomy.\nEarly diagnosis is vital, as the late effects of iron accumulation can be wholly prevented by periodic phlebotomies (by venesection) comparable in volume to blood donations.\nPhlebotomy (or bloodletting) is usually done at a weekly or each two weeks interval until ferritin levels are 50-100 \u03bcg/L. To prevent iron reaccumulation, subsequent phlebotomies are normally carried out about once every three to four months for males, and twice a year for females to keep the serum ferritin between 50 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L. This treatment can have the side effect of altering trace element metabolism, including changes in the blood concentrations of potentially toxic elements such as cadmium and lead.\nIron chelation therapy.\nWhere venesection is not possible, long-term administration of an iron chelator as Deferoxamine (or Desferrioxamine), Deferasirox and Deferiprone is useful. Deferoxamine is an iron-chelating compound, and excretion induced by deferoxamine is enhanced by administration of vitamin C. It cannot be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding due to risk of defects in the child.\nDiet.\nDiet can be a powerful but understudied and utilized tool in prevention of iron overload. It can strongly affect the incidence of disease and treatment. Especially in the Western world where many foods are fortified and animal protein (heme iron) is relatively convenient and inexpensive, it is very common for people to eat more than the https:// even in a single meal. For example, one serving of several popular cereals, such as Cheerios or Grape Nuts, has about two times the RDA of iron for a man or non menstruating woman. Menstruating women have roughly twice the iron requirements of a man or non menstruating woman. For this reason, it can very helpful for those recently diagnosed to track their iron and vitamin C consumption for a time and comparing it to the RDA. \nChelating polymers.\nA novel experimental approach to the hereditary haemochromatosis treatment is the maintenance therapy with polymeric chelators. These polymers or particles have a negligible or null systemic biological availability and they are designed to form stable complexes with Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the GIT and thus limiting the uptake of these ions and their long-term accumulation. Although this method has only a limited efficacy, unlike small-molecular chelators, such an approach has virtually no side effects in sub-chronic studies. Interestingly, the simultaneous chelation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ increases the treatment efficacy.\nPrognosis.\nPersons with symptomatic haemochromatosis have somewhat reduced life expectancy compared to the general population, mainly due to excess mortality from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Patients who were treated with phlebotomy lived longer than those who were not. Patients without liver disease or diabetes had similar survival rate to the general population.\nEpidemiology.\nHaemochromatosis is one of the most common heritable genetic conditions in people of Northern Europe, with a prevalence of 1:200. The disease has a variable penetration, and about one in 10 people of this demographic carry a mutation in one of the genes regulating iron metabolism. In the U.S., the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations is 5.4% and 13.5%, respectively. Whereas, the worldwide frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations is about 1.9% and 8.1%, respectively, so mutation in H63D allele are more than C282Y allele. The prevalence of mutations in iron-metabolism genes varies in different populations. A study of 3,011 unrelated white Australians found that 14% were heterozygous carriers of an HFE mutation, 0.5% were homozygous for an \"HFE\" mutation, and only 0.25% of the study population had clinically relevant iron overload. Most patients who are homozygous for \"HFE\" mutations do not manifest clinically relevant haemochromatosis (see Genetics above). Other populations have a lower prevalence of both the genetic mutation and the clinical disease. It is the most frequent genetic disease in the U.S. with a prevalence of 1:300 in the non-Hispanic white population, It is 2\u20133 times more common in males.\nGenetics studies suggest the original haemochromatosis mutation arose in a single person, possibly of Celtic ethnicity, who lived 60\u201370 generations ago. At that time, when dietary iron may have been scarcer than today, the presence of the mutant allele may have provided an evolutionary advantage by maintaining higher iron levels in the blood.\nThe distribution of the C282Y variant was noted in various countries. Non-HFE associated hemochromatosis, as Haemochromatosis type 2, Haemochromatosis type 3, Haemochromatosis type 4 and Haemochromatosis type 5, were discovered in Mediterranean countries. On the other side, Northern European ancestry is closely linked to hereditary hemochromatosis disease (HFE). In one study, over 93% of Irish patients with HFE C282Y mutation were homozygotic. The G320V mutation in the HJV gene, which produces hemojuvelin protein, is widely distributed in central Europe and Greece.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"haemochromatosis\" is used by different sources in many different ways.\nIt is often used to imply an association with the \"HFE\" gene. For many years, \"HFE\" was the only known gene associated with haemochromatosis, and the term \"hereditary haemochromatosis\" was used to describe haemochromatosis type 1. However, many different genetic associations with this condition are now known. The older the text, or the more general the audience, the more likely that \"HFE\" is implied. \"Haemochromatosis\" has also been used in contexts where a genetic cause for iron accumulation had not been known. In some cases, however, a condition that was thought to be due to diet or environment was later linked to a genetic polymorphism, as in African iron overload.\nHistory.\nIn 1847, Virchow described a golden brown granular pigment that was soluble in sulfuric acid and produced red ash on ignition. The disease was first described in 1865 by Armand Trousseau in a report on diabetes in patients presenting with a bronze pigmentation of their skin. Two years later, Perls developed the first practical method for the analysis of iron in tissue. Despite Trousseau not associating diabetes with iron accumulation, the recognition that infiltration of the pancreas with iron might disrupt endocrine function resulting in diabetes was made by Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1890. In 1935, English gerontologist Joseph Sheldon described the cases of haemochromatosis. He established this as the name of the disorder and his detailed monograph. Despite lacking the modern molecular techniques accessible today, he came to accurate conclusions that describe haemochromatosis disease as an inborn error of metabolism where this inherited disorder can increase the absorption of iron and thus cause tissue damage due to iron deposition. Moreover, he rejected theories that alcohol, drug, and other factors contribute to the disorder.\nThe clinical case series from 1935 to 1955 indicated that haemochromatosis was more common than had been acknowledged. During the 1960s, MacDonald, a pathologist at Boston City Hospital, diverted attention away from the true cause of haemochromatosis. He believed that haemochromatosis was a nutritional condition because he observed many drunken patients of Irish ancestry. During this period of time, other investigators reported additional evidence suggesting that a genetic factor could play a central role in the absorption of iron in people with haemochromatosis. However, alcohol consumption is known to increase the risk of liver injury in haemochromatosis. This finding is consistent with the concept that excess iron metabolism is a primary cause of haemochromatosis disease.\nFinally, in 1976, Marcel Simon and his collaborators confirmed that haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that has a link to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region of the genome. It took 20 years for researchers at Mercator Genetics to effectively identify and clone the haemochromatosis genes using a positional cloning approach.\nIn 1996, Feder et al. identified HFE, which is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene. They found that 83% of patients have homozygosity for a missense mutation (C282Y) in the HFE gene. Finally, several groups reported their findings in a series of patients with haemochromatosis where they discovered the existence of the C282Y mutation in about 85-90% of the cases. The discovery has led to improved clinical medicine and liver disease evaluation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable and logical manner. There exists countless kinds of unclassified patterns, present in everyday nature, fashion, many artistic areas, as well as a connection with mathematics. A geometric pattern is a type of pattern formed of repeating geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper design.\nAny of the senses may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in science, mathematics, or language may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual patterns in nature are often chaotic, rarely exactly repeating, and often involve fractals. Natural patterns include spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tilings, cracks, and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection. Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure;6 indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.\nIn many areas of the decorative arts, from ceramics and textiles to wallpaper, \"pattern\" is used for an ornamental design that is manufactured, perhaps for many different shapes of object. In art and architecture, decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer.\nNature.\nNature provides examples of many kinds of pattern, including symmetries, trees and other structures with a fractal dimension, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tilings, cracks and stripes.\nSymmetry.\nSymmetry is widespread in living things. Animals that move usually have bilateral or mirror symmetry as this favours movement. Plants often have radial or rotational symmetry, as do many flowers, as well as animals which are largely static as adults, such as sea anemones. Fivefold symmetry is found in the echinoderms, including starfish, sea urchins, and sea lilies.\nAmong non-living things, snowflakes have striking sixfold symmetry: each flake is unique, its structure recording the varying conditions during its crystallisation similarly on each of its six arms.52 Crystals have a highly specific set of possible crystal symmetries; they can be cubic or octahedral, but cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals).\nSpirals.\nSpiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including molluscs such as the nautilus, and in the phyllotaxis of many plants, both of leaves spiralling around stems, and in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such as the sunflower and fruit structures like the pineapple.\nChaos, turbulence, meanders and complexity.\nChaos theory predicts that while the laws of physics are deterministic, there are events and patterns in nature that never exactly repeat because extremely small differences in starting conditions can lead to widely differing outcomes. The patterns in nature tend to be static due to dissipation on the emergence process, but when there is interplay between injection of energy and dissipation there can arise a complex dynamic. Many natural patterns are shaped by this complexity, including vortex streets, other effects of turbulent flow such as meanders in rivers. or nonlinear interaction of the system \nWaves, dunes.\nWaves are disturbances that carry energy as they move. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium \u2013 air or water, making it oscillate as they pass by. Wind waves are surface waves that create the chaotic patterns of the sea. As they pass over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples; similarly, as the wind passes over sand, it creates patterns of dunes.\nBubbles, foam.\nFoams obey Plateau's laws, which require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant average curvature. Foam and bubble patterns occur widely in nature, for example in radiolarians, sponge spicules, and the skeletons of silicoflagellates and sea urchins.\nCracks.\nCracks form in materials to relieve stress: with 120 degree joints in elastic materials, but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. Cracking patterns are widespread in nature, for example in rocks, mud, tree bark and the glazes of old paintings and ceramics.\nSpots, stripes.\nAlan Turing, and later the mathematical biologist James D. Murray and other scientists, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns, for example in the skin of mammals or the plumage of birds: a reaction\u2013diffusion system involving two counter-acting chemical mechanisms, one that activates and one that inhibits a development, such as of dark pigment in the skin. These spatiotemporal patterns slowly drift, the animals' appearance changing imperceptibly as Turing predicted.\nArt and architecture.\nTilings.\nIn visual art, pattern consists in regularity which in some way \"organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner.\" At its simplest, a pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a painting, drawing, tapestry, ceramic tiling or carpet, but a pattern need not necessarily repeat exactly as long as it provides some form or organizing \"skeleton\" in the artwork. In mathematics, a tessellation is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes (which mathematicians call tiles), with no overlaps and no gaps.\nIn architecture.\nIn architecture, motifs are repeated in various ways to form patterns. Most simply, structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically (see leading picture). Architects can use and repeat decorative and structural elements such as columns, pediments, and lintels. Repetitions need not be identical; for example, temples in South India have a roughly pyramidal form, where elements of the pattern repeat in a fractal-like way at different sizes.\nLanguage and linguistics.\nLanguage provides researchers in linguistics with a wealth of patterns to investigate,\nand literary studies can investigate patterns in areas such as sound, grammar, motifs, metaphor, imagery, and narrative plot.\nScience and mathematics.\nMathematics is sometimes called the \"Science of Pattern\", in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed. For example, any sequence of numbers that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern. Mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns.\nGravity is a source of ubiquitous scientific patterns or patterns of observation. The rising and falling pattern of the sun each day results from the rotation of the earth while in orbit around the sun. Likewise, the moon's path through the sky is due to its orbit of the earth. These examples, while perhaps trivial, are examples of the \"unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics\" which obtain due to the differential equations whose application within physics function to describe the most general empirical patterns of the universe.\nReal patterns.\nDaniel Dennett's notion of real patterns, discussed in his 1991 paper of the same name, provides an ontological framework aiming to discern the reality of patterns beyond mere human interpretation, by examining their predictive utility and the efficiency they provide in compressing information. For example, centre of gravity is a real pattern because it allows the prediction of the movements of a bodies such as the earth around the sun, and it compresses all the information about all the particles in the sun and the earth that allows scientists to make those predictions.\nFractals.\nSome mathematical rule-patterns can be visualised, and among these are those that explain patterns in nature including the mathematics of symmetry, waves, meanders, and fractals. Fractals are mathematical patterns that are scale-invariant. This means that the shape of the pattern does not depend on how closely you look at it. Self-similarity is found in fractals. Examples of natural fractals are coastlines and tree-shapes, which repeat their shape regardless of the magnification used by the viewer. While self-similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their formation can be simple (e.g. Lindenmayer systems describing tree-shapes).\nIn pattern theory, devised by Ulf Grenander, mathematicians attempt to describe the world in terms of patterns. The goal is to lay out the world in a more computationally-friendly manner.\nIn the broadest sense, any regularity that can be explained by a scientific theory is a pattern. As in mathematics, science can be taught as a set of patterns.\nA 2021 study, \"Aesthetics and Psychological Effects of Fractal Based Design\", suggested that \nfractal patterns possess self-similar components that repeat at varying size scales. The perceptual experience of human-made environments can be impacted with inclusion of these natural patterns. Previous work has demonstrated consistent trends in preference for and complexity estimates of fractal patterns. However, limited information has been gathered on the impact of other visual judgments. Here we examine the aesthetic and perceptual experience of fractal 'global-forest' designs already installed in humanmade spaces and demonstrate how fractal pattern components are associated with positive psychological experiences that can be utilized to promote occupant wellbeing. These designs are composite fractal patterns consisting of individual fractal 'tree-seeds' which combine to create a 'global fractal forest.' The local 'tree-seed' patterns, global configuration of tree-seed locations, and overall resulting 'global-forest' patterns have fractal qualities. These designs span multiple mediums yet are all intended to lower occupant stress without detracting from the function and overall design of the space. In this series of studies, we first establish divergent relationships between various visual attributes, with pattern complexity, preference, and engagement ratings increasing with fractal complexity compared to ratings of refreshment and relaxation which stay the same or decrease with complexity. Subsequently, we determine that the local constituent fractal ('tree-seed') patterns contribute to the perception of the overall fractal design, and address how to balance aesthetic and psychological effects (such as individual experiences of perceived engagement and relaxation) in fractal design installations. This set of studies demonstrates that fractal preference is driven by a balance between increased arousal (desire for engagement and complexity) and decreased tension (desire for relaxation or refreshment). Installations of these composite mid-high complexity 'global-forest' patterns consisting of 'tree-seed' components balance these contrasting needs, and can serve as a practical implementation of biophilic patterns in human-made environments to promote occupant wellbeing.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Parabolic mirrors or heliostats concentrate light (Insolation) onto a focal point. The temperature at the focal point may reach , and this heat can be used to generate electricity, melt steel, make hydrogen fuel or nanomaterials.\nThe largest solar furnace is at Odeillo in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales in France, opened in 1970. It employs an array of plane mirrors to gather sunlight, reflecting it onto a larger curved mirror.\nHistory.\nThe ancient Greek / Latin term \"heliocaminus\" means \"solar furnace\" and refers to a glass-enclosed sunroom intentionally designed to become hotter than the outside air temperature.\nLegendary accounts of the Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC) tell of Archimedes' heat ray, a set of burnished brass mirrors or burning glasses supposedly used to ignite attacking ships, though modern historians doubt its veracity.\nOn 24 September 1901, Knut C. Wideen was granted a patent for a \"System for collecting and utilizing solar heat\", which included a solar furnace.\nThe first modern solar furnace is believed to have been built in France in 1949 by Professor F\u00e9lix Trombe.

At the age of two, his family moved to the suburbs of Paris, but traveled to A\u00ff for summer holidays. These trips influenced Lalique later on in his naturalistic glasswork. With the death of his father, Lalique began working as an apprentice to goldsmith Louis Aucoc in Paris. Lalique died on 1 May or 5 May 1945, in Paris. Ren\u00e9 Lalique was buried in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France. His daughter Suzanne Lalique was the painter and set designer for the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. His son Marc Lalique continued the family business as a glass artist himself. It was under his impetus that the Maison Lalique began its transition from glass to crystal in the early 1950s. Marc's daughter, Marie Claude-Lalique (b. 1936), was also a glass maker who died on 14 April 2003 in Fort Myers, Florida.\nEducation.\nIn 1872, when he was twelve, Ren\u00e9 entered the Coll\u00e8ge Turgot, where he started drawing and sketching. He attended evening classes at the Ecole des arts d\u00e9coratifs. He worked there from 1874 to 1876 and subsequently spent two years at the Crystal Palace School of Art Sydenham, London. During that time, he also practised as an apprentice goldsmith to leading Parisian Art Nouveau jeweller and goldsmith Louis Aucoc. At the Sydenham Art College, his skills for graphic design were improved, and his naturalistic approach to art was further developed.\nIn 1876, at 16, Ren\u00e9 Lalique was apprenticed to the jeweler Louis Aucoc. Aucoc was among the leading jewelers working in Paris at the time, and this provided the young Ren\u00e9 Lalique with an excellent opportunity to learn jewelry production and design. During this time, Lalique also studied at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. By 1881, Lalique worked as a freelance designer for several French jewelry firms, including Cartier and Boucheron. In 1886, he started working in his workshop in Paris, in the former workshop of Jules Destape.\nIn 1890, Ren\u00e9 Lalique opened a jewelry store in the Op\u00e9ra district of Paris. While working in this new shop, some of Ren\u00e9 Lalique's most famous jewelry designs were created, as well as his experimentation and use of glass.\nThe main motif of Lalique's jewelry design was the natural world. His designs often featured motifs such as dragonflies, orchids, and peacocks, crafted using a combination of enamel, gemstones, and semi-precious materials. Lalique surrounded himself at work with flowers to serve as subtle inspiration for his art. These motifs symbolized the organic flow of life, metamorphosis, and beauty in motion. He was influenced not only by the nature of the French countryside but also by the motifs of Japanese nature art. And he incorporated many materials into his jewelry that were not widely used in high-end jewelry in his time, including glass, horn, pearl, semi-precious stones, enamel, and ivory. He used typical period gemstones only for artistic appearance and not for their value. Therefore, his Lalique jewelry creations were not just holders of precious stones, they were works of art in their own right, creating worldwide interest and great demand.\nArt Nouveau jewellery designer.\nWhen he returned from England, he worked as a freelance artist, designing pieces of jewellery for French jewelers Cartier, Boucheron, and others. In 1885, he opened his own business, designed and made his own jewellery and other glass pieces. After 1895, Lalique also created pieces for Samuel Bing's Paris shop, the Maison de l'Art Nouveau, which gave Art Nouveau its name.\nOne of Lalique's major patrons was Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian, who commissioned more than 140 of his works over nearly 30 years. Many of these works can be seen on permanent display at the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon, Portugal.\nGlass maker.\nLalique was best known for his creations in glass art. In the 1920s, he became noted for his work in the Art Deco style. He was responsible for the walls of lighted glass and elegant coloured glass columns which filled the dining room and \"grand salon\" of the and the interior fittings, cross, screens, reredos and font of St. Matthew's Church at Millbrook in Jersey (Lalique's \"Glass Church\"). \nAs part of the Art Nouveau style, many of his jewellery pieces and vases showcase plants, flowers and flowing lines.\nIn 1907, Lalique began collaborating with Fran\u00e7ois Coty to design luxury perfume bottles. He eventually created hundreds of different models, many of which became iconic, for companies such as Guerlain, Houbigant, Worth, Rogeret et Gallet, D'Orsay, Forvil, and Worth. \nLalique was also a pioneer in the use of 'p\u00e2te-de-verre,' an ancient glassworking technique, which he used to mold ground glass into intricate, lifelike forms in both jewelry and decorative objects.\nBoth unique and commercial works of Ren\u00e9 Lalique are in the collections of a large number of public museums around the world including the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon, the Lalique Museum of Hakone in Japan, the Mus\u00e9e Lalique and the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in France, the Schmuckmuseum Pforzheim in Germany, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Metropolitan Museum and the Corning Museum in New York State, and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n\"Lalique Mascots - Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 (or critical catalogue) The Automotive Radiator Hood, Desk Ornaments, Trophies and Bookends of master glass artisan R.

{"id": "68363", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68363", "title": "Chick Hearn", "text": "American basketball sportscaster (1916\u20132002)\nFrancis Dayle \"Chick\" Hearn (November 27, 1916 \u2013 August 5, 2002) was an American sportscaster who was the play-by-play announcer for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association for 41 years, as well as the team's assistant general manager for seven years beginning in 1972. Hearn was the first broadcaster named to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Hearn is remembered for his rapid fire, staccato broadcasting style, associated with colorful phrases such as \"slam dunk\", \"air ball\", and \"no harm, no foul\" that have become common basketball vernacular. Hearn broadcast 3,338 consecutive Lakers games starting on November 21, 1965. \nMost of Hearn's games in the television era were simulcast on both radio and television, even after most teams chose to use different announcers for the different media.\nLife and career.\nEarly life and nickname.\nHearn was born in Buda, Illinois and raised in Aurora, Illinois, in west suburban Chicago, and attended high school at Marmion Academy and college at Bradley University. He earned the nickname \"Chick\" while an Amateur Athletic Union basketball player at Bradley, when teammates played a prank on him: giving him a shoebox to see his surprised reaction when he opened it and found not sneakers inside, but instead a dead chicken.\nHe and his wife Marge were married August 13, 1938. They had two children, a son, Gary, and a daughter, Samantha aka Janice, both of whom predeceased Hearn. His granddaughter is Shannon. Marge Hearn died January 30, 2016, at the age of 98.\nBroadcasting streak.\nHearn's broadcasting streak began on November 21, 1965. Hearn missed the Lakers' game the previous night after having been stranded in Fayetteville, Arkansas, by inclement weather after having announced a game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Even that was only Hearn's second missed assignment for the Lakers since he had become the team's broadcaster in March 1961. He would not miss another until December 16, 2001. Over the course of the streak, Hearn was paired with several different color commentators, including \u201dHot\u201d Rod Hundley, Pat Riley, Keith Erickson, Dick Schad, Lynn Shackelford and Stu Lantz.\nHearn's streak of 3,338 consecutive Lakers games came to an end on December 16, 2001, in order to undergo scheduled cardiac bypass surgery. Hearn recovered from his surgery, but in February 2002, he suffered a broken hip after falling at a gas station, which further delayed his expected return to the Lakers broadcast booth. Hearn recovered from both issues and resumed broadcasting on April 9, 2002, receiving a standing ovation from the Staples Center crowd upon his return. His final broadcast was for the Lakers' radio feed of Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Finals where the Lakers defeated the New Jersey Nets to win their third consecutive NBA championship. His final Lakers-affiliated appearance was as the emcee of the team's 2002 championship parade in June.\nAssistant general manager.\nHearn became assistant general manager of the Lakers in 1972, hired by Jack Kent Cooke, the team's owner at the time. Hearn advised management on personnel and trades, and helped negotiate player contracts as part of the role which he held for seven years. Hearn advised team owner Cooke to draft future hall of fame player Magic Johnson in 1979.\nNon-Lakers work.\nHearn was the long-time host of \"Bowling for Dollars\" on KTLA (1972\u20131976); KHJ-TV (now KCAL-TV) (1978). He called the closed-circuit television broadcast of the first Ali-Frazier fight in 1971. He also did boxing commentary for Forum boxing fights in Inglewood in the 1980s, usually appearing alongside former featherweight contender Ruben Castillo. Hearn also contributed to KCAL-TV's coverage of the U.S. Open golf tournament from 1957 to 1964. At the time, Hearn handled the sports desk of the local news program on Los Angeles' NBC affiliate, KRCA (now KNBC). Hearn announced USC football and basketball games from 1956 to 1961, and also served as the play-by-play broadcaster for USC football games on tape-delayed, syndicated telecasts during the 1973 season. Hearn called UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball games on KHJ/KCAL with Ross Porter from 1986 to 1990. During the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, Hearn called the play-by-play for USA Men's Basketball games on the pay per view Olympics Triplecast \"Red\" channel.\nMusic.\nHearn can be heard on the Pink Floyd album \"The Wall\" (at the 4:07 mark of the song \"Don't Leave Me Now\" as \"Pink\" flips through television channels just before destroying his television set leading into the song \"Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 3\"). This clip of Hearn appears to have been taken from an actual game between the Lakers and Bulls which was probably recorded during the 1978\u201379 season. \nBefore the playoffs in the 1986 season, Hearn released a 12-inch rap single \"Rap-Around\". The song features Hearn in the studio re-creating many of his most famous 'Chickisms' and was distributed by Macola Records (who distributed an early Dr. Dre/Ice Cube group \"World Class Wreckin' Cru\"). The song was played on Los Angeles television and radio stations, including the Lakers' televised games.\nDeath.\nDuring the summer of 2002, Hearn suffered a fall at his home in Encino, California, and struck his head causing serious injury. Three days later, on August 5, 2002, he died of his injury. He was 85. He was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California, next to his son Gary and his daughter Samantha. Chick and Marge would have celebrated their 64th wedding anniversary on August 13, 2002.\nHonors.\nOn May 9, 1991, Hearn became the third broadcaster to win the Gowdy Award from the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. He later became the first broadcaster inducted into the Hall in 2003. In 1995, he was voted to be the 20th member of the American Sportscaster Hall of Fame by his fellow sportscasters. He was inducted by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame in 1997.\nIn honor of his contributions to the Los Angeles Lakers, both the Lakers and the city of Los Angeles renamed a portion of West 11th Street between Figueroa Street and Georgia Street (now L.A. Live Way) to Chick Hearn Court. This street currently runs alongside Crypto.com Arena's main entrance. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority further honored the broadcaster by changing the name of the nearby A and E line station to \"Pico/Chick Hearn\". His name was later hung from the rafters of the Staples Center, alongside the retired numbers of past Lakers players, though with a microphone in place of a number.\nHearn also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in radio. Hearn's star is located at 6755 Hollywood Blvd.\nOn April 27, 2010, Hearn was honored with a bronze statue at Star Plaza outside Staples Center. A chair next to Hearn's statue behind the desk with the Lakers' logo is a part of the statue so his fans can sit down to have their pictures taken.\nOn-air style and demeanor.\nHearn was notable for his focus on calling play-by-play. He did not chitchat while the game was in motion. He was able to report clearly and rapidly, which he considered a gift. This style was especially well-suited for his notable simulcasts of Lakers games on television and radio, which were a tradition during his 40-plus year tenure. He was especially appreciated on radio because listening to the broadcast was almost like watching the game. Shortly after Hearn's departure, the simulcasts were ended, with some listeners complaining that his successor, Paul Sunderland, was difficult to follow for radio listeners. Sometimes this style made it difficult for his partners to get a word in edgewise; his seven-year color commentator, Keith Erickson, fondly reminisced at a ceremony commemorating Hearn: \"Not being able to talk for eight years [as his partner], I thought this was a great opportunity to share a bit\". He was formal, always referring to the Lakers' former owner as \"Mr. Cooke\" and the owner for much of his tenure, Jerry Buss by his full title \u2013 Dr. Jerry Buss or Dr. Buss.\nChickisms.\nThe particular phrases that Hearn used during his broadcasts were labeled \"Chickisms\". Many are staples of basketball. When a book of his memoirs was published in 2004, it included an audio CD with the calls as well as a \"Chick Hearn Rap-Around\" rap song created with the samples.\nMemorable calls.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And the crowd stands for Kareem to get the ball.

His father was a colonel in the French Army died when he was a young child. His mother married again to the French playwright Jean Giraudoux. Later, Christian Pineau would say that it was Giraudoux who gave him his love of writing. He was educated at the \u00c9cole alsacienne in Paris and graduated with degrees in law and in political science. In 1931 he joined the staff of the Bank of France, and later worked for the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas. In 1937 he founded the journal \" Banque et Bourse\".\nA World War II French Resistance leader who established a network called Phalanx, Pineau helped found the underground newspaper \"Lib\u00e9ration\". He was a close ally of Charles de Gaulle and went on dangerous secret missions passing communications between occupied France and the Free France headquarters in London. He was arrested by the \"Gestapo\" in September 1942 but escaped. He was arrested again in 1943 and evaded a death sentence through forged identity papers which hid his true identity. He was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp, and remained there until it was liberated by American soldiers in 1945.\nPineau represented the Sarthe department as a Socialist in the French National Assembly from 1946 to 1958. After the war, he served as a minister in French governments, 1945\u20131958. He was minister of supply in Charles de Gaulle's government (1945) and minister of public works (1947\u20131950) in various governments.\nPineau was finance minister for a short time in 1948. He was designated as prime minister of France by President Ren\u00e9 Coty after the February 1955 resignation of Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France, but the National Assembly refused to ratify his cabinet by 312 votes against 268; his prime ministership lasted for two days between 17 and 19 February 1955.\nAs foreign minister (February 1956 \u2013 May 1958), Pineau was responsible for handling the Suez Crisis and for signing the Treaty of Rome on behalf of France. With Guy Mollet, he visited Moscow. In October 1956, he signed the Protocol of S\u00e8vres with Great Britain and Israel on behalf of France.\nPineau was a lifelong advocate of European integration.\nPineau is buried in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.\nBibliography.\nPineau wrote several political books and memoirs:\nHe also wrote children's books:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Computer chess provides opportunities for players to practice even in the absence of human opponents, and also provides opportunities for analysis, entertainment and training. Computer chess applications that play at the level of a chess grandmaster or higher are available on hardware from supercomputers to smart phones. Standalone chess-playing machines are also available. Stockfish, Leela Chess Zero, GNU Chess, Fruit, and other free open source applications are available for various platforms.\nComputer chess applications, whether implemented in hardware or software, use different strategies than humans to choose their moves: they use heuristic methods to build, search and evaluate trees representing sequences of moves from the current position and attempt to execute the best such sequence during play. Such trees are typically quite large, thousands to millions of nodes. The computational speed of modern computers, capable of processing tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of nodes or more per second, along with extension and reduction heuristics that narrow the tree to mostly relevant nodes, make such an approach effective.\nThe first chess machines capable of playing chess or reduced chess-like games were software programs running on digital computers early in the vacuum-tube computer age (1950s). The early programs played so poorly that even a beginner could defeat them. Within 40 years, in 1997, chess engines running on super-computers or specialized hardware were capable of defeating even the best human players. By 2006, programs running on desktop PCs had attained the same capability. In 2006, Monty Newborn, Professor of Computer Science at McGill University, declared: \"the science has been done\". Nevertheless, solving chess is not currently possible for modern computers due to the game's extremely large number of possible variations.\nComputer chess was once considered the \"Drosophila of AI\", the edge of knowledge engineering. The field is now considered a scientifically completed paradigm, and playing chess is a mundane computing activity.\nAvailability and playing strength.\nIn the past, stand-alone chess machines (usually microprocessors running software chess programs; occasionally specialized hardware) were sold. Today, chess engines may be installed as software on ordinary devices like smartphones and PCs, either alone or alongside GUI programs such as Chessbase and the mobile apps for Chess.com and Lichess (both primarily websites). Examples of free and open source engines include Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero (Lc0). Chess.com maintains its own proprietary engine named Torch. Some chess engines, including Stockfish, have web versions made in languages like WebAssembly and JavaScript. Most chess programs and sites offer the ability to analyze positions and games using chess engines, and some offer the ability to play against engines (which can be set to play at custom levels of strength) as though they were normal opponents.\nHardware requirements for chess engines are minimal, but performance will vary with processor speed, and memory, needed to hold large transposition tables. \nMost modern chess engines, such as Stockfish, rely on efficiently updatable neural networks, tailored to be run exclusively on CPUs, but Lc0 uses networks reliant on GPU performance. Top engines such as Stockfish can be expected to beat the world's best players reliably, even when running on consumer-grade hardware.\nTypes and features of chess software.\nPerhaps the most common type of chess software are programs that simply play chess. A human player makes a move on the board, the AI calculates and plays a subsequent move, and the human and AI alternate turns until the game ends. The chess engine, which calculates the moves, and the graphical user interface (GUI) are sometimes separate programs. Different engines can be connected to the GUI, permitting play against different styles of opponent. Engines often have a simple text command-line interface, while GUIs may offer a variety of piece sets, board styles, or even 3D or animated pieces. Because recent engines are so capable, engines or GUIs may offer some way of handicapping the engine's ability, to improve the odds for a win by the human player. Universal Chess Interface (UCI) engines such as Fritz or Rybka may have a built-in mechanism for reducing the Elo rating of the engine (via UCI's uci_limitstrength and uci_elo parameters). Some versions of Fritz have a Handicap and Fun mode for limiting the current engine or changing the percentage of mistakes it makes or changing its style. Fritz also has a Friend Mode where during the game it tries to match the level of the player.\nChess databases allow users to search through a large library of historical games, analyze them, check statistics, and formulate an opening repertoire. Chessbase (for PC) is a common program for these purposes amongst professional players, but there are alternatives such as Shane's Chess Information Database (Scid) for Windows, Mac or Linux, Chess Assistant for PC, Gerhard Kalab's Chess PGN Master for Android or Giordano Vicoli's Chess-Studio for iOS.\nPrograms such as Playchess allow players to play against one another over the internet.\nChess training programs teach chess. Chessmaster had playthrough tutorials by IM Josh Waitzkin and GM Larry Christiansen. Stefan Meyer-Kahlen offers Shredder Chess Tutor based on the Step coursebooks of Rob Brunia and Cor Van Wijgerden. Former World Champion Magnus Carlsen's Play Magnus company released a Magnus Trainer app for Android and iOS. Chessbase has Fritz and Chesster for children. Convekta provides a large number of training apps such as CT-ART and its Chess King line based on tutorials by GM Alexander Kalinin and Maxim Blokh.\nThere is also software for handling chess problems.\nComputers versus humans.\nAfter discovering refutation screening\u2014the application of alpha\u2013beta pruning to optimizing move evaluation\u2014in 1957, a team at Carnegie Mellon University predicted that a computer would defeat the world human champion by 1967. It did not anticipate the difficulty of determining the right order to evaluate moves. Researchers worked to improve programs' ability to identify killer heuristics, unusually high-scoring moves to reexamine when evaluating other branches, but into the 1970s most top chess players believed that computers would not soon be able to play at a Master level. In 1968, International Master David Levy made a famous bet that no chess computer would be able to beat him within ten years, and in 1976 Senior Master and professor of psychology Eliot Hearst of Indiana University wrote that \"the only way a current computer program could ever win a single game against a master player would be for the master, perhaps in a drunken stupor while playing 50 games simultaneously, to commit some once-in-a-year blunder\".\nIn the late 1970s chess programs began defeating highly skilled human players. The year of Hearst's statement, Northwestern University's Chess 4.5 at the Paul Masson American Chess Championship's Class B level became the first to win a human tournament. Levy won his bet in 1978 by beating Chess 4.7, but it achieved the first computer victory against a Master-class player at the tournament level by winning one of the six games. In 1980, Belle began often defeating Masters. By 1982 two programs played at Master level and three were slightly weaker.\nThe sudden improvement without a theoretical breakthrough was unexpected, as many did not expect that Belle's ability to examine 100,000 positions a second\u2014about eight plies\u2014would be sufficient. The Spracklens, creators of the successful microcomputer program \"Sargon\", estimated that 90% of the improvement came from faster evaluation speed and only 10% from improved evaluations. \"New Scientist\" stated in 1982 that computers \"play \"terrible\" chess ... clumsy, inefficient, diffuse, and just plain ugly\", but humans lost to them by making \"horrible blunders, astonishing lapses, incomprehensible oversights, gross miscalculations, and the like\" much more often than they realized; \"in short, computers win primarily through their ability to find and exploit miscalculations in human initiatives\".\nBy 1982, microcomputer chess programs could evaluate up to 1,500 moves a second and were as strong as mainframe chess programs of five years earlier, able to defeat a majority of amateur players. While only able to look ahead one or two plies more than at their debut in the mid-1970s, doing so improved their play more than experts expected; seemingly minor improvements \"appear to have allowed the crossing of a psychological threshold, after which a rich harvest of human error becomes accessible\", \"New Scientist\" wrote. While reviewing \"SPOC\" in 1984, \"BYTE\" wrote that \"Computers\u2014mainframes, minis, and micros\u2014tend to play ugly, inelegant chess\", but noted Robert Byrne's statement that \"tactically they are freer from error than the average human player\". The magazine described \"SPOC\" as a \"state-of-the-art chess program\" for the IBM PC with a \"surprisingly high\" level of play, and estimated its USCF rating as 1700 (Class B).\nAt the 1982 North American Computer Chess Championship, Monroe Newborn predicted that a chess program could become world champion within five years; tournament director and International Master Michael Valvo predicted ten years; the Spracklens predicted 15; Ken Thompson predicted more than 20; and others predicted that it would never happen. The most widely held opinion, however, stated that it would occur around the year 2000. In 1989, Levy was defeated by Deep Thought in an exhibition match. Deep Thought, however, was still considerably below World Championship level, as the reigning world champion, Garry Kasparov, demonstrated in two strong wins in 1989. It was not until a 1996 match with IBM's Deep Blue that Kasparov lost his first game to a computer at tournament time controls in Deep Blue versus Kasparov, 1996, game 1. This game was, in fact, the first time a reigning world champion had lost to a computer using regular time controls. However, Kasparov regrouped to win three and draw two of the remaining five games of the match, for a convincing victory.\nIn May 1997, an updated version of Deep Blue defeated Kasparov 3\u00bd\u20132\u00bd in a return match. A documentary mainly about the confrontation was made in 2003, titled \"\".\nWith increasing processing power and improved evaluation functions, chess programs running on commercially available workstations began to rival top-flight players. In 1998, Rebel 10 defeated Viswanathan Anand, who at the time was ranked second in the world, by a score of 5\u20133. However, most of those games were not played at normal time controls. Out of the eight games, four were blitz games (five minutes plus five seconds Fischer delay for each move); these Rebel won 3\u20131. Two were rapid games (fifteen minutes for each side) that Rebel won as well (1\u00bd\u2013\u00bd). Finally, two games were played as regular tournament games with classic time controls (forty moves in two hours, one hour sudden death); here it was Anand who won \u00bd\u20131\u00bd. In fast games, computers played better than humans, but at classical time controls \u2013 at which a player's rating is determined \u2013 the advantage was not so clear.\nIn the early 2000s, commercially available programs such as Junior and Fritz were able to draw matches against former world champion Garry Kasparov and classical world champion Vladimir Kramnik.\nIn October 2002, Vladimir Kramnik and Deep Fritz competed in the eight-game Brains in Bahrain match, which ended in a draw. Kramnik won games 2 and 3 by \"conventional\" anti-computer tactics \u2013 play conservatively for a long-term advantage the computer is not able to see in its game tree search. Fritz, however, won game 5 after a severe blunder by Kramnik. Game 6 was described by the tournament commentators as \"spectacular\". Kramnik, in a better position in the early middlegame, tried a piece sacrifice to achieve a strong tactical attack, a strategy known to be highly risky against computers who are at their strongest defending against such attacks. True to form, Fritz found a watertight defense and Kramnik's attack petered out leaving him in a bad position. Kramnik resigned the game, believing the position lost. However, post-game human and computer analysis has shown that the Fritz program was unlikely to have been able to force a win and Kramnik effectively sacrificed a drawn position. The final two games were draws. Given the circumstances, most commentators still rate Kramnik the stronger player in the match.\nIn January 2003, Kasparov played Junior, another chess computer program, in New York City. The match ended 3\u20133.\nIn November 2003, Kasparov played X3D Fritz. The match ended 2\u20132.\nIn 2005, Hydra, a dedicated chess computer with custom hardware and sixty-four processors and also winner of the 14th IPCCC in 2005, defeated seventh-ranked Michael Adams 5\u00bd\u2013\u00bd in a six-game match (though Adams' preparation was far less thorough than Kramnik's for the 2002 series).\nIn November\u2013December 2006, World Champion Vladimir Kramnik played Deep Fritz. This time the computer won; the match ended 2\u20134. Kramnik was able to view the computer's opening book. In the first five games Kramnik steered the game into a typical \"anti-computer\" positional contest. He lost one game (overlooking a mate in one), and drew the next four. In the final game, in an attempt to draw the match, Kramnik played the more aggressive Sicilian Defence and was crushed.\nThere was speculation that interest in human\u2013computer chess competition would plummet as a result of the 2006 Kramnik-Deep Fritz match. According to Newborn, for example, \"the science is done\".\nHuman\u2013computer chess matches showed the best computer systems overtaking human chess champions in the late 1990s. For the 40 years prior to that, the trend had been that the best machines gained about 40 points per year in the Elo rating while the best humans only gained roughly 2 points per year. The highest rating obtained by a computer in human competition was Deep Thought's USCF rating of 2551 in 1988 and FIDE no longer accepts human\u2013computer results in their rating lists. Specialized machine-only Elo pools have been created for rating machines, but such numbers, while similar in appearance, are not directly compared. In 2016, the Swedish Chess Computer Association rated computer program Komodo at 3361.\nChess engines continue to improve. In 2009, chess engines running on slower hardware reached the grandmaster level. A mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating 2898: chess engine Hiarcs 13 running inside Pocket Fritz 4 on the mobile phone HTC Touch HD won the Copa Mercosur tournament in Buenos Aires, Argentina with 9 wins and 1 draw on August 4\u201314, 2009. Pocket Fritz 4 searches fewer than 20,000 positions per second. This is in contrast to supercomputers such as Deep Blue that searched 200\u00a0million positions per second.\nAdvanced Chess is a form of chess developed in 1998 by Kasparov where a human plays against another human, and both have access to computers to enhance their strength. The resulting \"advanced\" player was argued by Kasparov to be stronger than a human or computer alone. This has been proven in numerous occasions, such as at Freestyle Chess events.\nPlayers today are inclined to treat chess engines as analysis tools rather than opponents. Chess grandmaster Andrew Soltis stated in 2016 \"The computers are just much too good\" and that world champion Magnus Carlsen won't play computer chess because \"he just loses all the time and there's nothing more depressing than losing without even being in the game.\"\nComputer methods.\nSince the era of mechanical machines that played rook and king endings and electrical machines that played other games like hex in the early years of the 20th century, scientists and theoreticians have sought to develop a procedural representation of how humans learn, remember, think and apply knowledge, and the game of chess, because of its daunting complexity, became the \"Drosophila of artificial intelligence (AI)\". The procedural resolution of complexity became synonymous with thinking, and early computers, even before the chess automaton era, were popularly referred to as \"electronic brains\". Several different schema were devised starting in the latter half of the 20th century to represent knowledge and thinking, as applied to playing the game of chess (and other games like checkers):\nUsing \"ends-and-means\" heuristics a human chess player can intuitively determine optimal outcomes and how to achieve them regardless of the number of moves necessary, but a computer must be systematic in its analysis. Most players agree that looking at least five moves ahead (ten plies) when necessary is required to play well. Normal tournament rules give each player an average of three minutes per move. On average there are more than 30 legal moves per chess position, so a computer must examine a quadrillion possibilities to look ahead ten plies (five full moves); one that could examine a million positions a second would require more than 30 years.\nThe earliest attempts at procedural representations of playing chess predated the digital electronic age, but it was the stored program digital computer that gave scope to calculating such complexity. Claude Shannon, in 1949, laid out the principles of algorithmic solution of chess. In that paper, the game is represented by a \"tree\", or digital data structure of choices (branches) corresponding to moves. The nodes of the tree were positions on the board resulting from the choices of move. The impossibility of representing an entire game of chess by constructing a tree from first move to last was immediately apparent: there are an average of 36 moves per position in chess and an average game lasts about 35 moves to resignation (60-80 moves if played to checkmate, stalemate, or other draw). There are 400 positions possible after the first move by each player, about 200,000 after two moves each, and nearly 120\u00a0million after just 3 moves each.\nSo a limited lookahead (search) to some depth, followed by using domain-specific knowledge to evaluate the resulting terminal positions was proposed. A kind of middle-ground position, given good moves by both sides, would result, and its evaluation would inform the player about the goodness or badness of the moves chosen. Searching and comparing operations on the tree were well suited to computer calculation; the representation of subtle chess knowledge in the evaluation function was not. The early chess programs suffered in both areas: searching the vast tree required computational resources far beyond those available, and what chess knowledge was useful and how it was to be encoded would take decades to discover.\nThe developers of a chess-playing computer system must decide on a number of fundamental implementation issues. These include:\nAdriaan de Groot interviewed a number of chess players of varying strengths, and concluded that both masters and beginners look at around forty to fifty positions before deciding which move to play. What makes the former much better players is that they use pattern recognition skills built from experience. This enables them to examine some lines in much greater depth than others by simply not considering moves they can assume to be poor. More evidence for this being the case is the way that good human players find it much easier to recall positions from genuine chess games, breaking them down into a small number of recognizable sub-positions, rather than completely random arrangements of the same pieces. In contrast, poor players have the same level of recall for both.\nThe equivalent of this in computer chess are evaluation functions for leaf evaluation, which correspond to the human players' pattern recognition skills, and the use of machine learning techniques in training them, such as Texel tuning, stochastic gradient descent, and reinforcement learning, which corresponds to building experience in human players. This allows modern programs to examine some lines in much greater depth than others by using forwards pruning and other selective heuristics to simply not consider moves the program assume to be poor through their evaluation function, in the same way that human players do. The only fundamental difference between a computer program and a human in this sense is that a computer program can search much deeper than a human player could, allowing it to search more nodes and bypass the horizon effect to a much greater extent than is possible with human players.\nGraphical user interface.\nComputer chess programs usually support a number of common \"de facto\" standards. Nearly all of today's programs can read and write game moves as Portable Game Notation (PGN), and can read and write individual positions as Forsyth\u2013Edwards Notation (FEN). Older chess programs often only understood long algebraic notation, but today users expect chess programs to understand standard algebraic chess notation.\nStarting in the late 1990s, programmers began to develop separately \"engines\" (with a command-line interface which calculates which moves are strongest in a position) or a \"graphical user interface\" (GUI) which provides the player with a chessboard they can see, and pieces that can be moved. Engines communicate their moves to the GUI using a protocol such as the Chess Engine Communication Protocol (CECP) or Universal Chess Interface (UCI). By dividing chess programs into these two pieces, developers can write only the user interface, or only the engine, without needing to write both parts of the program. (See also chess engine.)\nDevelopers have to decide whether to connect the engine to an opening book and/or endgame tablebases or leave this to the GUI.\nBoard representations.\nThe data structure used to represent each chess position is key to the performance of move generation and position evaluation. Methods include pieces stored in an array (\"mailbox\" and \"0x88\"), piece positions stored in a list (\"piece list\"), collections of bit-sets for piece locations (\"bitboards\"), and huffman coded positions for compact long-term storage.\nSearch techniques.\nComputer chess programs consider chess moves as a game tree. In theory, they examine all moves, then all counter-moves to those moves, then all moves countering them, and so on, where each individual move by one player is called a \"ply\". This evaluation continues until a certain maximum search depth or the program determines that a final \"leaf\" position has been reached (e.g. checkmate).\nMinimax search.\nOne particular type of search algorithm used in computer chess are minimax search algorithms, where at each ply the \"best\" move by the player is selected; one player is trying to maximize the score, the other to minimize it. By this alternating process, one particular terminal node whose evaluation represents the searched value of the position will be arrived at. Its value is backed up to the root, and that evaluation becomes the valuation of the position on the board. This search process is called minimax.\nA naive implementation of the minimax algorithm can only search to a small depth in a practical amount of time, so various methods have been devised to greatly speed the search for good moves. Alpha\u2013beta pruning, a system of defining upper and lower bounds on possible search results and searching until the bounds coincided, is typically used to reduce the search space of the program.\nIn addition, various selective search heuristics, such as quiescence search, forward pruning, search extensions and search reductions, are also used as well. These heuristics are triggered based on certain conditions in an attempt to weed out obviously bad moves (history moves) or to investigate interesting nodes (e.g. check extensions, passed pawns on seventh rank, etc.). These selective search heuristics have to be used very carefully however. If the program overextends, it wastes too much time looking at uninteresting positions. If too much is pruned or reduced, there is a risk of cutting out interesting nodes.\nMonte Carlo tree search.\nMonte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm which expands the search tree based on random sampling of the search space. A version of Monte Carlo tree search commonly used in computer chess is PUCT, Predictor and Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees.\nDeepMind's AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero uses MCTS instead of minimax. Such engines use batching on graphics processing units in order to calculate their evaluation functions and policy (move selection), and therefore require a parallel search algorithm as calculations on the GPU are inherently parallel. The minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms used in computer chess are inherently serial algorithms, so would not work well with batching on the GPU. On the other hand, MCTS is a good alternative, because the random sampling used in Monte Carlo tree search lends itself well to parallel computing, and is why nearly all engines which support calculations on the GPU use MCTS instead of alpha-beta.\nOther optimizations.\nMany other optimizations can be used to make chess-playing programs stronger. For example, transposition tables are used to record positions that have been previously evaluated, to save recalculation of them. Refutation tables record key moves that \"refute\" what appears to be a good move; these are typically tried first in variant positions (since a move that refutes one position is likely to refute another). The drawback is that transposition tables at deep ply depths can get quite large \u2013 tens to hundreds of millions of entries. IBM's Deep Blue transposition table in 1996, for example was 500\u00a0million entries. Transposition tables that are too small can result in spending more time searching for non-existent entries due to threshing than the time saved by entries found. Many chess engines use pondering, searching to deeper levels on the opponent's time, similar to human beings, to increase their playing strength.\nOf course, faster hardware and additional memory can improve chess program playing strength. Hyperthreaded architectures can improve performance modestly if the program is running on a single core or a small number of cores. Most modern programs are designed to take advantage of multiple cores to do parallel search. Other programs are designed to run on a general purpose computer and allocate move generation, parallel search, or evaluation to dedicated processors or specialized co-processors.\nHistory.\nThe first paper on chess search was by Claude Shannon in 1950. He predicted the two main possible search strategies which would be used, which he labeled \"Type A\" and \"Type B\", before anyone had programmed a computer to play chess.\nType A programs would use a \"brute force\" approach, examining every possible position for a fixed number of moves using a pure naive minimax algorithm. Shannon believed this would be impractical for two reasons.\nFirst, with approximately thirty moves possible in a typical real-life position, he expected that searching the approximately 109 positions involved in looking three moves ahead for both sides (six plies) would take about sixteen minutes, even in the \"very optimistic\" case that the chess computer evaluated a million positions every second. (It took about forty years to achieve this speed.) A later search algorithm called alpha\u2013beta pruning, a system of defining upper and lower bounds on possible search results and searching until the bounds coincided, reduced the branching factor of the game tree logarithmically, but it still was not feasible for chess programs at the time to exploit the exponential explosion of the tree.\nSecond, it ignored the problem of quiescence, trying to only evaluate a position that is at the end of an exchange of pieces or other important sequence of moves ('lines'). He expected that adapting minimax to cope with this would greatly increase the number of positions needing to be looked at and slow the program down still further. He expected that adapting type A to cope with this would greatly increase the number of positions needing to be looked at and slow the program down still further.\nThis led naturally to what is referred to as \"selective search\" or \"type B search\", using chess knowledge (heuristics) to select a few presumably good moves from each position to search, and prune away the others without searching. Instead of wasting processing power examining bad or trivial moves, Shannon suggested that type B programs would use two improvements:\nThis would enable them to look further ahead ('deeper') at the most significant lines in a reasonable time. However, early attempts at selective search often resulted in the best move or moves being pruned away. As a result, little or no progress was made for the next 25 years dominated by this first iteration of the selective search paradigm. The best program produced in this early period was Mac Hack VI in 1967; it played at the about the same level as the average amateur (C class on the United States Chess Federation rating scale).\nMeanwhile, hardware continued to improve, and in 1974, brute force searching was implemented for the first time in the Northwestern University Chess 4.0 program. In this approach, all alternative moves at a node are searched, and none are pruned away. They discovered that the time required to simply search all the moves was much less than the time required to apply knowledge-intensive heuristics to select just a few of them, and the benefit of not prematurely or inadvertently pruning away good moves resulted in substantially stronger performance.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, progress was finally made in the selective search paradigm, with the development of quiescence search, null move pruning, and other modern selective search heuristics. These heuristics had far fewer mistakes than earlier heuristics did, and was found to be worth the extra time it saved because it could search deeper and widely adopted by many engines. While many modern programs do use alpha-beta search as a substrate for their search algorithm, these additional selective search heuristics used in modern programs means that the program no longer does a \"brute force\" search. Instead they heavily rely on these selective search heuristics to extend lines the program considers good and prune and reduce lines the program considers bad, to the point where most of the nodes on the search tree are pruned away, enabling modern programs to search very deep.\nIn 2006, R\u00e9mi Coulom created Monte Carlo tree search, another kind of type B selective search. In 2007, an adaption of Monte Carlo tree search called Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees or UCT for short was created by Levente Kocsis and Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri. In 2011, Chris Rosin developed a variation of UCT called Predictor + Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees, or PUCT for short. PUCT was then used in AlphaZero in 2017, and later in Leela Chess Zero in 2018.\nKnowledge versus search (processor speed).\nIn the 1970s, most chess programs ran on super computers like Control Data Cyber 176s or Cray-1s, indicative that during that developmental period for computer chess, processing power was the limiting factor in performance. Most chess programs struggled to search to a depth greater than 3 ply. It was not until the hardware chess machines of the 1980s, that a relationship between processor speed and knowledge encoded in the evaluation function became apparent.\nIt has been estimated that doubling the computer speed gains approximately fifty to seventy Elo points in playing strength .\nLeaf evaluation.\nFor most chess positions, computers cannot look ahead to all possible final positions. Instead, they must look ahead a few plies and compare the possible positions, known as leaves. The algorithm that evaluates leaves is termed the \"evaluation function\", and these algorithms are often vastly different between different chess programs. Evaluation functions typically evaluate positions in hundredths of a pawn (called a centipawn), where by convention, a positive evaluation favors White, and a negative evaluation favors Black. However, some evaluation function output win/draw/loss percentages instead of centipawns.\nHistorically, handcrafted evaluation functions consider material value along with other factors affecting the strength of each side. When counting up the material for each side, typical values for pieces are 1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen. (See Chess piece relative value.) The king is sometimes given an arbitrarily high value such as 200 points (Shannon's paper) to ensure that a checkmate outweighs all other factors . In addition to points for pieces, most handcrafted evaluation functions take many factors into account, such as pawn structure, the fact that a pair of bishops are usually worth more, centralized pieces are worth more, and so on. The protection of kings is usually considered, as well as the phase of the game (opening, middle or endgame). Machine learning techniques such as Texel turning, stochastic gradient descent, or reinforcement learning are usually used to optimise handcrafted evaluation functions.\nMost modern evaluation functions make use of neural networks. The most common evaluation function in use today is the efficiently updatable neural network, which is a shallow neural network whose inputs are piece-square tables. Piece-square tables are a set of 64 values corresponding to the squares of the chessboard, and there typically exists a piece-square table for every piece and colour, resulting in 12 piece-square tables and thus 768 inputs into the neural network. In addition, some engines use deep neural networks in their evaluation function. Neural networks are usually trained using some reinforcement learning algorithm, in conjunction with supervised learning or unsupervised learning.\nThe output of the evaluation function is a single scalar, quantized in centipawns or other units, which is, in the case of handcrafted evaluation functions, a weighted summation of the various factors described, or in the case of neural network based evaluation functions, the output of the head of the neural network. The evaluation putatively represents or approximates the value of the subtree below the evaluated node as if it had been searched to termination, i.e. the end of the game. During the search, an evaluation is compared against evaluations of other leaves, eliminating nodes that represent bad or poor moves for either side, to yield a node which by convergence, represents the value of the position with best play by both sides.\nEndgame tablebases.\nEndgame play had long been one of the great weaknesses of chess programs because of the depth of search needed. Some otherwise master-level programs were unable to win in positions where even intermediate human players could force a win.\nTo solve this problem, computers have been used to analyze some chess endgame positions completely, starting with king and pawn against king. Such endgame tablebases are generated in advance using a form of retrograde analysis, starting with positions where the final result is known (e.g., where one side has been mated) and seeing which other positions are one move away from them, then which are one move from those, etc. Ken Thompson was a pioneer in this area.\nThe results of the computer analysis sometimes surprised people. In 1977 Thompson's Belle chess machine used the endgame tablebase for a king and rook against king and queen and was able to draw that theoretically lost ending against several masters (see Philidor position#Queen versus rook). This was despite not following the usual strategy to delay defeat by keeping the defending king and rook close together for as long as possible. Asked to explain the reasons behind some of the program's moves, Thompson was unable to do so beyond saying the program's database simply returned the best moves.\nMost grandmasters declined to play against the computer in the queen versus rook endgame, but Walter Browne accepted the challenge. A queen versus rook position was set up in which the queen can win in thirty moves, with perfect play. Browne was allowed 2\u00bd hours to play fifty moves, otherwise a draw would be claimed under the fifty-move rule. After forty-five moves, Browne agreed to a draw, being unable to force checkmate or win the rook within the next five moves. In the final position, Browne was still seventeen moves away from checkmate, but not quite that far away from winning the rook. Browne studied the endgame, and played the computer again a week later in a different position in which the queen can win in thirty moves. This time, he captured the rook on the fiftieth move, giving him a winning position.\nOther positions, long believed to be won, turned out to take more moves against perfect play to actually win than were allowed by chess's fifty-move rule. As a consequence, for some years the official FIDE rules of chess were changed to extend the number of moves allowed in these endings. After a while, the rule reverted to fifty moves in all positions\u00a0\u2013 more such positions were discovered, complicating the rule still further, and it made no difference in human play, as they could not play the positions perfectly.\nOver the years, other endgame database formats have been released including the Edward Tablebase, the De Koning Database and the Nalimov Tablebase which is used by many chess programs such as Rybka, Shredder and Fritz. Tablebases for all positions with six pieces are available. Some seven-piece endgames have been analyzed by Marc Bourzutschky and Yakov Konoval. Programmers using the Lomonosov supercomputers in Moscow have completed a chess tablebase for all endgames with seven pieces or fewer (trivial endgame positions are excluded, such as six white pieces versus a lone black king). In all of these endgame databases it is assumed that castling is no longer possible.\nMany tablebases do not consider the fifty-move rule, under which a game where fifty moves pass without a capture or pawn move can be claimed to be a draw by either player. This results in the tablebase returning results such as \"Forced mate in sixty-six moves\" in some positions which would actually be drawn because of the fifty-move rule. One reason for this is that if the rules of chess were to be changed once more, giving more time to win such positions, it will not be necessary to regenerate all the tablebases. It is also very easy for the program using the tablebases to notice and take account of this 'feature' and in any case if using an endgame tablebase will choose the move that leads to the quickest win (even if it would fall foul of the fifty-move rule with perfect play). If playing an opponent not using a tablebase, such a choice will give good chances of winning within fifty moves.\nThe Nalimov tablebases, which use state-of-the-art compression techniques, require 7.05 GB of hard disk space for all five-piece endings. To cover all the six-piece endings requires approximately 1.2 TB. It is estimated that a seven-piece tablebase requires between 50 and 200 TB of storage space.\nEndgame databases featured prominently in 1999, when Kasparov played an exhibition match on the Internet against the rest of the world. A seven piece Queen and pawn endgame was reached with the World Team fighting to salvage a draw. Eugene Nalimov helped by generating the six piece ending tablebase where both sides had two Queens which was used heavily to aid analysis by both sides.\nThe most popular endgame tablebase is syzygy which is used by most top computer programs like Stockfish, Leela Chess Zero, and Komodo. It is also significantly smaller in size than other formats, with 7-piece tablebases taking only 18.4 TB.\nFor a current state-of-the art chess engine like Stockfish, a table base only provides a very minor increase in playing strength (approximately 3 Elo points for syzygy 6men as of Stockfish 15).\nOpening book.\nChess engines, like human beings, may save processing time as well as select variations known to be strong via referencing an opening book stored in a database. Opening books cover the opening moves of a game to variable depth, depending on opening and variation, but usually to the first 10-12 moves (20-24 ply). In the early eras of computer chess, trusting variations studied in-depth by human grandmasters for decades was superior to the weak performance of mid-20th-century engines. And even in the contemporary era, allowing computer engines to extensively analyze various openings at their leisure beforehand, and then simply consult the results when in a game, speeds up their play.\nIn the 1990s, some theorists believed that chess engines of the day had much of their strength in memorized opening books and knowledge dedicated to known positions, and thus believed a valid anti-computer tactic would be to intentionally play some out-of-book moves in order to force the chess program to think for itself. This seems to have been a dubious assumption even then; Garry Kasparov tried it via using the non-standard Mieses Opening at the 1997 Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov Game 1 match, but lost. This tactic became even weaker as time passed; the opening books stored in computer databases can be far more extensive than even the best prepared humans, meaning computers will be well-prepared for even rare variations and know the correct play. More generally, the play of engines even in fully unknown situations (as comes up in variants such as Chess960) is still exceptionally strong, so the lack of an opening book isn't even a major disadvantage for tactically sharp chess engines, who can discover strong moves in unfamiliar board variations accurately.\nIn contemporary engine tournaments, engines are often told to play situations from a variety of openings, including unbalanced ones, to reduce the draw rate and to add more variety to the games.\nComputer chess rating lists.\nCEGT, CSS, SSDF, WBEC, REBEL, FGRL, and IPON maintain rating lists allowing fans to compare the strength of engines. Various versions of Stockfish, Komodo, Leela Chess Zero, and Fat Fritz dominate the rating lists in the early 2020s.\nCCRL (Computer Chess Rating Lists) is an organisation that tests computer chess engines' strength by playing the programs against each other. CCRL was founded in 2006 to promote computer-computer competition and tabulate results on a rating list.\nThe organisation runs three different lists: 40/40 (40 minutes for every 40 moves played), 40/4 (4 minutes for every 40 moves played), and 40/4 FRC (same time control but Chess960). Pondering (or permanent brain) is switched off and timing is adjusted to the AMD64 X2 4600+ (2.4\u00a0GHz) CPU by using Crafty 19.17 BH as a benchmark. Generic, neutral opening books are used (as opposed to the engine's own book) up to a limit of 12 moves into the game alongside 4 or 5 man tablebases.\nHistory.\nPre-computer age.\nThe idea of creating a chess-playing machine dates back to the eighteenth century. Around 1769, the chess playing automaton called The Turk, created by Hungarian inventor Farkas Kempelen, became famous before being exposed as a hoax. Before the development of digital computing, serious trials based on automata such as El Ajedrecista of 1912, built by Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo, which played a king and rook versus king ending, were too complex and limited to be useful for playing full games of chess. The field of mechanical chess research languished until the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s.\nEarly software age: selective search and Botvinnik.\nSince then, chess enthusiasts and computer engineers have built, with increasing degrees of seriousness and success, chess-playing machines and computer programs. One of the few chess grandmasters to devote himself seriously to computer chess was former World Chess Champion Mikhail Botvinnik, who wrote several works on the subject. Botvinnik's interest in Computer Chess started in the 50s, favouring chess algorithms based on Shannon's selective type B strategy, as discussed along with Max Euwe 1958 in Dutch Television. Working with relatively primitive hardware available in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, Botvinnik had no choice but to investigate software move selection techniques; at the time only the most powerful computers could achieve much beyond a three-ply full-width search, and Botvinnik had no such machines. In 1965 Botvinnik was a consultant to the ITEP team in a US-Soviet computer chess match which won a correspondence chess match against the Kotok-McCarthy-Program led by John McCarthy in 1967.(see Kotok-McCarthy). Later he advised the team that created the chess program Kaissa at Moscow's Institute of Control Sciences. Botvinnik had his own ideas to model a Chess Master's Mind. After publishing and discussing his early ideas on attack maps and trajectories at Moscow Central Chess Clubin 1966, he found Vladimir Butenko as supporter and collaborator. Butenko first implemented the 15x15 vector attacks board representation on a M-20 computer, determining trajectories. After Botvinnik introduced the concept of Zones in 1970, Butenko refused further cooperation and began to write his own program, dubbed Eureka. In the 70s and 80s, leading a team around Boris Stilman, Alexander Yudin, Alexander Reznitskiy, Michael Tsfasman and Mikhail Chudakov, Botvinnik worked on his own project 'Pioneer' - which was an Artificial Intelligence-based chess project. In the 90s, Botvinnik already in his 80s, he worked on the new project 'CC Sapiens'.\nLater software age: full-width search.\nOne developmental milestone occurred when the team from Northwestern University, which was responsible for the Chess series of programs and won the first three ACM Computer Chess Championships (1970\u201372), abandoned type B searching in 1973. The resulting program, Chess 4.0, won that year's championship and its successors went on to come in second in both the 1974 ACM Championship and that year's inaugural World Computer Chess Championship, before winning the ACM Championship again in 1975, 1976 and 1977. The type A implementation turned out to be just as fast: in the time it used to take to decide which moves were worthy of being searched, it was possible just to search all of them. In fact, Chess 4.0 set the paradigm that was and still is followed essentially by all modern Chess programs today, and that had been successfully started by the Russian ITEP in 1965.\nRise of chess machines.\nIn 1978, an early rendition of Ken Thompson's hardware chess machine Belle, entered and won the North American Computer Chess Championship over the dominant Northwestern University Chess 4.7.\nMicrocomputer revolution.\nTechnological advances by orders of magnitude in processing power have made the brute force approach far more incisive than was the case in the early years. The result is that a very solid, tactical AI player aided by some limited positional knowledge built in by the evaluation function and pruning/extension rules began to match the best players in the world. It turned out to produce excellent results, at least in the field of chess, to let computers do what they do best (calculate) rather than coax them into imitating human thought processes and knowledge. In 1997 Deep Blue, a brute-force machine capable of examining 500\u00a0million nodes per second, defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov, marking the first time a computer has defeated a reigning world chess champion in standard time control.\nSuper-human chess.\nIn 2016, NPR asked experts to characterize the playing style of computer chess engines. Murray Campbell of IBM stated that \"Computers don't have any sense of aesthetics... They play what they think is the objectively best move in any position, even if it looks absurd, and they can play any move no matter how ugly it is.\" Grandmasters Andrew Soltis and Susan Polgar stated that computers are more likely to retreat than humans are.\nNeural network revolution.\nWhile neural networks have been used in the evaluation functions of chess engines since the late 1980s, with programs such as NeuroChess, Morph, Blondie25, Giraffe, AlphaZero, and MuZero, neural networks did not become widely adopted by chess engines until the arrival of efficiently updatable neural networks in the summer of 2020. Efficiently updatable neural networks were originally developed in computer shogi in 2018 by Yu Nasu, and had to be first ported to a derivative of Stockfish called Stockfish NNUE on 31 May 2020, and integrated into the official Stockfish engine on 6 August 2020, before other chess programmers began to adopt neural networks into their engines.\nSome people, such as the Royal Society's Venki Ramakrishnan, believe that AlphaZero led to the widespread adoption of neural networks in chess engines. However, AlphaZero influenced very few engines to begin using neural networks, and those tended to be new experimental engines such as Leela Chess Zero, which began specifically to replicate the AlphaZero paper. The deep neural networks used in AlphaZero's evaluation function required expensive graphics processing units, which were not compatible with existing chess engines. The vast majority of chess engines only use central processing units, and computing and processing information on the GPUs require special libraries in the backend such as Nvidia's CUDA, which none of the engines had access to. Thus the vast majority of chess engines such as Komodo and Stockfish continued to use handcrafted evaluation functions until efficiently updatable neural networks were ported to computer chess from computer shogi in 2020, which did not require either the use of GPUs or libraries like CUDA at all. Even then, the neural networks used in computer chess are fairly shallow, and the deep reinforcement learning methods pioneered by AlphaZero are still extremely rare in computer chess.\nCategorizations.\nDedicated hardware.\nThese chess playing systems include custom hardware with approx. dates of introduction (excluding dedicated microcomputers):\nCommercial dedicated computers.\nIn the late 1970s to early 1990s, there was a competitive market for dedicated chess computers. This market changed in the mid-1990s when computers with dedicated processors could no longer compete with the fast processors in personal computers.\nRecently, some hobbyists have been using the Multi Emulator Super System to run the chess programs created for Fidelity or Hegener &amp; Glaser's Mephisto computers on modern 64-bit operating systems such as Windows 10. The author of Rebel, Ed Schr\u00f6der has also adapted three of the Hegener &amp; Glaser Mephisto's he wrote to work as UCI engines.\nDOS programs.\nThese programs can be run on MS-DOS, and can be run on 64-bit Windows 10 via emulators such as DOSBox or Qemu:\nNotable theorists.\nWell-known computer chess theorists include:\nSolving chess.\nThe prospects of completely solving chess are generally considered to be rather remote. It is widely conjectured that no computationally inexpensive method to solve chess exists even in the weak sense of determining with certainty the value of the initial position, and hence the idea of solving chess in the stronger sense of obtaining a practically usable description of a strategy for perfect play for either side seems unrealistic today. However, it has not been proven that no computationally cheap way of determining the best move in a chess position exists, nor even that a traditional alpha\u2013beta searcher running on present-day computing hardware could not solve the initial position in an acceptable amount of time. The difficulty in proving the latter lies in the fact that, while the number of board positions that could happen in the course of a chess game is huge (on the order of at least 1043 to 1047), it is hard to rule out with mathematical certainty the possibility that the initial position allows either side to force a mate or a threefold repetition after relatively few moves, in which case the search tree might encompass only a very small subset of the set of possible positions. It has been mathematically proven that \"generalized chess\" (chess played with an arbitrarily large number of pieces on an arbitrarily large chessboard) is EXPTIME-complete, meaning that determining the winning side in an arbitrary position of generalized chess provably takes exponential time in the worst case; however, this theoretical result gives no lower bound on the amount of work required to solve ordinary 8x8 chess.\nMartin Gardner's Minichess, played on a 5\u00d75 board with approximately 1018 possible board positions, has been solved; its game-theoretic value is 1/2 (i.e. a draw can be forced by either side), and the forcing strategy to achieve that result has been described.\nProgress has also been made from the other side: as of 2012, all 7 and fewer pieces (2 kings and up to 5 other pieces) endgames have been solved.\nChess engines.\nA \"chess engine\" is software that calculates and orders which moves are the strongest to play in a given position. Engine authors focus on improving the play of their engines, often just importing the engine into a graphical user interface (GUI) developed by someone else. Engines communicate with the GUI by standardized protocols such as the nowadays ubiquitous Universal Chess Interface developed by Stefan Meyer-Kahlen and Franz Huber. There are others, like the Chess Engine Communication Protocol developed by Tim Mann for GNU Chess and Winboard. Chessbase has its own proprietary protocol, and at one time Millennium 2000 had another protocol used for ChessGenius. Engines designed for one operating system and protocol may be ported to other OS's or protocols. Chess engines are regularly matched against each other at dedicated chess engine tournaments.\nChess web apps.\nIn 1997, the Internet Chess Club released its first Java client for playing chess online against other people inside one's webbrowser. This was probably one of the first chess web apps. Free Internet Chess Server followed soon after with a similar client. In 2004, International Correspondence Chess Federation opened up a web server to replace their email-based system. Chess.com started offering Live Chess in 2007. Chessbase/Playchess has long had a downloadable client, and added a web-based client in 2013.\nAnother popular web app is tactics training. The now defunct Chess Tactics Server opened its site in 2006, followed by Chesstempo the next year, and Chess.com added its Tactics Trainer in 2008. Chessbase added a tactics trainer web app in 2015.\nChessbase took their chess game database online in 1998. Another early chess game databases was Chess Lab, which started in 1999. New In Chess had initially tried to compete with Chessbase by releasing a NICBase program for Windows 3.x, but eventually, decided to give up on software, and instead focus on their online database starting in 2002.\nOne could play against the engine Shredder online from 2006. In 2015, Chessbase added a play Fritz web app, as well as My Games for storing one's games.\nStarting in 2007, Chess.com offered the content of the training program, Chess Mentor, to their customers online. Top GMs such as Sam Shankland and Walter Browne have contributed lessons.\nImpact of AI on chess.\nRevolutionizing chess strategy.\nThe introduction of artificial intelligence transformed the game of chess, particularly at the elite levels. AI greatly influenced defensive strategies. It has the capacity to compute every potential move without concern, unlike human players who are bound to emotional and psychological impacts from factors such as stress or tiredness. As a result, many positions once considered not defensible are now recognized as defensible.\nAfter studying millions of games, chess engines made new analysis and improved the existing theories of opening. These improvements led to the creation of new ideas and changed the way players think throughout all parts of the game. In classical chess, elite players commonly initiate games by making 10 to 15 opening moves that align with established analyses or leading engine recommendations.\nCheating and fair play.\nUnlike traditional over-the-board tournaments where handheld metal detectors are employed in order to counter players attempts at using electronic assistance, fair-play monitoring in online chess is much more challenging.\nhttps://, which saw a record participation of nearly 4000 players over 80 participants were disqualified for cheating\u2014most from beginner and youth categories. The event underscored the growing need for advanced detection methods in online competitions.\nIn response to these issues, chess platforms such as Chess.com developed AI-based statistical models which track improbable moves by a player and compare them to moves that could be made by an engine. Expert examination is conducted for all suspected cases, and the findings are published on a regular basis. FIDE introduced AI behavior-tracking technology to strengthen anti-cheating measures in online events.\nChallenges in cheat detection.\nAI-based detection systems use a combination of machine learning to track suspicious player actions in different games. This is done by measuring discrepancies between the real moves and the predicted moves derived from the available statistics. Players of unusually high skill level or unusual strategies that can imitate moves characteristic of automated chess systems. Each case is examined by a human expert to ensure that the decision is correct before any actions are made to guarantee fairness and accuracy.\nAligning AI with humans.\nThe Maia Chess project was begun in 2020 by the University of Toronto, Cornell University, and Microsoft Research. Maia Chess is a neural network constructed to impersonate a human's manner of playing chess based on skill. Each Maia models was tested on 9 sets of 500,000 positions each, covering rating levels from 1100 to 1900. They perform best when predicting moves made by players at their targeted rating level, with lower Maias accurately predicting moves from lower-rated players (around 1100) and higher Maias doing the same for higher-rated players (around 1900). The primary goal of Maia is to develop an AI chess engine that imitates human decision-making rather than focusing on optimal moves. Through personalization across different skill levels, Maia is able to simulate game styles typical for each level more accurately.\nChess and LLMs.\nWhile considered something done more for entertainment than for serious play, people have discovered that large language models (LLMs) of the type created in 2018 and beyond such as GPT-3 can be prompted into producing chess moves given proper language prompts. While inefficient compared to native chess engines, the fact that LLMs can track the board state at all beyond the opening rather than simply recite chess-like phrases in a dreamlike state was considered greatly surprising. LLM play has a number of quirks compared to engine play; for example, engines don't generally \"care\" how a board state was arrived at. However, LLMs seem to produce different quality moves for a chess position reached via strong play compared to the same board state produced via a set of strange preceding moves (which will generally produce weaker and more random moves).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"\u00a0This article incorporates https:// by Chess Programming Wiki available under the license.\""}

Toklas", "text": "American artist (1877\u20131967)\nAlice Babette Toklas (April 30, 1877\u00a0\u2013 March 7, 1967) was an American-born member of the Parisian avant-garde of the early 20th century, and the life partner of American writer Gertrude Stein.\nEarly life.\nAlice B. Toklas was born in San Francisco into a middle-class Polish Jewish family. Her paternal grandfather was a rabbi, whose son Feivel (usually known as Ferdinand) Toklas moved to San Francisco in 1863. In 1876, Ferdinand Toklas married Emma (Emelia) Levinsky and they had two children: Alice and her brother Clarence Ferdinand (1887\u20131924).\nIn 1890, the Toklas family moved to Seattle, where her father was one half of Toklas, Singerman and Company, the city's leading dry goods store.\nToklas was educated in local schools, which included the Mount Rainier Seminary, and attended the University of Washington where she studied piano.\nWhen her mother became ill, the family moved back to San Francisco. Her mother died in 1897, aged 41.\nRelationship with Gertrude Stein.\nFive months after the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Toklas left the city and moved to Paris. On September 8, 1907, the day after she arrived in Paris, she met Gertrude Stein. This marked the beginning of a relationship which lasted for nearly four decades, ending in 1946 with Stein's death.\nTogether they hosted a salon in the home they shared at 27 rue de Fleurus that attracted expatriate American writers, such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Paul Bowles, Thornton Wilder, and Sherwood Anderson as well as avant-garde painters, including Picasso, Matisse, and Braque.\nActing as Stein's confidante, lover, cook, secretary, muse, editor, critic, and general organizer, Toklas remained a background figure, chiefly living in the shadow of Stein, until the publication by Stein of Toklas' \"memoirs\" in 1933 under the teasing title \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\". It became Stein's best-selling book.\nToklas and Stein drove ambulances in World War I after learning from Parisian taxi drivers.\nWhen World War II broke out in 1939, Stein and Toklas were at their country home, Bilignin, near the Swiss border. Stein and Toklas likely avoided being sent to concentration camps by their obscurity, American citizenship, and the goodness of their neighbors that protected them.\nW. G. Rogers wrote in his memoir of the couple, published in 1946, that Toklas \"was a little stooped, somewhat retiring and self-effacing. She doesn't sit in a chair, she hides in it; she doesn't look at you, but up at you; she is always standing just half a step outside the circle. She gives the appearance, in short, not of a drudge, but of a poor relation, someone invited to the wedding but not to the wedding feast.\" James Merrill wrote that before meeting Toklas \"one knew about the tiny stature, the sandals, the mustache, the eyes,\" but he had not anticipated \"the enchantment of her speaking voice\u2014like a viola at dusk.\"\nToklas and Stein remained a couple until Stein's death in 1946.\nLater life, after Stein's death.\nAlthough Gertrude Stein willed much of her estate to Toklas, including their shared art collection (some of it Picassos) housed in their apartment at 5 rue Christine, the couple's relationship had no legal recognition. As many of the paintings appreciated greatly in value, Stein's relatives took action to claim them, eventually removing them from Toklas's residence and placing them in a bank vault while she was away on vacation. Toklas then relied on contributions from friends as well as her writing to make a living.\nIn 1954, Toklas published \"The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook\", a book that mixes reminiscences and recipes. The most famous recipe, contributed by her friend Brion Gysin, is for \"Haschich Fudge\", a mixture of fruit, nuts, spices, and \"canibus sativa\" [\"sic\"] or marijuana. The \"Haschich Fudge\" recipe appeared in the British edition of the book, but it was left out of the first United States edition published by Harper &amp; Brothers. It was included in the second American edition and became popular within the 1960s counterculture movement. She and the recipe were referenced in the 1968 film, \"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas\", starring Peter Sellers, as well as the 1969 \"Bewitched\" episode, \"Tabitha's Weekend\". When Tabitha asked if Endora could have a cookie, Endora asked Phyllis Stephens (Tabitha's other grandmother), \"They wouldn't by chance be from an Alice B. Toklas recipe?\" The cookbook has been translated into numerous languages.\nA second cookbook followed in 1958, \"Aromas and Flavors of Past and Present\". However, Toklas did not approve of it, as it was heavily annotated by Poppy Cannon, an editor at \"House Beautiful\" magazine. Toklas also wrote articles for several magazines and newspapers, including \"The New Republic\" and \"The New York Times\".\nIn 1963, Toklas published her autobiography \"What Is Remembered\", which ends abruptly with the death of Stein.\nToklas's later years were very difficult because of poor health and financial problems. She converted to the Catholic Church in 1957. She died in poverty at the age of 89, and is buried next to Stein in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris, France; her name is engraved on the back of Stein's headstone.\nLegacy.\n\"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas\" is a 1968 film starring Peter Sellers that references Toklas's cannabis brownies, which play a significant role in the plot. Marianne's Ice Cream in Santa Cruz, California, created an ice cream flavor called \"Alice B. Toklas' Fudge Brownie\" in honor of the brownies in Sellers' film.\nThe Alice B. Toklas LGBTQ Democratic Club is a political organization founded in San Francisco in 1971.\nSamuel Steward, who met Toklas and Stein in the 1930s, edited \"Dear Sammy: Letters from Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas\" (1977), and also wrote two mystery novels featuring Stein and Toklas as characters: \"Murder Is Murder Is Murder\" (1985) and \"The Caravaggio Shawl\" (1989).\nIn the 1980s, Jacquie Phelan, a mountain bike racer and founder of the first all-women's mountain biking club, raced under the pseudonym \"Alice B. Toe Clips\" in reference to Toklas.\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted in 1998 to rename a block of Myrtle Street between Polk Street and Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco as Alice B. Toklas Place, since Toklas was born one block away on O'Farrell Street.\nToklas has been portrayed on-screen by Wilfrid Brambell in the 1978 Swedish film \"The Adventures of Picasso\", by Linda Hunt in the 1987 film \"Waiting for the Moon\"; by Alice Dvor\u00e1kov\u00e1 in the 1993 television series \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\"; and by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bourou-Rubinsztein in the 2011 film \"Midnight in Paris\".\nIn 2020, artist Maira Kalman, along with her son Alex Kalman, created and published a short film adaptation of \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\" called \"My Name is Alice B. Toklas.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her first novel, \"The Man with the Dancing Eyes\", was published in 2003 and was followed by \"Playing With the Grown-ups\" in 2007. In 2009, she wrote \"Miss Dahl's Voluptuous Delights\", a cookery book which formed the basis for a six-part BBC Two series named \"The Delicious Miss Dahl\". In 2011, she published her second cookery book, \"From Season to Season\". Her first children's book, \"Madame Badobedah\", was released in 2019. She is the daughter of Tessa Dahl and Julian Holloway and the granddaughter of author Roald Dahl, actress Patricia Neal, and actor Stanley Holloway.\nEarly life and education.\nDahl was born in London in 1977 to the actor Julian Holloway and the writer Tessa Dahl, who were unmarried. Dahl's parents separated shortly after her birth. Through her mother, Dahl has three half-siblings. As a child, Sophie frequently spent time at both her maternal and paternal grandparents' houses in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, and East Preston, West Sussex, respectively. Dahl has noted that her childhood was \"an odd one, but with such magic\". Dahl attended 10 schools and lived in 17 homes in various locations, including London, New York, and India.\nWriting career.\nIn 2003, Dahl published her first book, an illustrated novella and Times bestseller, \"The Man with the Dancing Eyes\" (Bloomsbury Publishing). From 2005, she was a contributing editor and regular columnist at \"Men's Vogue\", until its closure in 2008. Her next books were \"Playing with the Grown-Ups\" (2007) and two cookbooks, \"Miss Dahl's Voluptuous Delights\" (2009) and \"From Season To Season\" (2011).

She wrote and presented a social history documentary about the Victorian cook Isabella Beeton, which was transmitted on BBC 2 on 29 September 2011.\nDahl was a contributing editor at British magazine \"Vogue\" for a decade, writing about subjects from cultural identity and the journey of refugees to Britain to the Proustian response to scent, winning a Jasmine Award for her column. She is a contributing editor at Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller, and has written essays for amongst others, \"The Guardian\", the American edition of \"Vogue\", \"The Observer\" and \"The New York Times Magazine\".\nIt was announced in the \"Bookseller\" in 2019 that Dahl had been signed to a four-book deal with Walker Books. The first of these, \"Madame Badobedah\", a children's picture book illustrated by Lauren O'Hara, was published in October 2019 and received a number of nominations and awards, including a nomination for a Kate Greenaway Medal. It received a Parents' Choice Gold Award, and was selected as a 2019 Best Children\u2019s Book by both the Guardian and The Sunday Times.

In 2000, Dahl became the face of Yves Saint-Laurent's Opium. The ad campaign was art-directed by Tom Ford and shot by Steven Meisel. Dahl's nude images in British advertisements caused a near-record number of complaints to the UK's Advertising Standards Authority.\nPersonal life.\nDahl's paternal grandparents were the actor Stanley Holloway and his wife, Violet (n\u00e9e Lane), a former chorus dancer. Dahl's paternal lineage has been associated with the stage since at least 1850; Charles Bernard (1830\u20131894), a great-uncle to Stanley Holloway, was a Shakespearean actor and theatre manager in London and the English provinces. Bernard's son, Oliver Percy Bernard (1881\u20131939), was an architect and scenic designer, responsible for the sets for Sir Thomas Beecham's \"Ring\" Cycle at Covent Garden. Through Bernard, Dahl is related to his sons, the poet and translator Oliver Bernard, the photographer Bruce Bernard, and the writer Jeffrey Bernard. Dahl's maternal grandparents were the author Roald Dahl (who named the character Sophie from his novel \"The BFG\" after her) and the American actress Patricia Neal.\nOn 9 January 2010, Dahl married the singer Jamie Cullum.

It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Harry Tasker, a U.S. government agent, who struggles to balance his double life as a spy with his familial duties, and Jamie Lee Curtis as his unknowing wife. Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, Art Malik, Tia Carrere, Eliza Dushku, and Charlton Heston star in supporting roles. The screenplay is based on the 1991 French comedy film \"La Totale!.\"\nThe film was the first Lightstorm Entertainment project to be distributed under Cameron's multimillion-dollar production deal with 20th Century Fox, as well as the first major production for the visual effects company Digital Domain, which was co-founded by Cameron. It was also the first film to cost $100 million.\n\"True Lies\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, and ultimately grossed $378 million worldwide at the box office, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1994. For her performance, Curtis won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Saturn Award for Best Actress, while Cameron won the Saturn Award for Best Director. It was also nominated at the Academy Awards and BAFTAs in the Best Visual Effects category, and also for seven Saturn Awards. A streaming television series adaptation premiered in 2023.\nA 2004 ruling by the Court of Appeal of Paris found that \"True Lies\" and \"La Totale!\" were plagiarized from an unproduced 1981 screenplay, \"\u00c9milie\", by Lucien Lambert.\nPlot.\nHarry Tasker, to the knowledge of his wife Helen and his daughter Dana, is a mild-mannered computer hardware salesman often away on business trips. In reality he works for Omega Sector, a top-secret U.S. counterterrorism agency. Harry, aided by his teammates Albert \"Gib\" Gibson and Faisil, infiltrates a party in Switzerland hosted by billionaire Jamal Khaled. At the party, Harry approaches Khaled's art dealer Juno Skinner, who is also a paid agent of \"Crimson Jihad\", a terrorist organization led by Salim Abu Aziz.\nPosing as a potential art buyer, Harry visits Juno, leading the terrorists to attempt to kill him. Harry fights them off but loses Aziz in a pursuit. As a result, Harry misses the birthday party that Helen and Dana planned for him. The next day, Harry goes to Helen's office to reconcile with her, but instead overhears her secretly arranging to meet someone called Simon. \nSuspecting Helen is having an affair, Harry uses Omega Sector resources to learn that Simon is a used car salesman, who pretends to be a spy to seduce women. In disguise, Harry and other Omega agents arrest Helen and Simon. After terrifying Simon into keeping away from Helen, Harry and Gib interrogate her while hiding their identities. They learn she is suffering a midlife crisis and is desperately seeking adventure. They arrange for Helen to participate in a staged spy mission, where she is to seduce a mysterious figure (who is actually Harry) and plant a bug in his hotel room. As the fake mission proceeds, Aziz's men burst in and capture Helen and Harry. \nThe couple are taken to an island in the Florida Keys, where Helen learns of Harry's double life. Harry learns Juno had managed to smuggle four MIRV nuclear warheads by hiding them in fake antique statues. Aziz sends a message threatening to detonate warheads in major cities unless the U.S. government removes their forces from the Persian Gulf. He starts a timer to detonate one warhead on an uninhabited island as a demonstration. \nHarry breaks out of his restraints and kills his would-be torturers. The couple learn that one warhead is set to explode in 90 minutes while the others are loaded onto vehicles to be taken into the mainland via the Overseas Highway, bypassing U.S. Customs. In the ensuing melee, Harry and Helen kill many of the terrorists, but their main convoy drive off with two warheads, while Aziz carries one on a helicopter. Helen is caught by Juno and taken in a limousine following the convoy. \nGib and other Omega agents pick up Harry. Two Marine Harrier jump jets destroy part of the Seven Mile Bridge, intercepting the convoy. Hanging from a helicopter, Harry rescues Helen from the limo before it falls off the bridge, killing Juno. The warhead left on the island detonates without killing anyone.\nHarry discovers that Aziz and his men are holding Dana hostage in a Miami skyscraper and are threatening to detonate their last warhead. Harry commandeers one of the jets to rescue her. Faisil gets into the building by posing as a news cameraman. Dana steals the missile control key and flees to the roof, while Faisil kills several of Aziz's men. Aziz pursues Dana onto a tower crane, and then Harry arrives. Harry rescues Dana, and after a struggle with Aziz, he has him ensnared on the end of one of the plane's missiles, which Harry fires at a terrorist helicopter, killing Aziz and the remnants of Crimson Jihad. Harry, Helen and Dana are safely reunited.\nA year later, Harry and Helen are working together as Omega agents. While on a mission at a formal party, they encounter Simon, working as a waiter and pretending to be a spy. Simon runs away in fear after they reveal themselves and threaten to kill him to avoid jeopardizing their covers. Harry and Helen dance the tango, while Gib pleads for them to take their work seriously.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nArnold Schwarzenegger stated that while filming a scene with a horse, a camera boom hit the horse and \"it went crazy, spinning and rearing\" near a drop of . Schwarzenegger quickly slid off the horse and a stuntman caught him; he concluded, \"[this is] why I will always love stunt people\". Art Malik said he was drawn to the script's \"pantomime quality\" and the chance to work with director James Cameron. Costing $100\u2013120 million to produce, \"True Lies\" was the first film with a production budget of over $100 million. It was filmed over a seven-month schedule.\nOf the many locations that were used in the film, the Rosecliff Mansion was used for the ballroom tango scenes in the beginning of the film and the exterior of the Swiss chalet that Harry Tasker infiltrates is Ochre Court. The ballroom dancing scene that closes the film, as well as the scenes in the lobby of the fictional Hotel Marquis in Washington, take place in the Crystal Ballroom of the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. The outdoor structures used by Aziz's smuggling ring as a base of operations were a series of custom made Alaska Structures fabric buildings, leased to the production crew during filming.\nIt was during the production of \"True Lies\" in 1993 when Cameron would also first meet his future \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\" film series co-producer Jon Landau, who Cameron stated in July 2024 was \"the studio 'suit' assigned to oversee \"True Lies\".\" In the time following the production of \"True Lies\", Landau would leave Fox to join Cameron's production company Lightstorm.\nJoel Kramer sexual misconduct allegation.\nIn 2018, Eliza Dushku alleged that while filming \"True Lies\" at the age of twelve, she was sexually molested by the film's stunt coordinator, Joel Kramer. According to Dushku, soon after that, an adult friend of hers confronted Kramer on set, and that same day, Dushku was injured during a stunt and several of her ribs were broken, while Kramer was responsible for her safety. Dushku's co-stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, and director James Cameron all voiced support and admiration for Dushku's bravery. Kramer has denied the accusation of sexual misconduct.\nMusic.\nThis was the first film to use the 1994 20th Century Fox logo and fanfare adapted and conducted by Bruce Broughton.\nSoundtrack.\nSongs appearing in the film not included on the soundtrack album:\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"True Lies\" was a box-office success. Opening in 2,368 theaters in the United States and Canada, it ranked number one at the US box office in its opening weekend, grossing $25,869,770 and beating \"Forrest Gump\". Once \"Forrest Gump\" returned to the top of the box office the following week, \"True Lies\" dropped into second place, grossing $20.7 million. It set a record opening weekend in South Korea with a gross of $995,023. It also had a record opening weekend in Japan for distributor Nippon Herald with a gross of $3 million and was number one at the Japanese box office for twelve straight weeks. \"True Lies\" was the second major American film to be released in China since \"The Fugitive\" and generated a total of CN\u00a5, becoming the country's highest-grossing Hollywood film. The film also became the highest-grossing film of all time in the Philippines. \"True Lies\" went on to gross $146,282,411 in the United States and Canada and $232,600,000 in the rest of world, totaling $378,882,411 worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 1994, behind \"The Lion King\" and \"Forrest Gump\".\nCritical reception.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% based on 57 reviews, and an average score of 6.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"If it doesn't reach the heights of director James Cameron's and star Arnold Schwarzenegger's previous collaborations, \"True Lies\" still packs enough action and humor into its sometimes absurd plot to entertain\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars out of four, writing, \"It's stuff like that we go to Arnold Schwarzenegger movies for, and \"True Lies\" has a lot of it: laugh-out-loud moments when the violence is so cartoonish we don't take it seriously, and yet are amazed at its inventiveness and audacity.\" He wrote that he found the plot \"perfunctory\", but praised the film's stunts and special effects.\nThe film received criticism for its portrayal of Middle Easterners and its treatment of female characters. John Simon of the \"National Review\" criticized the plot line of the hero character (Schwarzenegger) using his agency's resources to stalk and frighten his wife as cruel and misogynistic. In a negative review, Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote:\nSome Arabs and Muslims perceived the film as conveying strong anti-Arab or anti-Muslim prejudice, with some Arab-American advocacy groups calling for its banning in Arab countries.\nIn a 2022 retrospective review, Polish writer Jacek Szafranowicz called the film \"a masterpiece of cinematic fun\", noting that the collaboration between the director and its main star \"deserves a golden medal\". Commenting on the state of blockbuster films, Scott Tobias of \"The Guardian\" and \"The A.V. Club\" wrote, \"\"True Lies\" is the strange case of a film that's alternately retrograde, forward-looking, and thoroughly of its time. For better or worse, it's a marker of how the Hollywood action blockbuster had advanced in 1994, as well as a commentary (intended or not) on the troubled state of American masculinity, marital relationships, and lingering racial attitudes.\"\nCensorship.\nOn October 1, 1994, \"True Lies\" was banned from Indonesian movie theaters due to the film spawning controversy that focused on Muslim leaders insulting Islam and portraying themselves as religious extremists. According to the Council of Muslim Scholars, it led people to hate Arab terrorists defending the interests of some Islamic nations, but justified American terrorism. Earlier that year, officials had already banned \"Schindler's List\" from the country because it contained too much violence and nudity.\nPlagiarism lawsuit.\n\"True Lies\" and its source material \"La Totale!\" were the subject of a 2000 plagiarism lawsuit launched by French screenwriter Lucien Lambert. Lambert sued Cameron and \"La Totale!\" writer-director Claude Zidi, claiming the latter had knowingly plagiarized from his unproduced 1981 screenplay called \"\u00c9milie,\" about a con artist who poses as a spy in order to seduce a woman\".\"\nIn 2001, the court ruled against Lambert, which he appealed. In June 2004, the Court of Appeal of Paris ruled in favor of Lambert, based on new evidence. Claude Zidi was ordered to pay Lambert US$15 million (his total profit percentage for the box office receipts of \"True Lies\"). Cameron was not held liable for damages, as the Court ruled he had purchased the film rights to \"La Totale!\" in good faith.\nHome media.\n\"True Lies\" was released on VHS on January 10, 1995, and on LaserDisc a month later on February 8. It was the second LaserDisc release to feature a Dolby Digital AC-3 track, after \"Clear and Present Danger\". On August 20, 1996, the film was released on a THX certified Widescreen Series VHS release, along with \"Speed\", \"The Abyss\" and \"The Last of the Mohicans\". It was then released on DVD on May 25, 1999. A high-definition version was released on D-Theater in 2003. In 2018, James Cameron stated that a new transfer for Blu-ray had been completed, but he hasn't found time to review it.\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film for purchase digitally on December 12, 2023, followed by a release on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 12, 2024. This release, along with the 4K releases of Cameron's \"Aliens\" and \"The Abyss\", have received criticism for the quality of their AI upscaling.\nLegacy.\nVideo games.\nShortly after the film's release, video games based on the film of the same name were released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Game Gear and Game Boy platforms.\nCancelled sequel.\nIn April 1997, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold met with Cameron and discussed the possibility of an eventual \"True Lies\" sequel, which would also bring back Curtis in her role. At the time, Cameron was busy working on \"Titanic\". Following the release of \"Titanic\" in late 1997, Cameron was planning to begin work on a \"True Lies\" sequel early the following year. Schwarzenegger and Arnold were expected to reprise their roles. Cameron conducted a search for a writer to work on \"True Lies 2\". In August 1999, Cameron and 20th Century Fox were negotiating to have Jeff Eastin write the script under Cameron's supervision. At the time, the film was being planned for a mid-2001 release, with Cameron expected to direct it. By the end of 1999, there was the possibility that filming would begin in the third quarter of 2000. However, development of the script was ongoing as of June 2000. Cameron planned to produce \"True Lies 2\" with Fox, but was undecided at that time on whether he would also direct it, as he wanted to wait until the script was complete. Eastin worked with Cameron on the project for approximately a year and a half, and Schwarzenegger and Arnold liked Eastin's script.\nBy March 2001, the script had been completed, and Curtis was confirmed to reprise her role alongside Schwarzenegger and Arnold. Following the September 11 attacks, Schwarzenegger said in January 2002, \"We'll shoot it next year. We have a good script. There does need to be some changes because it deals with some terrorist act of some sort. But it's pretty much done.\" Later in 2002, Cameron said the film would not be made following the September 11 attacks: \"Terrorism is no longer something to take as lightly as we did in the first one. I just can't see it happening given the current world climate.\"\nIn June 2003, Schwarzenegger said that after the attacks, \"Cameron was worried because there's an airplane scene \u2013 a terrific airplane scene \u2013 that didn't have anything to do with the terrorism that we had in 9/11, but it was a great fight scene inside the plane while the plane goes down and this kind of thing. It was a very important moment in the movie, and he felt like he can't do that and therefore has to rewrite it ... These things take a long time.\" The following month, Curtis said the film would never be made due to the September 11 attacks: \"Terrorists aren't funny anymore. They never were, but, it was distant enough from our psyche that we could make it funny. It'll never be funny again. I just think that that is over, that kind of humor is over.\" Eastin cited Schwarzenegger's 2003 election as California governor as another reason that \"True Lies 2\" did not get made. However, Arnold remained optimistic that the film would be made.\nIn 2005, Schwarzenegger said he had met with Cameron, Curtis, Paxton, and Dushku to discuss \"True Lies 2\". Schwarzenegger said that filming would begin once his role as California governor was concluded. Cameron said in 2009 that there were no plans to make the film, and Curtis, in 2019, reiterated her previous comments: \"I don't think we could ever do another \"True Lies\" after 9/11.\" Art Malik concurred, saying during the time of \"True Lies\"' filming, \"there was an element of fanaticism brewing and anti-West feeling going on. But I don't think any of us took any of it as seriously as we had to after 9/11. I think one of the reasons for that is probably the reason \"True Lies 2\" was never made.\u201d\nIn the 2005 film \"The Kid &amp; I\", Tom Arnold plays a fictional character based on himself. In that film, the character had starred in \"True Lies\" and is pursued by a fan and teams up with Henry Winkler and Linda Hamilton to make a sequel; Schwarzenegger and Curtis cameo as themselves.\nTelevision.\nOn February 10, 2021, CBS announced a pilot order for the \"True Lies\" series adaptation. Matt Nix wrote the pilot and produce with Josh Levy via Flying Glass of Milk Productions. James Cameron, director of the film, executive produced with Rae Sanchini through Lightstorm Entertainment. Mary Viola of Wonderland Sound and Vision also executive produced, with Corey Marsh of Wonderland co-executive producing. McG was set to direct the pilot and executive produce via Wonderland. In March 2021, CBS moved the pilot \"off cycle\" to give the series producers more time to film the pilot later in the year.\nBy May 2022, Anthony Hemingway replaced McG as the director of the pilot and subsequent episodes, via Anthony Hemingway Productions, to air by the 2022\u201323 broadcast season at CBS. Steve Howey and Ginger Gonzaga were cast in the lead roles, while Erica Hernandez, Omar Miller, Mike O'Gorman, Annabella Didion, and Lucas Jaye round out the supporting roles. On May 13, 2022, CBS officially picked up the series.

He acted in more than 100 films, in roles covering a wide range of genres. In his later years, Curtis made numerous television appearances.\nHe achieved his first major recognition as a dramatic actor in \"Sweet Smell of Success\" (1957) with co-star Burt Lancaster. The following year he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for \"The Defiant Ones\" (1958) alongside Sidney Poitier (who was also nominated in the same category). This was followed by the comedies \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"Operation Petticoat\" in 1959. In 1960, Curtis played a supporting role in the epic historical drama \"Spartacus\".\nHis stardom and film career declined considerably after 1960. Subsequently, his most significant dramatic part came in 1968 when he starred in the true-life drama \"The Boston Strangler\". Curtis also took on the role of the Ukrainian Cossack Andrei in the historical action romance epic \"Taras Bulba\" in 1962 and starred in the ITC TV series \"The Persuaders!\", playing Danny Wilde, an American millionaire. The series ran for twenty-four episodes.\nCurtis married six times and fathered six children.

He had two sons with his third wife, Leslie Allen, one of whom predeceased him. From 1998 until his death, he was married to Jill Vandenberg, a horse trainer.\nEarly life.\nTony Curtis was born Bernard Schwartz on June 3, 1925, at the Fifth Avenue Hospital corner of East 105th Street in East Harlem, Manhattan, the first of three boys born to Helen (n\u00e9e Klein) and Emanuel Schwartz.\nHis parents were Jewish immigrants from Hungary: his father was born in \u00d3p\u00e1lyi, near M\u00e1t\u00e9szalka, and his mother was a native of Michalovce, now in Slovakia; she later said she arrived in the U.S. from Va\u013ekovo, Slovakia. He spoke only Hungarian until the age of six, delaying his schooling. His father was a tailor and the family lived in the back of the shop. His mother was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. His youngest brother Robert was institutionalized with the same mental illness.\nWhen Curtis was eight, he and his brother Julius were placed in an orphanage for a month because their parents could not afford to feed them. Four years later, Julius was struck and killed by a truck. Curtis joined a neighborhood gang whose main crimes were truancy and minor pilfering. When Curtis was 11, a friendly neighbor saved him from what he felt would have led to a life of delinquency by sending him to a Boy Scout camp, where he was able to work off his energy and settle down. He attended Seward Park High School. At 16, he had his first small acting part in a school stage play.\nMilitary service.\nCurtis enlisted in the United States Navy. Inspired by Cary Grant's role in \"Destination Tokyo\" and Tyrone Power's in \"Crash Dive\" (1943), he joined the Pacific submarine force. Curtis served aboard a submarine tender, the USS \"Proteus\"\",\" until the end of the Second World War. On September 2, 1945, Curtis witnessed the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay from his ship's signal bridge about a mile away.\nFollowing his discharge from the Navy, Curtis attended City College of New York on the G.I.

The first name was from the novel \"Anthony Adverse\" and \"Curtis\" was from Kurtz, a surname in his mother's family. Although Universal Pictures taught him fencing and riding, Curtis admitted he was initially only interested in girls and money\u2014adding that he was pessimistic regarding his chances of becoming a major star. Curtis's biggest fear was having to return home to the Bronx as a failure:\nI was a million-to-one shot, the \"least\" likely to succeed. I wasn't low man on the totem pole, I was \"under\" the totem pole, in a sewer, tied to a sack. \nCurtis's uncredited screen debut came in the crime drama \"Criss Cross\" (1949) playing a rumba dancer, dancing with Yvonne de Carlo.

Curtis then co-starred with Frank Sinatra and Natalie Wood in the war movie \"Kings Go Forth\" (1958), before starring in \"The Defiant Ones\" the following year as a bigoted white escaped convict chained to a black man (played by Sidney Poitier).

She would also return to the \"Halloween\" franchise seven times, playing Strode in the sequels \"Halloween II\" (1981), ' (1998), ' (2002), \"Halloween\" (2018), \"Halloween Kills\" (2021), and \"Halloween Ends\" (2022), and having an uncredited voice role in \"\" (1982).\nAfter the major critical and commercial success of \"Halloween\", Curtis was cast in several horror films, garnering her a reputation as a scream queen.\n1980\u20131982: Scream queen.\nHer next film following \"Halloween\" was \"The Fog\", which was also directed by Carpenter and produced by Hill. The film opened in February 1980 to mixed reviews but strong box office, starting Curtis as a horror film starlet. In the years since its release, the film has achieved critical reappraisal and developed a cult following. Her next film, \"Prom Night\", was a low-budget Canadian slasher film released in July 1980. The film, for which she earned a Genie Award nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actress, was similar in style to \"Halloween\", yet received negative reviews which marked it as a disposable entry in the then-popular slasher genre. That year, Curtis also starred in \"Terror Train\", which opened in October and met with negative reviews akin to \"Prom Night\". Both films performed moderately well at the box office. Curtis's roles in the latter two films served a similar function to that of Strode\u2014the main character whose friends are murdered and is practically the only protagonist to survive. Film critic Roger Ebert, who gave negative reviews to all three of Curtis's 1980 films, said that Curtis \"is to the current horror film glut what Christopher Lee was to the last one\u2014or Boris Karloff was in the 1930s.\"\nIn 1981, she appeared alongside Stacey Keach in the Australian thriller film \"Roadgames\", directed by Carpenter's friend Richard Franklin; her importation, which was requested by the film's American distributor AVCO Embassy Pictures, was contested by the Sydney branch of Actors Equity. Although the film was a box office bomb in Australia and Franklin later regretted not increasing the size of Curtis's role, it has achieved a cult following and was championed by Quentin Tarantino. That same year, Curtis reprised her role of Laurie Strode in \"Halloween II.\" She starred in the television films \"Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story\", playing the eponymous doomed Playmate, and \"She's in the Army Now\".\n1983\u20131989: \"Trading Places\" and established actress.\nHer role as a kindhearted prostitute in 1983's \"Trading Places\" helped Curtis shed her horror queen image; the film was a great critical and commercial success and garnered Curtis a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She had previously worked with director John Landis on the documentary \"Coming Soon\". The studio originally objected to Curtis's casting, as she was primarily associated with horror films: \"The casting people all thought [Landis] was crazy, and he single-handedly changed the course of my life by giving me that part\", Curtis later stated. The following year, Curtis appeared in the romantic drama film \"Love Letters\" and the comedy-drama \"Grandview, U.S.A.\".\nIn 1985, Curtis was cast opposite John Travolta as a workout instructor in the film \"Perfect\". While her role earned her a reputation as a sex symbol, the film was a critical and commercial flop. It has since earned a cult following, and in a 1994 interview with \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Quentin Tarantino called the movie \"greatly underappreciated.\" That same year, Curtis starred as Annie Oakley in an episode of \"Shelley Duvall's Tall Tales &amp; Legends\". In 1986, she starred alongside Bette Davis in the HBO film \"As Summers Die\". She then starred in the 1988 comedy film \"A Fish Called Wanda\", which achieved cult status while showcasing her as a comedic actress.

The following year, she appeared in \"My Girl\", opposite her \"Trading Places\" co-star Dan Aykroyd. The film was a great commercial success and was followed by a sequel, \"My Girl 2\", in 1994. In 1992, Curtis starred alongside Mel Gibson in the romantic fantasy film \"Forever Young\". The following year, she appeared in the psychological thriller \"Mother's Boys\".\nCurtis received a Golden Globe Award for her work in the 1994 action-comedy film \"True Lies\", directed by James Cameron. The film was a critical and commercial success, becoming the 3rd highest-grossing film of 1994. Her performance also earned Curtis her first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination.

The series reunited Curtis with Harmon, after he played her character's fianc\u00e9 and later husband in the 2003 remake of \"Freaky Friday\". This was followed by supporting roles in the neo-noir mystery film \"Veronica Mars\" (2014) and the biographical drama film \"Spare Parts\" (2015).

{"id": "68383", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68383", "title": "Paul Rose (political figure)", "text": "Canadian terrorist (1943\u20132013)\nPaul Rose (16 October 1943 \u2013 14 March 2013) was a Canadian Quebec nationalist, a lecturer at Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, and a convicted murderer and terrorist known for his role in the October Crisis. He was convicted of the kidnapping and murder by strangulation of Quebec Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte in 1970. A Quebec government commission later determined in 1980 that Rose was not present when Laporte was killed, despite a recorded confession. He was the leader of the Chenier cell of the \"Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec\" (FLQ), an armed group which was fighting what they considered the oppression of French Quebecers.\nOn 10 October 1970, the cell kidnapped Quebec Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte. Laporte's strangled body was found in the trunk of a car on 17 October. Rose was among those convicted of the kidnapping and murder.\nBiography.\nRose was born in the Saint-Henri district of Montreal. At the age of eight, his family moved to Ville-Emard and later on his family moved to Ville Jacques-Cartier, now part of Longueuil, where he spent most of his teenage years.\nA member of the \"Rassemblement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance nationale\" political party, Rose's involvement with radical groups began in 1968 after meeting Jacques Lanct\u00f4t, a member of the FLQ, during a rally against Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau at the \"Saint-Jean-Baptiste\" parade.\nRole in October Crisis.\nDuring what became known as the October Crisis, on 5 October 1970, members of the FLQ's Liberation Cell kidnapped the British Trade Commissioner James Cross from his Montreal home as part of a violent attempt to overthrow the elected government and to establish a socialist Quebec state independent of Canada.\nOn 10 October, Paul Rose as leader of the FLQ's Ch\u00e9nier Cell joined with members Jacques Rose (brother), Bernard Lortie, and Francis Simard to kidnap Quebec Vice Premier and cabinet minister, Pierre Laporte. Believing many others would follow in an uprising, their goal was to have Quebec live up to the fate wished for it by the Lower Canada rebellions of 1837\u20138, namely to become an independent country. However, the kidnapping did not work out as planned and they killed Laporte. Some say that FLQ killed him without hesitation in order to show to the population they were serious. In 1971, Rose was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Laporte and sentenced to life imprisonment.\nIn 1980, the Duchaine Report found that Rose was not present when Laporte was killed. He was released on parole in 1982.\nLater evidence would prove the contrary. \"A coroner's inquest soon after the murder determined that Laporte had been strangled by a gold religious medal he wore around his neck. In a conversation wiretapped by police, Rose even admitted to his lawyer that he \u201cfinished\u201d Laporte with the gold chain.\" However, the police officer who recorded the conversation told \"The Globe and Mail\" that Rose may have made the statement to cover up for another cell member. Another version, less \"drastic\", says rather that this secretly recorded conversation was between Paul Rose's brother, Jacques, and his lawyer, Robert Lemieux. Jacques Rose then told that Pierre Laporte was accidentally strangled during a struggle after he tried to escape while two of the kidnappers were about to release him. As this conversation was recorded without the consent of Rose and Lemieux, it could not be used as evidence.\nRose also remained unrepentant. In an interview he gave to \"Le Devoir\", he said:\nI regret nothing: 1970, the abductions, the prison, the suffering, nothing. I did what I had to do. Placed before the same circumstances today, I would do exactly the same thing. I will never deny what I did and what happened. It was not a youthful indiscretion.\nLater life and death.\nDuring the 1990s, he contributed to the monthly \"L'aut'journal.\" He was nominated as the New Democratic Party of Quebec's candidate in a 1992 provincial by-election. His nomination was controversial, and resulted in the federal New Democratic Party denouncing its former provincial wing (ties between the two parties had been severed in 1989) and seeking legal options in an attempt to force the provincial party to change its name.\nThe NDPQ changed its name to the Parti de la d\u00e9mocratie socialiste in 1994, and Rose was elected its leader in 1996. He led the party until 2002 when it joined the Union des forces progressistes. Rose worked for the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des syndicats nationaux labour union. Rose remained a strong supporter of the Quebec sovereignty movement, which he likened to \"a liberation nationalism. It's a people being denied its existence that is trying to find its place in the sun, in the same way as Palestine and Ireland.\"\nHe died of a stroke on 14 March 2013, at the H\u00f4pital du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Montr\u00e9al at the age of 69.\nEven in death, Rose was the source of controversy. Amir Khadir, one of two deputies of the sovereigntist party \"Quebec solidaire\", which had absorbed the UFP in 2006, proposed tabling a motion in the Quebec provincial legislature to honour his death. Khadir later withdrew the proposal, blaming anglophone media for nationalist hate-mongering, and claiming Rose had recanted and been rehabilitated.\nHis son F\u00e9lix Rose released the documentary film \"The Rose Family (Les Rose)\", about his own efforts to come to terms with being the son of a convicted murderer, in 2020.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68385", "revid": "48985617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68385", "title": "Chess puzzle", "text": "Puzzle based on chess\nA chess puzzle is a puzzle in which knowledge of the pieces and rules of chess is used to logically solve a chess-related problem. The history of chess puzzles reaches back to the Middle Ages and has since evolved.\nUsually the goal is to find the single best, ideally aesthetic move or a series of single best moves in a chess position, that was created by a composer or is from a real game. But puzzles can also set different objectives. Examples include deducing the last move played, the location of a missing piece, or whether a player has lost the right to castle. Sometimes the objective is antithetical to normal chess, such as helping (or even compelling) the opponent to checkmate one's own king.\nChess problems.\nWhile a \"chess puzzle\" is any puzzle involving aspects of chess, a \"chess problem\" (or \"chess composition\") is a crafted position with a specified task to be fulfilled, such as White mates in \"n\" moves. Chess problems are divided into orthodox and heterodox types, both covering a variety of genres.\n\"Orthodox problems\" employ the standard rules of chess and involve positions that can legally arise from actual gameplay. The most common form of orthodox problem is the directmate, which stipulates checkmate in \"n\" moves, usually two or three. The positions are often dissimilar to positions from actual play, sometimes to the extent of being outlandish in comparison. The &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;key&lt;/dfn&gt; move is usually counter-intuitive. Despite their unusual stipulations, helpmates and selfmates are usually considered orthodox problems, as they use standard chess rules. Likewise, retrograde analysis problems are usually considered orthodox.\n\"Heterodox problems\", also called fairy chess problems, involve altered rules, such as different boards and pieces not used in standard chess.\nTactical puzzles.\nChess puzzles can also be regular positions from actual games, usually meant as tactical training positions. They can range from a simple \"Mate in one\" combination to a complex attack on the enemy king. Solving tactical chess puzzles is a very common chess teaching technique. They are helpful in pattern recognition.\nExample 1.\nThe solution is 1...Qf2!, attacking the f1-rook; 2.Rxf2 would incur a back-rank checkmate after 2...Rd1+. If 2.Rg1, 2...Bc5 sets up a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;battery&lt;/dfn&gt; targetting g1, where White can stop checkmate only by moving the c1-bishop to &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;connect rooks&lt;/dfn&gt;. Since the only two squares available to the bishop are controlled by the black queen, loss of the bishop is unavoidable. White's best try is 2.Be3, giving up the bishop immediately and leaving Black an easily &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;won position&lt;/dfn&gt;.\nExample 2.\nThe solution is 1.Ne6+!, unblocking White's h4-bishop and g1-rook. Black's f-pawn must guard the g6-bishop, preventing ...fxe6 in almost all variations; thus, if the black king moves after 1.Ne6+, then 2.Qxf6 leaves Black down a piece and in a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;mating net&lt;/dfn&gt;. 1...Kh7 and 2...Rhg8 defending the bishop allows for 3...fxe6, but White's attack is insurmountable, with prospects of opening the h-file with Bg5 and of Bxe6. White can force mate in less than 13 moves against any alternative to 1...Qxe6, which sacrifices material to blunt White's attack.\nMathematical chess problems.\nSome chess problems, like the eight queens puzzle or the knight's tour problem, have connections to mathematics, especially to graph theory and combinatorics. Many famous mathematicians have studied such problems, including Euler, Legendre, and Gauss. Besides finding a solution to a particular puzzle, mathematicians are usually interested in counting the total number of possible solutions, finding solutions with certain properties, and generalization of the problems to \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" or rectangular boards."}

Members of the group were responsible for the events known as the October Crisis.\nAs a member of the Rassemblement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance nationale political party, he met Paul Rose and the two became involved in revolutionary activities in 1969 when Simard campaigned for the development of the French language in McGill University, one of Montreal's English-language universities. During what became known as the October Crisis, on October 5, 1970, members of the FLQ's Liberation Cell kidnapped the British Trade Commissioner James Cross from his Montreal home as part of a violent attempt to overthrow the elected government and to establish a Marxist Quebec state independent of Canada. On October 10, Francis Simard, along with Chenier Cell leader, Paul Rose and his brother, Jacques Rose and Bernard Lortie, kidnapped and then murdered Quebec vice premier and cabinet minister Pierre Laporte. Believing many others would follow in an uprising, their goal was to create an independent state based on the ideals of Fidel Castro's Cuba. In 1982, Simard described the murder of Laporte as \"a sincere gesture to show that what we were saying was not just words.\"\nOn May 20, 1971, Simard was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Pierre Laporte. He was given parole in 1982. Simard wrote a book published in 1982 about the October Crisis titled \"Pour en finir avec octobre\". In 1994, Quebec film director Pierre Falardeau made a movie from it titled \"Octobre\".

It was inspired by the Great Locomotive Chase, a true story of an event that occurred during the American Civil War. The story was adapted from the 1889 memoir \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" by William Pittenger. The film stars Buster Keaton, who also co-directed it along with Clyde Bruckman.\nAt the time of its initial release, \"The General,\" an action comedy film made toward the end of the silent era, was not well received by critics and audiences, resulting in mediocre box office returns (about half a million dollars domestically, and approximately one million worldwide). Because of its huge budget ($750,000 supplied by Metro chief Joseph Schenck) and failure to turn a significant profit, Keaton lost his independence as a film maker and was forced into a restrictive deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\nIn 1954, the film entered the public domain in the United States because its claimant did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. In 1989, the film was selected by the Library of Congress to be included in the first class of films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\nAfter arriving in Marietta, Georgia, Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad train engineer Johnnie Gray visits Annabelle Lee, one of the two loves of his life, the other being his locomotive, \"The General.\" News arrives that the American Civil War has broken out, and Annabelle's brother and father rush to enlist in the Confederate Army. To please Annabelle, Johnnie hurries to be first in line to enlist, but is rejected because he is more valuable as an engineer, although he is not told that reason. On leaving, he runs into Annabelle's father and brother, who beckon to him to join them in line, but he walks away, leading them to believe that he does not want to enlist. Annabelle decides that she will not speak to Johnnie again until he is in uniform.\nA year passes, and Annabelle receives word that her father has been wounded. She travels north on the W&amp;ARR to see him, with \"The General\" pulling the train. When it makes a stop, the passengers and crew detrain for a quick meal. As previously planned, Union Army spies led by Captain Anderson use the opportunity to steal the train. Anderson's objective is to burn all the railroad bridges he passes, thus preventing reinforcement and resupply of the Confederate army. Annabelle, having returned to the train to fetch her belongings, is taken captive by the spies.\nJohnnie gives chase, first on foot, then by handcar and boneshaker bicycle, before reaching the station at Kingston. He alerts the army detachment there, which boards another train to give chase, with Johnnie manning the locomotive the \"Texas.\" However, the flatcars are not hooked up to the engine and the troops are left behind. By the time Johnnie realizes he is alone, it is too late to turn back.\nThe Union agents try various methods to shake their pursuer, including disconnecting their trailing car and dropping railroad ties on the tracks. As the chase continues northward, the Confederate Army of Tennessee is ordered to retreat and the Northern army advances in its wake. Now behind Union lines, the hijackers see that Johnnie is by himself. Johnnie stops the \"Texas\" and runs into the forest to hide.\nAt nightfall, Johnnie climbs through the window of a house to steal food, but hides underneath a table when Union officers enter. He overhears their plan for a surprise attack and learns that the Rock River Bridge is essential for their supply trains. There, Johnny meets Annabelle, and they decide to steal back the train.\nAs day breaks, Johnnie and Annabelle find themselves near a railway station where Union soldiers and equipment are being organized for the attack. Seeing \"The General,\" Johnnie devises a plan to warn the South. After sneaking Annabelle onto a boxcar, Johnnie steals his engine back. Two Union trains, including the \"Texas,\" set out after the pair, while the Union attack is launched. Fending off his pursuers, Johnnie starts a fire behind \"The General\" in the center of the Rock River Bridge to cut off the Union's supply line.\nReaching friendly lines, Johnnie warns the Confederate commander of the impending attack and their forces rush to meet the enemy. Meanwhile, Annabelle is reunited with her convalescing father. The pursuing \"Texas\" drives onto the burning bridge, which collapses. When Union soldiers try to ford the river, Confederate fire drives them back.\nAfterward, Johnnie returns to his locomotive to find the Union officer whom he had knocked out in escaping earlier has now regained consciousness. He takes the officer prisoner and is spotted by the Confederate general. As a reward for his bravery, he is commissioned a lieutenant and given the captured officer's sword.\nReturning to \"The General\" with Annabelle, he tries to kiss her, but has to repeatedly return the salutes of troops walking past. Johnnie finally uses his left hand to embrace Annabelle while using his right to salute passing soldiers.\nProduction.\nIn early 1926, Keaton's collaborator Clyde Bruckman told him about William Pittenger's 1889 memoir \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" about the 1862 Great Locomotive Chase. Keaton was a huge fan of trains and had read the book. Although it was written from the Union Army perspective, Keaton did not believe that the audience would accept Confederates as villains and changed the story's point of view. Keaton looked into shooting the film in the area where the original events took place, and attempted to authorize a lease agreement for the real-life \"General\". At that time, the locomotive was on display at Chattanooga Union Station. The Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway, who had entitlement on the engine, denied Keaton's request when they realized the film was going to be a comedy.\nIn April 1926, Keaton's location manager, Burt Jackson, found an area in Oregon with old-fashioned railroads which he ascertained to be more authentic in terms of period setting for the film. He also discovered that the Oregon, Pacific and Eastern Railway owned two vintage locomotives operating in lumber service that looked the part and purchased them for the production. He later bought a third locomotive in Oregon to portray the \"Texas\" for the purpose of using it in the iconic bridge collapse stunt. Producer Joseph Schenck was excited about the film and gave Keaton a budget of $400,000. Keaton spent weeks working on the script and preparing for elaborate pyrotechnical shots. He also grew his hair long for the film. He hired Sennett Bathing Beauties actress Marion Mack for the female lead role.\nThe cast and crew arrived in Cottage Grove, Oregon, on May 27, 1926, with 18 freight cars full of Civil War-era cannons, rebuilt passenger cars, stagecoaches, houses, wagons and laborers. The crew stayed at the Bartell Hotel in nearby Eugene and brought three 35\u00a0mm cameras with them from Los Angeles. On May 31, set construction began with the materials, and regular train service in Cottage Grove ceased until the end of production. One third of the film's budget was spent in Cottage Grove, and 1,500 locals were hired.\nFilming began on June 8. At first, Keaton completely ignored Mack on set. She said that \"Buster just stuck to the job and to his little clique, and that was all\" and that the crew \"stopped the train when they saw a place to play baseball.\" Keaton eventually came to like Mack during production, often playing practical jokes on her. The atmosphere on set was lighthearted, and every Sunday the cast and crew played baseball with local residents, who often said that Keaton could have been a professional player.\nAccording to a United Artists press release at the time, the film had 3,000 people on its payroll and cost $400 an hour to make. Entertainment trade papers reported rumors that the film's budget had grown to between $500,000 and $1 million, and that Keaton was out of control, building real bridges and having dams constructed to change the depths of rivers. Producer Schenck was angry at Keaton over the growing costs. There were also numerous on-set accidents that contributed to the growing budget. This included Keaton being knocked unconscious, an assistant director being shot in the face with a blank cartridge, a train wheel running over a brakeman's foot, resulting in a $2,900 lawsuit, and the train's wood-burning engine causing numerous fires. The fires often spread to forests and farmers' haystacks, which cost the production $25 per burnt stack.\nOn July 23, Keaton shot the climactic train wreck scene in the conifer forest near Cottage Grove. The town declared a local holiday so that everyone could watch the spectacle. Between three and four thousand local residents showed up, including 500 extras from the Oregon National Guard. (Elsewhere in the film, the Oregon National Guard members appear dressed as both Union and Confederate soldiers who cross the landscape in the background of the train tracks). Keaton used six cameras for the train wreck scene, which began four hours late and required several lengthy trial runs. The production company left the wreckage in the riverbed. The locomotive became a minor tourist attraction for nearly twenty years, until it was salvaged in 1944\u201345 for scrap during World War II.\nAnother fire broke out during the filming of a large fight scene, which not only cost the production $50,000, but also forced Keaton and the crew to return to Los Angeles on August 6 due to excessive smoke. Heavy rains finally cleared the smoke in late August and production resumed. Shooting concluded on September 18. Keaton had shot 200,000 feet of film and began a lengthy editing process for a late December release date.\nKeaton performed many dangerous physical stunts on and around the moving train, including jumping from the engine to a tender to a boxcar, and running along the roofs of the railcars. One of the most dangerous stunts involved him pulling a railroad tie out from being lodged into the track, with the train steadily approaching, then sitting on the cow-catcher of the slow-moving train while carrying the tie, then tossing it at another tie to dislodge it from the tracks. Had he either failed to pull out the first tie on time, or mistimed the throw to the second tie, the locomotive could have derailed and Keaton could have been injured or killed.\nAnother dangerous stunt involved Keaton sitting on one of the coupling rods connecting the drivers of the locomotive. Had the locomotive suffered a wheelspin, Keaton might have been thrown from the rod and injured or killed. Shot in one take, the scene shows the train starting gently and gradually picking up speed as it enters a shed, while Keaton's character Johnnie Gray, distracted and heartbroken, is oblivious.\nRelease and initial reception.\n\"The General\" premiered on December 31, 1926, in two small theaters in Tokyo, Japan. It was scheduled to have its US premiere at the prestigious Capitol Theatre in New York City on January 22, 1927, but was delayed for several weeks due to the enormous hit, \"Flesh and the Devil,\" then playing at the Capitol. It finally premiered on February 5, with the engine bell from the real \"General\" train on display in the lobby to promote it. It played at the Capitol for one week, making $50,992, considered average box-office. With a final budget of $750,000, it made $474,264 in the US.\nOn its initial release, the film largely failed to please the critics. \"Variety\" reported of a theater in which it played, \"After four weeks of record business with \"Flesh and the Devil,\" [the theater] looks as though it were virtually going to starve to death this week.\" It went on to say \"The General\" was \"far from funny\" and that it was \"a flop.\" \"The New York Times\" reviewer, Mordaunt Hall, stated: \"The production itself is singularly well mounted, but the fun is not exactly plentiful,\" and \"This is by no means so good as Mr. Keaton's previous efforts.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that the picture was \"neither straight comedy nor is it altogether thrilling drama\"...\"drags terribly with a long and tiresome chase of one engine by another.\" A review in \"Motion Picture Classic\" called it \"a mild Civil War comedy, not up to Keaton's best standards.\" A review in the \"New York Herald Tribune\" called it \"long and tedious \u2014 the least-funny thing Buster Keaton has ever done.\" Writer Robert E. Sherwood wrote, \"Someone should have told Buster Keaton that it is difficult to derive laughter from the sight of men being killed in battle.\" There was a favourable review in the \"Brooklyn Eagle.\"\nLegacy.\nIn 1963, Keaton said, \"I was more proud of that picture than any I ever made. Because I took an actual happening out of the...history books, and I told the story in detail too.\" Following changes in taste and critical reevaluation of Keaton's work, later audiences and critics have come to agree with him, and \"The General\" is now considered a major classic of the silent era. David Robinson wrote, \"Every shot has the authenticity and the unassumingly correct composition of a Mathew Brady Civil War photograph.\" Raymond Durgnat wrote, \"Perhaps \"The General\" is the most beautiful [film], with its spare, grey photography, its eye for the racy, lunging lines of the great locomotives, with their prow-like cowcatchers, with its beautifully sustained movement.\" In 2015, film critic Eileen Jones (writing for leftist magazine \"Jacobin\") called the film a \"comic masterpiece\" while also criticizing how it exemplified a larger tendency throughout American cinema to champion the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.\nIn 1954 the film entered the public domain in the United States because its claimant did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.\n\"The General\" was a favorite film of American filmmaker Orson Welles. Welles said that \"The General\" was \"the greatest comedy ever made, the greatest Civil War film ever made, and perhaps the greatest film ever made.\u201d He featured the film in his 1971 documentary television series, \"The Silent Years\".\nIn 1989, \"The General\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" It was the Registry's initial year, some of the other films chosen were \"The Best Years of Our Lives,\" \"Casablanca,\" \"Citizen Kane,\" \"Gone with the Wind,\" \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" \"Star Wars,\" \"Sunset Boulevard,\" and \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\nIn the decennial \"Sight &amp; Sound\" poll of the greatest films ever made, international critics ranked \"The General\" #8 in 1972 and #10 in 1982. It ranked #34 in critic's poll in 2012 and 75th in the directors poll. In 2002, critic Roger Ebert ranked it sixth in the 2002 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" Greatest Films poll and included it on his The Great Movies list. Dave Whitaker of DavesMovieDatabase, a film aggregator site that combines other lists with box-office, ratings and awards, lists \"The General\" as the 99th-greatest movie of all time, the 21st-greatest comedy, and the 3rd-greatest silent.\nA mural was painted on a building in Cottage Grove, Oregon commemorating the film. David Thomson has speculated it is \"the only memorial in the United States to Buster Keaton.\"\nU.S. film distributor Kino International released the film on Blu-ray Disc in November 2009, the first American release of a silent feature film for the high-definition video medium. The Blu-ray edition replicates the extra features of Kino's 2008 \"The Ultimate 2-Disc Edition\" on DVD, including the choice of three orchestral scores.\nThe film was recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2000: AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs \u2013 #18 2007: AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 #18.\nVersions.\nIn 1953, a new version of the film was created by film distributor and collector Raymond Rohauer, re-edited with an introduction and music. That version is still under copyright, because Rohauer filed a copyright registration in 1953 and renewed it in 1983.\nIn 1987, Carl Davis composed a score for the film, which was later used with a 4K restoration of the film in 2019.\nIn 2016 or 2017, an original score was commissioned to celebrate the 90th anniversaries of both \"The General\" and the Hollywood Theatre in Portland, Oregon. The film subsequently toured Oregon.\nIn 2017, the Dallas Chamber Symphony commissioned an original film score for \"The General\" from composer Douglas Pipes. The score premiered during a concert screening on October 17, 2017 at Moody Performance Hall with Richard McKay conducting.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68392", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68392", "title": "Harry Flashman", "text": "Sir Harry Paget Flashman is a fictional character created by Thomas Hughes (1822\u20131896) in the semi-autobiographical \"Tom Brown's School Days\" (1857) and later developed by George MacDonald Fraser (1925\u20132008). Harry Flashman appears in a series of 12 of Fraser's books, collectively known as \"The Flashman Papers\", with covers illustrated by Arthur Barbosa and Gino D'Achille. Flashman was played by Malcolm McDowell in the Richard Lester 1975 film \"Royal Flash\".\nIn \"Tom Brown's School Days\" (1857), Flashman is portrayed as a notorious Rugby School bully who persecutes Tom Brown and is finally expelled for drunkenness, at which point he simply disappears. Fraser decided to write the story of Flashman's later life, in which the school bully would be identified as an \"illustrious Victorian soldier\", experiencing many of the 19th-century wars and adventures of the British Empire and rising to high rank in the British Army, to be acclaimed as a great warrior, while still remaining \"a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward\u2014and, oh yes, a toady.\" In the papers\u2014which are purported to have been written by Flashman and discovered only after his death\u2014he describes his own dishonourable conduct with complete candour. Fraser's Flashman is an antihero who often runs away from danger. Nevertheless, through a combination of luck and cunning, he usually ends each volume acclaimed as a hero.\nFlashman's origins.\nFraser gave Flashman a lifespan from 1822 to 1915 and a birth-date of 5 May. He also provided Flashman's first and middle names, as Hughes's novel had given Flashman only one, using the names to make an ironic allusion to Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey. Paget was one of the heroes of Waterloo, who cuckolded the Duke of Wellington's brother Henry Wellesley and later\u2014in one of the period's more celebrated scandals\u2014married Lady Anglesey, after Wellesley had divorced her for adultery.\nIn \"Flashman\", Flashman says that his great-grandfather, Jack Flashman, made the family fortune in America, trading in rum, slaves and \"piracy too, I shouldn't wonder\". Despite their wealth, the Flashmans \"were never the thing\"; Flashman quotes the diarist Henry Greville's comment that \"the coarse streak showed through, generation after generation, like dung beneath a rosebush\". Harry Flashman's equally fictional father, Henry Buckley Flashman, appears in \"Black Ajax\" (1997). Buckley, a bold young officer in the British cavalry, is said to have been wounded in action at Talavera in 1809, and then to have gained access to \"society\" by sponsoring bare-knuckle boxer Tom Molineaux (the first black man to contend for a championship). The character subsequently marries Flashman's mother Lady Alicia Paget, a fictional relation of the real Marquess of Anglesey. Buckley, it is related, also served as a Member of Parliament (MP) but was \"sent to the knacker's yard at Reform\". Beside politics, the older Flashman character has interests including drinking, fox hunting (riding to hounds), and women.\nCharacter.\nFlashman is a large man, tall and close to 13 stone (about 180 pounds or 82\u00a0kg). In \"Flashman and the Tiger\", he mentions that one of his grandchildren has black hair and eyes, resembling him in his younger years. His dark colouring frequently enabled him to pass (in disguise) for a Pashtun. He claims only three natural talents: horsemanship, facility with foreign languages, and fornication. He becomes an expert cricket-bowler, but only through hard effort (he needed sporting credit at Rugby School, and feared to play rugby football). He can also display a winning personality when he wants to, and is very skilled at flattering those more important than himself without appearing servile.\nAs he admits in the Papers, Flashman is a coward, who will flee from danger if there is any way to do so, and has on some occasions collapsed in funk. He has one great advantage in concealing this weakness: when he is frightened, his face turns red, rather than white, so that observers think he is excited, enraged, or exuberant\u2014as a hero ought to be.\nAfter his expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness, the young Flashman looks for an easy life. He has his wealthy father buy him an officer's commission in the fashionable 11th Regiment of Light Dragoons. The 11th, commanded by Lord Cardigan, later involved in the Charge of the Light Brigade, has just returned from India and are not likely to be posted abroad soon. Flashman throws himself into the social life that the 11th offered and becomes a leading light of Canterbury society. In 1840 the regiment is converted to Hussars with an elegant blue and crimson uniform, which assists Flashman in attracting female attention for the remainder of his military career.\nA duel with another officer over a French courtesan leads to his being temporarily stationed in Paisley, Scotland. There he meets and deflowers Elspeth Morrison, daughter of a wealthy textile manufacturer, whom he has to marry in a \"shotgun wedding\" under threat of a horsewhipping by her uncle. But marriage to the daughter of a mere businessman forces his transferral from the snobbish 11th Hussars. He is sent to India to make a career in the army of the East India Company. Unfortunately, his language talent and his habit of flattery bring him to the attention of the Governor-General. The Governor does him the (very much unwanted) favour of assigning him as aide to General Elphinstone in Afghanistan. \nFlashman survives the ensuing retreat from Kabul (the worst British military debacle of Victoria's reign) by a mixture of sheer luck and unstinting cowardice. He becomes an unwitting hero: the defender of Piper's Fort, where he is the only surviving white man, and is found by the relieving troops clutching the flag and surrounded by enemy dead. Of course, Flashman had arrived at the fort by accident, collapsed in terror rather than fighting, been forced to stand and show fight by his subordinate, and is 'rumbled' for a complete coward. He had been trying to surrender the colours, not defend them. Happily for him, all inconvenient witnesses had been killed.\nThis incident sets the tone for Flashman's life. Over the following 60 years or so, he is involved in many of the major military conflicts of the 19th century\u2014always in spite of his best efforts to evade his duty. He is often selected for especially dangerous jobs because of his heroic reputation. He meets many famous people, and survives some of the worst military disasters of the period (the First Anglo-Afghan War, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Siege of Cawnpore, the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and the Battle of Isandlwana), always coming out with more heroic laurels. The date of his last adventure seems to have been around 1900, being involved in the Boxer Rebellion alongside US Marines. He dies in 1915.\nDespite his admitted cowardice, Flashman is a dab hand at fighting when he has to. Though he dodges danger as much as he can, and runs away when no one is watching, after the Piper's Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and he holds up long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides all the way to the Russian guns. However, most of these acts of 'bravery' are performed only when he has absolutely no choice and to do anything else would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.\nFlashman surrenders to fear in front of witnesses only a few times, and is never caught out again. During the siege of Piper's Fort, in the first novel, Flashman cowers weeping in his bed at the start of the final assault; the only witness to this dies before relief comes. He breaks down while accompanying Rajah Brooke during a battle with pirates, but the noise drowns out his blubbering, and he recovers enough to command a storming party of sailors (placing himself right in the middle of the party, to avoid stray bullets). After the Charge of the Light Brigade, he flees in panic from the fighting in the battery\u2014but mistakenly charges into an entire Russian regiment, adding to his heroic image.\nIn spite of his numerous character flaws, Flashman is represented as being a perceptive observer of his times (\"I saw further than most in some ways\"). In its obituary of George MacDonald Fraser, \"The Economist\" commented that realistic sharp-sightedness (\"if not much else\") was an attribute Flashman shared with his creator.\nRelationships.\nFlashman, an insatiable lecher, has sex with many different women over the course of his fictional adventures. His size, good looks, winning manner, and especially his splendid cavalry-style whiskers win over women from low to high, and his dalliances include famous ladies along with numerous prostitutes. In \"Flashman and the Great Game\", about halfway through his life, he counted up his sexual conquests while languishing in a dungeon at Gwalior, \"not counting return engagements\", reaching a total of 478 up to that date (similar\u2014albeit not equal\u2014to the tally made by Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" in the famous aria of Giovanni's henchman, Leporello). Passages in \"Royal Flash\", \"Flashman and the Mountain of Light\", \"Flashman and the Dragon\", \"Flashman and the Redskins\", and \"Flashman and the Angel of the Lord\" suggest that Flashman was well endowed.\nHe was a vigorous and exciting (if sometimes selfish and rapacious) lover, and some of his partners became quite fond of him\u2014though by his own admission, others tried to kill him afterwards. The most memorable of these was Cleonie, a prostitute Flashman sold into slavery in \"Flashman and the Redskins\". He was not above forcing himself on a partner by blackmail (e.g., Phoebe Carpenter in \"Flashman and the Dragon\"), and at least twice raped women (Narreeman, an Afghan dancing girl in \"Flashman\", and an unnamed harem girl in \"Flashman's Lady\").\nFlashman's stories are dominated by his numerous amorous encounters. Several of them are with prominent historical personages. These women are sometimes window dressing, sometimes pivotal characters in the unpredictable twists and turns of the books. Historical women Flashman bedded included:\nHe also lusted after (but never bedded):\nHis fictional amours included:\nAs well as bedding more or less any lass available, he married whenever it was politic to do so. During a posting to Scotland, he was forced to marry Elspeth to avoid \"pistols for two with her fire-breathing uncle\". He is still married to her decades later when writing the memoirs, though that does not stop him pursuing others. Nor does it prevent marrying them when his safety seems to require it; he marries Duchess Irma in \"Royal Flash\" and in \"Flashman and the Redskins\" he marries Susie Willnick as they escape New Orleans, and Sonsee-Array a few months later.\nHe was also once reminded of a woman that Elspeth claimed he flirted with named Kitty Stevens, though Flashman was unable to remember her.\nHe had a special penchant for royal ladies, and noted that his favourite amours (apart from his wife) were Lakshmibai, Ci Xi and Lola Montez: \"a Queen, an Empress, and the foremost courtesan of her time: I dare say I'm just a snob.\" He also noted that, while civilized women were more than ordinarily partial to him, his most ardent admirers were among the savage of the species: \"Elspeth, of course, is Scottish.\" And for all his raking, it was always Elspeth to whom he returned and who remained ultimately top of the list.\nHis lechery was so strong that it broke out even in the midst of rather hectic circumstances. While accompanying Thomas Henry Kavanagh on his daring escape from Lucknow, he paused for a quick rattle with a local prostitute, and during the battle of , he found himself galloping one of Sharif Sahib's concubines without even realizing it but nonetheless continued to the climax of the battle and the tryst.\nFlashman's relations with the highest-ranking woman of his era, Queen Victoria, are warm but platonic. He first meets her in 1842 when he receives a medal for his gallantry in Afghanistan and reflects on what a honeymoon she and Prince Albert must have enjoyed.

After publishing the report in 1945, the Survey members then turned their attention to the war efforts against Imperial Japan during the Pacific War, including a separate section on the recent use of the atomic bomb in attacks on two Japanese cities.\nIn total, the reports contained 208 volumes for Europe and another 108 for the Pacific, comprising thousands of pages. The reports' conclusions were generally favorable about the contributions of Allied strategic bombing towards victory.\nThe survey said of Allied airpower that it \"was decisive in the war in Western Europe. Hindsight inevitably suggests that it might have been employed differently or better in some respects. Nevertheless, it was decisive. In the air, its victory was complete. At sea, its contribution, combined with naval power, brought an end to the enemy's greatest naval threat-the U-boat; on land, it helped turn the tide overwhelmingly in favor of Allied ground forces\"\nA majority of the Survey's members were civilians in positions of influence on the various committees of the survey. Only one position of some influence was given to a prominent military officer, USAAF General Orvil A. Anderson (who had been in the Air War Plans Division) and that only in an advisory capacity. Anderson was the only one on the survey board who knew about procedures of strategic bombing as Jimmy Doolittle's former deputy commander of operations. While the Board was not associated with any branch of the military, it was established by General Hap Arnold (chief of the USAF) along with Carl Spaatz (commander of Strategic Air Forces in Europe). Failing to obtain the prominent public figure he had hoped for, Arnold settled for Franklin D'Olier.\nBackground.\nThe strategic bombing effort against Germany had begun at the start of the war with British attacks on German naval facilities. After heavy losses in daylight raids, RAF Bomber Command moved to night attacks for protection from German fighter defences. The Butt report identified that attacks on specific targets were inaccurate due to navigational and target identification issues. Bomber Command reorganised its efforts and targeted German industrial locations in general rather than aiming for any specific factory or industry under the Area Bombing directive. At the same time it invested in navigational aids and target marking. The total bomber force increased until the RAF was able to send 500 to 800 bombers against a single target city while still able to carry out minor raids and diversions against other areas. While in 1941 the RAF dropped about 46,000 tons of bombs, in 1944 it dropped 676,000 tons.\nThe USAAF entered the strategic bombing campaign with the intention of targeting specific industrial locations and to achieve precision bombing the attacks needed to be made by daylight. Formations of bombers flew in a mutually self-defensive \"combat box\" where their many machine guns would be sufficient to drive off or bring down enemy fighters. In practice due to many factors including the weather bombing accuracy fell short - around 20% of bombs fell within the required 1000\u00a0ft of the aiming point.\nThe 1943 Casablanca conference led to the Allied strategic bombing organisation: the USAAF would be working together with the RAF in the Combined Bomber offensive concentrating on particular areas of German industry but in such a way as their commanders interpreted their instructions. In 1942 and early 1943 the US 8th Air Force based in UK had limited itself to raids close to base as it built up its strength, and developed tactics. A second strategic force, the 15th Air Force was created in the Mediterranean. Two further air forces, the Ninth Air Force in Western Europe and Twelfth Air Force in Mediterranean were focused on tactical operations in support of land forces.\nThe Allied strategy was to win the war by a land war in Europe rather than delivering a knock out blow by airpower alone, and the bombing strategy was in support of that. Over the course of the war, the focus of the Combined Bomber Offensive changed. As Germany was reliant on imported fuel and the synthetic generation of fuel from coal, attacks on such facilities were ordered. While some attacks were successful, the aircraft and crew losses were far beyond what could be sustained and further attacks were limited to within range of supporting fighters In late 1943, the Pointblank directive specified the importance of reducing the ability of the Luftwaffe to influence the outcome of the cross-Channel invasion of France planned for mid-1944 by attacking the production of German fighter aircraft. Changes in tactics and availability of longer ranged fighters meant that the active Luftwaffe force was significantly diminished in early 1944 and the majority of the bombing offensive was directed instead against transport routes to prevent reinforcement of the defences there.\nEurope.\nThe Survey team was formed on 3 November 1944 by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson in response to a directive by President Roosevelt. The headquarters was in Teddington, England, while its teams assessed the damage that had been done targets as the allied armies took control of them. German records were analysed for information and Germans interrogated including the remaining senior officials in the Nazi regime. The survey was not able to assess the effects in Soviet controlled areas.\nThe sociologist Charles Fritz was part of the survey team before going on to become a significant theorist in disaster research. The Survey was tasked with producing an impartial report on the effects of the bombing against Nazi Germany, in order to:\n*aid the upcoming campaign against the Japanese home islands,\n*establish a basis for evaluating the importance and potentialities of air power as an instrument of military strategy,\n*provide data for planning the future development of the United States armed forces, and\n*determine future economic policies with respect to the national defense.\nThe report, along with some 200 supporting documents, was dated 30 September 1945. However it was not publicly released until 30 October 1945. The major conclusion of the report was that strategic bombing, particularly the destruction of the oil industry and truck manufacturing, had greatly contributed to the success of the Allies in World War II. However, despite the overall contribution of the bombing, the survey concluded that the impact of strategic bombing could not be separated from the general collapse of Germany in 1945.\nThe survey notes the effects on the German population: 3,600,000 \"dwelling units\", approximately 20% of total housing stock were \"destroyed or heavily damaged\" with an estimated 300,000 civilians killed and a further 780,000 wounded. About seven and half million were left homeless. The survey found that German morale deteriorated after attacks night bombing having a greater effect but although dissatisfaction with the war increased, under the German police state the will or means to oppose the leadership was absent.\nIn attacks on urban areas incendiary bombs, were ton for ton, four to five times as destructive as high explosive. German fire defences were inadequate and in cases of fire storms ineffective. While cities were provided with very strong bunkers\u2014resistant to direct hits\u2014as air raid shelters there was insufficient capacity (enough for 8 million) and casualties outside the shelters among those sheltering in basements and cellars was high.\nSuccesses.\nThe Survey noted several successes against crucial industrial areas:\nFailures.\nThe Survey also noted a number of failed or outcomes of limited success:\nThe German power network had not been attacked as the Allied assessment was that it was well organised and resistant to bombing, The survey found that power production and distribution was known by the Germans to be vulnerable and the survey opined that if it had been attacked it would have had a severe effect on materiel.\nOn German production.\nThe Survey concluded that one reason German production rose in so many areas was in part that the German economy did not go on a complete war footing until late 1942 and 1943. German strategy had been focussed on short decisive campaigns with no thought to a sustained war and consequent production. Up until then, factories had been on a single shift in many industries and the German economy was generally inefficient and not operating at full capacity. They also noted that women's participation in the manufacturing field remained low, lower than during World War I. The sections of the Survey regarding the German production system remain one of the best resources on the topic.\nGerman aircraft production increased as spare capacity in the industry was used, and dispersal of production increased resilience. The effective combat strength of the Luftwaffe did not increase despite the large numbers of aircraft available. In each of the three months at the start of 1944, over 1,000 fighters were claimed to have been shot down with a consequent loss of pilots. The survey did not identify what happened to the aircraft produced, the German \"air generals\" unable to explain it and it was supposed some were lost in transit or damaged on the ground with others unable to fly due to lack of fuel. By start of 1945 fighter production was curtailed due to lack of fuel for all except the new jet fighters.\nConclusions.\nIn respect of the bombing campaign over Europe, the survey identified several points:\nBut it warned that the \"No greater or more dangerous mistake could be made than to assume that the same policies and practices that won the War in Europe will be sufficient to win the next one-if there be another. The results achieved in Europe will not give the answer to future problems; they should be treated rather as signposts pointing the direction in which such answers may be found\".\nAnd concluded that \"The great lesson to be learned in the battered towns of England and the ruined cities of Germany is that the best way to win a war is to prevent it from occurring.\"\nPacific.\nAfter the European report was completed, as order by Truman in August 1945, the Survey turned its attention to the Pacific campaign. The report opens with a discussion of the Japanese strategic plans, which were based on an initial victory against the U.S. Navy which would upset any U.S. plans in the Pacific for an estimated 18 months to 2 years. During this time, they planned to \"speedily extract bauxite, oil, rubber and metals from Malaya, Burma, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and ship these materials to Japan for processing\". They also noted the belief that high casualties would not be accepted by the U.S. democracy, and that if the initial campaigns were successful, a negotiated peace was possible.\nThe survey identified that there was no civilian control of the military nor coordination between army and navy. The Japanese Army and Japanese Navy pursued their own foreign policy, independent of the government, according to their own requirements and capacities.\nAgainst shipping.\nThe Survey received sufficient information to detail every ship used by the Japanese during the war. They noted that the Imperial Japanese Navy began the war with 381 warships of approximately 1,271,000 tons, and completed another 816 ships of 1,048,000 tons during the war. Of these, 1,744,000 tons were sunk; \"625,000 tons were sunk by Navy and Marine aircraft, 375,000 tons by submarines, 183,000 tons by surface vessels, 55,000 tons by Army aircraft, and 65,000 tons by various agents\".\nThe Japanese merchant fleet was likewise destroyed. They started the war with 6,000,000 tons of merchant ships over 500 tons gross weight, which was alone not sufficient to provide for the wartime economy. Another 4,100,000 tons were constructed, captured or requisitioned. However, 8,900,000 tons were sunk, the vast majority of their fleet. Of this, \"54.7 percent of this total was attributable to submarines, 16.3 percent to carrier based planes, 10.2 percent to Army land-based planes and 4.3 percent to Navy and Marine land-based planes, 9.3 percent to mines (largely dropped by B-29s), less than 1 percent to surface gunfire and the balance of 4 percent to marine accidents.\" The Allied submarine campaign played the largest role, while naval mining by air in Operation Starvation also played a significant role, sinking or damaging more than 1,250,000 tons.\nAgainst the home islands.\nIn total, Allied aircraft dropped 656,400 tons of bombs on Japanese targets, 160,800 tons on the home islands. In Europe there were 2,770,000 tons dropped, and 1,415,745 tons on Germany specifically.\nAfter initial attacks from high-altitude precision bombing in which less than 10% of the bombs fell near their targets, Allied air forces switched to low-level night-time incendiary attacks against Japanese cities. On the night of 9\u201310 March 1945, of eastern Tokyo were burned out and tens of thousands were killed by U.S. Army Air Forces B-29s in Operation Meetinghouse. The Survey estimated that 88,000 died, while the Tokyo Fire Department estimated 97,000. Historian Richard Rhodes estimated more than 100,000, though journalist Mark Selden considered even this figure to be too low. In the following 10 days, a total of were destroyed. The Survey notes that these attacks had little direct effect on manufacturing, with factories that were hit by bombs having less drop off in production than those that did not. However, they also noted that production dropped by 54% during this period due to the effects of bombing: the killing, injuring and dehousing of the workers as well as the destruction of the transportation network. Further, many of the houses destroyed in the bombing contained small shops that made parts for factories, so the bombing of residential districts also destroyed this decentralized manufacturing. They noted a precipitous reduction in food availability as well, dropping from about 2,000 calories per day at the start of the war, to 1,680 for industrial workers at the height of the campaign, and less for non-essential workers. The Survey found that civilian morale dropped across the country from the bombings, not confined to areas that were bombed, but that Japanese dedication to their Emperor prevented morale from inducing a desire to surrender. The Survey stated that Japanese leaders were partially influenced by low civilian morale, but only to the extent that it warranted concerns about maintaining the ruling class.\nAtomic bombing.\nThe Survey dedicates a separate section of the reports to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nThey noted that although the blast wave was of about the same pressure as that of a high-explosive bomb, the duration of the effect was longer and that brick buildings were collapsed as far as at Hiroshima and at Nagasaki, while traditional wood houses were about the same, while reinforced-concrete structures suffered structural damage or collapse up to at Hiroshima and at Nagasaki.\nIn Hiroshima (August 6, 1945), approximately 60,000 to 70,000 people were killed, and 50,000 were injured. This is out of a pre-war population of about 340,000 that had been reduced to 245,000 through evacuations. Of approximately 90,000 buildings in the city, 65,000 were rendered unusable and almost all the remainder received at least light superficial damage.\nIn Nagasaki (August 9, 1945), approximately 40,000 persons were killed or missing and a like number injured. This was from a population of about 285,000, which had been reduced to around 230,000 by August 1945. Of the 52,000 residential buildings in Nagasaki, 14,000 were totally destroyed and a further 5,400 badly damaged. The vast majority of Nagasaki's industrial output was from the Mitsubishi factories and steel plant, which were 58 and 78 percent destroyed, respectively.\nUnlike Hiroshima, Nagasaki featured extensive bomb shelters in the form of tunnels cut into the sides of hills. \"...all the occupants back from the entrances survived, even in those tunnels almost directly under the explosion. Those not in a direct line with the entrance were uninjured. The tunnels had a capacity of roughly 100,000 persons. Had the proper alarm been sounded, and these tunnel shelters been filled to capacity, the loss of life in Nagasaki would have been substantially lower.\"\nThe report also concluded that: \"Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.\" Military historian Gian Gentile disputed this counterfactual, stating that testimony from Japanese leaders in USSBS interrogations supported the likelihood of Japan continuing the war beyond November and December 1945. Gentile stated that survey authors chose not to publish such evidence, as it challenged their conclusions.\nSurvey officers and controversy.\nThe Forward to the Summary Report for the Pacific War said, \"The United States Strategic Bombing Survey was established by the Secretary of War on 3 November 1944, pursuant to a directive from the late President Roosevelt. It was established for the purpose of conducting an impartial and expert study of the effects of our aerial attack on Germany, to be used in connection with air attacks on Japan and to establish a basis for evaluating air power as an instrument of military strategy, for planning the future development of the United States armed forces, and for determining future economic policies with respect to the national defense.\"\nThe surveys of both the European and Pacific Wars were managed by a team of a dozen civilians, support by \"300 civilians, 350 officers, and 500 enlisted men\", who followed closely the advance of the Allied forces, to search for written records of German decisions before they disappeared completely. Many of which were hidden, some even in coffins. Three of the leaders of the European team were replaced for the research in Japan, so the accompanying table of \"Officers of the Survey\" includes fifteen men. Those fifteen were selected as nonmilitary leaders, many of whom had even greater career success in supporting the development of strategic forces in the US military after the war than before.\nA review of a biography of Galbraith said that the survey \"found that, contrary to the claims of the U.S. Air Force [sic], \"Germany\u2019s war production rose for much of the period when American and British air attacks were at their fiercest. An obituary of Galbraith for the free market economist Foundation for Economic Education said 'Galbraith wrote wittily, \u201cNothing in World War II air operations was subject to such assault as open agricultural land.\u201d ... Galbraith\u2019s boss, George Ball ... found something equally disturbing about the firebombing of cities. The RAF\u2019s bombing of central Hamburg, for example, destroyed many lives and many businesses in the central city\u2014restaurants, cabarets, department stores, banks, and more. What were the newly unemployed waiters, bank clerks, and entertainers to do? That\u2019s right: seek jobs in the war plants on the edge of the cities \u201cto get the ration cards that the Nazis thoughtfully distributed to workers there.\u201d ... [T]he incredible destruction that the British and air forces wreaked on Germany, with the high loss of human life, didn\u2019t even have the intended effect of slowing Germany's war-production machine. Galbraith had to fight hard to have the report published without it being rewritten to hide the essential points. \u201cI defended it,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cwith a maximum of arrogance and a minimum of tact.\u201d ... Galbraith also visited Japan, where he analyzed the effect of the use of the atom bomb. He wrote: \"The bombs fell after the decision had been taken by the Japanese government to surrender. That the war had to be ended was agreed by at a meeting of key members of the Supreme War Direction Council with the Emperor on June 20, 1945, a full six weeks before the devastation of Hiroshima. The next steps took time. The Japanese government had the usual bureaucratic lags as between decision and action.\"'\nMore recent research.\nThe introduction to the summary report of air power in Europe noted that, \"Allied air power was called upon to play many roles-partner with the Navy over the sea lanes; partner with the Army in ground battle; partner with both on the invasion beaches; reconnaissance photographer for all; mover of troops and critical supplies; and attacker of the enemy's vital strength far behind the battle line.\" The summary report only discussed the latter: attacks on the enemy's vital strength far behind the battle line. Grant (2008) said, \"The survey began in no small part as a way to look at the major targeting controversies (rail vs. oil, and so forth) that had so often consumed the attention of top Allied planners and leaders. Its original intent was to sweep up lessons from Europe for use in the ongoing war with Japan.\"\nThe survey reported that the rate of production of war materials by Germany actually \"increased\" in response to strategic bombing by the Allies. Destroyed factories were quickly reconstituted in hardened sites. John Kenneth Galbraith, who was one of the \"Officers\" of the USSBS, wrote, \"Nothing in World War II air operations was subject to such assault as open agricultural land.\" When Allied bombs fell in cities like central Hamburg, they destroyed many lives and often many businesses in the central city\u2014restaurants, cabarets, department stores, banks, and more. The newly unemployed waiters, bank clerks, and entertainers took jobs in the war plants.\nIn other words, the Allies may have obtained roughly the same benefits from strategic bombing of \"the enemy's vital strength far behind the battle line\" as Hitler gained from The Blitz, namely nothing\u2014or worse: increasing their enemies' will to resist.\nPape (1996) studied the use of air power from the First World War into the 1990s. He concluded that air power could be effective in direct support of ground operations, but strategic bombing was a waste. Pape's conclusions were supported by a more formal quantitative analysis of a larger set of cases by Horowitz and Reiter (2001). The claims of Galbraith, Pape (1996) and Horowitz and Reiter (2001) are controversial.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68402", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68402", "title": "Chess opening", "text": "Initial moves of a chess game\nThe opening is the initial stage of a chess game. It usually consists of established theory. The other phases are the middlegame and the endgame. Many opening sequences, known as \"openings\", have standard names such as \"Sicilian Defense\". \"The Oxford Companion to Chess\" lists 1,327 named openings and variants, and there are many others with varying degrees of common usage.\nOpening moves that are considered standard are referred to as \"book moves\", or simply \"book\". When a game begins to deviate from known opening theory, the players are said to be \"out of book\". In some openings, book lines have been worked out for over 30 moves, such as some lines in the classical King's Indian Defense and in the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense.\nProfessional chess players spend years studying openings, and they continue doing so throughout their careers as opening theory continues to evolve. Players at the club level also study openings, but the importance of the opening phase is less there since games are rarely decided in the opening. The study of openings can become unbalanced if it is to the exclusion of tactical training and middlegame and endgame strategy.\nA new sequence of moves in the opening is referred to as a \"&lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;theoretical novelty&lt;/dfn&gt;\". When kept secret until used in a competitive game, it is often known as a \"prepared variation\", a powerful weapon in top-class competition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC_left/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAims of the opening.\nCommon aims in opening play.\nWhether they are trying to gain the upper hand as White, or to &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;equalize&lt;/dfn&gt; as Black or to create dynamic imbalances, players generally devote a lot of attention in the opening stages to the following strategies:\nApart from these ideas, other strategies used in the middlegame may also be carried out in the opening. These include preparing pawn breaks to create counterplay, creating weaknesses in the opponent's pawn structure, seizing control of key squares, making favorable exchanges of minor pieces (e.g. gaining the bishop pair), or gaining a space advantage, whether in the center or on the flanks.\nTop-level objectives.\nAt higher levels of competition, for many years the main objectives of opening play were to obtain a better position when playing as White and to equalize when playing as Black. The idea behind this is that playing first gives White a slight initial advantage; for example, White will be the first to attack if the game opens symmetrically (Black mirrors White's moves).\nSince about the 1950s another objective has gradually become more dominant. According to IM Jeremy Silman, the purpose of the opening is to create dynamic imbalances between the two sides, which will determine the character of the middlegame and the strategic plans chosen by both sides. For example, in the main line of the of the French Defense (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3), White will try to use their &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;bishop pair&lt;/dfn&gt; and &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;space&lt;/dfn&gt; advantage to mount an attack on Black's &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;kingside&lt;/dfn&gt;, while Black will seek simplifying exchanges (in particular, trading off one of White's bishops to blunt this advantage) and counterattack against the weakened pawns on White's &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;queenside&lt;/dfn&gt;; both players accept different combinations of advantages and disadvantages. This idea was a doctrine of the Soviet school of chess.\nA third objective, which is complementary to the previous ones and has been common since the 19th century, is to lure the opponent into positions with which the player is more familiar and comfortable than the opponent. This is usually done by transpositions, in which a game that apparently starts with one opening can reach a position that is normally produced by a different opening.\nOpening repertoires.\nMost players realize after a while that they play certain types of positions better than others, and that the amount of theory they can learn is limited. Therefore, most players specialize in certain openings where they know the theory and that lead to positions they favor. The set of openings a player has specialized in is called an opening repertoire. The main elements a player needs to consider in a repertoire are:\nA very narrow repertoire allows for deeper specialization but also makes a player less flexible to vary against different opponents. In addition, opponents may find it easier to prepare against a player with a narrow repertoire.\nThe main openings in a repertoire are usually reasonably sound; that is, they should lead to playable positions even against optimal counterplay. Unsound gambits are sometimes used as surprise weapons, but are unreliable for a stable repertoire. Repertoires often change as a player develops, and a player's advancement may be stifled if the opening repertoire does not evolve. Some openings that are effective against amateur players are less effective at the master level. For example, Black obtains active play in return for a pawn in the Benko Gambit; amateur players may have trouble defending against Black's activity, while masters are more skilled at defending and making use of the extra pawn. Some openings played between grandmasters are so complex and theoretical that amateur players will have trouble understanding them. An example is the Perenyi Attack of the Sicilian Defense (see diagram), which yields an immensely complicated and tactical position that even strong players have difficulty handling, and that is beyond the comprehension of most amateurs.\nOpening nomenclature.\nMajor changes in the rules of chess in the late fifteenth century increased the speed of the game, consequently emphasizing the importance of opening study. Thus, early chess books, such as the 1497 text of Luis Ramirez de Lucena, present opening analysis, as do Pedro Damiano (1512) and Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura (1561). Ruy L\u00f3pez's disagreement with Damiano regarding the merits of 2...Nc6 led to 3.Bb5 (after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6) being named for him as the Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening. Opening theory was studied more scientifically from the 1840s on, and many opening variations were discovered and named in this period and later.\nOpening nomenclature developed haphazardly, and most names are historical accidents not based on systematic principles. In the early 1930s, the nascent FIDE embarked on a project to standardize opening nomenclature, culminating in the publication of a short booklet in 1933, but this had little impact.\nThe oldest openings tend to be named for geographic places and people. Many openings are named after nationalities of players who advocated them, for example Indian, English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Scotch, Russian, Italian, Scandinavian and Sicilian, or places where important games featuring the opening were played such as Vienna, Berlin, and Wilkes-Barre. The Catalan System is named after the Catalonia region.\nChess players' names are the most common sources of opening names.\nThe name given to an opening is not always that of the first player to adopt it; often an opening is named for the player who was the first to popularize it or to publish analysis of it. Eponymic openings include the Ruy Lopez, Alekhine's Defense, , and the R\u00e9ti Opening. Some opening names honor two people, such as the Caro\u2013Kann and the Smith\u2013Morra.\nA few opening names are purely descriptive, such as Giuoco Piano (), Two Knights Defense, Four Knights Game and Bishop's Opening.\nSome openings have been given fanciful names, often names of animals. This practice became more common in the 20th century. By then, most of the more common and traditional sequences of opening moves had already been named, so these tend to be unusual or recently developed openings like the Orangutan, Hippopotamus, Elephant, Hedgehog, and, most recently, the Cow. A few are given humorous names, such as the Monkey's Bum and the Toilet Variation.\nOpening names usually include characterizing terms like \"opening\", \"variation\", \"defense\", \"gambit\", or \"attack\"; however, the terminology is inconsistent and imprecise, and is not a useful basis for classification. Broadly, these terms are used as follows:\nClassification of chess openings.\nChess openings are primarily categorized by move sequences. In the initial position, White has twenty legal moves. Of these, 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, and 1.c4 are by far the most popular as these moves do the most to promote rapid development and control of the center. A few other opening moves are considered reasonable but less consistent with opening principles than the four most popular moves. The Dunst Opening, 1.Nc3, develops a knight to a good square, but is somewhat inflexible because it blocks White's c-pawn; also, after 1...d5 the knight is liable to be driven to an inferior square by ...d4. (Note that after 1.Nf3 the analogous 1...e5? loses a pawn.) Bird's Opening, 1.f4, addresses center control but not development and weakens the king position slightly. The Sokolsky Opening 1.b4 and the King's and Queen's fianchettos: Larsen's Opening 1.b3 and 1.g3 aid development a bit, but they only address center control peripherally and are slower than the more popular openings. The eleven remaining possibilities are rarely played at the top levels of chess. Of these, the best are merely slow such as 1.c3, 1.d3, and 1.e3. Worse possibilities either ignore the center and development such as 1.a3, weaken White's position (for instance, 1.f3 and 1.g4), or place the knights on poor squares (1.Na3 and 1.Nh3).\nBlack has twenty complementary responses to White's opening move. Many of these are mirror images of the most popular first moves for White, but with one less tempo. Defenses beginning with 1...c6 and 1...e6, often followed by the center thrust 2...d5, are also popular. Defenses with an early ...d6 coupled with a kingside fianchetto are also commonly played.\nThe most important scheme of classifying chess openings for serious players is by \"ECO\" code, a series of 500 opening codes assigned by the \"Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings\". Although these codes are invaluable for the serious study of the chess opening, they are not very practical for a broad survey of the chess opening as the codes obscure common structural features between related openings.\nA simple descriptive categorization of the chess opening is king's pawn openings, queen's pawn openings, and others. Since these categories are still individually very large, it is common to divide each of them further. One reasonable way to group the openings is:\nThe Indian systems (1.d4 Nf6) are the most important of the semi-closed games, and warrant separate treatment.\nOpen games: 1.e4 e5.\nWhite starts by playing 1.e4 (moving their king pawn two spaces). This is the most popular opening move and it has many strengths\u2014it immediately works on controlling the center, and it activates two pieces (the queen and a bishop). The oldest openings in chess follow 1.e4. Bobby Fischer rated 1.e4 as \"Best by test.\" On the downside, 1.e4 places a pawn on an undefended square and weakens d4 and f4. If Black mirrors White's move and replies with 1...e5, the result is an open game.\nThe most popular second move for White is 2.Nf3 attacking Black's king pawn, preparing for a kingside castle, and anticipating the advance of the queen pawn to d4. Black's most common reply is 2...Nc6, which usually leads to the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5), Scotch Game (3.d4), or Italian Game (3.Bc4). If Black instead maintains symmetry and counterattacks White's center with 2...Nf6 then the Petrov's Defense results. The Philidor Defense (2...d6) is not popular in modern chess because it allows White an easy space advantage while Black's position remains cramped and passive, although solid. Other responses to 2.Nf3 are not seen in master play.\nThe most popular alternatives to 2.Nf3 are the Vienna Game (2.Nc3), the Bishop's Opening (2.Bc4), and the King's Gambit (2.f4). These openings have some similarities with each other, in particular the Bishop's Opening frequently transposes to variations of the Vienna Game. The King's Gambit was extremely popular in the 19th century. White sacrifices a pawn for quick development and to divert a black pawn from the center. The Vienna Game also frequently features attacks on the Black center by means of a f2\u2013f4 pawn advance.\nIn the Center Game (2.d4) White immediately opens the center but if the pawn is to be recovered after 2...exd4, White must contend with a slightly premature queen development after 3.Qxd4. An alternative is to sacrifice one or two pawns, for example in the Danish Gambit.\nMany other variations after 1.e4 e5 have been studied; see Open Game for details.\nSemi-open games: 1.e4, Black plays other than 1...e5.\nIn the semi-open games White plays 1.e4 and Black breaks symmetry immediately by replying with a move other than 1...e5. The most popular Black defense to 1.e4 is the Sicilian (1...c5), but the French (1...e6, normally followed by 2.d4 d5) and the Caro\u2013Kann (1...c6, normally followed by 2.d4 d5) are also very popular. The Pirc and the Modern are closely related openings that are also often seen, while the Alekhine and the Scandinavian have made occasional appearances in World Chess Championship games.\nThe Sicilian and French Defenses lead to unbalanced positions that can offer exciting play with both sides having chances to win. The Caro\u2013Kann Defense is solid as Black intends to use their c-pawn to support their center (1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5). Alekhine's, the Pirc and the Modern are hypermodern openings in which Black tempts White to build a large center with the goal of attacking it with pieces.\nOther semi-open games have been studied but are less common; see Semi-Open Game for details.\nClosed games: 1.d4 d5.\nThe openings classified as closed games begin 1.d4 d5. The move 1.d4 offers the same benefits to development and center control as does 1.e4, but unlike with King Pawn openings where the e4-pawn is undefended after the first move, the d4-pawn is protected by White's queen. This slight difference has a tremendous effect on the opening. For instance, whereas the King's Gambit is rarely played today at the highest levels of chess, the Queen's Gambit remains a popular weapon at all levels of play. Also, compared with the King Pawn openings, transpositions among variations are more common and critical in the closed games.\nThe most important closed openings are in the Queen's Gambit family (White plays 2.c4). The Queen's Gambit is somewhat misnamed, since White can always regain the offered pawn if desired. In the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Black plays ...dxc4, giving up the center for free development and the chance to try to give White an isolated queen pawn with a subsequent ...c5 and ...cxd4. White will get active pieces and possibilities for the attack. Black has two popular ways to decline the pawn, the Slav (2...c6) and the Queen's Gambit Declined (2...e6). Both of these moves lead to an immense forest of variations that can require a great deal of opening study to play well. Among the many possibilities in the Queen's Gambit Declined are the Orthodox Defense, Lasker's Defense, the Cambridge Springs Defense, the Tartakower Variation, and the Tarrasch and Semi-Tarrasch Defenses. Black replies to the Queen's Gambit other than 2...dxc4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 are uncommon.\nThe Colle System and Stonewall Attack are classified as queen's pawn games because White plays d4 but not c4. They are also examples of \"Systems\", rather than specific opening variations. White develops aiming for a particular formation without great concern over how Black chooses to defend. Both systems are popular with club players because they are easy to learn, but are rarely used by professionals because a well-prepared opponent playing Black can equalize fairly easily. The Stonewall is characterized by the White pawn formation on c3, d4, e3, and f4, and can be achieved by several move orders and against many different Black setups. The diagram positions and the move sequences given below are typical.\nOther closed openings have been studied but are less common; see Closed Game for details.\nIndian defenses: 1.d4 Nf6.\nThe Indian systems are asymmetrical defenses to 1.d4 that employ hypermodern chess strategy. Fianchettos are common in many of these openings. As with the closed games, transpositions are important and many of the Indian defenses can be reached by several different move orders. Although Indian defenses were championed in the 1920s by players in the hypermodern school, they were not fully accepted until Soviet players showed in the late 1940s that these systems are sound for Black. Since then, Indian defenses have been the most popular Black replies to 1.d4 because they offer an unbalanced game with chances for both sides. The usual White second move is 2.c4, grabbing a larger share of the center and allowing the move Nc3, to prepare for moving the e-pawn to e4 without blocking the c-pawn. Black's most popular replies are:\nAdvocated by Nimzowitsch as early as 1913, the Nimzo-Indian Defense was the first of the Indian systems to gain full acceptance. It remains one of the most popular and well-respected defenses to 1.d4 and White often adopts move orders designed to avoid it. Black attacks the center with pieces and is prepared to trade a bishop for a knight to weaken White's queenside with doubled pawns.\nThe King's Indian Defense is aggressive, somewhat risky, and generally indicates that Black will not be satisfied with a draw. Although it was played occasionally as early as the late 19th century, the King's Indian was considered inferior until the 1940s, when it was taken up by Bronstein, Boleslavsky, and Reshevsky. Despite being Fischer's favored defense to 1.d4, its popularity faded in the mid-1970s. Kasparov's successes with the defense restored the King's Indian to prominence in the 1980s.\nErnst Gr\u00fcnfeld debuted the Gr\u00fcnfeld Defense in 1922. Distinguished by the move 3...d5, Gr\u00fcnfeld intended it as an improvement to the King's Indian which was not considered entirely satisfactory at that time. The Gr\u00fcnfeld has been adopted by World Champions Smyslov, Fischer, and Kasparov.\nThe Queen's Indian Defense is considered solid, safe, and perhaps somewhat drawish. Black often chooses the Queen's Indian when White avoids the Nimzo-Indian by playing 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Nc3. Black constructs a sound position that makes no positional concessions, although sometimes it is difficult for Black to obtain good winning chances. Karpov was a leading expert in this opening.\nThe Modern Benoni is a risky attempt by Black to unbalance the position and gain active piece play at the cost of allowing White a pawn wedge at d5 and a central majority. Tal popularized the defense in the 1960s by winning several brilliant games with it, and Fischer occasionally adopted it, with good results, including a win in his 1972 world championship match against Boris Spassky. Often Black adopts a slightly different move order, playing 2...e6 before 3...c5 in order to avoid the sharpest lines for White.\nThe Benko Gambit is often played by strong players, and is very popular at lower levels. Black plays to open lines on the queenside where White will be subject to considerable pressure. If White accepts the gambit, Black's compensation is positional rather than tactical, and their initiative can last even after many piece exchanges and well into the endgame. White often chooses instead either to decline the gambit pawn or return it.\nThe Catalan Opening is characterized by White forming a pawn center at d4 and c4 and fianchettoing their king's bishop. It resembles a combination of the Queen's Gambit and R\u00e9ti Opening. Since the Catalan can be reached from many different move orders, (one Queen's Gambit Declined-like move sequence is 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.g3), it is sometimes called the Catalan System.\nThe most important Indian Defenses are listed below, but many others have been studied and played; see Indian Defense for details.\nOther Black responses to 1.d4.\nOf the defenses to 1.d4 other than 1...d5 and 1...Nf6, the most important are the Dutch Defense and the Benoni Defense.\nThe Dutch, an aggressive defense adopted for a time by World Champions Alekhine and Botvinnik, and played by both Botvinnik and challenger David Bronstein in their 1951 world championship match, is still played occasionally at the top level by Short and others. Another fairly common opening is the Benoni Defense, which may become very wild if it develops into the Modern Benoni, though other variations are more solid.\nSeveral other uncommon semi-closed openings have been named and studied, see Semi-Closed Game for details.\nFlank openings (including English, R\u00e9ti, Bird's, and White fianchettos).\nThe flank openings are the group of White openings typified by play on one or both flanks.\nWhite plays in hypermodern style, attacking the center from the flanks with pieces rather than occupying it with pawns. These openings are played often, and 1.Nf3 and 1.c4 trail only 1.e4 and 1.d4 in popularity as opening moves.\nIf White opens with 1.Nf3, the game often becomes one of the d4 openings (closed games or semi-closed games) by a different move order (called \"transposition\"), but unique openings such as the R\u00e9ti and King's Indian Attack are also common. The R\u00e9ti itself is characterized by White playing 1.Nf3, fianchettoing one or both bishops, and not playing an early d4 (which would generally transpose into one of the 1.d4 openings).\nThe King's Indian Attack (KIA) is a system of development that White may use in reply to almost any Black opening moves. The characteristic KIA setup is 1.Nf3, 2.g3, 3.Bg2, 4.0-0, 5.d3, 6.Nbd2, and 7.e4, although these moves may be played in several different orders. In fact, the KIA is often reached after 1.e4 when White uses it to respond to a Black attempt to play one of the semi-open games such as the Caro\u2013Kann, French, or Sicilian, or even the open games that usually follow 1.e4 e5. Its greatest appeal may be that by adopting a set pattern of development, White can avoid the large amount of opening study required to prepare to meet the many different possible Black replies to 1.e4.\nThe English Opening (1.c4) also frequently transposes into a d4 opening, but it can take on independent character as well including the Symmetrical Variation (1.c4 c5) and the Reversed Sicilian (1.c4 e5).\n1.g3, the King's Fianchetto Opening or Benko's Opening, received renewed attention after Pal Benko used it to defeat both Fischer and Tal in the 1962 Candidates Tournament in Cura\u00e7ao. It is flexible and usually transposes into a known opening such as the King's Indian Attack or Reti Opening.\nLarsen's Opening (1.b3) and the Sokolsky Opening (1.b4) are occasionally seen in grandmaster play.\nWith Bird's Opening (1.f4) White tries to get a strong grip on the e5-square.\nThe opening can resemble a Dutch Defense in reverse after 1.f4 d5, or Black may try to disrupt White by playing 1...e5!? (From's Gambit).\nUnusual first moves for White.\n1.e4 and 1.d4 remain the most popular first moves by White. 1.Nf3 and 1.c4 are also commonly played, and 1.g3 usually transposes into a standard line. 1.f4, 1.b3 and 1.b4 are occasionally seen at Grandmaster level. Other moves are not regarded as effective ways to exploit White's first-move advantage and thus are rarely played, though they are occasionally seen in on-line blitz games. Although some of these openings are not actually bad for White, each of the twelve remaining possible first moves suffers one or more of the following defects compared to the more popular choices:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
