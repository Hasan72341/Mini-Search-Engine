The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Since the formation of the club in 1881, when Newcastle East End absorbed the assets of Newcastle West End to become Newcastle United, the club has played its home matches at St James' Park. Located in the centre of Newcastle, it currently has a capacity of 52,305.\nThe club have been a member of the Premier League for all but three years of the competition's history, spending 93 seasons in the top flight as of May 2025, and have never dropped below English football's second tier since joining the Football League in 1893. The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby Sunderland. Newcastle have won four League titles, six FA Cups, one League Cup and an FA Charity Shield, as well as the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the ninth-highest total of trophies won by an English club. The club's most successful period was between 1904 and 1910, when they won an FA Cup and three of their League titles. More recently the club have been League or FA Cup runners-up on four occasions in the 1990s. Newcastle were relegated in 2009, and again in 2016. The club won promotion at the first time of asking each time, returning to the Premier League, as Championship winners, in 2010 and 2017. In October 2021, a consortium led by the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, became majority owners of Newcastle United. In 2025, the club won the 2024\u201325 EFL Cup, the club's first trophy in nearly 56 years, and their first domestic trophy since 1955.\nNewcastle's traditional kit colours are black-and-white striped shirts, black shorts and black or white socks. Their crest has elements of the city coat of arms, which features two grey hippocamps. Before each home game, the team enters the field to \"\", with \"Blaydon Races\" also being sung during games.\nHistory.\n1881\u20131903: Formation and early history.\nThe first record of football being played on Tyneside dates from 3 March 1877 at Elswick Rugby Club. Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of Byker in November 1881. This team was renamed Newcastle East End F.C. in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in Stanley, County Durham. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, Newcastle West End F.C. formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886 moved into St James' Park. The two clubs became rivals in the Northern League. In 1889, Newcastle East End became a professional team, before becoming a limited company the following March. Newcastle West End, on the other hand, was in serious financial trouble and approached East End with a view to a takeover. Newcastle West End was eventually dissolved, and a number of its players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End, with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James' Park in May 1892.\nWith only one senior club in the city for fans to support, development of the club was much more rapid. Despite being refused entry to the Football League's First Division at the start of the 1892\u201393 season, they were invited to play in their new Second Division. However, with no big names playing in the Second Division, they turned down the offer and remained in the Northern League, stating \"gates would not meet the heavy expenses incurred for travelling\". In a bid to start drawing larger crowds, Newcastle East End decided to adopt a new name in recognition of the merger. Suggested names included 1892 Newcastle, Newcastle Rangers, Newcastle City and City of Newcastle, but Newcastle United was decided upon on 9 December 1892, to signify the unification of the two teams. The name change was accepted by the Football Association on 22 December, but the club was not legally constituted as Newcastle United Football Club Co. Ltd. until 6 September 1895. At the start of the 1893\u201394 season, Newcastle United were once again refused entry to the First Division and so joined the Second Division, along with Liverpool and Woolwich Arsenal. They played their first competitive match in the division that September against Woolwich Arsenal, with a score of 2\u20132.\nTurnstile numbers were still low, and the club published a statement stating, \"The Newcastle public do not deserve to be catered for as far as professional football is concerned\". However, eventually figures picked up by 1895\u201396, when 14,000 fans watched the team play Bury. That season Frank Watt became secretary of the club, and he was instrumental in promotion to the First Division for the 1898\u201399 season. However, they lost their first game 4\u20132 at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers and finished their first season in 13th place.\n1903\u20131937: First glory years and war years.\nIn 1903\u201304, the club built up a promising squad of players, and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade, the team known for their \"artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing\". Long after his retirement, Peter McWilliam, the team's defender at the time, said, \"The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and furthermore, beat them at a trot\". Newcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s; 1904\u201305, 1906\u201307 and 1908\u201309. In 1904\u201305, they nearly did the double, losing to Aston Villa in the 1905 FA Cup Final. They were beaten again the following year by Everton in the 1906 FA Cup Final. They reached the final again in 1908 where they lost to Wolverhampton Wanderers. They finally won the FA Cup in 1910 when they beat Barnsley in the final. They lost again the following year in the final against Bradford City.\nThe team returned to the FA Cup final in 1924, in the second final held at the then new Wembley Stadium. They beat Aston Villa, winning the club's second FA Cup. Three years later, they won the First Division championship a fourth time in 1926\u201327, with Hughie Gallacher, one of the most prolific goal scorers in the club's history, captaining the team. Other key players in this period were Neil Harris, Stan Seymour and Frank Hudspeth. In 1930, Newcastle United came close to relegation, and at the end of the season Gallacher left the club for Chelsea, and at the same time Andy Cunningham became the club's first team manager. In 1931\u201332, the club won the FA Cup a third time. However, a couple of years later, at the end of the 1933\u201334 season, the team were relegated to the Second Division after 35 seasons in the top. Cunningham left as manager and Tom Mather took over.\n1937\u20131969: Post-war success.\nThe club found it difficult to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the 1937\u201338 season, when they were spared on goal average. However, when World War II broke out in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in Jackie Milburn, Tommy Walker and Bobby Cowell. They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the 1947\u201348 season. During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup three times in five years, beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952 and Manchester City in 1955. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960\u201361 season under the management of Charlie Mitten. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964\u201365 season after winning the Second Division title. Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967\u201368 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 6\u20132 over two legs against Hungary's \u00dajpest in the final.\n1969\u20131992: Bouncing between divisions.\nHarvey bought striker Malcolm Macdonald in the summer of 1971, for a club record transfer fee of \u00a3180,000 (equivalent to \u00a32,265,000 in 2021). He was an impressive goal scorer, who led United's attack to Wembley in their 1974 FA Cup Final defeat at the hands of Liverpool. The club also had back to back triumphs in the Texaco Cup in 1974 and 1975. Harvey left the club in 1975, with Gordon Lee brought in to replace him. Lee took the team to the 1976 Football League Cup Final against Manchester City, but failed to bring the trophy back to Tyneside. However, he sold Macdonald to Arsenal at the end of the season, a decision of which Macdonald later said \"I loved Newcastle, until Gordon Lee took over\". Lee left for Everton in 1977, and was replaced by Richard Dinnis.\nUnited dropped once again to the Second Division at the end of the 1977\u201378 season. Dinnis was replaced by Bill McGarry, and then he was replaced by Arthur Cox. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division at the end of the 1983\u201384 season, with players such as Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle and ex-England captain Kevin Keegan the fulcrum of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for Derby County and Keegan retired. With managers such as Jack Charlton and then Willie McFaul, Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as Waddle, Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne were sold, and the team was relegated once more in the 1988\u201389 season. McFaul left the managerial post, and was replaced by Jim Smith. Smith left at the start of the 1991\u201392 season and the board appointed Osvaldo Ardiles his replacement.\nJohn Hall became the club's chairman in 1992, and replaced Ardiles with Keegan, who managed to save the team from relegation to the Third Division. Keegan was given more money for players, buying Rob Lee, Paul Bracewell and Barry Venison. The club won the First Division championship at the end of the 1992\u201393 season, earning promotion to the Premier League.\n1993\u20132007: Into the Premier League.\nAt the end of their first year, 1993\u201394 season, back in the top flight they finished in third, their highest league finish since 1927. The attacking philosophy of Keegan led to the team being labelled \"The Entertainers\" by Sky Sports.\nKeegan took Newcastle to two consecutive runners-up finishes in the league in 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397, coming very close to winning the title in the former season which included a 4\u20133 game against Liverpool at Anfield \u2013 often considered the greatest game in Premier League history \u2013 which ended with a defining image of the Premier League with Keegan slumped over the advertising hoarding. The success of the team was in part due to the attacking talent of players like David Ginola, Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then world record fee of \u00a315\u00a0million.\nKeegan left Newcastle in January 1997 and was replaced by Kenny Dalglish, however the club endured a largely unsuccessful season with a 13th-place finish in the 1997\u201398 FA Premier League, failure to progress beyond the group stages of the 1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League despite beating Barcelona and group winners Dynamo Kyiv at home as well as coming from 2\u20130 down to draw 2\u20132 with Valeriy Lobanovskyi's team in Ukraine and defeat in the 1998 FA Cup Final. Dalglish was replaced as manager early in the following season by Ruud Gullit. The club once again finished 13th in the league and lost the 1999 FA Cup Final. Gullit fell into disagreements with the squad and chairman Freddy Shepherd, and quit the club five games into the 1999\u20132000 season with the team bottom of the table to be replaced by Bobby Robson. In 1999 Newcastle was 5th-highest revenue producing club in the world; second in England behind Manchester United.\nA title challenge emerged during the 2001\u201302 season, and Newcastle's fourth-place finish saw them qualify for the UEFA Champions League. The following season, Robson guided the team to another title challenge and finished third in the League, and the second group stage of the Champions League, after being the first team to have progressed past the first group stage after losing their first three games. Newcastle finished fifth in the league at the end of the 2003\u201304 season, and exited the Champions League in the qualifying rounds, but despite this Robson was sacked in August 2004 following a series of disagreements with the club.\nGraeme Souness was brought in as manager early in the 2004\u201305 season. In his time at the helm, he broke the club's transfer record by signing Michael Owen for \u00a316.8\u00a0million. Souness also took Newcastle to the quarter-finals of the 2004\u201305 UEFA Cup with Alan Shearer winning the tournament's golden boot as well. However, he was sacked in February 2006 after a bad start to the club's 2005\u201306 season. Glenn Roeder took over, initially on a temporary basis, before being appointed full-time manager at the end of the season. Shearer retired at the end of the 2005\u201306 season as the club's all-time record goal scorer, with 206 goals.\nIn 2006, Newcastle won the Intertoto Cup for the first time in their history, and their first European trophy since 1973.\nDespite finishing the 2005\u201306 season in seventh, Roeder's fortunes changed in the 2006\u201307 season, with a terrible injury run to the senior squad, and he left the club by mutual consent on 6 May 2007. After the 2006\u201307 season, and inside the Premier League era, Newcastle United were now the fifth most successful Premiership club in terms of points gained.\nSam Allardyce was appointed Roeder's replacement as manager on 15 May 2007.\n2007\u20132021: Mike Ashley era.\nOn 7 June, Freddy Shepherd's final shares in the club were sold to Mike Ashley and Shepherd was replaced as chairman by Chris Mort on 25 July. Ashley then announced he would be delisting the club from the London Stock Exchange upon completion of the takeover. The club officially ceased trading on the Stock Exchange as of 8am on 18 July 2007 at 5p a share.\nAllardyce departed the club on in January 2008 by mutual consent after a bad start to the 2007\u201308 season, and Kevin Keegan was reappointed as Newcastle manager. Mort stepped down as chairman in June and was replaced by Derek Llambias, a long-term associate of Ashley. Newcastle finished the 2007\u201308 season in 12th place, but as the season drew to a close, Keegan publicly criticised the board, stating they were not providing the team enough financial support.\nIn September 2008, Keegan resigned as manager, stating: \"It's my opinion that a manager must have the right to manage and that clubs should not impose upon any manager any player that he does not want\". Former Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear was appointed as his replacement, but in February 2009, due to his heart surgery, Alan Shearer was appointed interim manager in his absence. Under Shearer, the club were relegated to the Championship at the end of the 2008\u201309 season, the first time the club had left the Premier League since joining it in 1993.\nFollowing their relegation, the club was put up for sale in June 2009, with an asking price of \u00a3100\u00a0million. Chris Hughton was given the manager job on a caretaker basis before taking over full-time on 27 October 2009. On the same day, Ashley announced that the club was no longer for sale.\nHughton led Newcastle to win the 2009\u201310 Championship, securing automatic promotion on 5 April 2010 with five games remaining, and securing the title on 19 April; Newcastle were promoted back to the Premier League after just one season away.\nUnder Hughton, Newcastle enjoyed a strong start to the 2010\u201311 season, but he was sacked on 6 December 2010. The club's board stated that they felt \"an individual with more managerial experience [was] needed to take the club forward.\" Three days later, Alan Pardew was appointed as manager with a five-and-a-half-year contract. Despite some turbulence, Newcastle were able to finish 12th at the end of the season, with one particular highlight being a 4\u20134 home draw against Arsenal that saw Newcastle come back from four goals down to claim a point.\nThe start of the 2011\u201312 season was very successful as they went on to enjoy one of their strongest openings to a season, playing 11 consecutive games unbeaten. Newcastle eventually secured a place in the 2012\u201313 Europa League with a fifth-place finish, their highest league position since the Bobby Robson days. Further honours were to come as Pardew won both the Premier League Manager of the Season and the LMA Manager of the Year awards.\nIn the following season Newcastle made few acquisitions in the summer and suffered injuries over the season. As a result, the first half of the season was marred by a run of 10 losses in 13 games, which saw the club sink near the relegation zone. The Europa League campaign was largely successful with the team making the quarter-finals before bowing out to eventual finalists Benfica. Domestically, Newcastle struggled, and stayed up after a 2\u20131 victory over already-relegated Queens Park Rangers on the penultimate game of the season.\nThe 2014\u201315 season saw Newcastle fail to win any of their first seven games, prompting fans to start a campaign to get Pardew sacked as manager before an upturn in form saw them climb to fifth in the table. Pardew left for Crystal Palace in December. On 26 January 2015, his assistant John Carver was put in charge for the remainder of the season but came close to relegation, staying up on the final day with a 2\u20130 home win against West Ham, with Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez, who beat testicular cancer earlier in the season, scoring the team's second goal.\nOn 9 June 2015, Carver was sacked and replaced by Steve McClaren the following day. On 11 March 2016, McClaren was sacked after nine months as manager, with Newcastle in 19th place in the Premier League and the club having won just six of 28 Premier League games during his time at the club. He was replaced by Spaniard Rafael Ben\u00edtez on the same day, who signed a three-year deal, but was not able to prevent the club from being relegated for the second time under Ashley's ownership.\nNewcastle returned to the Premier League at the first attempt, winning the Championship title in May 2017. In October, Mike Ashley put Newcastle United up for sale for the second time. The team finished the season with a 3\u20130 win over the previous year's champions Chelsea, finishing tenth in the league, their highest finish in four years. The following season saw a 13th-place finish, despite being in the relegation zone in January. Ashley came under increased scrutiny for his lack of investment in the squad and apparent focus on other business ventures. Benitez left his position on 30 June 2019 after rejecting a new contract.\nOn 17 July 2019, former Sunderland manager Steve Bruce was appointed as manager on a three-year contract. Bruce oversaw 13th and 12th-placed finishes during his two full seasons in charge.\n2021\u2013present: PIF era.\nOn 7 October 2021, after 14 years as owner, Ashley sold the club to a new consortium for a reported \u00a3305 million. The consortium was made up of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, RB Sports &amp; Media and PCP Capital Partners. On 20 October, Bruce left his position by mutual consent, after receiving a reported \u00a38\u00a0million payout. Eddie Howe was appointed as Bruce's replacement on 8 November 2021. Howe guided the club to an 11th-place finish after a run of 12 wins in their final 18 games, and Newcastle became the first team in Premier League history to avoid relegation after failing to win any of their first 14 games.\nOn 21 August 2022, Newcastle United Women moved into the club's ownership for the first time, after a formal restructuring. At the end of the 2022\u201323 season, the club sealed qualification for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years. The season was the subject of the Amazon Prime Video documentary \"We Are Newcastle United\". In the 2023\u201324 season, Newcastle were eliminated in the group stages of the Champions League.\nOn 16 March 2025, Newcastle United won their first major domestic trophy since 1955 after beating Liverpool 2\u20131 in the 2025 EFL Cup final through goals from Dan Burn and Alexander Isak.\nOn 5 September 2025, Newcastle United announced the appointment of David Hopkinson as Chief Executive Officer. Hopkinson, who previously held senior roles at Real Madrid, Madison Square Garden Sports, and Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, succeeded Darren Eales. His mandate includes strengthening the club\u2019s commercial strategy, expanding its global profile, and overseeing long-term infrastructure projects.\nClub identity.\n Newcastle United's original colours, worn until 1894\nThe club's home colours are a black and white striped shirt. Shorts and socks are usually black with white trim, though white socks are sometimes worn. Newcastle's colours at the outset were generally the home kit of Newcastle East End, comprising plain red shirts with white shorts and red socks. In 1894, the club adopted the black and white striped shirts, which had been used as the reserve team's colours. These colours were chosen for the senior team because they were not associated with either of the two teams United were merged from. They played in grey shorts until 1897, and between 1897 and 1921, they played in blue shorts before adopting the black shorts they play in now.\nUnited's away colours have changed a number of times over the years. They played in white shirts and black shorts from 1914 until 1961, and then white shorts until 1966. They then played in yellow shirts and blue shorts for the 1967\u201368 season, but from 1969 to 1974 played in all red with an all blue third kit. In 1974, they returned to a yellow shirt, which they played with various coloured shorts until 1983. They played in all grey from 1983 to 1988, before once again returning to the yellow kit until 1993. Since 1995, the away kit has changed frequently and has not been the same for more than a single season.\nThe current club crest was first used in the 1988\u201389 season. The crest includes elements from the coat of arms of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne\u00a0\u2013 the two sea horses representing Tyneside's strong connections with the sea, the castle representing the city's keep. The city's coat of arms were first embroidered on the team's shirts in 1969 and worn as standard until 1976. A scroll at the bottom featured the city's motto in Latin; \"fortiter defendit triumphans\" which translates into English as \"triumphing by brave defence\". From 1976 until 1983, the club wore a specific badge which was developed to wear in place of the city's coat of arms. The design was of a circular shape, which featured the club's name in full, it contained a magpie standing in front of the River Tyne with the historic keep of Newcastle in the background. A more simplistic design followed in 1983, featuring the initials of the club's name, NUFC with the small magpie used in the previous crest within the horizontally laid \"C\"; this logo was relatively short lived and was discontinued after 1988.\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors.\nIn May 2013, Newcastle announced a sponsorship which featured the Wonga.com logo on kits. This attracted criticism from many Newcastle supporters. In July 2013, it was reported that Newcastle striker and practising Muslim Papiss Ciss\u00e9 refused to wear any official kit or training wear with reference to Wonga.com as it did not align with his religious beliefs. The matter was later resolved.\nOn 15 May 2017, the home shirt for the 2017\u201318 season was revealed, featuring the logo of new sponsors Fun88. The shirt was shown to include a gold and silver commemorative crest to mark the club's 125th football season, based on the city's coat of arms. It was also announced that the kit would feature red numbers for the first time since the 1992\u201393 season.\nNewcastle United's current kit sponsor is Sela, a deal that started in 2023. Previous kit sponsors include Newcastle Breweries (1980\u20131986), Greenall's Beers (1986\u20131990), McEwan's Lager and Newcastle Brown Ale (1990\u20132000), NTL (2000\u20132003), Northern Rock (2003\u20132012), Virgin Money (2012\u20132013), Wonga.com (2013\u20132017), and Fun88 (2017\u20132023).\nNewcastle United's current kit manufacturer is Adidas, in a deal that started in 2024. Previous kit manufacturers include Bukta (1974\u20131975, 1976\u20131980), Umbro (1975\u20131976, 1980\u20131993), Asics (1993\u20131995), Adidas (1995\u20132010, 2024\u2013present), Puma (2010\u20132021), and Castore (2021\u20132024).\nNewcastle United's current sleeve sponsor is Noon, in a deal that started in 2022. Previous sleeve sponsors include MRF Tyres (2017\u20132018), StormGain (2019\u20132020), ICM.com (2020\u20132021), and Kayak (2021\u20132022).\nOther current team sponsors include Fun88, BetMGM, Carling, Monster Energy, Sportsbet.io, InPost, Fenwick and Saudia.\nStadium.\nThroughout Newcastle United's history, their home venue has been St James' Park, the oldest and largest football stadium in North East England, as well as the seventh-largest football stadium in the Premier League. It has hosted 11 international football matches at senior level, the first in 1901 and the most recent in 2024. It was used as a venue for both the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2015 Rugby World Cup and has been a regular venue for Rugby League's Magic Weekend, attracting record crowds.\nFootball had been played at St James' Park as early as 1880, the ground being occupied by Newcastle Rangers, before becoming the home of Newcastle West End in 1886. Its lease was then bought by Newcastle East End in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At the turn of the 20th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity all-seater stadium. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and Sir John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,305.\nIn October 2009, Ashley announced that he planned to lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium. This name was only supposed to be used until the end of the 2009\u201310 season, but lasted until November 2011. On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this was an interim name to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium. The company, owned by Ashley, was not paying anything for the deal. In October 2012, payday loan company Wonga.com became Newcastle United's main commercial sponsor and purchased the stadium naming rights but restored the St James' Park name.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 22/23 season, a small allocation of seating in between the East stand and Gallowgate end were converted into Safe standing zones meaning that for the first time since 1993 St James' Park is no longer an all-seater stadium much like many other Premier League grounds.\nIn July 2023 it was confirmed that following the re-purchase of Strawberry Place, plans for a new fan zone outside the Gallowgate End had been submitted. It will be built in partnership with Stack and Sela (The clubs front of shirt sponsor).\nSince 1982, the stadium has been served by St James Metro station on the Tyne and Wear Metro. The station is decorated in a black and white colour scheme, with archive photographs of the club's players.\nThe club's current training ground is the Newcastle United Training Centre, located at Darsley Park, which is north of the city at Benton. The facility was opened in July 2003.\nFollowing the club's ownership takeover in 2021, the Training Centre was renovated extensively, with a new reception area, restaurant, players' lounge, presentation suite, offices, medical facility, dressing room and hydrotherapy unit all constructed.\nOwnership.\nNewcastle United was set up as a private company limited by shares on 6 September 1895. The club traded in this way for much of the 20th century, dominated by McKeag, Westwood and Seymour family ownership.\nJohn Hall, who bought 79.2% of the club for \u00a33\u00a0million in 1991, floated the club on the stock exchange as a public limited company in April 1997. After the float 57% of the shares were held by John Hall and his family, and a minority were held by his business partner Freddy Shepherd.\nIn December 1998, after buying a 6.3% stake in the club for \u00a310\u00a0million, the media group NTL had considered a full takeover of the club. This was later dropped after the Competition Commission, established in April 1999, expressed concerns about football clubs being owned by media companies.\nIn 2007, businessman Mike Ashley purchased the combined stakes of both Douglas and John Hall, 41% share in the club, through a holding company St James Holdings, with a view to buy the rest. Upon purchasing this share, he appointed Chris Mort as chairman, while gaining more shares, owning 93.19% of the club by 29 June 2007. This figure reached 95% on 11 July 2007, forcing the remaining shareholders to sell their shares.\nAfter completing the purchase of the club, Ashley had announced that he planned to sell the club on three occasions. The first occurred after fan protests over the resignation of Kevin Keegan in September 2008, when Ashley stated, \"I have listened to you. You want me out. That is what I am now trying to do.\" However, he took it off the market on 28 December 2008 after being unable to find a buyer. On 31 May 2009, it was reported that Ashley was attempting to sell the club again. On 8 June 2009, Ashley confirmed that the club was up for sale at an asking price of \u00a3100\u00a0million. By the end of August 2009, the club was back off the market. On 16 October 2017, Newcastle United announced that Ashley had once again put the club up for sale, reporting that he hoped that a deal could be concluded by Christmas 2017.\nSaudi-led takeover.\nIn April 2020, it was widely reported that a consortium consisting of Public Investment Fund, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports &amp; Media, was finalising an offer to acquire Newcastle United. The proposed sale prompted concerns and criticism, such as arguments considering it sportwashing of Saudi Arabia's human rights record, as well as ongoing piracy of sports broadcasts in the region.\nIn May 2020, two Conservative MPs called upon the government to scrutinise aspects of the deal, with Karl McCartney calling for the sale to be blocked, and Giles Watling calling upon the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to hold an oral evidence session regarding sports piracy in Saudi Arabia. In May 2020, \"The Guardian\" reported that the Premier League had obtained a report from the World Trade Organization (published publicly the following month), which contained evidence that Saudi nationals had backed beoutQ \u2013 a pirate broadcaster carrying the beIN Sports networks in the region since the Qatar diplomatic crisis. In June 2020, \"The Guardian\" reported that Richard Masters, who appeared in front of the DCMS, had hinted the possible takeover of Newcastle United was close to completion. The MPs warned it would be humiliating to allow a Saudi Arabian consortium to take charge given the country's record on piracy and human rights.\nIn July 2020, \"The Guardian\" reported that Saudi Arabia's decision to ban beIN Sports broadcast from operating in the nation had further complicated the takeover of Newcastle United. On 30 July 2020, Saudi Arabia announced its withdrawal from the Newcastle deal, stating \"with a deep appreciation for the Newcastle community and the significance of its football club, we have come to the decision to withdraw our interest in acquiring Newcastle United Football Club\". The group also stated that the \"prolonged process\" was a major factor in them pulling out. The collapse of the takeover was met with widespread criticism from Newcastle fans, with Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah accusing the Premier League of treating fans of the club with \"contempt\" and subsequently wrote to Masters for an explanation.\nDespite the consortium's withdrawal, disputes over the takeover continued. On 9 September 2020, Newcastle United released a statement claiming that the Premier League had officially rejected the takeover by the consortium and accused Masters and the Premier League board of \"[not] acting appropriately in relation to [the takeover]\", while stating that the club would be considering any relevant legal action. The Premier League strongly denied this in a statement released the next day, expressing \"surprise\" and \"disappointment\" at Newcastle's statement.\nOn 7 October 2021, the Public Investment Fund, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports &amp; Media confirmed that they had officially completed the acquisition of Newcastle United. An investigation in May 2022 by \"The Guardian\" claimed that the British government of Boris Johnson was involved in Saudi Arabia's takeover of Newcastle United. In April 2021, it was revealed that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had warned Johnson in a text message, stating that the Premier League's decision would impact on UK-Saudi diplomatic relations. Following the warning, Johnson had appointed his special envoy for the Gulf, Edward Lister, to take up the case. It was later reported that Johnson's extensive efforts also involved the Minister of Investment Gerry Grimstone, who held discussions with the Premier League chairman Gary Hoffman and Saudi representatives well-connected with MBS' office. The UK Government and Johnson said they were not involved in the Saudi takeover. After Premier League's approval, Hoffman informed the 20 English Football clubs that there was extensive pressure from the government; he said the decision was not influenced by it. A separate report revealed that despite the US' conclusion that Jamal Khashoggi's assassination was ordered by Saudi's Prince Mohammed, he was able to avert the owners' and directors' test of the Premier League. Human Rights Watch (HRW), a campaign group, has accused the Saudi government of using football, motor racing, and golf for sportswashing. As reported by Josh Noble, a sports editor for the \"Financial Times\", HRW defines sportswashing as \"an effort to distract from its serious human rights abuses by taking over events that celebrate human achievement\".\nThe Premier League had agreed to the Saudi PIF takeover of Newcastle, following \"legally-binding assurances\" that the Saudi state will have no control over the club. However, in February 2023, court documents published in the US claimed that the PIF is \"a sovereign instrumentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\", and that the PIF governor and Newcastle's chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan is \"a sitting minister of the Saudi government\". Following that, Amnesty international, which already criticised Saudi of sportswashing, pushed Premier League to re-examine the Saudi PIF takeover of the club. In March 2023, Richard Masters expressed his doubts to a committee of lawmakers, stating that he was unsure if Premier League had launched the investigation. In October 2024, the Premier League said it will not review the Saudi deal.\nSocial responsibility.\nNewcastle United Foundation is an independent charity established by the club in summer 2008. It seeks to encourage learning and promote healthy living amongst disadvantaged children, young people and families in the North East region, as well as promoting equality and diversity. \nIn December 2012, the club announced that it had become the world's first carbon positive football club.\nSupporters and rivalries.\nNewcastle United's supporters are known for being some of the most passionate football fans in the world. In 2016, supporters founded the Wor Flags group, which continues to produce large and unique flag, banner and tifo displays at St James' Park. The group is entirely fan-funded.\nThe club's strongest supporter base is in the North East, but supporters' clubs can be found in many countries across the world. The club's nickname is The Magpies, while the club's supporters are also known as the \"Geordies\" or the \"Toon Army\". The name \"Toon\" originates from the Geordie pronunciation of town. In a 2004 survey by Co-operative Financial Services, it was found that Newcastle United topped the league table for the cost incurred and distance travelled by Newcastle-based fans wishing to travel to every Premier League away game. The total distance travelled for a fan to attend every away game from Newcastle was found to be equivalent to a round-the-world trip. In the 2016\u201317 season, while in the second tier, Newcastle recorded an average attendance of 51,106.\nThe club's supporters publish a number of fanzines including \"True Faith\" and \"The Mag\", along with NUFC.com, which was established in 1996. They set up Newcastle United Supporters Trust in September 2008, aiming to \"represent the broad church of Newcastle United's support\". In addition to the usual English football chants, Newcastle's supporters sing the traditional Tyneside song \"Blaydon Races\". Prior to each home game the team enters the field to \"\", the closing song of the 1983 film \"Local Hero\", written by Newcastle supporter and Dire Straits founder Mark Knopfler.\nIn 1998, The Police founder and Newcastle fan Sting wrote a song in support of Newcastle, called \"Black and White Army (Bringing The Pride Back Home)\" (sung by Ryan Molloy). In 2015, some Newcastle fans boycotted games in protest of club management by Mike Ashley, and they were supported by famous club fans like Sting and Jimmy Nail.\nTraditionally, Newcastle's main rivals are Sunderland, against whom the Tyne\u2013Wear derby is competed, along with Middlesbrough, with whom they compete in the Tyne-Tees derby.\nRecords.\nNewcastle United have spent ninty-four seasons in the top-flight, they are eighth in the all-time Premier League table and have the ninth-highest total of major honours won by an English club with eleven wins. Jimmy Lawrence holds the record for the most appearances for the club, having made 496 first team appearances between 1904 and 1921. Alan Shearer is the club\u2019s record goal scorer, scoring 206 goals in all competitions between 1996 and 2006. Andy Cole holds the record for the most goals scored in a season: 41 in the 1993\u201394 season in the Premier League. Shay Given is the most capped international for the club, with 134 appearances for the Republic of Ireland.\nNewcastle United's widest victory margin in the league was a 13\u20130 win against Newport County in the Second Division in 1946. Their heaviest defeat in the league was 9\u20130 against Burton Wanderers in the Second Division in 1895.\nNewcastle's record home attendance is 68,386 for a First Division match against Chelsea on 3 September 1930. The club's highest attendance in the Premier League is 52,389, in a match against Manchester City on 6 May 2012. The highest transfer fee received for a Newcastle player is \u00a3125\u00a0million, from Liverpool for Alexander Isak in September 2025, while the most spent by the club on a player is \u00a369\u00a0million for forward Nick Woltemade from Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart in August 2025.\n \"As of 1 September 2025\"&lt;ref name=\"2024/25 Updated Premier League squad lists\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nPlayers.\nFirst-team squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnder-21s and Academy.\nThe following Under-21 players have previously been named in a Newcastle United squad for a competitive match:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSource: https://\nManagement.\nBackroom staff.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSource: \nBoard of directors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSource: \nSource:\nHonours.\nLeague\nCup\nMinor titles\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Certain digraphs were changed over time; for example, the digraph for the Soviet Union changed at least twice.\nThe rest is either an arbitrary dictionary word, or occasionally the digraph and the cryptonym combine to form a dictionary word (e.g., AEROPLANE) or can be read out as a simple phrase (e.g., WIBOTHER, read as \"Why bother!\"). Cryptonyms are sometimes written with a slash after the digraph, e.g., ZR/RIFLE, and sometimes in one sequence, e.g., ZRRIFLE. The latter format is the more common style in CIA documents.\nExamples from publications by former CIA personnel show that the terms \"code name\" and \"cryptonym\" can refer to the names of operations as well as to individual persons. TRIGON, for example, was the code name for Aleksandr Ogorodnik, a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the former Soviet Union, whom the CIA developed as a spy; HERO was the code name for Col. Oleg Penkovsky, who supplied data on the nuclear readiness of the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. According to former CIA Director Richard M. Helms: \"The code names for most Agency operations are picked in sequence from a sterile list, with care taken not to use any word that might give a clue to the activity it covers. On some large projects, code names are occasionally specially chosen\u2014GOLD, SILVER, PBSUCCESS, CORONA. When Robert F. Kennedy requested a code name for the government-wide plan that Richard Goodwin was drafting, an exception was made. Goodwin was on the White House staff, and the plan concerned Cuba. Occasionally the special code names come close to the nerve, as did MONGOOSE.\" A secret joint program between the Mexico City CIA station and the Mexican secret police to wiretap the Soviet and Cuban embassies was code-named ENVOY.\nSome cryptonyms relate to more than one subject, e.g., a group of people. In this case, the basic cryptonym, e.g., LICOZY, will designate the whole group, while each group member is designated by a sequence number, e.g., LICOZY/3, which can also be written LICOZY-3, or just L-3.\nDigraphs.\nPartial list of digraphs and probable definitions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnidentified digraphs.\nDT, ER, FJ, HB, HO, HT, JU, KM, KO, QK, SC, SE, SG, WO, WS, ZI\nKnown cryptonyms.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOperations and projects.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 42,090. The county seat is Lewiston. The county is named after the Native American Nez Perce tribe. Nez Perce County is part of the Lewiston, Idaho\u2013WA Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nNez Perce County was originally organized in 1861, when the area was part of Washington Territory. It was reorganized in 1864 by the Idaho Territorial Legislature and was later subdivided into new counties. Rapid migration to the Palouse in the 1880s led to the formation of Latah County in 1888. Isolated from its county seat of Wallace in the Silver Valley, the southern portion of Shoshone County was annexed by Nez Perce County in 1904, then became Clearwater County in 1911. Lewis County was also formed from Nez Perce County in 1911.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water.\nNez Perce County has two rivers, the Clearwater and the Snake, which meet in Lewiston and then flow west. The Clearwater flows from the east and the Snake from the south, creating the state border with Washington (and further upstream, Oregon). The lowest point in the state of Idaho is located on the Snake River in Lewiston in Nez Perce County, where it flows out of Idaho and into Washington.\nThe northern portion of the county is part of the Palouse, a wide and rolling agricultural region of the middle Columbia basin.\nGovernment and politics.\nNez Perce County is currently strongly Republican, though less so than southern Idaho: it is one of only nine counties (out of 44) in Idaho that has failed to vote Republican in every presidential election since 1968, and indeed supported Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton (by plurality) three times in succession from 1988 to 1996.\nIn 2004 Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry 62% to 36%. In 2008 Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama by a slightly smaller margin of 58.11 percent to 39.97 percent, a result almost exactly replicated by Mitt Romney in 2012.

{"id": "57808", "revid": "35028171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57808", "title": "Belgian Congo", "text": "1908\u20131960 Belgian colony in Central Africa\nThe Belgian Congo (, ; ) was a Belgian colony in Central Africa from 1908 until independence in 1960. It is today the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nColonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century. King Leopold II of the Belgians attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexploited Congo Basin. Their ambivalence resulted in Leopold establishing a colony himself. With support from a number of Western countries, Leopold achieved international recognition of the Congo Free State in 1885. By the end of the 19th century, the violence used by Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and a ruthless system of economic exploitation led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did by creating the Belgian Congo in 1908.\nBelgian rule in the Congo was based on the \"colonial trinity\" (\"trinit\u00e9 coloniale\") of state, missionary and private-company interests. The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised. On many occasions, the interests of the government and of private enterprise became closely linked, and the state helped companies to break strikes and to remove other barriers raised by the indigenous population. The colony was divided into hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions and run uniformly according to a set \"native policy\" (\"politique indig\u00e8ne\"). This differed from the practice of British and French colonial policy, which generally favoured systems of indirect rule, retaining traditional leaders in positions of authority under colonial oversight.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the Belgian Congo experienced extensive urbanisation and the colonial administration began various development programs aimed at making the territory into a \"model colony\". One result saw the development of a new middle-class of Europeanised African \"\u00e9volu\u00e9s\" in the cities. By the 1950s, the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony.\nIn 1960, as the result of a widespread and increasingly radical pro-independence movement, the Belgian Congo achieved independence, becoming the Republic of the Congo under Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu. Poor relations between political factions within the Congo, the continued involvement of Belgium in Congolese affairs, and the intervention by major parties (mainly the United States and the Soviet Union) during the Cold War led to a five-year-long period of war and political instability, known as the Congo Crisis, from 1960 to 1965. This ended with the seizure of power by Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu in November 1964.\nCongo Free State.\nUntil the later part of the 19th century, few Europeans had ventured into the Congo Basin. The rainforest, swamps and accompanying malaria and other tropical diseases, such as sleeping sickness, made it a difficult environment for European exploration and exploitation. In 1876, King Leopold II of Belgium organized the International African Association with the cooperation of the leading African explorers and the support of several European governments for the promotion of the exploration and colonization of Africa. After Henry Morton Stanley had explored the region in a journey that ended in 1878, Leopold courted the explorer and hired him to help his interests in the region.\nLeopold II had been keen to acquire a colony for Belgium even before he ascended to the throne in 1865. The Belgian civil government showed little interest in its monarch's dreams of empire-building. Ambitious and stubborn, Leopold decided to pursue the matter on his own account.\nEuropean rivalry in Central Africa led to diplomatic tensions, in particular with regard to the Congo Basin, which no European power had claimed. In November 1884, Otto von Bismarck convened a 14-nation conference (the Berlin Conference) to find a peaceful resolution to the Congo situation. Though the Berlin Conference did not formally approve the territorial claims of the European powers in Central Africa, it did agree on a set of rules to ensure a conflict-free partitioning of the region. The rules recognised (\"inter alia\") the Congo Basin as a free-trade zone. But Leopold II emerged triumphant from the Berlin Conference and his single shareholder \"philanthropic\" organization received a large share of territory () to be organized as the Congo Free State.\nThe Congo Free State operated as a corporate state, privately controlled by Leopold II through a non-governmental organization, the International African Association. The state included the entire area of the present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, and existed from 1885 until 1908, when the government of Belgium reluctantly annexed the area. Under Leopold II's administration, the Congo Free State became a humanitarian disaster.\nThe lack of accurate records makes it difficult to quantify the number of deaths caused by the ruthless exploitation and the lack of immunity to new diseases introduced by contact with European colonists \u2013 like the 1889\u20131890 influenza pandemic, which caused millions of deaths on the European continent, including Prince Baudouin of Belgium, who died in 1891. William Rubinstein wrote: \"More basically, it appears almost certain that the population figures given by Hochschild are inaccurate. There is, of course, no way of ascertaining the population of the Congo before the twentieth century and estimates like 20 million are purely guesses. Most of the interior of the Congo was literally unexplored if not inaccessible.\" Leopold's \"Force Publique,\" a private army that terrorized natives to work as forced labour for resource extraction, disrupted local societies and killed and abused natives indiscriminately. The \"Force Publique\" also became involved in the Congo\u2013Arab War against African and Arab slavers like Zanzibari/Swahili strongman Tippu Tip.\nFollowing the 1904 Casement Report on misdeeds and conditions, European (British included) and American press exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in the early 1900s. In 1904 Leopold II was forced to allow an international parliamentary commission of inquiry entry to the Congo Free State. By 1908, public pressure and diplomatic manoeuvres led to the end of Leopold II's personal rule and to the annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium, known as the \"Belgian Congo\".\nBelgian Congo.\nOn 18 October 1908, the Belgian Parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian colony. A majority of the socialists and the radicals firmly opposed this annexation and reaped electoral benefits from their anti-colonialist campaign, but some believed that the country should annex the Congo and play a humanitarian role to the Congolese population. Eventually, two Catholic MPs and half of the Liberal MPs joined the socialists in rejecting the Colonial Charter (forty-eight votes against) and nearly all the Catholics and the other half of the Liberal MP's approved the charter (ninety votes for and seven abstentions). This way, on 15 November 1908 the Belgian Congo became a colony of the Belgian Kingdom. This was after King Leopold II had given up any hope of excluding a vast region of the Congo from the government's control by attempting to maintain a substantial part of the Congo Free State as a separate crown property.\nWhen the Belgian government took over the administration in 1908, the situation in the Congo improved in certain respects. The brutal exploitation and arbitrary use of violence, in which some of the concessionary companies had excelled, were curbed. The crime of \"red rubber\" was put to a stop. Article 3 of the new Colonial Charter of 18 October 1908 stated that: \"Nobody can be forced to work on behalf of and for the profit of companies or privates\", but this was not enforced, and the Belgian government continued to impose forced labour on the indigenous people of the area, albeit by less obvious methods.\nThe transition from the Congo Free State to the Belgian Congo was a turning point, but it was also marked by a considerable continuity. The last Governor-General of the Congo Free State, Baron Wahis, remained in office in the Belgian Congo, and the majority of Leopold II's administration with him. While conditions were improved somewhat relative to rule under King Leopold, reports by doctors such as Dr. Raingeard show the low importance the Belgian government placed on healthcare and basic education of the natives. Opening up the Congo and its natural and mineral riches for the Belgian economy remained the motive for colonial expansion.\nGovernment.\nThe governance of the Belgian Congo was outlined in the 1908 Colonial Charter. Executive power rested with the Belgian Minister of Colonial Affairs, assisted by a Colonial Council (\"Conseil Colonial\"). Both resided in Brussels. The Belgian Parliament exercised legislative authority over the Belgian Congo.\nThe highest-ranking representative of the colonial administration residing in the Belgian Congo was the Governor-General. From 1886 until 1926, the Governor-General and his administration were posted in Boma, near the Congo River estuary. From 1923, the colonial capital moved to L\u00e9opoldville, some 300\u00a0km further upstream in the interior. Initially, the Belgian Congo was administratively divided into four provinces: Congo-Kasa\u00ef, Equateur, Orientale, and Katanga, each presided over by a Vice-Governor-General. An administrative reform in 1932 increased the number of provinces to six, while \"demoting\" the Vice-Governors-General to provincial Governors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe territorial service was the true backbone of the colonial administration. The colony was divided into four provinces (six after the administrative reforms of 1933). Each province was in turn divided into a few districts (24 districts for the whole Congo) and each district into a handful of territories (some 130\u2013150 territories in all; some territories were merged or split over time). A territory was managed by a territorial administrator, assisted by one or more assistants. The territories were further subdivided into numerous \"chiefdoms\" (\"chefferies\"), at the head of which the Belgian administration appointed \"traditional chiefs\" (\"chefs coutumiers\"). The territories administered by one territorial administrator and a handful of assistants were often larger than a few Belgian provinces taken together (the whole Belgian Congo was nearly 80 times larger than the whole of Belgium and was roughly twice the size of Germany and France combined). The territorial administrator was expected to inspect his territory and to file detailed annual reports with the provincial administration.\nIn terms of the legal system, two systems co-existed: a system of European courts and one of indigenous courts (\"tribunaux indig\u00e8nes\"). These indigenous courts were presided over by the traditional chiefs but had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration. In 1936 it was recorded that there were 728 administrators controlling the Congo from Belgium. Belgians living in the Congo had no say in the government and the Congolese did not either. No political activity was permitted in the Congo whatsoever. Public order in the colony was maintained by the \"Force Publique\", a locally recruited army under Belgian command. It was only in the 1950s that metropolitan troops\u2014i.e., units of the regular Belgian army\u2014were posted in the Belgian Congo (for instance in Kamina).\nThe colonial state\u2014and any authority exercised by whites in the Congo\u2014was often referred to by the Congolese as \"bula matari\" (\"break rocks\"), one of the names originally given to Stanley. He had used dynamite to crush rocks when paving his way through the lower-Congo region. The term \"bula matari\" came to signify the irresistible and compelling force of the colonial state.\nInternational conflicts.\nThe Belgian Congo was directly involved in the two world wars. During World War I, an initial stand-off between the \"Force Publique\" and the German colonial army in German East Africa (Tanganyika) turned into open warfare with a joint Anglo-Belgian invasion of German colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the East African campaign. By 1916, the Belgian commander of the \"Force Publique\", Lieutenant-General Charles Tombeur, had assembled an army of 15,000 men supported by local bearers \u2013 Reybrouck indicated that during the war no less than 260,000 native bearers were called upon \u2013 and advanced to Kigali (now the capital of Rwanda). Kigali was taken by 6 May 1916, and the army went on to take Tabora (now part of Tanzania) on 19 September after heavy fighting. In 1917, after Mahenge (now in Tanzania) had been conquered, the army of the Belgian Congo, by now 25,000 men, occupied one-third of German East Africa.\nAfter World War I, under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany ceded control of the western section of the former German East Africa to Belgium, and Ruanda-Urundi would go on to become a League of Nations mandate territory, under Belgian administration. These areas did not become part of the Belgian Congo. Ruanda-Urundi would later become independent as the nations of Rwanda and Burundi, and the Belgian-controlled portions of German East Africa would join the nation of Tanganyika, followed by Tanzania.\nDuring World War II, the Belgian Congo served as a crucial source of income for the Belgian government in exile in London after the occupation of Belgium by the Nazis. Following the occupation of Belgium by the Germans in May 1940, the Belgian Congo declared itself loyal to the Belgian government in exile in London. The Belgian Congo and the rest of the Free Belgian forces supported the war on the Allied side in the Battle of Britain with 28 pilots in the RAF (squadron 349) and in the Royal South African Air Force (350 Squadron) and in Africa. The \"Force Publique\" again participated in the Allied campaigns in Africa. Belgian Congolese forces (with Belgian officers) notably fought against the Italian colonial army in Italian East Africa, and were victorious in Asosa, Borta\u00ef and in the Siege of Sa\u00efo under Major-general Auguste-Eduard Gilliaert during the second East African campaign of 1940\u20131941. On 3 July 1941, the Italian forces (under General Pietro Gazzera) surrendered when they were cut off by the \"Force Publique\". A Congolese unit also served in the Far Eastern Theatre with the British army in the Burma campaign.\nEconomic policy.\nThe economic development of the Congo was one of the colony\u2019s top priorities. An important tool was the construction of railways to open up the mineral and agricultural areas.\nWorld War I.\nRubber had long been the main export of the Belgian Congo, but its importance fell in the early 20th century from 77% of exports (by value) to only 15% as British colonies in Southeast Asia like British Malaya began to farm rubber. New resources were exploited, especially copper mining in Katanga province. The Belgian-owned Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut-Katanga, which would come to dominate copper mining, used a direct rail line to the sea at Beira. World War I increased demand for copper, and production soared from 997 tons in 1911 to 27,462 tons in 1917, then fell off to 19,000 tons in 1920. Smelters operated at Lubumbashi. Before the war the copper was sold to Germany; but the British purchased all the wartime output, with the revenues going to the Belgian government in exile. Diamond- and gold-mining also expanded during the war. The British firm of Lever Bros. greatly expanded the palm oil business during the war, and output of cocoa, rice and cotton increased. New rail and steamship lines opened to handle the expanded export traffic. During the First World War (1914\u20131918), the system of \"mandatory cultivation\" (\"cultures obligatoires\") was introduced, forcing Congolese peasants to grow certain cash crops (cotton, coffee, groundnuts) destined as commodities for export. Territorial administrators and state agronomists had the task of supervising and, if necessary, sanctioning those peasants who evaded the mandatory cultivation.\nInterbellum.\nTwo distinct periods of investment in the Congo's economic infrastructure stand out during the period of Belgian rule: the 1920s and the 1950s.\nIn 1921, the Belgian government provided 300\u00a0million francs of loans to the Belgian Congo, to fund public infrastructure projects in support of the boom of the private companies in the colony. The Belgian government also privatised many of the government-owned companies that were active in the colony (the Kilo-Moto mines, La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des transport fluviaux..). After the First World War, priority was given to investments in transport infrastructure (such as the rail lines between Matadi and L\u00e9opoldville and Elisabethville and Port Francqui). From 1920 to 1932, 2,450\u00a0km of railroads were constructed. The government also invested heavily in harbour infrastructure in the cities of Boma, Matadi, L\u00e9opoldville and Coquilhatville. Electricity and waterworks in the main cities were also funded. Airports were built and a telephone line was funded that connected Brussels with L\u00e9opoldville. The government accounted for about 50% of the investments in the Belgian Congo; commercial companies accounted for the other 50%. The mining industry\u2014with the Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga (U.M.H.K.) as a major player\u2014, attracted the majority of private investments (copper and cobalt in Katanga, diamonds in Kasai, gold in Ituri). This allowed, in particular, the Belgian Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale to build up an economic empire in the Belgian Congo. Huge profits were generated by the private companies and for a large part siphoned off to European and other international shareholders in the form of dividends.\nDuring the economic boom of the 1920s, many young Congolese men left their often impoverished rural villages and were employed by companies located near the cities; the population of Kinshasa nearly doubled from 1920 to 1940, and the population of Elizabethville grew from approximately 16,000 in 1923, to 33,000 in 1929. The necessary work-force was recruited by specialised recruiting firms (Robert Williams &amp; Co, Bourse du Travail Kasa\u00ef..) and was in some cases supported by governmental recruiting offices (Office de Travail-Offitra..). In Katanga the main labour force were seasonal migrant workers from Tanganyika, Angola, Northern Rhodesia, and after 1926, also from Ruanda-Urundi.\nIn many cases, this huge labour migration affected the economic viability of rural communities: many farmers left their villages, which resulted in labour shortages in these areas. To counter these problems, the colonial government used maximum quotas of \"able-bodied workers\" that could be recruited from every area in the Belgian Congo. In this way, tens of thousands of workers from densely populated areas were employed in copper mines in the sparsely populated south (Katanga). In agriculture, too, the colonial state forced a drastic rationalisation of production. The state took over so-called \"vacant lands\" (land not directly used by the local population) and redistributed the territory to European companies, to individual white landowners (\"colons\"), or to the missions. In this way, an extensive plantation economy developed. Palm-oil production in the Congo increased from 2,500 tons in 1914 to 9,000 tons in 1921, and to 230,000 tons in 1957. Cotton production increased from 23,000 tons in 1932 to 127,000 in 1939.\nThe mobilization of the African workforce in the capitalist colonial economy played a crucial role in spreading the use of money in the Belgian Congo. The basic idea was that the development of the Congo had to be borne not by the Belgian taxpayers but by the Congolese themselves. The colonial state needed to be able to levy taxes in money on the Congolese, so it was important that they could make money by selling their produce or their labour within the framework of the colonial economy.\nThe economic boom of the 1920s turned the Belgian Congo into one of the leading copper-ore producers worldwide. In 1926 alone, the Union Mini\u00e8re exported more than 80,000 tons of copper ore, a large part of it for processing in Hoboken (Belgium). In 1928 King Albert I visited the Congo to inaugurate the so-called 'voie national' that linked the Katanga mining region via rail (up to Port Francqui) and via river transport (from Port Francqui to L\u00e9opoldville) to the Atlantic port of Matadi.\nGreat Depression.\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s affected the export-based Belgian Congo economy severely because of the drop in international demand for raw materials and agricultural products (for example, the price of peanuts fell from 1.25 francs to 25 centimes (cents)). In some areas, as in the Katanga mining region, employment declined by 70%. In the country as a whole, the wage labour force decreased by 72,000 and many such labourers returned to their villages. In L\u00e9opoldville, the population decreased by 33%, because of this labour migration. In order to improve conditions in the countryside, the colonial government developed the so-called \"indigenous peasantry programme\", aimed at supporting the development of a stronger internal market that was less dependent of fluctuations in export demand, but also to combat the disastrous effects of erosion and soil exhaustion brought about by the mandatory cultivation scheme. This policy began to be implemented on a large scale throughout the Congo after the Second World War, by the colonial government. The scheme aimed to modernize indigenous agriculture by assigning plots of land to individual families and by providing them with government support in the form of selected seeds, agronomic advice, fertilizers, etc. The National Institute for Agronomic Study of the Belgian Congo, established in 1934, with its large experimental fields and laboratories in Yangambe, played an important role in crop selection and in the popularization of agronomic research and know-how.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, industrial production and agricultural output increased drastically. The Congolese population bore the brunt of the \"war effort\" \u2013 for instance, through a reinforcement of the mandatory cultivation policy. After Malaya fell to the Japanese (January 1942), the Belgian Congo became a strategic supplier of rubber to the Allies. The Belgian Congo became one of the major exporters of uranium to the US during World War II (and the Cold War), particularly from the Shinkolobwe mine. The colony provided the uranium used by the Manhattan Project, including in atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\nPost World War II.\nAfter World War II, the colonial state became more active in the economic and social development of the Belgian Congo. An ambitious ten-year plan was launched by the Belgian government in 1949. It put emphasis on house building, energy supply, rural development and health-care infrastructure. The ten-year plan ushered in a decade of strong economic growth, from which, for the first time, the Congolese began to benefit on a substantial scale. At the same time, the economy had expanded and the number of Belgian nationals in the country more than doubled, from 39,000 in 1950 to more than 88,000 by 1960.\nIn 1953, Belgium granted the Congolese the right \u2013 for the first time \u2013 to buy and sell private property in their own names. In the 1950s a Congolese middle class, modest at first, but steadily growing, emerged in the main cities (L\u00e9opoldville, Elisabethville, Stanleyville, and Luluabourg).\nThere was rapid political development, forced by African aspirations, in the last years of the 1950s, culminating in the 1960 Belgian Congo general election.\nCivilising mission.\nJustifications for colonialism in Africa, taking as a given that tribal wars, cannibalism, human sacrifice, display of human trophies, bigamy, and other \"primitive\" practices were common place, often invoked as a key argument the civilizing influence of the European culture. The civilizing mission in the Congo went hand-in-hand with the economic and educational development. Conversion to Catholicism, basic Western-style education, and improved health-care were objectives in their own right, but at the same time helped to transform what Europeans regarded as a primitive society into the Western capitalist model, in which workers who were disciplined and healthy, and who had learned to read and write, could be assimilated into labour market. Some of the first notable missions into Africa were conducted by David Livingstone and John M. Springer during the late 19th century into the early 20th century.\nEducation.\nThe educational system was dominated by the Catholic Church\u2014as was the case for the rest of Belgium at the time\u2014and, in some rare cases, by Protestant churches. Curricula reflected Christian and Western values. Even in 1948, 99.6% of educational facilities were run by Christian missions. Indigenous schooling was mainly religious and vocational. Children received basic education such as learning how to read, write and some mathematics. The Belgian Congo was one of the few African colonies in which local languages (Kikongo, Lingala, Tshiluba and Swahili) were taught at primary school. Even so, language policies and colonial domination often went hand in hand, as evidenced by the preference given to Lingala\u2014a semi-artificial language spread through its common use in the \"Force Publique\"\u2014over more local (but also more ancient) indigenous languages such as Lomongo and others.\nIn 1940 the schooling rates of children between 6 and 14 years old was 12%, reaching 37% in 1954, one of the highest rates in sub-Saharan Africa. Secondary and higher education for the indigenous population were not developed until relatively late in the colonial period. Black children, in small numbers, began to be admitted to European secondary schools from 1950 onward. The first university in the Belgian Congo, the Catholic Lovanium University, near L\u00e9opoldville, opened its doors to black and white students in 1954. Before the foundation of the Lovanium, the Catholic University of Louvain already operated multiple institutes for higher education in the Belgian Congo. The \"Fomulac\" (Fondation m\u00e9dicale de l'universit\u00e9 de Louvain au Congo), was founded in 1926, with the goal of forming Congolese medical personnel and researchers specialized in tropical medicine. In 1932 the Catholic University of Louvain founded the \"Cadulac\" (Centres agronomiques de l'universit\u00e9 de Louvain au Congo) in Kisantu. Cadulac was specialized in agricultural sciences and formed the basis for what was later to become Lovanium University. In 1956 a state university was founded in Elisabethville. Progress was slow though; until the end of the 1950s, no Congolese had been promoted beyond the rank of non-commissioned officer in the Force Publique, nor to a responsible position in the administration (such as head of bureau or territorial administrator).\nIn the late 1950s, 42% of the youth of school-going age was literate, which placed the Belgian Congo far ahead of any other country in Africa at the time. In 1960, 1,773,340 students were enrolled in schools around the Belgian Congo, of which 1,650,117 in primary school, 22,780 in post-primary school, 37,388 in secondary school and 1,445 in university and higher education. Of these 1,773,340 students, the majority (1,359,118) were enrolled in Catholic mission schools, 322,289 in Protestant mission schools and 68,729 in educational institutions organized by the state.\nHealth care.\nHealth care, too, was largely supported by the missions, although the colonial state took an increasing interest. In 1906 the Institute of Tropical Medicine was founded in Brussels. The ITM was, and still is, one of the world's leading institutes for training and research in tropical medicine and the organisation of health care in developing countries. Endemic diseases, such as sleeping sickness, were all but eliminated through large-scale and persistent campaigns.\nIn 1925 medical missionary Dr. Arthur Lewis Piper was the first person to use and bring tryparsamide, the Rockefeller Foundation's drug to cure sleeping sickness, to the Congo. The health-care infrastructure expanded steadily throughout the colonial period, with a comparatively high availability of hospital beds relative to the population and with dispensaries set up in the most remote regions. In 1960 the country had a medical infrastructure that far surpassed any other African nation at that time. The Belgian Congo had 3,000 health care facilities, of which 380 were hospitals. There were 5.34 hospital beds for every 1000 inhabitants (1 for every 187 inhabitants). Great progress was also made in the fight against endemic diseases; the numbers of reported cases of sleeping sickness went from 34,000 cases in 1931 to 1,100 cases in 1959, mainly by eradicating the tsetse fly in densely populated areas. All Europeans and Congolese in the Belgian Congo received vaccinations for polio, measles and yellow fever. Vast disease prevention programmes were rolled out, aimed at eradicating polio, leprosy and tuberculosis. In the primary schools, disease prevention campaigns were implemented, and disease prevention classes were part of the curriculum.\nSocial inequality and racial discrimination.\nA system of racial segregation and discrimination existed in the Belgian Congo. There was an \"implicit apartheid\". The colony had curfews for Congolese city-dwellers and similar racial restrictions were commonplace. L\u00e9opoldville's system of racist curfews was particularly notable and was used as a blueprint in other European colonies, such as nearby French Equatorial Africa.\nThough there were no specific laws imposing racial segregation, it was practiced socially and was more de facto in nature as blacks and whites were expected to be separate with the two rarely interacting with each other on a daily basis. Cities were designed with racial segregation in mind with certain areas being intended for whites and blacks. Public spaces such as shops, restaurants, hotels, etc. were racially segregated as some spaces were meant for whites and others for blacks but blacks could serve whites but could not often be serviced at facilities meant for whites. In the Force Publique, black soldiers could not pass the rank of non-commissioned officer. The black population in the cities could not leave their houses from 9\u00a0pm to 4\u00a0am. Starting in 1950 identity cards were issued to blacks who were deemed to be \"civilized\" allowing them to use white facilities and even be able to live in some white neighborhoods.\nBecause of the close interconnection between economic development and the 'civilizing mission', and because in practice state officials, missionaries and the executives of the private companies always lent each other a helping hand, the image has emerged that the Belgian Congo was governed by a \"colonial trinity\" of King-Church-Capital, encompassing the colonial state, the Christian missions, and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique.\nThe paternalistic ideology underpinning colonial policy was summed up in a catchphrase used by Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans (1934\u201346): \"Dominer pour servir\" (\"Dominate to serve\"). The colonial government wanted to convey images of a benevolent and conflict-free administration and of the Belgian Congo as a true model colony. Only in the 1950s did this paternalistic attitude begin to change. In the 1950s the most blatant discriminatory measures directed at the Congolese were gradually withdrawn (among these: corporal punishment by means of the feared chicote\u2014Portuguese word for whip). From 1953, and even more so after the triumphant visit of King Baudouin to the colony in 1955, Governor-General L\u00e9on P\u00e9tillon (1952\u20131958) worked to create a \"Belgian-Congolese community\", in which blacks and whites were to be treated as equals. Regardless, anti-miscegenation laws remained in place, and between 1959 and 1962 thousands of mixed-race Congolese children were forcibly deported from the Congo by the Belgian government and the Catholic Church and taken to Belgium.\nIn 1957, the first municipal elections open to black voters took place in a handful of the largest cities\u00a0\u2014 L\u00e9opoldville, \u00c9lisabethville, and Jadotville.\nAbolition of slavery.\nIn the Congo Free State, thousands of men, women, and children were freed from Swahili Arab slave owners and slave traders in Eastern Congo between 1886 and 1892. They were then either enlisted in the militia (Force Publique) or given as prisoners to local chiefs who were allies, who then used them as laborers. Although chattel slavery was officially outlawed in 1910 when the Belgian Congo was formed, prisoners were still used as forced laborers for both public and private projects.\nColonists.\nIn the Belgian Congo the presence of Belgian settlers along with white settlers in general was low and they were the minority of the population. Belgium did not encourage settlement in the colony and poor white people were not allowed to immigrate to the Belgian Congo. Belgian colonists made up 0.08% of the population in 1925 and 0.6% of the population in 1958. While the number of white settlers was at 0.13% in 1925 and 0.9% in 1958.\nResistance.\nCongolese opposition against colonialism was continuous, sustained and took many different forms. It became more likely as modern ideas and education spread. Armed risings occurred sporadically and localized until roughly the end of the Second World War (e.g., revolt of the Pende in 1931, mutiny in Luluabourg 1944). From the end of the Second World War until the late 1950s, the era of what colonial propaganda called a \"Pax belgica\" prevailed. Until the end of colonial rule in 1960, passive forms of resistance and expressions of an anti-colonial sub-culture were nevertheless manifold and widespread (e.g., Kimbanguism, after the 'prophet' Simon Kimbangu, who was imprisoned by the Belgians).\nApart from active and passive resistance among the Congolese, the colonial regime over time also elicited internal criticism and dissent. Already in the 1920s, certain members of the Colonial Council in Brussels (among them Octave Louwers) voiced criticism regarding the often brutal recruitment methods employed by the major companies in the mining districts. The stagnation of population growth in many districts\u2014in spite of spectacular successes in the fight against endemic diseases such as sleeping sickness\u2014was another cause for concern. Low birth rates in the countryside and the depopulation of certain areas were typically attributed to the disruption of traditional community life as a result of forced labour migration and mandatory cultivation. Response was often made that that had been the point of the policies, and pointed to the increase of population in the cities, as well as the improvement in health and lifespan due to modern medicine and living conditions. Many missionaries who were in daily contact with Congolese villagers, took their plight in the transition at heart and sometimes intervened on their behalf with the colonial administration (for instance in land property questions).\nThe missions and certain territorial administrators also played an important role in the study and preservation of Congolese cultural and linguistic traditions and artefacts. One example among many is that of Father Gustaaf Hulstaert (1900\u20131990), who in 1937 created the periodical \"Aequatoria\" devoted to the linguistic, ethnographic and historical study of the Mongo people of the central Congo basin. The colonial state took an interest in the cultural and scientific study of the Congo, particularly after the Second World War, through the creation of the \"Institut pour la Recherche Scientifique en Afrique Centrale\" (IRSAC, 1948).\nToward independence.\nIn the early 1950s, political emancipation of the Congolese elites, let alone of the masses, seemed like a distant event. But it was clear that the Congo could not forever remain immune from the rapid changes that, after the Second World War, profoundly affected colonialism around the world. The independence of the British, French and Dutch colonies in Asia shortly after 1945 had little immediate effect in the Congo, but in the United Nations pressure on Belgium (as on other colonial powers) increased. Belgium had ratified article 73 of the United Nations Charter, which advocated self-determination, and both superpowers put pressure on Belgium to reform its Congo policy; the Belgian government tried to resist what it described as 'interference' with its colonial policy.\nColonial authorities discussed ways to ameliorate the situation of the Congolese. Since the 1940s, the colonial government had experimented in a very modest way with granting a limited elite of so-called \"\u00e9volu\u00e9s\" more civil rights, holding out the eventual prospect of a limited amount of political influence. To this end \"deserving\" Congolese could apply for a proof of \"civil merit\", or, one step up, 'immatriculation' (registration), i.e., official evidence of their assimilation with European civilisation. To acquire this status, the applicant had to fulfill strict conditions (monogamous matrimony, evidence of good behaviour, etc.) and submit to stringent controls (including house visits). This policy was a failure. By the mid-1950s, there were at best a few thousand Congolese who had successfully obtained the civil merit diploma or been granted \"immatriculation\". The supposed benefits attached to it\u2014including equal legal status with the white population\u2014proved often more theory than reality and led to open frustration with the \"\u00e9volu\u00e9s\". When Governor-General P\u00e9tillon began to speak about granting the native people more civil rights, even suffrage, to create what he termed a \"Belgo-Congolese community\", his ideas were met with indifference from Brussels and often with open hostility from some of the Belgians in the Congo, who feared for their privileges.\nIt became increasingly evident that the Belgian government lacked a strategic long-term vision in relation to the Congo. 'Colonial affairs' did not generate much interest or political debate in Belgium, so long as the colony seemed to be thriving and calm. A notable exception was the young King Baudouin, who had succeeded his father, King Leopold III, under dramatic circumstances in 1951, when Leopold III was forced to abdicate. Baudouin took a close interest in the Belgian Congo.\nOn his first state visit to the Belgian Congo in 1955, King Baudouin was welcomed enthusiastically by cheering crowds of whites and blacks alike, as captured in Andr\u00e9 Cauvin's documentary film, \"Bwana Kitoko\". Foreign observers, such as the international correspondent of \"The Manchester Guardian\" or a \"Time\" journalist, remarked that Belgian paternalism \"seemed to work\", and contrasted Belgium's seemingly loyal and enthusiastic colonial subjects with the restless French and British colonies. On the occasion of his visit, King Baudouin openly endorsed the Governor-General's vision of a \"Belgo-Congolese community\"; but, in practice, this idea progressed slowly. At the same time, divisive ideological and linguistic issues in Belgium, which heretofore had been successfully kept out of the colony's affairs, began to affect the Congo as well. These included the rise of unionism among workers, the call for public (state) schools to break the missions' monopoly on education, and the call for equal treatment in the colony of both Belgian national languages: French and Dutch. Until then, French had been promoted as the sole colonial language. The Governor-General feared that such divisive issues would undermine the authority of the colonial government in the eyes of the Congolese, while also diverting attention from the more pressing need for true emancipation.\nPolitical organisation.\nThe participation of Congolese people in the Second World War and news of changes in other colonies resulted in their organising to gain more power. As a result of the inability of the colonial government to introduce radical and credible changes, the Congolese elites began to organise themselves socially and soon also politically. In the 1950s, two markedly different forms of nationalism arose among the Congolese elites. The nationalist movement\u2014to which the Belgian authorities, to some degree, turned a blind eye\u2014promoted territorial nationalism, wherein the Belgian Congo would become one politically united state after independence.\nIn opposition to this was the ethno-religious and regional nationalism that took hold in the Bakongo territories of the west coast, Kasai and Katanga. The first political organisations were of the latter type. ABAKO, founded in 1950 as the \"Association culturelle des Bakongo\" and headed by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, was initially a cultural association that soon turned political. From the mid-1950s, it became a vocal opponent of Belgian colonial rule. Additionally, the organization continued to serve as the major ethno-religious organization for the Bakongo and became closely intertwined with the Kimbanguist Church, which was extremely popular in the lower Congo.\nIn 1955, Belgian professor Antoine van Bilsen published a treatise called \"Thirty Year Plan for the Political Emancipation of Belgian Africa\". The timetable called for the gradual emancipation of the Congo over a 30-year period\u2014the time Van Bilsen expected it would take to create an educated elite who could replace the Belgians in positions of power. The Belgian government and many of the \"\u00e9volu\u00e9s\" were suspicious of the plan\u2014the former because it meant eventually giving up the Congo, and the latter because Belgium would continue to rule for another three decades. A group of Catholic \"\u00e9volu\u00e9s\" responded positively to the plan with a moderate manifesto in a Congolese journal called \"Conscience Africaine\"; they raised issues as to the extent of Congolese participation.\nIn 1957, by way of experiment, the colonial government organised the first municipal elections in three urban centres (L\u00e9opoldville, Elisabethville and Jadotville), in which Congolese people were allowed to stand for office and cast their vote. Events in 1957\u201358 led to a sudden acceleration in the demands for political emancipation. The independence of Ghana in 1957 and President De Gaulle's August 1958 visit to Brazzaville, the capital of the French Congo, on the other side of the Congo river to L\u00e9opoldville, in which he promised France's African colonies the free choice between a continued association with France or full independence, aroused ambitions in the Congo. The World Exhibition organised in Brussels in 1958 (Expo 58) proved another eye-opener for many Congolese leaders, who were allowed to travel to Belgium for the first time.\nIn 1958, the demands for independence radicalised quickly and gained momentum. A key role was played by the \"Mouvement National Congolais\" (MNC). First set up in 1956, the MNC was established in October 1958 as a national political party that supported the goal of a unitary and centralised Congolese nation. Its most influential leader was the charismatic Patrice Lumumba. In 1959, an internal split was precipitated by Albert Kalonji and other MNC leaders who favoured a more moderate political stance (the splinter group was deemed Mouvement National Congolais-Kalonji). Despite the organisational divergence of the party, Lumumba's leftist faction (now the Mouvement National Congolais-Lumumba) and the MNC collectively had established themselves as by far the most important and influential party in the Belgian Congo. Belgium vehemently opposed Lumumba's leftist views and had grave concerns about the status of their financial interests should Lumumba's MNC gain power.\nIndependence.\nWhile the Belgian government was debating a programme to gradually extend the political emancipation of the Congolese population, it was overtaken by events. On 4 January 1959, a prohibited political demonstration organised in L\u00e9opoldville by ABAKO got out of hand. At once, the colonial capital was in the grip of extensive rioting. It took the authorities several days to restore order and, by the most conservative count, several hundred died. The eruption of violence sent a shockwave through the Congo and Belgium alike. On 13 January, King Baudouin addressed the nation by radio and declared that Belgium would work towards the full independence of the Congo \"without delay, but also without irresponsible rashness\".\nWithout committing to a specific date for independence, the government of prime minister Gaston Eyskens had a multi-year transition period in mind. They thought provincial elections would take place in December 1959, national elections in 1960 or 1961, after which administrative and political responsibilities would be gradually transferred to the Congolese, in a process presumably to be completed towards the mid-1960s. On the ground, circumstances were changing much more rapidly. Increasingly, the colonial administration saw varied forms of resistance, such as refusal to pay taxes. In some regions anarchy threatened. At the same time many Belgians resident in the Congo opposed independence, feeling betrayed by Brussels. Faced with a radicalisation of Congolese demands, the government saw the chances of a gradual and carefully planned transition dwindling rapidly.\nIn 1959, King Baudouin made another visit to the Belgian Congo, finding a great contrast with his visit of four years before. Upon his arrival in L\u00e9opoldville, he was pelted with rocks by black Belgo-Congolese citizens who were angry with the imprisonment of Lumumba, convicted because of incitement against the colonial government. Though Baudouin's reception in other cities was considerably better, the shouts of \"Vive le roi!\" were often followed by \"Ind\u00e9pendance imm\u00e9diate!\" The Belgian government wanted to avoid being drawn into a futile and potentially very bloody colonial war, as had happened to France in Indochina and Algeria, or to the Netherlands in Indonesia. For that reason, it was inclined to give in to the demands for immediate independence voiced by the Congolese leaders.\nDespite lack of preparation and an insufficient number of educated elites (there were only a handful of Congolese holding a university degree at that time), the Belgian leaders decided to accept the independence. In fact, the weakness of local elites was seen favorably by the Belgian government and business leaders, who hoped this would make it easier for them to remain in charge of key aspects of the country's politics and economy. This approach, different from both the colonial wars and the more gradual decolonization other European states engaged in, became known as \"\"\u2014the Congolese bet.\nIn January 1960, Congolese political leaders were invited to Brussels to participate in a round-table conference to discuss independence. Patrice Lumumba was discharged from prison for the occasion. The conference agreed surprisingly quickly to grant the Congolese practically all of their demands: a general election to be held in May 1960 and full independence\u2014\"Dipenda\"\u2014on 30 June 1960. This was in response to the strong united front put up by the Congolese delegation.\nPolitical maneuvering ahead of the elections resulted in the emergence of three political alliances: a coalition of the federalistic nationalists consisting of six separatist parties or organizations, two of which were ABAKO and the MNC\u2014Kalonji; the centralist MNC\u2014Lumumba; and that of Mo\u00efse Tshombe, the strongman of Katanga, who wanted to preserve the business interests of the Union Mini\u00e8re (as Kalonji did with respect to the diamond exploitations in Kasa\u00ef). The parliamentary elections resulted in a divided political landscape, with both the regionalist factions\u2014chief among them ABAKO\u2014and the nationalist parties such as the MNC, doing well. A compromise arrangement was forced through, with Kasa-Vubu becoming the first president of the Republic of the Congo, and Lumumba its first head of government. As planned scarcely five months earlier, the hand-over ceremony by the Belgians took place on time on 30 June 1960 at the new residence of the Governor-General of the Belgian Congo in L\u00e9opoldville.\nOne week later, a rebellion broke out within the \"Force Publique\" against its officers, who were still predominantly Belgian. This was a catalyst for disturbances arising all over the Congo, mainly instigated by dissatisfied soldiers and radicalized youngsters. In many areas, their violence specifically targeted European victims. Within weeks, the Belgian military and later a United Nations intervention force evacuated the largest part of the more than 80,000 Belgians who were still working and living in the Congo.\nCongo Crisis and aftermath.\nThe rebellion that had started in Thyssville in the Bas-Congo in July 1960 quickly spread to the rest of the Congo. In September 1960, the leaders split, with President Kasa-Vubu declaring prime minister Lumumba deposed from his functions, and vice versa. The stalemate was ended with the government's arrest of Lumumba. In January 1961, he was flown to the rich mining province of Katanga, which by that time had declared a secession from L\u00e9opoldville under the leadership of Mo\u00efse Tshombe (with active Belgian support). Lumumba was handed over to Katangan authorities, who executed him.\nIn 2002 Belgium officially apologised for its role in the assassination of Lumumba; the CIA has long been speculated of complicity, as they had seen Lumumba's politics were too far left. The Soviet Union during the Cold War years was active in expanding its influence in Africa against European powers, giving 'anti-colonialism' as a rationale for the increase of its power in the region. A series of rebellions and separatist movements seemed to shatter the dream of a unitary Congolese state at its birth. Although the nation was independent, Belgian paratroopers intervened in the Congo on various occasions to protect and evacuate Belgian and international citizens. The United Nations maintained a large peace-keeping operation in the Congo from late 1960 onward. The situation did not stabilise until 1964\u201365. Katanga province was re-absorbed and the so-called Simba Rebellion ended in Stanleyville (province Orientale). Shortly after that army colonel Joseph D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu ended the political impasse by seizing power in a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\".\nMobutu had some support in the West, and in particular in the United States, because of his strong anti-communist stance. Initially his rule favored consolidation and economic development (e.g., by building the Inga dam that had been planned in the 1950s). In order to distance himself from the previous regime, he launched a campaign of Congolese \"authenticity\". The government abandoned the use of colonial place names in 1966: L\u00e9opoldville was renamed as Kinshasa, Elisabethville as Lubumbashi, Stanleyville as Kisangani. During this period, the Congo generally maintained close economic and political ties with Belgium. Certain financial issues had remained unresolved after independence (the so-called \"contentieux\"), for instance, the transfer of shares in the big mining companies that had been held directly by the colonial state. In 1970, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of independence, King Baudouin paid an official state visit to the Congo.\nMobutu's r\u00e9gime became more radical during the 1970s. The \"Mouvement populaire de la R\u00e9volution\" (MPR), of which Mobutu was the \"pr\u00e9sident-fondateur\", firmly established one-party rule. Political repression increased considerably. Mobutu renamed the Congo as the republic of Za\u00efre. The so-called \"Za\u00efrisation\" of the country in the mid-1970s led to an exodus of foreign workers and economic disaster. In the 1980s the Mobutu regime became a byword for mismanagement and corruption. Relations with Belgium, the former colonial power, went through a series of ups and downs, reflecting a steady decline in the underlying economic, financial and political interests. As there was no danger of the country falling into Soviet hands, the Western powers maintained a neutral stance.\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War in the late 1980s, Mobutu lost support in the West. As a result, in 1990, he decided to end the one-party system and dramatically announced a return to democracy. But he dragged his feet and played out his opponents against one another to gain time. A bloody intervention of the Za\u00efrian Army against students on the Lubumbashi University Campus in May 1990 precipitated a break in diplomatic relations between Belgium and Za\u00efre. Pointedly, Mobutu was not invited to attend the funeral of King Baudouin in 1993, which he considered a grave personal affront.\nIn 1997 Mobutu was forced from power by a rebel force headed by Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, who declared himself president and renamed Za\u00efre as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Assassinated in 2001, Kabila was succeeded by his son Joseph Kabila. In 2006 Joseph Kabila was confirmed as president through the first nationwide free elections in the Congo since 1960. On 30 June\u00a0\u2013 2 July 2010, King Albert II and Yves Leterme, the Belgian Prime Minister, visited Kinshasa to attend the festivities marking the 50th anniversary of Congolese independence.\nCertain practices and traditions from the colonial period have survived into the independent Congolese state. It maintains a strong centralising and bureaucratic tendency, and has kept the organizational structure of the education system and the judiciary. The influence of the Congo on Belgium has been manifested mainly in economic terms: through the activities of the Union Mini\u00e8re (now Umicore), the development of a nonferrous metal industry, and the development of the Port of Antwerp and diamond industry. To this day, Brussels Airlines (successor of the former Sabena) has maintained a strong presence in the DRC. It was estimated that in 2010, more than 4,000 Belgian nationals were resident in the DRC, and the Congolese community in Belgium was at least 16,000 strong. The \"Matong\u00e9\" quarter in Brussels is the traditional focal point of the Congolese community in Belgium.\nCulture.\nMusic.\nIn popular music, Latin music such as rumba was introduced from Cuba in the 1930s and 1940s during the colonial era, and Latin music was played extensively in the Belgian Congo. In the 1950s, American jazz was also widely accepted as African jazz. In 1956, Franco formed OK Jazz (later renamed TPOK Jazz).\nJoseph Kabasele, also known as \"Le Grand Kall\u00e9\" (The Great Kall\u00e9), formed African Jazz. House bands became popular, and rumba congolaise were formed. Marlo Mashi is a musician of the same era. Congo's popular music evolved from continental rhythm, church music, Ghana's high life, and traditional Congo music.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is acknowledged to have introduced to broader use, in the late 1970s, the previously-synthesized compound MDMA (\"ecstasy\"), in research psychopharmacology and in combination with conventional therapy, the latter through presentations and academic publications, including to psychologists; and for the rediscovery, occasional discovery, and regular synthesis and personal use and distribution, of possibly hundreds of psychoactive compounds (for their psychedelic and MDMA-like empathogenic bioactivities). As such, Shulgin is seen both as a pioneering and a controversial participant in the emergence of the broad use of psychedelics.\nIn 1991 and 1997, he and his wife Ann Shulgin compiled the books \"PiHKAL\" and \"TiHKAL\" (\"Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved\", likewise for \"Tryptamines\"), from notebooks that extensively described their work and personal experiences with these two classes of psychoactive drugs. Shulgin documented the chemical synthesis of many of these compounds. Some of the syntheses catalogued by Shulgin in his books include chemicals in the 2C family (such as 2C-B), compounds of the DOx family (such as DOM), and tryptamines (such as 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MiPT).\nIn describing Shulgin's work in psychedelic research and his preparation and experimentation with psychedelic drugs, he has been dubbed the \"godfather of ecstasy\" (and to a much more limited extent, the \"godfather of psychedelics\").\nWriting in 2005\u2014in the decade before Shulgin's death\u2014a retrospective by Drake Bennett of \"The New York Times Magazine\" noted that as a consequence of Shulgin's testing his various synthetic compounds \"for activity by taking the chemicals himself\u00a0... most of the scientific community consider[ed] Shulgin at best a curiosity and at worst a menace\", but Bennett goes on to say that \"near the end\u00a0... [Shulgin's] faith in the potential of psychedelics ha[d] at least a chance at vindication\", going on to note the various clinical trials underway on compounds of interest to Shulgin. The early 2000s also was a period where Shulgin was witness to a series of incidents in which young men overdosed on a novel psychoactive agent whose preparation was disclosed by Shulgin in one of his books. Before his death (and before the onset of his late life dementia), Shulgin expressed sadness over the deaths, but argued that all drugs, including aspirin, carry risks with incorrect use.\nEarly life and career.\nShulgin was born on June 17, 1925, in Berkeley, California, to Theodore Stevens Shulgin (1893\u20131978) and Henrietta D. (Aten) Shulgin (1894\u20131960). His father was born in Chelyabinsk, Russia; his mother was born in Illinois. Theodore and Henrietta were public school teachers in Alameda County.\nShulgin studied organic chemistry at Harvard University as a scholarship student, and was enrolled there at the age of 16. He dropped out to join the U.S. Navy, during his second year at Harvard. In 1944 a military nurse gave Shulgin a glass of orange juice prior to a surgery for a thumb infection, while serving on USS \"Pope\" during World War\u00a0II; he drank the juice and, assuming that crystals at the bottom of the glass were a sedative, \"fell unconscious\". Upon waking he learned that the crystals were undissolved sugar, and that doctors had administered anesthesia after he was already unconscious\u2014an experience Drake Bennett of \"The New York Times Magazine\" referred to as \"revelatory\", and a \"tantalizing hint of the mind's odd strength\", as \"his collapse was caused entirely by the placebo effect\".\nAfter serving in the armed forces, Shulgin returned to California, and earned his PhD in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley. Through the late 1950s, Shulgin completed post-doctoral work in the fields of psychiatry and pharmacology at University of California, San Francisco. After working at Bio-Rad Laboratories as a research director for a brief period, he began work at Dow Chemical Company, One of his early achievements at Dow was the invention of the first known biodegradable pesticide (mexacarbate).\nAt this time he had a series of psychedelic experiences that helped to shape his further goals and research, the first of which was brought on by mescaline. \"I first explored mescaline in the late '50s ... Three-hundred-fifty to 400 milligrams. I learned there was a great deal inside me.\" However, other sources state that Shulgin first tried mescaline in April 1960.\nShulgin later reported personal revelations that \"had been brought about by a fraction of a gram of a white solid, but that in no way whatsoever could it be argued that these memories had been contained within the white solid ... I understood that our entire universe is contained in the mind and the spirit. We may choose not to find access to it, we may even deny its existence, but it is indeed there inside us, and there are chemicals that can catalyze its availability.\"\nShulgin's professional activities continued to lean in the direction of psychopharmacology, furthered by his personal experiences with psychedelics. But during this period he was unable to do much independent research. His opportunity for further research came in 1961 after his development of Zectran, the first biodegradable pesticide, a highly profitable product. In his book \"PiHKAL\", Shulgin limits his pesticide days at Dow Chemical to one sentence in 978 pages. Dow Chemical Company, in return for Zectran's valuable patent, gave Shulgin great freedom. During this time, he created and patented drugs when Dow asked, and published findings on other drugs in journals such as \"Nature\" and the \"Journal of Organic Chemistry\". One of these patents, approved in 1970, involved phenethylamines. Eventually, Dow Chemical requested that he no longer use their name on his publications.\nIn late 1966, Shulgin left Dow in order to pursue his own interests. He first spent two years studying neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, leaving to work on a consulting project. He set up a home-based lab on his property, known as \"the Farm\", and became a private consultant. He also taught classes in the local universities and at the San Francisco General Hospital. Through his friend Bob Sager, head of the U.S. DEA's Western Laboratories, Shulgin formed a relationship with the DEA and began holding pharmacology seminars for the agents, supplying the DEA with samples of various compounds, and occasionally serving as an expert witness in court. In 1988, he authored a then-definitive law enforcement reference book on controlled substances, and received several awards from the DEA.\nIndependent research.\nIn order to work with scheduled psychoactive chemicals, Shulgin obtained a DEA Schedule I license for an analytical laboratory, which allowed him to synthesize and possess any otherwise illicit drug. Shulgin set up a chemical synthesis laboratory in a small building behind his house, which gave him a great deal of career autonomy. Shulgin used this freedom to synthesize and test the effects of potentially psychoactive drugs.\nIn 1976, Shulgin was introduced to MDMA by a student in the medicinal chemistry group he advised at San Francisco State University. MDMA had been synthesized in 1912 by Merck and patented in 1913 as an intermediate of another synthesis in order to block competitors, but was never explored in its own right. Shulgin went on to develop a new synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff used the substance in his practice in small doses as an aid to talk therapy. Zeff introduced the substance to hundreds of psychologists and lay therapists around the nation, including Ann (born Laura Ann Gotlieb), whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981. It was her fourth marriage, and she had four children.\nAfter judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a small group of friends with whom he regularly tested his creations, starting in 1960. They developed a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, mescaline, and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect\u2014some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation\u2014all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's laboratory notebooks. Shulgin published many of these objective and subjective reports in his books and papers. About 2C-B he said in 2003: \"It is, in my opinion, one of the most graceful, erotic, sensual, introspective compounds I have ever invented. For most people, it is a short-lived and comfortable psychedelic, with neither toxic side-effects nor next-day hang-over.\"\nIn 1994, two years after the publication of \"PIHKAL\", the DEA raided his lab. The agency requested that Shulgin surrender his license for violating its terms, and he was fined $25,000 for possession of anonymous samples sent to him for quality testing. In the 15 years preceding the publication of \"PIHKAL\", two announced and scheduled reviews failed to find any irregularities. Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA's San Francisco Field Division, has stated that, \"It is our opinion that those books are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs. Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books.\"\nPrior to his 2010 health issues, Shulgin had been working on a series of N-allylated tryptamines including 5-MeO-DALT and 5-MeO-MALT.\nPersonal life, health, and death.\nShulgin was married to Nina Gordon until her death from a stroke in 1977. He then married author Ann Gotlieb in 1981. He spent most of his later life at the Farm in Lafayette, California.\nOn April 8, 2008, at the age of 82, he underwent surgery to replace a defective aortic valve. On November 16, 2010, he suffered a stroke, from which he largely recovered. Also at the close of 2010, a skin-grafting surgery saved his left foot from being amputated. Around this time, Shulgin began showing early signs of dementia, mostly severe loss of short-term memory. With progression of the dementia since 2010, his wife, Ann Shulgin, had been trying to sell part of their property to raise more money to cover care costs.\nOn April 17, 2014, Ann Shulgin reported on Facebook that her husband had developed liver cancer, and in a May 31 update on Facebook she said that, although appearing frail, he seemed to be experiencing his last moments in peace and without pain. Shulgin died at his home on June 2, 2014, at the age of 88.\nLegacy.\nIn a 2014 review of the synthesis of designer drugs, the effects of Shulgin's work were described as \"by far the most far-reaching\" effects associated with the cultural climate of interest at the time in hallucinogenic compounds generally and mescaline in particular, with which various artists and writers had experimented. Shulgin said that mescaline made him aware of a world submerged in human spirit, whose \"availability\" was \"catalyzed\" by such chemicals; the consequences of his insights were called \"devastating\" by the reviewers. In the same review, an example of his insights was given by his description of MDMA as \"his low-calorie Martini\".\nSocieties.\nShulgin was a member of Mensa International and frequently attended Mensa events in California.\nAlexander was a Bohemian Club member. The Bohemian club is located in California where Alexander lived. Alexander refers to \"The Owl Club\" in chapter 11 of \"PiHKAL\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One evening in the late 1950s, I was invited to a musical soiree at an old comfortable home in the Berkeley Hills. I brought my viola with me... The only person I can remember from that evening was a handsome, proper gentleman with a small grey moustache and the residues of an English accent. During coffee, after the music was over, he struck up a conversation.\nHe asked me if I had ever heard of The Owl Club in San Francisco? I had not, so he began painting a picture of a rather fascinating group, with many interests in all sorts of art, drama and music. He mentioned that there was need for a viola player, and would I be interested in sitting in for a couple of evenings? ... The Club proved to be a group of gentlemen from a broad array of political and professional backgrounds, leaning somewhat toward the political right and the well-to-do. ... At my first evening at the Club... Andrew was appointed my Pater Familias ...\"\u2014\u200a\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was 1.5km wide and 2.5km long, with an area of 3.5 kilometres. After 1830, the territory's northernmost border point at Vaalserberg connected it to a quadripoint shared additionally with the Dutch Province of Limburg, the Prussian Rhine Province, and the Belgian Li\u00e8ge Province. That border point's position is currently represented by the Three-Country Point, the meeting place of the borders of Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.\nDuring the First World War, Neutral Moresnet was annexed by Germany. The armistice between France and Germany in November 1918 forced Germany to withdraw from Belgium and Neutral Moresnet. A year later, the Treaty of Versailles awarded Neutral Moresnet to Belgium, so from January 1920 it became the municipality of Kelmis.\nDuring the Second World War, Kelmis and the surrounding area were annexed by Germany, and its name was changed to Moresnet. The territory was returned to Belgium at the end of the war.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAfter the demise of Napoleon's Empire, the Congress of Vienna of 1814\u201315 redrew the European map, intending to create a balance of power in Europe. One of the borders to be delineated was the one between the newly created United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Prussia. Both parties could agree on the larger part of the territory, as borders mostly followed older lines, the district of Moresnet proved problematic, mainly because of a valuable zinc spar mine named Altenberg (German) or Vieille Montagne (French) located there. The governments of both the Netherlands and Prussia desired to appropriate this resource, which was needed for the production of zinc and brass \u2013 at that time, Bristol in the United Kingdom was the only other place where zinc ore was processed.\nIn December 1815, Dutch and Prussian representatives convened in nearby Aachen, and on 26 June 1816, a compromise was obtained, dividing the district of Moresnet into three parts. The Dutch absorbed the village of Moresnet itself into Li\u00e8ge Province, while the Prussian village Moresnet (renamed Neu-Moresnet after World War I) became part of the Prussian Rhine Province and the mine and village adjacent became a neutral territory pending a future agreement. The two powers, whose armies were prohibited from occupying the area, established a joint administration.\nWhen Belgium gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1830, the Belgians assumed control of the Dutch role in Neutral Moresnet (though the Dutch never formally ceded their claim).\nBorders.\nFormal installation of border demarcation markers for the territory occurred on 23 September 1818. The territory of Neutral Moresnet had a somewhat triangular shape, with the base being the main road from Aachen to Li\u00e8ge. The village and mine lay just to the north of this road. To east and west, two straight lines converged on the Vaalserberg.\nThe roads from Germany and Belgium to the Three\u2011Country Point are named (lit.\u2009'Three Countries Way') and ('Three Border Stones Road') respectively; the road from the Netherlands is called ('Four Borders Way').\nFlag.\nFrom 1883, Neutral Moresnet used a tricolour with horizontal bars in black, white and blue as its territorial flag. The origin is unknown and has been explained in two different ways:\nStatus.\nThe territory was governed by two royal commissioners, one from each neighbour. Eventually, these commissioners were commonly civil servants from the Belgian Verviers and the Prussian Eupen. The municipal administration was directed by a mayor appointed by the commissioners.\nThe Napoleonic civil and penal codes, introduced during French rule, remained in force throughout the existence of Neutral Moresnet. However, since no law court existed in the neutral territory, Belgian and Prussian judges had to come in and decide cases based on the Napoleonic laws. Since there was no administrative court either, the judge's decision could not be appealed.\nIn 1859, Neutral Moresnet was granted a greater measure of self-administration by the installation of a municipal council of ten members. The council, as well as a welfare committee and a school committee, were appointed by the mayor and served an advisory function only. The people had no voting rights.\nLife in Neutral Moresnet was dominated by the Vieille Montagne mining company, which not only was the major employer but also operated residences, shops, a hospital and a bank. The mine attracted many workers from the neighboring countries, increasing the population from 256 in 1815 to 2,275 in 1858 and 4,668 in 1914. Most services, such as the mail, were shared between Belgium and Prussia (in a fashion similar to Andorra). There were five schools in the territory, and Prussian subjects could attend the schools in Prussian Moresnet.\nLiving in the territory had several benefits. Among these were the low taxes (the national budget being fixed at 2,735 Belgian francs throughout most of its history), the absence of import tariffs from both neighbouring countries, and low prices compared to just across the border. A downside to their special status was the fact that people from Neutral Moresnet were considered stateless and were not allowed a military of their own.\nMany immigrants settled in Moresnet so they would be exempt from military service; however, in 1854, Belgium began to conscript its citizens who had relocated to Moresnet, and Prussia did likewise in 1874. From then on, the exemption applied only to descendants of the original inhabitants.\nCurrency.\nNeutral Moresnet did not have its own currency. The French franc was legal tender. The currencies of Prussia (and then Germany, after 1871), Belgium and the Netherlands were also in circulation. In 1848, local currency began circulating, though these coins were not considered the official medium.\nUncertain future.\nWhen the mine was exhausted in 1885, the continued survival of Neutral Moresnet was in doubt. Perhaps in response, the next year Dr. Wilhelm Molly (1838\u20131919), the mine's chief medical doctor and an avid philatelist, tried to organise a local postal service with its own stamps. This enterprise was quickly thwarted by Belgian intervention.\nIn about 1900, Germany began a more aggressive policy concerning the territory and was accused of sabotage and obstructing the administrative process in order to force the issue.\nA casino was established in August 1903 after the Belgians closed all such resorts in Belgium. The Moresnet casino operated with strict limitations, permitting no local resident to gamble, and no more than 20 people to gather at a time. The venture was abandoned, however, when Kaiser Wilhelm II threatened to partition the territory or cede it to Belgium to end the gambling. Around this same time, Moresnet boasted three distilleries for the manufacture of gin.\nDuring 1908, Dr. Molly proposed making Neutral Moresnet the world's first Esperanto\u2011speaking state, named (\"friendship-place\"). The proposed national anthem was an Esperanto march of the same name, set to the tune of \"O Tannenbaum\". Several residents learned Esperanto and a rally was held in Kelmis to endorse the idea of on 13 August 1908, and a coat of arms was publicized. The World Congress of Esperanto, meeting in Dresden, even declared Neutral Moresnet the world capital of the Esperanto community.\nFirst World War.\nThe First World War resulted in the end of neutrality. On 4 August 1914, Germany invaded Belgium, initially leaving Neutral Moresnet as \"an oasis in a desert of destruction\". A total of 147 Neutral Moresnet citizens were killed, though it is unclear whether they were killed inside the territory or in fighting outside its borders. On 27 June 1915, Neutral Moresnet was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, although the annexation never received international recognition.\nIn 1918, the armistice between France and Germany, signed on 11 November at Compi\u00e8gne, forced Germany to withdraw from Belgium and also from Moresnet. It also resulted in the ousting of Mayor Wilhelm Kyll, a German national who had been appointed after the German invasion.\nOn 28 June 1919, the Treaty of Versailles settled the dispute that had created the neutral territory a century earlier by awarding Neutral Moresnet, along with Prussian Moresnet and the German cantons of Eupen and Malmedy, to Belgium. The treaty became effective 10 January 1920, ending the territory's existence and converting it into a municipality in Belgium.\nTo distinguish it from the already existing town of Moresnet (in the neighboring municipality of Plombi\u00e8res), Neutral Moresnet was renamed Kelmis (in French: )\u00a0\u2013 after \"kelme\", the local dialect word for zinc spar.\nDespite the annexation, Neutral Moresnet Mayor Pierre Grignard effectively stayed in office and became the first mayor of Kelmis. The ten members of Neutral Moresnet's council were confirmed for the Kelmis municipal council after its Prussian members renounced their nationality. They remained in office until the election of a new municipal council on 7 February 1923.\nPost-annexation history.\nAfter 1920, Moresnet shared the history of Eupen-Malmedy. Germany briefly re\u2011annexed the area during World War II, but it returned to Belgium in 1944. Since 1973, Kelmis has formed a part of the German\u2011speaking community of Belgium. During 1977, Kelmis absorbed the neighbouring communes of Neu\u2011Moresnet and Hergenrath.\nA small museum in Kelmis, the \"Museum Vieille Montagne\", includes exhibits on Neutral Moresnet. Of the 60 border markers for the territory, more than 50 are still standing.\nAs a company, Vieille Montagne survived Neutral Moresnet. It continues to exist as VMZINC, a part of Union Mini\u00e8re, the latter renamed in 2001 as Umicore, a global materials company.\nList of executive officers.\nList of mayors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57820", "revid": "51045739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57820", "title": "Donnie Darko", "text": "2001 American film by Richard Kelly\nDonnie Darko is a 2001 American science fiction psychological thriller film written and directed by Richard Kelly in his directorial debut, and produced by Flower Films. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Katharine Ross, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, and Seth Rogen in his film debut. Set in October 1988, the film follows Donnie Darko (Gyllenhaal), a troubled teenager who inadvertently escapes a bizarre accident by sleepwalking. He has visions of Frank, a mysterious figure in a rabbit costume who informs him that the world will end in 28 days.\nDevelopment began in late 1997 when Kelly had graduated from film school and started writing scripts. He took an early idea of a jet engine falling onto a house with no one knowing its origin and built the story around it. Kelly insisted on directing the film himself and struggled to secure backing from producers until 2000, when Pandora Cinema and Barrymore's Flower Films agreed to produce it on a $4.5 million budget. Filming took 28 days in the summer of 2000, mostly in California. The soundtrack features a cover of \"Mad World\" by Tears for Fears by American musicians Gary Jules and Michael Andrews, which went to No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks and was the Christmas number 1 in 2003.\n\"Donnie Darko\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2001, followed by a limited theatrical release on October 26. Because the film's advertising featured a crashing plane and the September 11 attacks had occurred a month and a half before, it was scarcely advertised. This affected its box office performance and it grossed just $517,375 in its initial run. However, the film gained a cult following, and after reissues, it went on to gross $7.5 million worldwide, and earned more than $10 million in US home video sales. It was listed No.\u00a02 in \"Empire\"'s \"50 Greatest Independent Films of All Time,\" and No.\u00a053 in \"Empire\"'s \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time.\" Kelly released \"\" in 2004. The film was adapted into a stage production in 2007 and a sequel, \"S. Darko\", followed in 2009 without Kelly's involvement. In 2021, he announced that work on a new sequel is in progress.\nPlot.\nOn October 2, 1988, troubled teenager Donald \"Donnie\" Darko sleepwalks outside, led by a mysterious voice. Once outside, he meets a figure named Frank in a monstrous rabbit costume. Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in precisely 28 days. Donnie wakes up the next morning on a local golf course and returns home to discover a jet engine has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the FAA investigators do not know its origin.\nOver the next several days, Donnie continues to have visions of Frank, and his parents, Eddie and Rose, send him to psychotherapist Dr. Thurman. Thurman believes Donnie is detached from reality and that his visions of Frank are \"daylight hallucinations,\" symptomatic of paranoid schizophrenia. Frank asks Donnie if he believes in time travel, and Donnie in turn asks his science teacher, Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff. Monnitoff gives Donnie \"The Philosophy of Time Travel\", a book written by Roberta Sparrow, a former science teacher at the school who is now a seemingly senile old woman living outside of town, known to the local teenagers as Grandma Death.\nFrank begins to influence Donnie's actions through his sleepwalking episodes, including causing him to flood his high school by breaking a water main, to which Donnie almost gets caught. Donnie later starts dating Gretchen Ross, who has recently moved into town with her mother under a new identity to escape her violent stepfather. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer begins teaching \"attitude lessons\" taken from local motivational speaker Jim Cunningham, but Donnie rebels against these, leading to friction between Kitty and Rose. Kitty arranges for Cunningham to speak at a school assembly, where Donnie insults him. He later finds Cunningham's wallet and address. Gretchen and Donnie go on a movie theater date, where Gretchen falls asleep and Frank reveals himself to be a teenager with his right eye hollow and bleeding. Frank then convinces Donnie to burn down Cunningham's house, which he does while Gretchen is at the theatre. Firefighters discover a hoard of child pornography at the burned remains. Cunningham is arrested, and Kitty, who wishes to testify in his defense, asks Rose to replace her as chaperone for their daughters' dance troupe on its trip to Los Angeles.\nWith Rose in Los Angeles and Eddie away for business, Donnie and Elizabeth hold a Halloween costume party to celebrate Elizabeth's acceptance to Harvard. At the party, Gretchen arrives distraught as her mother has gone missing, and she and Donnie have sex for the first time. When Donnie realizes that Frank's prophesied end of the world is only hours away, he takes Gretchen and two other friends to see Sparrow. Instead of Sparrow, they find two high school bullies, Seth and Ricky, who are trying to rob Sparrow's home. Donnie, Seth, and Ricky fight in the road in front of her house just as Sparrow returns home. The bullies and Donnie's two friends leave when an oncoming car runs over Gretchen, killing her. The driver turns out to be Elizabeth's boyfriend, Frank Anderson, wearing the same rabbit costume from Donnie's visions. Angered, and realizing what's happening, Donnie shoots Frank in the right eye with his father's gun and walks home carrying Gretchen's body.\nDonnie returns home in the morning as a vortex forms over his house. He borrows one of his parents' cars, loads Gretchen's body into it, and drives to a nearby ridge that overlooks the town. There, he watches as the plane carrying Rose and the dance troupe home from Los Angeles gets caught in the vortex's wake, violently ripping off one of its engines and sending it back in time. Events of the previous 28 days unwind. Donnie wakes up in his bedroom, recognizes the date is October 2, and laughs as the jet engine falls into his bedroom, killing him. Around town, those whose lives Donnie would have touched wake up from troubled dreams. Gretchen rides by the Darko home the following day and learns of Donnie's death. Gretchen asks the neighbor, \"What was his name?\" Gretchen and Rose exchange glances and wave as if they know each other but cannot remember from where.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie Darko\nProduction.\nWriting.\nThe film originated in late 1997 when Kelly, aged 22, had graduated from USC School of Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles. While earning money as a client's assistant at a post-production house, he thought about his future and decided to write his first feature-length script. The task frightened Kelly at first because he did not want to produce something that was poor in quality. It was not until October 1998 when Kelly felt the time was right to write a script and wrote \"Donnie Darko\" in 28 days, the same time period as the film. The time of year influenced Kelly to set the film around Halloween.\nKelly set out to write something \"ambitious, personal, and nostalgic\" about the 1980s which \"pushed the envelope by combining science fiction with a coming-of-age tale\". The \"New York Times\" homed in on the 1980s coming-of-age story aspect by observing the influence of John Hughes, noting the \"ineffectual\" adults and the fact that Donnie's \"suffering is a way to make him more sensitive\". Kelly summarized the script was to be \"an amusing and poignant recollection of suburban America in the Reagan era\". He recalled a news story that he had read as a child, which he later called an urban legend, about a large piece of ice falling from the wing of a plane and crashing through a boy's bedroom, who was not there at the time and thus escaped death. Kelly used this to develop an initial idea of a jet engine falling onto a house and no one could determine its origin. He then built the rest of the script with the aim of resolving the mystery at the end while taking a \"most interesting voyage\" to get there, although at this point he knew the plane was to be one that Donnie's mother was on and was from a different dimension. At one point Kelly considered replacing the jet engine with a piece of ice, like he had read. He based the film's concept of time travel and alternate universes from reading \"A Brief History of Time\" by Stephen Hawking.\nKelly was adamant about setting the film in 1988, thinking it would be fresh to explore the era and depict a society that he had not seen in a film before. Later he admitted that he felt pressured to make the setting more contemporary. However, he could not figure out how to make the story work in such a setting and retained the original setting. The first draft had Donnie originally wake up at a shopping mall, rather than a golf course. Kelly got ideas for Donnie's experiences of paranoid schizophrenia from researching the topic online. He considered such a broad disorder that is difficult to define was \"a great way to ground a supernatural story\" in a scientific sense. The first draft was between 145\u2013150 pages; Kelly did not change what he had initially written as he was aware that stopping to review it would have caused him to second guess himself. He presented it to producer Sean McKittrick, who recalled he \"had never read anything like this before\", and helped refine the script while making the story understandable enough. After two more drafts were written, the pair finalized a 128-page script. Kelly felt that had he clarified the film's ending any further, \"the film would collapse under its own pretension\", and credited McKittrick, Juvonen, and Gyllenhaal, whom he said were \"aggressive\" and \"vocal\" in not letting there be one simple answer to the plot.\nThere are some autobiographical links with Kelly and the film; he said there is \"plenty of me\" in Donnie's character. Kelly grew up in Midlothian, Virginia, also a suburban town, where a local woman called Grandma Death would stand by the road and constantly open and close her mailbox. Kelly also incorporated the moment he almost ran over a homeless person while driving, arguments with his school teachers over the curriculum, and his personal experiences with sleepwalking into the narrative. The word \"fuck-ass\", used in the Darko family dinner scene, was something that two of Kelly's film school friends used during their occasional exchange of insults. Frank was to be a rabbit since the beginning, but Kelly was unsure whether the character originated from a dream or his longtime interest in the animal novel \"Watership Down\" by Richard Adams. The novel was to be taught in Karen's English class after the school had censored Graham Greene from her curriculum; it was a subplot that was abandoned in the theatrical version but included in the director's cut.\nDevelopment.\nKelly knew that the film's complicated story would be difficult to pitch to producers without a script, so he had producers read it first before discussing it with them further. While pitching the script, Kelly and McKittrick insisted that Kelly direct the film, which hindered its chances at being picked up. Kelly recalled 1999 being a year of \"meeting after meeting\", all of which ended in rejection, and at this point declared the film \"dead\". McKittrick said \"Donnie Darko\" was \"the challenging script in town that everybody wanted to make, but was too afraid\".\nA turning point arrived when agents John Campisi and Rob Paris at the Creative Artists Agency took an interest in the script and signed Kelly on. Kelly said his \"jaw was on the floor\" at the unexpected offer, which greatly boosted the chances of having the film made with the agency's stamp on the script. This led to further meetings with several prominent individuals, including Francis Ford Coppola, Ben Stiller, William Horberg, and Betty Thomas. Kelly's meeting with Coppola was particularly influential, as Coppola drew his attention to one of Karen's lines after she is fired\u2014\"The kids have to figure it all out these days, because the parents, they don't have a clue\"\u2014and Kelly recalled: \"He slid the binder down the big table and very dramatically said: 'That's what your whole movie's about right there.'\" Early on Vince Vaughn was offered the role of Donnie, but he turned it down as he felt he was too old for the part. Mark Wahlberg was also approached, but he insisted that he should play Donnie with a lisp.\nDevelopment progressed in early 2000, when actor Jason Schwartzman expressed an interest in the script and agreed to play as Donnie. Kelly said this moment \"legitimized me as a director\" and recalled \"all of a sudden people came out of the woodwork, it was alive again\". Around this time Pandora Cinema offered a $2.5 million production budget, and Schwartzman's agent sent the script to Nancy Juvonen, who co-owned Flower Films with actress Drew Barrymore. The pair liked the script and wanted to get involved, which led Kelly and McKittrick to a meeting with the pair in March 2000 on the set of \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000), where Barrymore was filming. Barrymore agreed to play as Karen, and Flower Films agreed to increase the budget to $4.5 million. Kelly later called the sum the \"bare minimum\" to make the film.\nAfter securing enough financial backing, pre-production accelerated and filming was booked for the summer of 2000 and scheduled to accommodate Barrymore, who had just one week's availability. However, by July, Schwartzman had withdrawn due to scheduling conflicts. This led to an \"exciting\" period for Kelly who met several hopefuls, including Patrick Fugit and Lucas Black. Gyllenhaal, who was in Los Angeles auditioning for parts, was \"mesmerised\" by the script and recalled pulling over the side of the road to finish reading it. Filming was scheduled to start in one month, during which Kelly worked with Gyllenhaal to amend parts of his dialogue. Gyllenhaal was given \"a lot of room\" to incorporate his own ideas, including making his voice sound like \"a child talking to its blanket\" when he talks to Frank as he is a source of comfort for Donnie. Gyllenhaal also had the idea to have his real-life sister Maggie star as Elizabeth Darko. Jolene Purdy's audition for Cherita was the first of her career. Kelly credits Juvonen for being instrumental for getting Wyle and Swayze on board.\nDesign.\nKelly recalled several people showing him drawings of what they thought Frank should look like, describing them like an Easter bunny. He wanted Frank to be \"disturbing and animalistic\". He produced initial sketches of Frank's face and presented them to production designer Alex Hammond, who then made front and side drawings of the mask and sketches of the full suit. Kelly also said that the 1972 novel \"Watership Down\" was also the inspiration for Frank. The design was given to costume designer April Ferry who built the costume from scratch and hired a sculptor to create Frank's altered grin. Kelly insisted that Frank's face had to disturb people and create an intense response with the audience. The costume was first presented to the cast and crew at Loyola High School, shortly after filming began. Although Duval wore the suit for almost every scene, a director stepped in for the initial shoot. Kelly recalled, \"Everyone just got quiet [...] like, this is really intense. So I knew it was working, and I felt the sense of relief.\" Kelly wanted Frank's voice to sound as if he was speaking through liquid and \"has the power of the ocean\", and recalled spending a considerable amount of time with the sound designer to achieve the effect on Duval's voice.\nThere was not enough money in the budget for Ferry to dress everyone in 1980s clothing, so she suggested to Kelly that the pupils should wear school uniforms. Kelly agreed, feeling that it would help to portray the idea of Donnie challenging conformity and the educational system.\nKelly chose Steven Poster as cinematographer from going through a stack of resumes and noted Poster had shot \"Someone to Watch Over Me\" (1987) for director Ridley Scott; to Kelly, this meant \"you can retire, you made it.\" Poster had not shot a feature film in two years, and Kelly had to persuade him to accept the job for a reduced fee. Poster had Kelly dissect the script for him at their initial meeting: \"We read every word, every sentence, every page, every scene in the movie. I made him justify to me why he wanted that in the movie. I wanted him to be able to tell me what each scene was going to tell the audience.\" Although the task created arguments between them, once complete the pair knew exactly what was needed to make the film. Poster's reputation and connections with Panavision allowed Kelly to shoot with \"an unprecedented amount\" of filming equipment from them at a reduced price. For night time shots, Kelly showed the crew scenes from \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" (1986) for its \"idealised ... burnished nostalgia\". The polished cinematography in \"Donnie Darko\" \"creates a feeling of hyper-reality, suggesting that all is not what it seems.\"\nThe film was publicized at the Sundance Film Festival as being the first to feature significant digital effects. Kelly wanted to use them only \"when absolutely necessary\" and have them relate to the story, such as the water barrier seen between Donnie and Frank in his bathroom. The liquid spears that emerge from people's torsos are reminiscent of the water tentacle in \"The Abyss\" (1989), and can be seen as a representation of a character's psyche. Alternatively, they demonstrate the \"metaphysical idea of predestination\", suggesting Donnie is being guided, perhaps by God. Kelly got the idea from the on-screen chalkboard that American football commentator John Madden used to illustrate the movements of the players during a replay. Incidentally, the spears first appear when Donnie is watching a football game on television. The school flooding was inspired by a surreal photomontage by Scott Mutter, in which a giant escalator descends into a rough sea.\nFilming.\nFilming was completed in 28 days, the same length of time as the film's events, in July and August 2000. Most of the film was shot in Long Beach, California; Kelly was uninterested in shooting elsewhere because he wanted to portray a strong suburban feel. The ongoing commercial actors strike had created a shortage of work, so additional actors and crew members willing to work for scale were hired for the film. The golf course scenes were filmed at Virginia Country Club and the school scenes were shot at Loyola High School. The opening scene with Donnie waking up was the first to be filmed; it was shot at sunrise on the Angeles Crest Highway. The theatre marquee was shot at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica. Kelly lost 20\u00a0lbs from the stress of filming to a tight schedule, plus the pressure of justifying himself to others that he could direct the film. He openly stated to the actors that he was inexperienced and had no idea how to address them properly, so he talked to them like they were his friends.\nProduction designer Alex Hammond bought the jet engine used in the film for $10,000. The scene where it falls onto Donnie's bedroom was done in one shot. The shell of it was rigged above the set and sent through using an air pressure gun. Poster remembered people telling Kelly that jet engines do not fall off planes, but during production a \"dishwasher-sized engine part\" fell from the engine of a Boeing 747 and landed on a beach. Swayze frosted his hair specifically for his part and the infomercial clips were filmed at his ranch.\nKelly's goal was to \"seduce the audience\" from the film's opening shot. He was attentive to details and spoke to his transportation coordinator to ensure all cars in the film were era-specific. He wanted to avoid going \"too kitsch\" with the style and costumes and retain a conservative style of the Virginia suburb. The long shots at the school with \"Head Over Heels\" playing angered the production and line managers at first, who thought it was \"an indulgent music video\" that lacked dialogue and did nothing to advance the story. Upon viewing the finished sequence, they had changed their minds. Kelly choreographed the scene's action to the song before the rights to use it had been acquired. Sparkle Motion's performance scene was one of the more difficult shots for Poster, who used smoke to give the appearance that light is there and to achieve silhouettes of the girls on stage.\nThe film was shot with a Panavision Panastar camera and in anamorphic format, which involves filming in widescreen onto standard 35\u00a0mm film. Despite its setbacks and the need to have twice as much light, Kelly was adamant. Poster suggested using Kodak 800 ASA film stock, which people said looked \"terrible and grainy\", but he convinced the producers that anamorphic would reduce the amount of work with low ceiling lights that were common in the locations used for filming as they would be cut from the shot. The anamorphic process required Swayze to kneel down for some scenes so he could fit in the image. Early on Kelly made a promise to Sam Bauer that he would edit his first feature film when he had the opportunity, but Pandora Cinema disagreed with the choice initially. Kelly recalled he and McKittrick had to \"fight like hell\" to get Bauer onboard, and eventually Pandora agreed. The water barrier effects were produced by Kelly Carlton for $5,000.\nSoundtrack.\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by San Diego musician and songwriter Michael Andrews. Kelly knew that the film's limited budget prevented him from hiring either \"Thomas Newman or Danny Elfman\" to compose the score for the film, so he decided to look for a composer who happens to be someone \"very young, hungry, and really talented\". Andrews was recommended by Juvonen's brother, Jim.\nThe film's opening sequence is set to \"The Killing Moon\" by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. The continuous shot of introduction of Donnie's high school prominently features the song \"Head over Heels\" by Tears for Fears. Samantha's dance group \"Sparkle Motion\" performs to \"Notorious\" by Duran Duran. When the scene was originally shot, the group danced to \"West End Girls\" by Pet Shop Boys. However, the rights to the song could not be obtained for the final release. \"Under the Milky Way\" by The Church is played after Donnie and Gretchen emerge from his bedroom during the party. \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" by Joy Division also appears in the film diegetically during the party and shots of Donnie and Gretchen upstairs. Despite the film being set in 1988, the version played was not released until 1995. In the director's cut, the music in the opening sequence is replaced by \"Never Tear Us Apart\" by INXS; \"Under the Milky Way\" is moved to the scene of Donnie and Eddie driving home from Donnie's meeting with his therapist; and \"The Killing Moon\" is played as Gretchen and Donnie return to the party from Donnie's parents' room.\nThe film's end sequence features a piano-driven cover of \"Mad World\" by English new wave group Tears for Fears, sung by American musician Gary Jules, a schoolfriend of Andrews. In 2003, the cover of \"Mad World\" was released as a single that was No. 1 in the United Kingdom for three weeks, during which it was the country's Christmas No. 1 of that year.\nRelease.\nTheatrical release.\n\"Donnie Darko\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, on January 19, 2001. Kelly said it took around six months to secure a theatrical release; at one point, he was close to having it on the premium cable and satellite television network Starz. Donnie firing a gun became one of Kelly's biggest problems while finding a distributor, as the Columbine High School massacre from 1999 raised concerns of the film promoting teenage suicide. The licensed songs in the film also presented problems as they had yet to be paid for, causing a risk of them being removed for a wide release. Kelly was also advised to cut 30 minutes from the film. Despite the problems, Newmarket Films agreed to buy the film and organise a theatrical release in a service deal with IFC Films. Kelly involved Barrymore in the negotiations and recalled getting her to \"beg\" Newmarket for a deal, who had initially considered a straight-to-video release for it. Kelly credits Christopher Nolan and his wife Emma Thomas in securing the deal, after \"Memento\" producer Aaron Ryder arranged a private screening of \"Donnie Darko\" for Newmarket executives Chris Ball and Will Tyrer and encouraged the pair to distribute it.\nWith a deal secured, the crew spent the summer of 2001 revisiting the film; Ryder said it was to get the film \"in the best possible shape we could\", but recalled the difficulty in the task. This involved an additional day of shooting to clarify some plot holes, such as Ryder's suggestion of including shots of Frank in the \"Mad World\" sequence. Nolan and Thomas had advised Kelly to insert title cards throughout the film to break down the events leading up to October 30, 1988, which he did.\n\"Donnie Darko\" was theatrically released from October 26, 2001, to its peak of 58 theaters across the United States; its premiere was held at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. The film grossed $110,494 on its opening weekend, ranking No. 34 on the box office. The film was released six weeks after the September 11 attacks and its trailer featured an accident involving an aircraft, which affected its chances of box office success. Kelly said the film was not \"attractive to people in that emotional, very deeply traumatizing chapter in our history\". Newmarket president Bob Berney said \"the bleak mood and the timing\" was the cause of the film's failure at the box office, and that critics failed to understand or accept the film for what it is. \"The mood filtered through everything.\" When its theatrical run ended on April 11, 2002, the film had grossed $517,375. After reissues, it went on to gross $7.6 million worldwide, recouping its budget. Despite its initial poor box office showing, the film attracted a devoted fan base and gained a cult following. Following its release on home video in March 2002, the Pioneer Theatre in New York City began midnight screenings of \"Donnie Darko\" that ran for 28 consecutive months.\nUK release.\nIn October 2002, the film was released in the UK, which generated renewed critical and commercial interest in the film. It sold 300,000 tickets within the first six weeks of its release, based mostly on word-of-mouth marketing, and grossed the equivalent of $2.5 million in its theatrical run. Its UK distributor Metrodome Distribution organised They Made Me Do It, an art exhibition that ran for 28 days at cafe bar \"Dream Bags Jaguar Shoes\"&lt;ref name=\"ratings.food.gov.uk/622420\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"sxswlondon/847d2a8f\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in Shoreditch, London. The project involved several graffiti artists given 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds to complete a work inspired by the film.\nBook.\nKelly published \"The Donnie Darko Book\" in October 2003. Jake Gyllenhaal wrote the foreword, in which he comments on the confusing nature of the film. The book includes an interview with Kelly who discusses the process of making and marketing the film, and questions about his personal life. The full shooting script of the film is included, plus several pages from \"The Philosophy of Time Travel\" and photographs and concept sketches such as Frank's mask and slides from Cunningham's school presentation.\nPromotion.\nThe official \"Donnie Darko\" website, donniedarko.com (which can still be found archived https://), was an interactive experience and marketing tool for the film. The website was riddled with puzzles and secrets and contained never-before-seen information about the universe of the film, including information about the fate of many of the characters after the film ends. James Beck has commented on the website's validity as a narrative in and of itself due to the website's introduction of new content while reinforcing themes from the movie like fluidity of time, exemplified by the website's lack of concern for the chronology of the movie. Beck further argues that the Donnie Darko website differs from most other promotional websites in that it treats the user not as an outside viewer, but rather as someone within the universe of the film, creating an experience rather than an advertisement.\nHome media.\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film for home video several times. The first was in March 2002 on VHS and DVD formats, of which the latter included bonus material, including audio commentaries, trailers and TV spots, concept art, galleries, and a virtual guide through \"The Philosophy of Time\". Berney declared the film \"a runaway hit\" on DVD, the sales in the US alone brought in over $10 million.\nIn 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray, containing the theatrical and director's cuts. This was released in the UK in 2010. A four-disc set was released in 2011 to commemorate its tenth anniversary. In December 2016, Arrow Films released a limited edition Blu-ray and DVD set in the UK, taken from a new 4K scan of the original print, and supervised and approved by Kelly. It was released in the US in 2017.\nIn April 2021, Arrow Films released a two-disc Ultra HD Blu-ray box set containing both cuts in 4K resolution restorations from the original negatives, supervised by Kelly and Poster. This set includes a poster, postcards, and a 100-page book.\nDirector's cut.\nThe idea to produce a director's cut of the film originated in late 2003, when Kelly and Berney attended the first-anniversary screening at the Pioneer Theatre in New York City. \"\" premiered on 29\u00a0May 2004, at the Seattle International Film Festival, followed by screenings in New York City and Los Angeles on 23\u00a0July. The tickets sold out within the day for the Seattle International Film Festival premiere, grossing nearly $33,000 over a five-day period. This cut includes 20\u00a0minutes of extra footage and an altered soundtrack. \nThe director's cut DVD was released on 15\u00a0February 2005, in single- and double-disc versions, the latter being available in a standard DVD case or in a limited edition that also features a lenticular slipcase, whose central image alternates between Donnie and Frank depending on the viewing angle. Most additional features are exclusive to the two-DVD set, excerpts from the storyboard, a 52\u00a0minute production diary, \"#1\u00a0fan video\", a \"cult following\" video interviewing British fans, and the new director's cut trailer. The single-DVD edition was also released as a giveaway with copies of the British \"Sunday Times\" newspaper on 19\u00a0February 2006.\nThe DVD of the director's cut includes text of the in-universe book, \"The Philosophy of Time Travel\", written by Roberta Sparrow, which Donnie is given and reads in the film. The text expands on the philosophical and scientific concepts much of the film's plot revolves around, and has been seen as a way to understand the film better than from its theatrical release. As outlined by a \"Salon\" article, drawing from the book's text, much of the film takes place in an unstable \"tangent universe\" that is physically connected to the \"primary universe\" by a wormhole (the entrance to which is the vortex seen at the end of the film) and which is an exact duplicate of the primary, except for an extra metal object known as an \"artifact\" \u2014 which in this case is the jet engine. If the artifact is not sent [back] to the primary universe by the designated \"living receiver\" (Donnie) within 28\u00a0days, the primary universe will be destroyed upon the collapse of the tangent universe into a black hole. To aid in this task, the living receiver is given super-human abilities such as foresight, physical strength, and elemental powers, but at the cost of troubling visions and paranoia, while the \"manipulated living\" (all who live around the \"receiver\") support him in unnatural ways, setting up a domino-like chain of events encouraging him to return the artifact. The \"manipulated dead\" (those who die within the tangent universe, like Frank and Gretchen) are more aware than the manipulated living, having the ability to travel through time, and will set an \"ensurance trap:\" a scenario which leaves the receiver no choice but to save the primary universe.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 88% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Richard Kelly's debut feature \"Donnie Darko\" is a daring, original vision, packed with jarring ideas and intelligence and featuring a remarkable performance from Jake Gyllenhaal as the troubled title character.\" Metacritic gives the theatrical version of the film a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable\" reviews.\nAndrew Johnson cited the film in \"Us Weekly\", as one of the outstanding films at Sundance in 2001, describing it as \"a heady blend of science fiction, spirituality, and teen angst\". Jean Oppenheimer of \"New Times (LA)\" praised the film, saying, \"Like gathering storm clouds, \"Donnie Darko\" creates an atmosphere of eerie calm and mounting menace\u2014[and] stands as one of the most exceptional movies of 2001.\" Writing for ABC Australia, Megan Spencer called the movie \"menacing, dreamy and exciting\" and noted \"it could take you to a deeply emotional place lying dormant in your soul\". Roger Ebert gave the theatrical version of the film two and a half stars out of four, but later gave the director's cut three stars out of four.\nOther critics like Sam Adams called the movie an apparent \"big mess\", citing incoherent plot, sloppy writing, and an uneven tone. Adams also took issue with the \"seemingly irrelevant\" but oft-referenced setting in a suburban America in the 1980s, claiming that it \"serves as another example of the movie's struggle to find identity\". Another review from the \"San Antonio Current\" lauds the build-up, citing vast build of mysteries with compelling characters, but claims the movie's ending \"leaves much to be desired\", calling it cheap and anti-climactic. The film has been praised for its 1980s nostalgia.\nAccolades.\nIn 2025, it was one of the films voted for the \"Readers' Choice\" edition of \"The New York Times\"' list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century,\" finishing at number 113.\nSequels.\n\"S. Darko\".\nA 2009 sequel, \"S. Darko\", set seven years afterwards, centers on the now 18-year-old Sam, Donnie's younger sister. Sam is troubled by her brother's death and begins to have problems with sleepwalking, along with strange dreams that hint at an impending major catastrophe. The sequel received extremely negative reviews. Kelly said he had no involvement in the sequel as he no longer owns the rights to the original. In 2017, Kelly said that he resents being asked about the sequel and that he had never seen it. Actress Daveigh Chase and producer Adam Fields were the only creative links between \"S. Darko\" and the original film.\nNew sequel.\nIn 2017, Kelly revealed that he had ideas for a new sequel that is \"much bigger and more ambitious\" than the original. In January 2021, he announced that \"an enormous amount of work\" had been done on the script. He was inspired to do so after a 2010 meeting with James Cameron, who found the film \"disturbing\" and had Kelly explain what happened to Donnie at the end of the film. Cameron suggested to Kelly that he continue working on the project, which made Kelly realize that \"there was really something big, something epic that could be done.\"\nIn other media.\nMarcus Stern, associate director of the American Repertory Theater, directed a stage adaptation of \"Donnie Darko\" at the Zero Arrow Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the fall of 2007. It ran from October 27 until November 18, 2007, with opening night scheduled near Halloween.\nAn article written by the production drama team says the director and production team planned to \"embrace the challenge to make the fantastical elements come alive on stage\". In 2004, Stern adapted and directed Kelly's screenplay for a graduate student production at the American Repertory Theater's Institute for Advanced Theater Training (I.A.T.T./M.X.A.T.).\nA playable skin based on Frank was released in \"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\" in October 2021.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It provides navigational support, data input, hyperlinks, text and image presentation, and forms, much like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It preceded the use of other markup languages used with WAP, such as XHTML and HTML itself, which achieved dominance as processing power in mobile devices increased.\nWML history.\nBuilding on Openwave's HDML, Nokia's \"Tagged Text Markup Language\" (TTML) and Ericsson's proprietary markup language for mobile content, the WAP Forum created the WML 1.1 standard in 1998. WML 2.0 was specified in 2001, but has not been widely adopted. It was an attempt at bridging WML and XHTML Basic before the WAP 2.0 spec was finalized. In the end, XHTML Mobile Profile became the markup language used in WAP 2.0. The newest WML version in active use is 1.3.\nThe first company to launch a public WML site was Dutch mobile phone network operator Telfort in October 1999 and the first company in the world to launch the Nokia 7110. The Telfort WML site was created and developed as side project to test the device's capabilities by a billing engineer called Christopher Bee and National Deployment Manager, Euan McLeod. The WML site consists of four pages in both Dutch and English that contained many grammatical errors in Dutch as the two developers were unaware the WML was configured on the Nokia 7110 as the home page and neither were native Dutch speakers.\nWML markup.\nWML documents are XML documents that validate against the WML DTD (Document Type Definition)\n. The W3C Markup Validation service (http://validator.w3.org/) can be used to validate WML documents (they are validated against their declared document type).\nFor example, the following WML page could be saved as \"example.wml\":\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC \"-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN\"\n \"http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml\" &gt;\n&lt;wml&gt;\n &lt;head&gt;\n &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /&gt;\n &lt;/head&gt;\n &lt;card id=\"main\" title=\"First Card\"&gt;\n &lt;p mode=\"wrap\"&gt;This is a sample WML page.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/card&gt;\n&lt;/wml&gt;\nA WML document is known as a \"deck\". Data in the deck is structured into one or more \"cards\" (pages), each of which represents a single interaction with the user.\nWML decks are stored on an ordinary web server configured to serve the text/vnd.wap.wml MIME type in addition to plain HTML and variants. The WML cards when requested by a device are accessed by a bridge (WAP gateway), which sits between mobile devices and the World Wide Web, passing pages from one to the other much like a proxy. The gateways send the WML pages on in a form suitable for mobile device reception (WAP Binary XML). This process is hidden from the phone, so it may access the page in the same way as a browser accesses HTML, using a URL (for example, http://example.com/foo.wml). (Provided the mobile phone operator has not specifically locked the phone to prevent access of user-specified URLs.)\nWML has a scaled-down set of procedural elements, which can be used by the author to control navigation to other cards.\nMobile devices are moving towards allowing more XHTML and even standard HTML as processing power in handsets increases. These standards are concerned with formatting and presentation. They do not however address cell-phone or mobile device hardware interfacing in the same way as WML.\nWML capability in desktop browsers.\nThe Presto layout engine (used by Opera before its switch to Blink) understood WML natively. Mozilla-based browsers (Firefox (before version 57), SeaMonkey, MicroB) could interpret WML through the WMLBrowser add-on. Google Chrome can also interpret WML via two extensions: WML and FireMobileSimulator.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, its population was 206,873. The county seat is Prosser, and its most populous city is Kennewick. The Columbia River demarcates the county's north, south, and east boundaries.\nBenton County was created from what were then larger versions of Klickitat County and Yakima County on March 8, 1905, and was named after Missouri statesman Thomas Hart Benton.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.4%) is water. The highest point of land elevation within the county is the summit of Rattlesnake Mountain at 3,527 feet; and the lowest point of land elevation is along the southwestern shore of Crow Butte at 265 feet (fluctuates due to level of Columbia River).\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 175,177 people, 65,304 households, and 45,699 families residing in the county.

The racial makeup of the county was 82.4% white, 2.7% Asian, 1.3% black or African American, 0.9% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific islander, 9.0% from other races, and 3.6% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 18.7% of the population. In terms of ancestry, 22.3% were German, 13.4% were English, 12.5% were Irish, and 7.9% were American.\nOf the 65,304 households, 36.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.8% were married couples living together, 11.1% had a female householder with no husband present, 30.0% were non-families, and 24.3% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.17.

The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 98.70 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.30 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $47,044, and the median income for a family was $54,146. Males had a median income of $45,556 versus $27,232 for females. The per capita income for the county was $21,301. About 7.80% of families and 10.30% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.30% of those under age 18 and 6.90% of those age 65 or over.\nGovernment.\nBenton County is one of the 33 counties in Washington that operates under the non-chartered \"commission\" or \"plural executive\" form of government. Three commissioners share administrative aegis with several other partisan officials independently elected to four-year terms of office. Judges of the superior court are also independently elected. In Benton County, the commissioners appoint a county administrator to oversee all departments that do not fall under other elected officials.\nThe County government is seated in Prosser, with many departments having satellite and auxiliary offices and facilities in Richland, Kennewick, and elsewhere. An attempt to move the county seat from Prosser to Kennewick resulted in a November 1984 ballot measure, which had 54.4 percent approval but failed to meet the required 60 percent threshold.\nThere are five incorporated cities within Benton County. The two larger cities\u2014Kennewick and Richland\u2014employ the \"council-manager\" form of government where the mayor is elected from the city council and serves a more ceremonial role, whereby direct administration of the city is the responsibility of the city manager. The three smaller cities\u2014Benton City, Prosser, and West Richland\u2014use the \"mayor-council\" form of government where the mayor is the chief administrator of the city and is directly elected by the citizens. In Washington, a majority of cities use the mayor-council form, but the council-manager structure is common among medium-sized municipalities.\nNumerous special purpose districts with varying degrees of taxing and administrative authority such as port authorities and school districts oversee local responsibilities that are not a part of county or city governance.\nEducation.\nBenton County is serviced by six public school districts and a few smaller private schools.\nPublic education.\nDelta High School, located in Pasco, is a public high school specializing in the \"STEM\" fields of study (science, technology, engineering, mathematics). Delta High School is a collaborative venture of the Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland school districts, and is located in neighboring Franklin County, Washington. Prosser High School is located much closer to the county seat of Benton County.\nHigher education.\nTwo public college branch campuses are located in Benton County, each in Richland:\nRecreation.\nThe Tri-City area's climate and distance to other metropolitan areas has made it a destination for tourism, particularly in outdoor recreation.\nGolf courses.\nBenton County is home to seven publicly accessible golf courses:\nA private golf and country club, Meadow Springs, is also located in Richland.\nSports.\nThe Tri-City Americans are a major junior hockey team and member of the Western Hockey League. They play at the Toyota Center in Kennewick. The Americans began as the Calgary Buffaloes in 1966, and after stints in Billings, Nanaimo, and New Westminster, moved to the Tri-Cities for the 1988\u201389 season where they were rebranded as the \"Americans\".\nPublic lands.\nPublic lands acreage account for about one-third of the total land area of Benton County. The most significant holding is the United States Department of Energy's Hanford Site, most of which has restricted public access. Hanford is a hub for \"nuclear tourism\" due to its role in the Manhattan Project and Cold War. Part of the Hanford Site acreage is also part of the Hanford Reach National Monument, which was established in 2000 by a presidential proclamation. Like with most of the rest of Hanford, most of the National Monument within Benton County is restricted from general public use.\nOther federal land holdings in the county include small areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management, notably an aggregation along the Horse Heaven Hills south of Benton City that is popular with hikers; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service-owned islands and shorelands that are parts of the Umatilla and McNary National Wildlife Refugues; and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers properties along the Columbia River, most of which are managed for habitat and recreation by the county and cities.\nState-owned public lands in Benton County include the Department of Fish and Wildlife's Rattlesnake Slope Wildlife Recreation Area north of Benton City. Benton County and the cities also own numerous parklands and open spaces, most notable the Badger Mountain Centennial Preserve, a hiking destination managed by the County located south of Richland which draws over 200,000 visits per year.\nViticulture.\nThe area of south-central Washington occupied by Benton County has been known primarily as an agricultural hub since its settlement. The rise of viticulture has had a profound impact on the agricultural and tourism industries over the past two decades, and has in many ways reshaped the reputation of the region.\nThe Yakima Valley AVA, part of which is located in Benton County, was the first American Viticultural Area established within Washington state, gaining the recognition in 1983. As the Washington wine industry began to focus more on \"terroir\", three sub-appellations have been created for areas within the Yakima Valley AVA that demonstrate unique microclimates and soil conditions which crafted different wines from their neighboring areas. The Red Mountain AVA, which lies in its entirety on Benton County, was created in 2001. The county also includes part of the Horse Heaven Hills AVA which is part of the larger Columbia Valley AVA.\nCommunities.\nCities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther unincorporated communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGhost towns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An extended real-valued function formula_1 is upper (respectively, lower) semicontinuous at a point formula_2 if, roughly speaking, the function values for arguments near formula_2 are not much higher (respectively, lower) than formula_4 Briefly, a function on a domain formula_5 is lower semi-continuous if its epigraph formula_6 is closed in formula_7, and upper semi-continuous if formula_8 is lower semi-continuous.\nA function is continuous if and only if it is both upper and lower semicontinuous. If we take a continuous function and increase its value at a certain point formula_2 to formula_10 for some formula_11, then the result is upper semicontinuous; if we decrease its value to formula_12 then the result is lower semicontinuous.\nThe notion of upper and lower semicontinuous function was first introduced and studied by Ren\u00e9 Baire in his thesis in 1899.\nDefinitions.\nAssume throughout that formula_5 is a topological space and formula_14 is a function with values in the extended real numbers formula_15.\nUpper semicontinuity.\nA function formula_14 is called upper semicontinuous at a point formula_17 if for every real formula_18 there exists a neighborhood formula_19 of formula_2 such that formula_21 for all formula_22.\nEquivalently, formula_1 is upper semicontinuous at formula_2 if and only if\nformula_25\nwhere lim sup is the limit superior of the function formula_1 at the point formula_2, defined as\nformula_28\nwhere the infimum is over all neighborhoods of the point formula_2.\nIf formula_5 is a metric space with distance function formula_31 and formula_32 this can also be restated using an formula_33-formula_34 formulation, similar to the definition of continuous function. Namely, for each formula_35 there is a formula_36 such that formula_37 whenever formula_38\nA function formula_14 is called upper semicontinuous if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:\n(1) The function is upper semicontinuous at every point of its domain.\n(2) For each formula_40, the set formula_41 is open in formula_5, where formula_43.\n(3) For each formula_40, the formula_45-superlevel set formula_46 is closed in formula_5.\n(4) The hypograph formula_48 is closed in formula_7.\n(5) The function formula_1 is continuous when the codomain formula_51 is given the left order topology. This is just a restatement of condition (2) since the left order topology is generated by all the intervals formula_52.\nLower semicontinuity.\nA function formula_14 is called lower semicontinuous at a point formula_54 if for every real formula_55 there exists a neighborhood formula_19 of formula_2 such that formula_58 for all formula_22.\nEquivalently, formula_1 is lower semicontinuous at formula_2 if and only if\nformula_62\nwhere formula_63 is the limit inferior of the function formula_1 at point formula_65\nIf formula_5 is a metric space with distance function formula_31 and formula_32 this can also be restated as follows: For each formula_35 there is a formula_36 such that formula_71 whenever formula_38\nA function formula_14 is called lower semicontinuous if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:\n(1) The function is lower semicontinuous at every point of its domain.\n(2) For each formula_40, the set formula_75 is open in formula_5, where formula_77.\n(3) For each formula_40, the formula_45-sublevel set formula_80 is closed in formula_5.\n(4) The epigraph formula_6 is closed in formula_7.\n(5) The function formula_1 is continuous when the codomain formula_51 is given the right order topology. This is just a restatement of condition (2) since the right order topology is generated by all the intervals formula_86.\nExamples.\nConsider the function formula_87 piecewise defined by:\nformula_88\nThis function is upper semicontinuous at formula_89 but not lower semicontinuous.\nThe floor function formula_90 which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to a given real number formula_91 is everywhere upper semicontinuous. Similarly, the ceiling function formula_92 is lower semicontinuous.\nUpper and lower semicontinuity bear no relation to continuity from the left or from the right for functions of a real variable. Semicontinuity is defined in terms of an ordering in the range of the functions, not in the domain. For example the function\nformula_93\nis upper semicontinuous at formula_94 while the function limits from the left or right at zero do not even exist.\nIf formula_95 is a Euclidean space (or more generally, a metric space) and formula_96 is the space of curves in formula_5 (with the supremum distance formula_98), then the length functional formula_99 which assigns to each curve formula_100 its length formula_101 is lower semicontinuous. As an example, consider approximating the unit square diagonal by a staircase from below. The staircase always has length 2, while the diagonal line has only length formula_102.\nA fundamental example in real analysis is Fatou's lemma. It asserts that if formula_103 is a sequence of non-negative measurable functions, then\nformula_104\nwhere formula_63 denotes the (pointwise) limit inferior. What this means, in full generality, is that if formula_106 be a measure space and formula_107 denotes the set of positive measurable functions endowed with the topology of convergence in measure with respect to formula_108 then the integral, seen as an operator from formula_107 to formula_110 is lower semicontinuous.\nProperties.\nUnless specified otherwise, all functions below are from a topological space formula_5 to the extended real numbers formula_112 \"Several of the results hold for semicontinuity at a specific point, but for brevity they are only stated for semicontinuity over the whole domain.\"\nBinary operations on semicontinuous functions.\nLet formula_126.\nIn particular, the limit of a monotone increasing sequence formula_158 of continuous functions is lower semicontinuous. (The Theorem of Baire below provides a partial converse.) The limit function will only be lower semicontinuous in general, not continuous. An example is given by the functions formula_159 defined for formula_160 for formula_161\nLikewise, the infimum of an arbitrary family of upper semicontinuous functions is upper semicontinuous. And the limit of a monotone decreasing sequence of continuous functions is upper semicontinuous.\n(\"Proof for the upper semicontinuous case\": By condition (5) in the definition, formula_1 is continuous when formula_51 is given the left order topology. So its image formula_172 is compact in that topology. And the compact sets in that topology are exactly the sets with a maximum. For an alternative proof, see the article on the extreme value theorem.)\nformula_178 and \nformula_179\nIf formula_1 does not take the value formula_181, the continuous functions can be taken to be real-valued.\nAdditionally, every upper semicontinuous function formula_14 is the limit of a monotone decreasing sequence of extended real-valued continuous functions on formula_183 if formula_1 does not take the value formula_185 the continuous functions can be taken to be real-valued.\nSemicontinuity of set-valued functions.\nFor set-valued functions, several concepts of semicontinuity have been defined, namely \"upper\", \"lower\", \"outer\", and \"inner\" semicontinuity, as well as \"upper\" and \"lower hemicontinuity\".\nA set-valued function formula_198 from a set formula_119 to a set formula_200 is written formula_201 For each formula_202 the function formula_198 defines a set formula_204\nThe preimage of a set formula_205 under formula_198 is defined as \nformula_207\nThat is, formula_208 is the set that contains every point formula_193 in formula_119 such that formula_211 is not disjoint from formula_212.\nUpper and lower semicontinuity.\nA set-valued map formula_213 is \"upper semicontinuous\" at formula_214 if for every open set formula_215 such that formula_216, there exists a neighborhood formula_217 of formula_193 such that formula_219\nA set-valued map formula_213 is \"lower semicontinuous\" at formula_214 if for every open set formula_215 such that formula_223 there exists a neighborhood formula_217 of formula_193 such that formula_226\nUpper and lower set-valued semicontinuity are also defined more generally for a set-valued maps between topological spaces by replacing formula_227 and formula_228 in the above definitions with arbitrary topological spaces.\nNote, that there is not a direct correspondence between single-valued lower and upper semicontinuity and set-valued lower and upper semicontinuouty. \nAn upper semicontinuous single-valued function is not necessarily upper semicontinuous when considered as a set-valued map. \nFor example, the function formula_229 defined by \nformula_88\nis upper semicontinuous in the single-valued sense but the set-valued map formula_231 is not upper semicontinuous in the set-valued sense. \nInner and outer semicontinuity.\nA set-valued function formula_213 is called \"inner semicontinuous\" at formula_193 if for every formula_234 and every convergent sequence formula_235 in formula_227 such that formula_237, there exists \na sequence formula_238 in formula_228 such that formula_240 and formula_241 for all sufficiently large formula_242\nA set-valued function formula_213 is called \"outer semicontinuous\" at formula_193 if for every convergence sequence formula_235 in formula_227 such that formula_237 and every convergent sequence formula_238 in formula_228 such that formula_250 for each formula_251 the sequence formula_238 converges to a point in formula_211 (that is, formula_254).\nHulls.\nBecause the supremum of a family of lower semicontinuous functions is lower semicontinuous, if formula_1 is an arbitrary extended-real valued function on a topological space formula_5, the supremum of the set of lower semicontinuous functions majorized by formula_1 is lower semicontinuous. This greatest lower semicontinuous function majorized by formula_1 is the lower semicontinuous \"hull\" of formula_1. The hull formula_260 is defined pointwise by the relation\nformula_261\nThe hull formula_260 has the property that its epigraph is the closure of the epigraph of formula_1.\nThe lower semicontinuous hull plays a role in convex analysis. Given a convex (extended real) function, the epigraph might not be closed. But the lower semicontinuous hull of a convex function is convex, and is known as the closure of the original convex function.\nSome operations in convex analysis, such as the Legendre transform automatically produce closed convex functions. The Legendre transform applied twice to a convex function gives the closure of the original function, rather than the original function. Thus the lower semicontinuous hull is a way of regularizing convex functions, by modifying it at boundary points of its effective domain.\nIn categorical terms, the lower semicontinuous hull of a function formula_1 is the (left) Kan extension of formula_1 along the inclusion of the poset of open neighborhoods (ordered by reverse inclusion) into the topological space formula_5. Explicitly, the value of the hull formula_260 at a point formula_191 is given by the colimit:\nformula_269\nwhich coincides with formula_270, the left Kan extension under the inclusion functor formula_271. In this formulation, the process of taking the semicontinuous envelope is a special case of the Kan extension machinery in enriched category theory. The upper semicontinuous hull is a right Kan extension.\nOther types of hulls are often considered in applications. For example, the infimum of the set of continuous affine functions that majorize a given function on a convex subset of a topological vector space is upper semicontinuous. This fact is used in the proof of the Choquet theorem. Similar ideas applied to subharmonic functions are used in the Perron method for solving the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace operator in a domain. The key condition for the class of subharmonic solutions is upper semicontinuity, particularly near the boundary where the boundary conditions are applied.\nApplications.\nCalculus of variations.\nAn important application of semicontinuity is to the calculus of variations. It derives its significance in this context due to the following theorem. Let formula_5 be a topological space, and formula_273. A minimizing sequence is a sequence formula_274 in formula_5 such that\nformula_276\nThe theorem is that if formula_198 is sequentially lower semicontinuous and formula_274 is a minimizing sequence that converges to formula_2, then formula_280\nThat is, formula_2 is an absolute minimum of formula_198.\nThis is often combined with results such as Tonelli's theorem in functional analysis, which characterizes the weak lower semicontinuity of nonlinear functionals on \"L\"\"p\" spaces in terms of the convexity of another function. More specialized results of this kind are useful in variational formulations of problems in partial differential equations, which relate semicontinuity of functionals given by integration to the convexity properties of the integrand, often defined on some Sobolev space. The prototypical example is the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace operator, which can be formulated as a minimization problem of the energy, subject to boundary conditions,\nformula_283\ni.e., the integral of the squared norm of the gradient of a function over a bounded domain in Euclidean space. The integrand is convex in an appropriate Sobolev space, so the limit of a minimizing sequence is a solution of the Dirichlet problem. This has implications, for instance, for finite element solutions, which gives a way to construct a minimizing sequence.\nExistence of saddle points.\nTogether with convexity assumptions, both upper and lower semicontinuity play a role in theorems guaranteeing the existence of saddle points of functions, on locally convex topological vector spaces. One such result is the minimax theorem of Fan and Sion. It states that if formula_284 is a function from a pair of non-empty closed, convex sets formula_285 belonging to reflexive Banach spaces, such that\nthen the set of saddle points of formula_1 is convex. If both convexity and concavity are strict, then there is at most one saddle point. If the sets formula_5 and formula_292 are bounded, then the set of saddle points is non-empty. A saddle point is by definition a point formula_293 at which\nformula_294\nDimension.\nMany integer-valued functions of importance are also semicontinuous. For a simple example, suppose one has a polyhedron formula_295 (or, more generally, a closed convex set) in an formula_296-dimensional vector space. A face of formula_295 is by definition the set of maxima of some linear functional on formula_295. Define the function\nformula_299\nThen formula_1 is lower semicontinuous. This is intuitively because under any small perturbations, you can move from a face of lower dimension, such as an edge or vertex, to one of higher dimension, but any point of a higher dimensional face cannot be moved to one of lower dimension if the perturbation is small enough.\nAnother example of a similar character is that matrix rank is a lower semicontinuous function on the space of formula_301 matrices. This is because the rank can go up at matrices which are nearby, but not down. As a result of this, together with the implicit function theorem, when a Lie group acts smoothly on a smooth manifold, the dimension of the orbit through a point is lower semicontinuous (i.e., the function formula_302).\nAlgebraic geometry.\nMore sophisticated versions of this same idea play a fundamental role in algebraic geometry, where many dimension maps with codomain in the integers are known to be semicontinuous. (For example as applied to a Newton\u2013Okounkov body.) \nIn general, let formula_5 and formula_212 be schemes and formula_305 a flat and proper morphism of finite presentation. Let formula_306 be an formula_307-module flat and of finite presentation over formula_212. Then for any formula_309 the function\nformula_310\nis upper semicontinuous. An important special case of this theorem when additionally formula_311 are noetherian, formula_1 is projective and formula_306 is coherent can be found in the standard textbook of Hartshorne. Original work in the language of hypercohomology can be found in EGA III Th\u00e9or\u00e8me (7.7.5), citing also previous work, in particular Grauert for the complex-analytic setting.\nLet formula_314 be schemes and formula_315 a morphism of finite type. The function\nformula_316\nassociates to any formula_289 the dimension of the fiber formula_318. If formula_1 is a flat morphism of schemes of finite presentation, then formula_320 is lower semicontinuous. If formula_1 is a proper morphism of schemes, then formula_320 is upper semicontinuous.\nVakil collected a list of further semicontinuity results in algebraic geometry.\nDescriptive set theory.\nSemicontinuous functions are used in descriptive set theory to define stratifications of topological spaces by complexity measures such as \"dimension\", \"rank\", or \"ordinal height\". Such functions often take values in an ordinal, and their semicontinuity ensures that the sets formula_323 are closed (and hence Borel in a Polish space).\nA central example is the rank function on well-founded trees. Let formula_324 be a tree coded by a point in Baire space formula_325. The \"rank\" formula_326 is defined as the supremum of the lengths of descending sequences in formula_327. The function assigning the rank formula_328 to each tree is \"lower semicontinuous\" with respect to the natural topology on tree codes. This rank stratifies the space of trees into closed sets formula_329, analogous to how matrix rank stratifies formula_330.\nMore generally, \"ordinal-valued lower semicontinuous functions\" are used to measure the complexity of points or structures in a Polish space\u2014such as Scott ranks of countable structures, projective ranks of sets, or Lusin\u2013Novikov complexities of equivalence relations. These functions enable fine classification and are crucial in defining universal sets and effective parametrizations in higher levels of the projective hierarchy.\nBecause the preimage of an interval formula_331 under a lower semicontinuous function is closed, such functions yield \"canonical stratifications\" of topological spaces into closed (thus Borel) pieces of increasing complexity. This property is often used in proofs of reflection principles, separation theorems, and in the effective classification of Borel equivalence relations.\nDynamical systems.\nIn ergodic theory and topological dynamics, semicontinuity arises naturally when studying functionals on the space of invariant measures of a dynamical system. The most important example is the \"entropy function\", which assigns to each invariant measure its measure-theoretic entropy.\nLet formula_332 be a topological dynamical system with formula_5 compact and formula_334 continuous. The space formula_335 of formula_336-invariant Borel probability measures is a compact convex subset of the dual of formula_337 under the weak-* topology. The \"entropy map\" formula_338 is an \"upper semicontinuous function\" on formula_335:\nformula_340\nThis property plays a key role in the variational principle, which asserts that the topological entropy formula_341 is the supremum of formula_342 over all invariant measures. Upper semicontinuity guarantees that this supremum is attained when the space of measures is compact.\nMore generally, many functionals of interest\u2014such as Lyapunov exponents, dimension spectra, or return time statistics\u2014are semicontinuous on the space of invariant measures. In some cases, these semicontinuity properties are used to prove existence of measures maximizing or minimizing a given quantity, or to establish structural properties of the simplex formula_335 (e.g., that ergodic measures form a residual\u2014dense formula_344\u2014set).\nSimilar ideas appear in the theory of joinings, where one studies invariant couplings between systems. The set of joinings is compact in the weak-* topology, and semicontinuity is used to analyze disjointness and uniqueness of invariant couplings.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has degrees in mathematics and engineering.\nEarly life and education.\nStephen Baxter was born in Liverpool, England, in 1957. \nHe earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics at University of Cambridge, and went on to obtain a doctorate in engineering at University of Southampton. He later received an MBA from Henley Management College. \nCareer.\nBaxter taught maths, physics, and information technology before becoming a full-time author in 1995. \nWriting.\nStrongly influenced by science fiction pioneer H. G. Wells, Baxter has been vice-president of the international H. G. Wells Society since 2006. His fiction falls into three main categories of original work plus a fourth category, extending other authors' writing; each has a different basis, style, and tone.\nBaxter's \"Future History\" mode is based on research into hard science. It encompasses the \"Xeelee Sequence\", which consists of nine novels (including the \"Destiny's Children\" trilogy and Vengeance/Redemption duology that is set in alternate timeline), plus three volumes collecting the 52 short pieces (short stories and novellas) in the series, all of which fit into a single timeline stretching from the Big Bang singularity of the past to his \"Timelike Infinity\" (1993) singularity of the future. These stories begin in the present day and end when the Milky Way galaxy collides with Andromeda five billion years in the future. The central narrative is that of humanity rising and evolving to become the second most powerful race in the universe, next to the god-like Xeelee. Character development tends to be secondary to the depiction of advanced theories and ideas, such as the true nature of the Great Attractor, naked singularities and the great battle between baryonic and dark matter lifeforms. The \"Manifold Trilogy\" is another example of Baxter's future history mode, even more conceptual than the Xeelee sequence. Each novel is focused on a potential explanation of the Fermi paradox. The two-part disaster series \"Flood\" and \"Ark\" (followed by three additional stories, \"Earth III,\" \"Earth II,\" and \"Earth I\") which also fits into this category, where catastrophic events unfold in the near future and humanity must adapt to survive in three radically different planetary environments. In 2013, Baxter released his short story collection \"Universes\" which featured stories set in Flood/Ark, Jones &amp; Bennet and Anti-Ice universes. Baxter signed a contract for two new books, \"Proxima\" and \"Ultima\", both of which are names of planets, and they were released in 2013 and 2014, respectively.\nA second category in Baxter's work is based on readings in evolutionary biology and human/animal behaviour. Elements of this appear in his future histories (especially later works like the \"Destiny's Children\" series and \"Flood\"/\"Ark\"), but here it is the focus. The major work in this category is \"Evolution\", which imagines the evolution of humanity in the Earth's past and future. \"The Mammoth Trilogy\", written for young adults, shares similar themes and concerns as it explores the present, past, and future of a small herd of mammoths found surviving on an island in the Arctic Ocean.\nA third category of Baxter's fiction is alternative history, based on research into history. These stories are more human, with characters portrayed with greater depth and care. This includes his \"NASA Trilogy\", which incorporates research into NASA and its history; and the \"Time's Tapestry\" series, which features science-fictional interventions into our past from an alternative-history future. The novel \"Anti-Ice\" is an earlier example of Baxter's blending of alternate history with science fiction. A more recent work in this direction is the \"Northland Trilogy\", an alternate prehistory that begins with \"Stone Spring\", set ten thousand years ago in the Stone Age, followed by \"Bronze Summer\" and \"Iron Winter\", set in alternative versions of the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. In 2009, Baxter became a judge for the Sidewise Award for Alternate History, the first former winner among the panel.\nAnother category, outside of the main body of Baxter's independent work, is sequels and instalments of science-fiction classics. His first novel to achieve wide recognition (winning three literary awards) was \"The Time Ships\", an authorised sequel to H. G. Wells' \"The Time Machine\". The \"Time Odyssey\" series, a trilogy co-authored with Arthur C. Clarke, is connected to Clarke's four \"Space Odyssey\" novels. The trilogy consists of \"Time's Eye\", \"Sunstorm\", and \"Firstborn\". Another novel is based on a synopsis written by Clarke, \"The Light of Other Days\". Baxter has also published a Doctor Who novel, \"The Wheel of Ice\". \"The Massacre of Mankind\" is an authorised sequel to H. G. Wells' \"The War of the Worlds\".\nIn 2010, Baxter began working on a new series with Terry Pratchett. This collaboration produced five books, \"The Long Earth\", \"The Long War\", \"The Long Mars\", \"The Long Utopia\" and \"The Long Cosmos\".\nBaxter has written non-fiction essays and columns for such publications as \"Critical Wave\" and the British SF Association's \"Matrix\".\nOther activities.\nBaxter is a chartered engineer and fellow of the British Interplanetary Society.\nLiterary awards.\nBaxter's story \"Last Contact\" was nominated for the 2008 Hugo Award for best short story.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program. A keystroke recorder or keylogger can be either software or hardware.\nWhile the programs themselves are legal, with many designed to allow employers to oversee the use of their computers, keyloggers are most often used for stealing passwords and other confidential information. Keystroke logging can also be utilized to monitor activities of children in schools or at home and by law enforcement officials to investigate malicious usage.\nKeylogging can also be used to study keystroke dynamics or human-computer interaction. Numerous keylogging methods exist, ranging from hardware and software-based approaches to acoustic cryptanalysis.\nHistory.\nIn the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union developed and deployed a hardware keylogger targeting US Embassy typewriters. Termed the \"selectric bug\", it transmitted the typed characters on IBM Selectric typewriters via magnetic detection of the mechanisms causing rotation of the print head. An early keylogger was written by Perry Kivolowitz and posted to the Usenet newsgroup net.unix-wizards, net.sources on November 17, 1983. The posting seems to be a motivating factor in restricting access to codice_1 on Unix systems. The user-mode program operated by locating and dumping character lists (clients) as they were assembled in the Unix kernel.\nIn the 1970s, spies installed keystroke loggers in the US Embassy and Consulate buildings in Moscow.\nThey installed the bugs in Selectric II and Selectric III electric typewriters.\nSoviet embassies used manual typewriters, rather than electric typewriters, for classified information\u2014apparently because they are immune to such bugs.\nAs of 2013, Russian special services still use typewriters.\nApplication of keylogger.\nSoftware-based keyloggers.\nA software-based keylogger is a computer program designed to record any input from the keyboard. Keyloggers are used in IT organizations to troubleshoot technical problems with computers and business networks. Families and businesspeople use keyloggers legally to monitor network usage without their users' direct knowledge. Microsoft publicly stated that Windows 10 has a built-in keylogger in its final version \"to improve typing and writing services\". However, malicious individuals can use keyloggers on public computers to steal passwords or credit card information. Most keyloggers are not stopped by HTTPS encryption because that only protects data in transit between computers; software-based keyloggers run on the affected user's computer, reading keyboard inputs directly as the user types.\nFrom a technical perspective, there are several categories:\nKeystroke logging in writing process research.\nSince 2006, keystroke logging has been an established research method for the study of writing processes. Different programs have been developed to collect online process data of writing activities, including Inputlog, Scriptlog, Translog and GGXLog.\nKeystroke logging is used legitimately as a suitable research instrument in several writing contexts. These include studies on cognitive writing processes, which include\nKeystroke logging can be used to research writing, specifically. It can also be integrated into educational domains for second language learning, programming skills, and typing skills.\nKeystroke logging as a secure defense.\nRecently, there has been extensive research completed into the use of keystroke logging data not only as a form of attack, but also as a form of behavioral defense for users. A 2020 study, \u201cPassphrase and Keystroke Dynamics Authentication\u201d by Ahmed and Traore evaluated whether keystroke-dynamics models could support the strategy of continuous authentication. Continuous authentication is a prevention strategy that takes advantage of the users normal behaviors to establish a baseline, and then checks for deviations from that baseline to detect adversarial activity. This study analyzed the performance of several machine learning classifiers to identify user typing patterns, latencies, and timing. The authors found that even small deviations in typing patterns could be strong indicators of impersonations. This suggests that keystroke logging data can serve defensive purposes when captured ethically and with the users permission. \nThis study also reported that machine learning models trained on genuine typing behavior achieved low false acceptance and false rejection rates in most instances, showing that the use of continuous authentication systems can operate with low error rates. They also found that the typing patterns of most people have enough discriminatory signals that you could create a personal profile based on the typing habits alone. This shows that the same core exploits used by malicious attackers can also form the basis of security systems designed to protect users from intrusions and impersonations. The authors concluded that while keystroke-dynamics authentication is promising, its deployment must carefully balance security, usability, and privacy considerations for the optimal user experience.\nRelated features.\nSoftware keyloggers may be augmented with features that capture user information without relying on keyboard key presses as the sole input. Some of these features include:\nHardware-based keyloggers.\nHardware-based keyloggers do not depend upon any software being installed as they exist at a hardware level in a computer system.\nCracking.\nWriting simple software applications for keylogging can be trivial, and like any nefarious computer program, can be distributed as a trojan horse or as part of a virus. What is not trivial for an attacker, however, is installing a covert keystroke logger without getting caught and downloading data that has been logged without being traced. An attacker that manually connects to a host machine to download logged keystrokes risks being traced. A trojan that sends keylogged data to a fixed e-mail address or IP address risks exposing the attacker.\nTrojans.\nResearchers Adam Young and Moti Yung discussed several methods of sending keystroke logging. They presented a deniable password snatching attack in which the keystroke logging trojan is installed using a virus or worm. An attacker who is caught with the virus or worm can claim to be a victim. The cryptotrojan asymmetrically encrypts the pilfered login/password pairs using the public key of the trojan author and covertly broadcasts the resulting ciphertext. They mentioned that the ciphertext can be steganographically encoded and posted to a public bulletin board such as Usenet.\nUse by police.\nIn 2000, the FBI used FlashCrest iSpy to obtain the PGP passphrase of Nicodemo Scarfo, Jr., son of mob boss Nicodemo Scarfo.\nAlso in 2000, the FBI lured two suspected Russian cybercriminals to the US in an elaborate ruse, and captured their usernames and passwords with a keylogger that was covertly installed on a machine that they used to access their computers in Russia. The FBI then used these credentials to gain access to the suspects' computers in Russia to obtain evidence to prosecute them.\nCountermeasures.\nThe effectiveness of countermeasures varies because keyloggers use a variety of techniques to capture data and the countermeasure needs to be effective against the particular data capture technique. In the case of Windows 10 keylogging by Microsoft, changing certain privacy settings may disable it. An on-screen keyboard will be effective against hardware keyloggers; transparency will defeat some\u2014but not all\u2014screen loggers. An anti-spyware application that can only disable hook-based keyloggers will be ineffective against kernel-based keyloggers.\nKeylogger program authors may be able to update their program's code to adapt to countermeasures that have proven effective against it.\nAnti-keyloggers.\nAn anti-keylogger is a piece of software specifically designed to detect keyloggers on a computer, typically comparing all files in the computer against a database of keyloggers, looking for similarities which might indicate the presence of a hidden keylogger. As anti-keyloggers have been designed specifically to detect keyloggers, they have the potential to be more effective than conventional antivirus software; some antivirus software do not consider keyloggers to be malware, as under some circumstances a keylogger can be considered a legitimate piece of software.\nLive CD/USB.\nRebooting the computer using a Live CD or write-protected Live USB is a possible countermeasure against software keyloggers if the CD is clean of malware and the operating system contained on it is secured and fully patched so that it cannot be infected as soon as it is started. Booting a different operating system does not impact the use of a hardware or BIOS based keylogger.\nAnti-spyware / Anti-virus programs.\nMany anti-spyware applications can detect some software based keyloggers and quarantine, disable, or remove them. However, because many keylogging programs are legitimate pieces of software under some circumstances, anti-spyware often neglects to label keylogging programs as spyware or a virus. These applications can detect software-based keyloggers based on patterns in executable code, heuristics and keylogger behaviors (such as the use of hooks and certain APIs).\nNo software-based anti-spyware application can be 100% effective against all keyloggers. Software-based anti-spyware cannot defeat non-software keyloggers (for example, hardware keyloggers attached to keyboards will always receive keystrokes before any software-based anti-spyware application).\nThe particular technique that the anti-spyware application uses will influence its potential effectiveness against software keyloggers. As a general rule, anti-spyware applications with higher privileges will defeat keyloggers with lower privileges. For example, a hook-based anti-spyware application cannot defeat a kernel-based keylogger (as the keylogger will receive the keystroke messages before the anti-spyware application), but it could potentially defeat hook- and API-based keyloggers.\nNetwork monitors.\nNetwork monitors (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from \"phoning home\" with their typed information.\nAutomatic form filler programs.\nAutomatic form-filling programs may prevent keylogging by removing the requirement for a user to type personal details and passwords using the keyboard. Form fillers are primarily designed for Web browsers to fill in checkout pages and log users into their accounts. Once the user's account and credit card information has been entered into the program, it will be automatically entered into forms without ever using the keyboard or clipboard, thereby reducing the possibility that private data is being recorded. However, someone with physical access to the machine may still be able to install software that can intercept this information elsewhere in the operating system or while in transit on the network. (Transport Layer Security (TLS) reduces the risk that data in transit may be intercepted by network sniffers and proxy tools.)\nOne-time passwords (OTP).\nUsing one-time passwords may prevent unauthorized access to an account which has had its login details exposed to an attacker via a keylogger, as each password is invalidated as soon as it is used. This solution may be useful for someone using a public computer. However, an attacker who has remote control over such a computer can simply wait for the victim to enter their credentials before performing unauthorized transactions on their behalf while their session is active.\nAnother common way to protect access codes from being stolen by keystroke loggers is by asking users to provide a few randomly selected characters from their authentication code. For example, they might be asked to enter the 2nd, 5th, and 8th characters. Even if someone is watching the user or using a keystroke logger, they would only get a few characters from the code without knowing their positions.\nSecurity tokens.\nUse of smart cards or other security tokens may improve security against replay attacks in the face of a successful keylogging attack, as accessing protected information would require both the (hardware) security token as well as the appropriate password/passphrase. Knowing the keystrokes, mouse actions, display, clipboard, etc. used on one computer will not subsequently help an attacker gain access to the protected resource. Some security tokens work as a type of hardware-assisted one-time password system, and others implement a cryptographic challenge\u2013response authentication, which can improve security in a manner conceptually similar to one time passwords. Smartcard readers and their associated keypads for PIN entry may be vulnerable to keystroke logging through a so-called supply chain attack where an attacker substitutes the card reader/PIN entry hardware for one which records the user's PIN.\nOn-screen keyboards.\nMost on-screen keyboards (such as the on-screen keyboard that comes with Windows XP) send normal keyboard event messages to the external target program to type text. Software key loggers can log these typed characters sent from one program to another.\nKeystroke interference software.\nKeystroke interference software is also available.\nThese programs attempt to trick keyloggers by introducing random keystrokes, although this simply results in the keylogger recording more information than it needs to. An attacker has the task of extracting the keystrokes of interest\u2014the security of this mechanism, specifically how well it stands up to cryptanalysis, is unclear.\nSpeech recognition.\nSimilar to on-screen keyboards, speech-to-text conversion software can also be used against keyloggers, since there are no typing or mouse movements involved. The weakest point of using voice-recognition software may be how the software sends the recognized text to target software after the user's speech has been processed.\nHandwriting recognition and mouse gestures.\nMany PDAs and lately tablet PCs can already convert pen (also called stylus) movements on their touchscreens to computer understandable text successfully. Mouse gestures use this principle by using mouse movements instead of a stylus. Mouse gesture programs convert these strokes to user-definable actions, such as typing text. Similarly, graphics tablets and light pens can be used to input these gestures, however, these are becoming less common.\nThe same potential weakness of speech recognition applies to this technique as well.\nMacro expanders/recorders.\nWith the help of many programs, a seemingly meaningless text can be expanded to a meaningful text and most of the time context-sensitively, e.g. \"en.wikipedia.org\" can be expanded when a web browser window has the focus. The biggest weakness of this technique is that these programs send their keystrokes directly to the target program. However, this can be overcome by using the 'alternating' technique described below, i.e. sending mouse clicks to non-responsive areas of the target program, sending meaningless keys, sending another mouse click to the target area (e.g. password field) and switching back-and-forth.\nDeceptive typing.\nAlternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window can cause a keylogger to record more information than it needs to, but this could be easily filtered out by an attacker. Similarly, a user can move their cursor using the mouse while typing, causing the logged keystrokes to be in the wrong order e.g., by typing a password beginning with the last letter and then using the mouse to move the cursor for each subsequent letter. Lastly, someone can also use context menus to remove, cut, copy, and paste parts of the typed text without using the keyboard. An attacker who can capture only parts of a password will have a larger key space to attack if they choose to execute a brute-force attack.\nAnother very similar technique uses the fact that any selected text portion is replaced by the next key typed. e.g., if the password is \"secret\", one could type \"s\", then some dummy keys \"asdf\". These dummy characters could then be selected with the mouse, and the next character from the password \"e\" typed, which replaces the dummy characters \"asdf\".\nThese techniques assume incorrectly that keystroke logging software cannot directly monitor the clipboard, the selected text in a form, or take a screenshot every time a keystroke or mouse click occurs. They may, however, be effective against some hardware keyloggers.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "57832", "revid": "89937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57832", "title": "Bernard Baruch", "text": "American businessman (1870\u20131965)\nBernard Mannes Baruch (August 19, 1870 \u2013 June 20, 1965) was an American financier and statesman.\nAfter amassing a fortune on the New York Stock Exchange, he impressed President Woodrow Wilson by managing the nation's economic mobilization in World War I as chairman of the War Industries Board. He advised Wilson during the Paris Peace Conference. He made another fortune in the postwar bull market, but foresaw the Wall Street crash and sold out well in advance. \nIn World War II, he became a close advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the role of industry in war supply. He was credited with greatly shortening the production time for tanks and aircraft. Later he helped to develop rehabilitation programs for injured servicemen. In 1946, he was the United States representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, though his Baruch Plan for international control of atomic energy was rejected by the Soviet Union.\nEarly life and education.\nBernard Baruch was born on August 19, 1870 in Camden, South Carolina, to a Jewish family. His parents were Belle (n\u00e9e Wolfe) and Simon Baruch, a physician and Confederate surgeon. Bernard was the second of four sons, including brothers Herman B. Baruch, Sailing Wolfe Baruch, and Hartwig Nathaniel Baruch.\nAt the age of 10, Baruch and his family moved from Camden to New York City. At the age of 14, he began attending the City College of New York in northern Manhattan. He later graduated from the college.\nBusiness career.\nBaruch became a broker and then a partner in A.A. Housman &amp; Company. With his earnings and commissions, he bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for $19,000 (). There, he amassed a fortune before the age of 30 speculating on the sugar market, which was booming in Hawaii. Baruch founded the Intercontinental Rubber Company of New York, which dominated the guayule rubber market in the U.S. with holdings in Mexico. His partners in the enterprise were Senator Nelson Aldrich, Daniel Guggenheim, John D. Rockefeller Jr., George Foster Peabody, and others. By 1903, Baruch had his own brokerage firm and gained the reputation of being \"The Lone Wolf of Wall Street\" because of his refusal to join any financial house. By 1910, he had become one of Wall Street's best-known financiers.\nAfter 1924, Baruch made millions in the bull market. By 1927 he had grown skeptical that the trend could continue, chastened by losses he had taken in the collapse of the Florida real estate bubble. A common anecdote holds that he sold his stock portfolio after a shoeshiner struck up a conversation with him about the market. In Baruch's own telling, a beggar whom he had often helped with money offered him a tip near the 1929 market peak, but by that time he had already reduced his market exposure. Unnerved by the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts in summer 1927, he confided his doubts to other businessmen and began selling his stocks in favor of bonds, cash and gold, also selling stocks short periodically. On September 25, 1929, after the peak of the Dow, Baruch refused to join a bull pool of financiers to support the declining market. He advised humorist Will Rogers to exit the market before the crash; Rogers did so and later told Baruch \"you saved my life\".\nPresidential adviser.\nWorld War I.\nIn 1916, Baruch left Wall Street to advise President Wilson on national defense and terms of peace. He served on the Advisory Commission to the Council of National Defense and in January 1918, became the chairman of the new War Industries Board. With his leadership, the body successfully managed the U.S.'s economic mobilization during World War I. In 1919, Wilson asked Baruch to serve as a staff member at the Paris Peace Conference. Baruch did not approve of the reparations which France and Britain demanded of Germany, and he supported Wilson's opinion that there needed to be new forms of cooperation, as well as the creation of the League of Nations.\nFor his services in support of the war effort, Baruch was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal with the following citation: \nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Mr. Bernard M. Baruch, a United States Civilian, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I, in the organization and administration of the War Industries Board and in the coordination of allied purchases in the United States. By establishing a broad and comprehensive policy for the supervision and control of the raw materials, manufacturing facilities, and distribution of the products of industry, he stimulated the production of war supplies, coordinated the needs of the military service and the civilian population, and contributed alike to the completeness and speed of the mobilization and equipment of the military forces and the continuity of their supply. War Department, General Orders No. 15 (1921)\nInterwar period.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Baruch expressed his concern that the United States needed to be prepared for the possibility of another world war. He wanted a more powerful version of the War Industries Board, which he saw as the only way to ensure maximum coordination between civilian business and military needs. Baruch remained a prominent government adviser during that time, and supported Franklin D. Roosevelt's domestic and foreign policy initiatives after his election.\nBaruch was also a major contributor to Eleanor Roosevelt's controversial initiative to build a resettlement community for unemployed mining families in Arthurdale, West Virginia southeast of Morgantown. The relationship did not stop the congressional Nye Committee from investigating Baruch's role in war profiteering.\nIn 1940, responding to pleas to help Harry Truman's shoestring bid for reelection to the U.S. Senate, Baruch provided crucial funding.\nWorld War II.\nWhen the United States entered World War II, Roosevelt appointed Baruch a special adviser to the director of the Office of War Mobilization. His offices at this time were at 120 Broadway. Baruch supported what was known as a \"work or fight\" bill. He advocated the creation of a permanent super-agency similar to his old Industries Board. His theory enhanced the role of civilian businessmen and industrialists in determining what was needed and who would produce it. Baruch's ideas were largely adopted, with James Byrnes appointed to carry them out. It is estimated that these policies cut two years off the time taken to produce tanks, bombers, etc. and caught Hitler totally by surprise. During World War II, Baruch remained a trusted adviser and confidant of Roosevelt, who in 1944 spent a month as a guest at Baruch's South Carolina estate, Hobcaw Barony near Georgetown.\nIn February 1943, Roosevelt invited Baruch to replace the widely criticized War Production Board head Donald M. Nelson. Baruch had long coveted the job, and responded that he only needed to ask his doctor if he was healthy enough for the post. During the delay, however, presidential advisor Harry Hopkins persuaded Roosevelt that firing Nelson at the army's demands would make him look weak, and when Roosevelt and Baruch met at the White House, Roosevelt declined to discuss the job offer further.\nIn 1944, Baruch commissioned a committee of physicians which developed recommendations for the formal establishment of the medical specialty of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and provided over a million dollars of funding to many medical schools to further this cause. Baruch's father, Simon Baruch, had been a surgeon and was the first teacher of physical medicine at Columbia University in Manhattan. In the same year, Baruch and Dr. Howard Rusk, an Air Force physician, advised Roosevelt to expand rehabilitation programs for injured soldiers within all the armed forces. After the war, these programs were adopted by the Veterans' Administration.\nIn 1946, President Harry S. Truman appointed Baruch as the United States representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. On Friday, June 14, 1946, Baruch presented his Baruch Plan, a modified version of the Acheson\u2013Lilienthal plan, to the UNAEC, which proposed international control of then-new atomic energy. The Soviet Union rejected Baruch's proposal as unfair given the fact that the U.S. already had nuclear weapons; it proposed that the U.S. eliminate its nuclear weapons before a system of controls and inspections was implemented. A stalemate ensued.\nBaruch resigned from the commission in 1947. His influence began to diminish, as his opinions grew further out-of-step with those of the Truman administration.\nLater life and death.\nBaruch was well-known and often walked or sat in Washington, D.C.'s Lafayette Park. A popular story exists which claims that Baruch disliked being driven to the White House and would sit on a bench waiting for a signal light indicating the president was ready to see him. That led to him being nicknamed \"the Park Bench Statesman\". In 1960, on his ninetieth birthday, a commemorative park bench in Lafayette Park across from the White House was dedicated to Baruch by the Boy Scouts. A life-size bronze of Baruch sitting on a park bench is in the lobby of Baruch College's Vertical Campus in Manhattan.\nHe continued to advise on international affairs until his death from a heart attack on June 20, 1965 at his home in New York City, at the age of 94. His funeral at Temple Shaaray Tefila, the family synagogue, was attended by 700 people. His grave is in Flushing Cemetery in Flushing, Queens, New York City.\nPersonal life.\nBaruch owned a string of thoroughbred racehorses and raced under the name \"Kershaw Stable\". In 1927, his horse, Happy Argo, won the Carter Handicap.\nWinston Churchill and Baruch were personal friends. Churchill sometimes stayed in Baruch's New York home when visiting the United States after the war (World War II).\nFamily.\nBaruch married Annie Griffin, an Episcopalian, of New York in 1897. Her father did not consent to the marriage or attend their wedding but later reconciled with Bernard. The couple had three children: Belle Baruch; Bernard Baruch Jr.; and Ren\u00e9e Baruch. Their daughters grew up Episcopalian, while Bernard Jr. was allowed to choose his faith.\nHis daughter, Belle Baruch, an avid sportsperson, never married. His son, Bernard Baruch Jr., was married to Winifred Beatrice Mann from 1932 to 1945. His daughter Renee married Henry Robert Samstag.\nHobcaw Barony.\nBetween 1905 and 1907, Baruch purchased about 16,000 acres (63 square kilometers) of the 18th-century Hobcaw Barony, consolidating 14 plantations on Waccamaw Neck in Georgetown County, South Carolina, between the Winyah Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. He developed sections of the property as a winter hunting resort and later sold the property to his eldest child, Belle. Upon her death in 1964, the property was transferred to The Belle W. Baruch Foundation as the Hobcaw Barony educational and research preserve. The property includes 37 historic buildings from the 18th- and 19th-century rice cultivation industry, and early-to-mid-20th-century winter resorts. The entire property was named to the National Register of Historic Places on November 2, 1994.\nThe Trustees of The Belle W. Baruch Foundation subsequently picked the University of South Carolina in Columbia and Clemson University in Clemson to preserve and study the Hobcaw Barony, including the wetlands forest and coastal ecosystems. The University of South Carolina established the Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences, and Clemson University established the Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences. Both universities have formed partnerships with other schools in South Carolina whose research and educational programs contribute to knowledge of coastal ecosystems. The Belle W. Baruch Foundation and the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve jointly operate the Hobcaw Barony Discovery Center and provide tours and special programs.\nLegacy and honors.\nAccording to historian Thomas A. Krueger:\nFor half a century Bernard Baruch was one of the country's richest and most powerful men. A great speculator, public official, presidential counselor, political benefactor, and indefatigable almoner, his public life provides a clear view of the inner workings of the American political system.\nIn 1925, Baruch endowed the Mrs. Simon Baruch University Award to the United Daughters of the Confederacy in memory of his mother, to support scholars who had written unpublished monographs for full-length books on Confederate history. His mother had been an early member of the organization and supported its activities.\nBaruch (along with Adlai Stevenson II) chose to donate his personal papers to Princeton University out of admiration for Woodrow Wilson and Dean Mathey.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a home rule-class city and the seat of Franklin County. As of the 2020 census, the population was 28,602, making it the 13th largest city in Kentucky and 4th smallest U.S. state capital by population. Located along the Kentucky River in the Upland South, Frankfort is the principal city of the Frankfort, Kentucky micropolitan area, which includes all of Franklin and Anderson counties.\nBefore Frankfort was founded, the site was a ford across the Kentucky River, along one of the great buffalo trails used as highways in colonial America. English explorers first visited the area in the 1750s. The site evidently received its name after an incident in 1780, when pioneer Stephen Frank was killed in a skirmish with Native Americans; the crossing was named \"Frank's Ford\" in his memory. In 1786, the Virginia legislature designated as the town of Frankfort and, after Kentucky became a state in 1792, it was chosen as capital.\nThe city is located in the inner Bluegrass region of Kentucky. The Kentucky River flows through the city, making a turn as it passes through the center of town; the Downtown and South Frankfort districts are opposite one another on each side of the river. The suburban areas on either side of the river valley are known as East and West Frankfort. Frankfort has four distinct seasons; winter is normally cool with some snowfall, while summers are hot and humid.\nBecause of the city's location on the Kentucky River, it has flooded many times, with the two highest recorded floods occurring in 1937 and 1978. The North Frankfort levee, finished in 1969, and the South Frankfort floodwall, built in the 1990s, were constructed for flood protection. Five bridges cross the river in downtown Frankfort, including the St. Clair Street bridge and Capitol Avenue bridge. Notable locations include the Kentucky State Capitol building, the Capital City Museum, and Fort Hill, a promontory with a view of downtown.\nAs of 2016, the city's largest industry was public administration with 28% of the workforce. Manufacturing totaled over 12% of the workforce. Frankfort is adjacent to Interstate 64, and Interstate 75 is nearby; general aviation access is via the Capital City Airport, and commercial air travel is available through Blue Grass Airport in Lexington.\nHistory.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nThe town of Frankfort likely received its name from an event that took place in the 1780s. Native Americans attacked a group of early European colonists from Bryan Station, who were on their way to make salt at Mann's Lick in Jefferson County. Pioneer Stephen Frank was killed at the Kentucky River and the settlers thereafter called the crossing \"Frank's Ford\". This name was later elided to Frankfort.\nIn 1786, James Wilkinson purchased a tract of land on the north side of the Kentucky River, which developed as downtown Frankfort. He was an early promoter of Frankfort as the state capital. Wilkinson felt Frankfort would be a center of transportation using the Kentucky River to ship farm produce to the Ohio River and then to the Mississippi and on to New Orleans.\nAfter Kentucky became the 15th state in 1792, five commissioners from various counties were appointed, on June 20, 1792, to choose a location for the capital. They were John Allen and John Edwards (both from Bourbon County), Henry Lee (from Mason), Thomas Kennedy (from Madison), and Robert Todd (from Fayette). A number of communities competed for this honor, but Frankfort won. According to early histories, the offer of Andrew Holmes' log house as capitol for seven years, a number of town lots, \u00a350 worth of locks and hinges, 10 boxes of glass, of nails, and $3,000 in gold helped the decision go to Frankfort.\nFrankfort had a United States post office by 1794, with Daniel Weisiger as postmaster. On October 1, 1794, Weisiger sent the first quarterly account to Washington.\nJohn Brown, a Virginia lawyer and statesman, built a home now called Liberty Hall in Frankfort in 1796. Before Kentucky statehood, he represented Virginia in the Continental Congress (1777\u221278) and the U.S. Congress (1789\u221291). While in Congress, he introduced the bill granting statehood to Kentucky. After statehood, he was elected by the state legislature as one of the state's U.S. Senators.\nIn 1796, the Kentucky General Assembly appropriated funds to provide a house to accommodate the governor; it was completed two years later. The Old Governor's Mansion is claimed to be the oldest official executive residence still in use in the United States. In 1829, Gideon Shryock designed the Old Capitol, Kentucky's third, in Greek Revival style. It served Kentucky as its capitol from 1830 to 1910. The separate settlement known as South Frankfort was annexed by the city on January 3, 1850.\nThe \"Argus of Western America\" was published in Frankfort from 1808 until 1830.\nDuring the American Civil War, the Union Army built fortifications overlooking Frankfort on what is now called Fort Hill. The Confederate Army also occupied Frankfort for a short time, starting on September 3, 1862, the only such time that Confederate forces took control of a Union capitol.\nThe Clinton Street High School, a segregated public school for African American students in Frankfort operated from either 1882 or 1884 until 1928.\nOn February 3, 1900, William Goebel was assassinated in Frankfort while walking to the capitol on the way to the Kentucky Legislature. Former Secretary of State Caleb Powers and several others were later found guilty of a conspiracy to murder Goebel; however, all were later pardoned.\n20th century.\nThe Mayo\u2013Underwood School, the successor to the Clinton Street High School, was a public school for African American students in Frankfort and operated from 1929 until 1964. The school was torn down as part of an urban renewal plan, and to make way for the Capital Plaza.\nThe Capital Plaza was comprised the Capital Plaza Office Tower, the tallest building in the city, the Capital Plaza Hotel (formerly the Holiday Inn, Frankfort), and the Fountain Place Shoppes. The Capital Plaza Office Tower opened in 1972 and became a visual landmark for the center of the city. By the early 2000s, maintenance of the concrete structures had been neglected and the plaza had fallen into disrepair, with sections of the plaza closed to pedestrian activity out of concerns for safety. In 2018 The Capital Plaza was demolished and a new state office building was constructed to take its place. The new building was named The Mayo-Underwood State Office Building to honor the namesake school that was razed for the sake of the original Capital Plaza.\nFrankfort grew considerably with state government in the 1960s. A modern addition to the State Office Building was completed in 1967. The original building was completed in the 1930s on the location of the former Kentucky State Penitentiary. Some of the stone from the old prison was used for the walls surrounding the office building.\n21st century.\nAlthough there was some rapid economic and population growth in the 1960s, both tapered off in the 1980s and have remained fairly stable since that time.\nIn August 2008, state government officials recommended demolition of the Capital Plaza Office Tower and redevelopment of the area over a period of years. Ten years later, the demolition of the office tower was completed on Sunday, March 11, 2018, and was televised by WKYT-TV on WKYT-DT2, as well as streamed live on Facebook. Demolition of the nearby convention center, which opened in 1972 and has hosted sporting events, concerts, and other local events, was completed in spring 2018. State officials replaced the outdated office tower with a smaller building called the Mayo\u2013Underwood Building (2019), in order to create a more pedestrian-oriented scale at the complex, to encourage street activity.\nFrankfort is home to three distilleries including the Buffalo Trace Distillery (Kentucky Bourbon), Castle &amp; Key Distillery (spirits), and Three Boys Farm Distillery (bourbon and whiskey).\nIn 2018, thousands of teachers protested at the city in response to Senate Bill 151 having been passed on March 29, 2018. The bill was shortly overturned on December 13, 2018, by the Kentucky Supreme Court as unconstitutional, which prevented the bill from going into effect on January 1, 2019.\nGeography.\nFrankfort is located in the (inner) Bluegrass region of Central Kentucky. The city is bisected by the Kentucky River, which makes an s-turn as it passes through the center of town. The river valley widens at this point, which creates four distinct parts of town. The valley within the city limits contains Downtown and South Frankfort districts, which lie opposite one another on the river. A small neighborhood with its own distinct identity, Bellepoint, is located on the west bank of the river to the north of Benson Creek, opposite the river from the \"downtown\" district. The suburban areas on either side of the valley are respectively referred to as the \"West Side\" and \"East Side\" (or \"West Frankfort\" and \"East Frankfort\").\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nFrankfort does not have a commercial airport and travelers fly into Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, the closest; Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport near Covington or Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville. Capital City Airport serves general and military aviation.\nClimate.\nFrankfort has a humid subtropical climate with four distinct seasons. Winter is generally cool with some snowfall. Spring and fall are both mild and relatively warm, with ample precipitation and thunderstorm activity. Summers are hot and humid.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 28,602 people, 12,434 households, and 6,053 families residing in the city.

It had a population of 227,470 at the 2020 United States census, making it Louisiana's second-most populous city. It is the seat of Louisiana's most populous parish, East Baton Rouge Parish, and the center of Louisiana's second-largest metropolitan area, Greater Baton Rouge, which had 870,569 residents in 2020.\nLocated on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River, the Baton Rouge area owes its historical importance to its strategic site upon the Istrouma Bluff, the first natural bluff upriver from the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. This allowed the development of a business quarter safe from seasonal flooding. In addition, it built a levee system stretching from the bluff southward to protect the riverfront and low-lying agricultural areas.\nBaton Rouge has developed as a culturally rich center, settled by immigrants from European nations and African peoples brought to North America as slaves or indentured servants. It was ruled by seven different nations: the French, Spanish and British in the colonial era; briefly the Republic of West Florida; the United States as a territory and a state; the Confederate States of America; and the United States again since the end of the American Civil War. The city developed as a multicultural region practicing many religious traditions from Catholicism to Protestantism and Louisiana Voodoo.\nBaton Rouge is a major industrial, petrochemical, medical, research, motion picture, and technology center of the Southern United States. It is the location of Louisiana State University, the LSU system's flagship university and the state's largest institution of higher education. It is also the location of Southern University, the flagship institution of the Southern University System\u2014the nation's only historically black college system.\nThe Port of Greater Baton Rouge is the tenth-largest in the U.S. by tonnage shipped, and it is the farthest upstream Mississippi River port capable of handling Panamax ships. Major corporations participating in the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area's economy include Amazon, Lamar Advertising Company, BBQGuys, Marucci Sports, Piccadilly Restaurants, Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, ExxonMobil, Brown &amp; Root, Shell, and Dow Chemical Company.\nHistory.\nPre-history.\nHuman habitation in the Baton Rouge area has been dated to 12000\u20136500 BC, based on evidence found along the Mississippi, Comite, and Amite rivers. Earthwork mounds were built by hunter-gatherer societies in the Middle Archaic period, from roughly the fourth millennium BC. The speakers of the Proto-Muskogean language divided into its descendant languages by about 1000 BC; and a cultural boundary between either side of Mobile Bay and the Black Warrior River began to appear between about 1200 BC and 500 BC\u2014a period called the Middle \"Gulf Formational Stage\". The Eastern Muskogean language began to diversify internally in the first half of the first millennium AD.\nThe early Muskogean societies were the bearers of the Mississippian culture, which formed around 800 AD and extended in a vast network across the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, with numerous chiefdoms in the Southeast, as well. By the time the Spanish made their first forays inland from the shores of the Gulf of Mexico in the early 16th century, by some evidence many political centers of the Mississippians were already in decline, or abandoned. At the time, this region appeared to have been occupied by a collection of moderately sized native chiefdoms, interspersed with autonomous villages and tribal groups. Other evidence indicates these Mississippian settlements were thriving at the time of the first Spanish contact. Later Spanish expeditions encountered the remains of groups who had lost many people and been disrupted in the aftermath of infectious diseases, chronic among Europeans, unknowingly introduced by the first expedition.\nColonial period.\nFrench explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville led an exploration party up the Mississippi River in 1698. The explorers saw a red pole marking the boundary between the Houma and Bayagoula tribal hunting grounds. The French name \"le b\u00e2ton rouge\" (\"the red stick\") is the translation of a native term rendered as \"Istrouma\", possibly a corruption of the Choctaw \"iti humma\" (\"red pole\"); Andr\u00e9-Joseph P\u00e9nicaut\u2014a carpenter traveling with d'Iberville\u2014published the first full-length account of the expedition in 1723. According to P\u00e9nicaut:\nFrom there [Manchacq] we went five leagues higher and found very high banks called \"\u00e9corts\" in that region, and in savage called \"Istrouma\" which means red stick [\"b\u00e2ton rouge\"], as at this place there is a post painted red that the savages have sunk there to mark the land line between the two nations, namely: the land of the Bayagoulas which they were leaving and the land of another nation\u2014thirty leagues upstream from the \"baton rouge\"\u2014named the Oumas.The red pole was presumably at Scott's Bluff, on what is now the campus of Southern University. It was reportedly a painted pole adorned with fish bones.\nEuropean settlement of Baton Rouge began in 1721 when French colonists established a military and trading post. Since then, Baton Rouge has been governed by France, Britain, Spain, Louisiana, the Republic of West Florida, the United States, the Confederate States, and the United States again. In 1755, when French settlers in the colony of Acadia (known as Acadians) were deported from there by British authorities, many took up residence in rural Louisiana, including Baton Rouge. Popularly known as Cajuns they maintained a distinct culture for centuries. From 1763 to 1783, Baton Rouge was part of the British North American colony of West Florida, though it was captured by Spanish forces in September 1779. During the first half of the 19th century, Baton Rouge grew steadily as the result of steamboat trade and transportation.\nIncorporation and growth.\nBaton Rouge was incorporated in 1817. In 1822, the Pentagon Barracks complex of buildings was completed. The site was used by Spanish, French, and British authorities and was occupied by both the Confederate States Army and United States Army. It was also part of the short-lived Republic of West Florida. In 1951, ownership of the barracks was transferred to the state of Louisiana. In 1976, the complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nAcquisition of Louisiana by the United States in 1803 was a catalyst for increased Anglo-American settlement, especially in the northern part of the state. In 1846, the state legislature designated Baton Rouge as Louisiana's new capital to replace \"sinful\" New Orleans. The architect James Dakin was hired to design the old Louisiana State Capitol, with construction beginning in late 1847.\nRather than mimic the United States Capitol, as many other states had done, he designed a capitol in Neo-Gothic style, complete with turrets and crenellations, and stained glass; it overlooks the Mississippi. It has been described as the \"most distinguished example of Gothic Revival\" architecture in the state and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.\nBy the outbreak of the American Civil War, the population of Baton Rouge was nearly 5,500. The war nearly halted economic progress, except for businesses associated with supplying the Union Army occupation of the city, which began in the spring of 1862 and lasted for the duration of the war. The Confederates at first consolidated their forces elsewhere, during which time the state government moved to Opelousas and later Shreveport. In the summer of 1862, about 2,600 Confederate troops under generals John C. Breckinridge (the former Vice President of the United States) and Daniel Ruggles attempted to recapture Baton Rouge.\nAfter the war, New Orleans temporarily served as the seat of the Reconstruction era state government. When the Bourbon Democrats regained power in 1882, after considerable intimidation and voter suppression of black Republicans, they returned the state government to Baton Rouge, where it has since remained. In his 1893 guidebook, Karl Baedeker described Baton Rouge as \"the Capital of Louisiana, a quaint old place with 10,378 inhabitants, on a bluff above the Mississippi\".\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the petrochemical industry boomed in Baton Rouge, stimulating the city's expansion beyond its original center. The changing market in the oil business has produced fluctuations in the industry, affecting employment in the city and area. In 1953, there was a bus boycott by black riders who were forbidden to occupy seats reserved for whites, leading eventually to some improvement of their rights.\nOn January 10, 1972, a violent shootout between members of the Nation of Islam (NOI) and the police ensued, which left two sheriff's deputies and two black males dead at the scene. 31 individuals were injured, including 14 police officers. In response, then-Louisiana Governor John McKeithen ordered 700 members of the Louisiana National Guard to patrol the streets to tamp down further intercity violence. Baton Rouge Mayor-President Woodrow Wilson \"W. W.\" Dumas subsequently imposed an evening to early-morning curfew. On January 14, the curfew was lifted.\nA building boom began in the city in the 1990s and continued into the 2000s, during which Baton Rouge became one of the fastest-growing cities in the Southern United States in terms of technology. Metropolitan Baton Rouge was ranked as one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the U.S. (with a population under 1 million), with 602,894 in 2000 and 802,484 people as of the 2010 U.S. census. After the extensive damage in New Orleans and along the coast from Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, the city took in as many as 200,000 displaced residents.\nIn 2010, Baton Rouge started a market push to become a test city for Google's new super high speed fiber optic line known as GeauxFiBR.\nIn July 2016, the Greater Baton Rouge metropolitan area was heavily affected by the shooting of Alton Sterling. His death led to multiple protests and the shooting of police officers. President Barack Obama also made remarks on the shooting of Alton Sterling. By February 2021, Sterling's family was given a $4.5 million settlement to settle a wrongful death lawsuit. In August 2016, the city and metropolitan area were severely flooded.\nDuring the runoff for District 3 of the Louisiana Public Service Commission in December 2022, many Baton Rougeans helped elect Davante Lewis\u2014the first openly LGBT politician to the state government.\nOn April 28, 2024, the Louisiana State Supreme Court gave the city of St. George the right to secede from Baton Rouge, in a 4\u20133 decision.\nGeography.\nThe city of Baton Rouge lies on the banks of the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana's Florida Parishes region. The city is about from New Orleans, from Alexandria, from Lafayette and from Shreveport. It is also from Jackson, Mississippi and from Houston, Texas. Baton Rouge lies on a low elevation of 56 to a little over 62 feet above sea level.\nBaton Rouge is the capital of Louisiana and the parish seat of East Baton Rouge Parish. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which are land and (2.81%) are covered by water.\nBaton Rouge is on the first set of bluffs north of the Mississippi River Delta's coastal plains. Because of its prominent location along the river and on the bluffs, which prevents flooding, the French built a fort in the city in 1719. Baton Rouge is the third-southernmost capital city in the continental United States, after Austin, Texas, and Tallahassee, Florida. It is the cultural and economic center of the Greater Baton Rouge metropolitan area.\nClimate.\nBaton Rouge has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\"). It has mild winters, hot and humid summers, moderate to heavy rainfall, and the possibility of damaging winds and tornadoes yearlong. The area's average precipitation is 61.94 inches (141.1\u00a0cm) of rain and 0.1 inches (0.25\u00a0cm) of snow annually. With ample precipitation, Baton Rouge is fifth on the list of wettest cities in the United States. Snow in the Baton Rouge area is usually rare, although it snowed in three consecutive years at the first decade of the 21st century: December 11, 2008, December 4, 2009, and February 12, 2010. In 2017, Baton Rouge received snow again. In January 2025, Baton Rouge as well as all of southern Louisiana received record snowfall in a once-in-a-lifetime blizzard. The yearly average temperature for Baton Rouge is . The average temperature for January is and July is . The area is usually free from extremes in temperature, with some cold winter fronts, but those are usually brief.\nBaton Rouge's proximity to the Gulf of Mexico exposes the city and metropolitan area to hurricanes. On September 1, 2008, Hurricane Gustav struck the city and became the worst hurricane ever to hit the Baton Rouge area. Winds topped , knocking down trees and powerlines and making roads impassable. The roofs of many buildings suffered tree damage, especially in the Highland Road, Garden District, and Goodwood areas. The city was shut down for five days and a curfew was put in effect. Rooftop shingles were ripped off, signs blew down, and minor structural damage occurred.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrior to colonization, American Indians were once the primary residents of present-day Baton Rouge. With the coming of European colonization, and the migration of American settlers after the Louisiana Purchase, European and African-descended peoples became the predominant groups in the area by birth rates and immigration to a 1860 population of 5,428. Since reaching its first historic high of 220,394 residents at the 1980 U.S. census, the city's population has expanded and contracted twice: from 219,531 in 1990, to 227,818 in 2000\u2014the second historic high\u2014and 229,493, the city-proper's third historic high in 2010, to 227,470 at the 2020 United States census. The black population gradually increased in Baton Rouge after the Civil War.\nIncluding the consolidated city\u2013parish of Baton Rouge in 2019 (East Baton Rouge Parish), the American Community Survey estimated 443,763 people lived in the area.

With the increase among people of color during the 20th century, Baton Rouge has also declined as a predominantly non-Hispanic white city, hastened by suburbanization, aging out, and white flight. In 1970, non-Hispanic whites were 70.5% of the population. In 2020, they were 34.2% of the total population.\nIn the 2020 United States census, Black or African Americans made up the majority (53.55%) of the city-proper's population. In 2021 census estimates, Black or African Americans made up the largest share of youths. The remaining racial and ethnic makeup for the city in 2020 was 34.22% non-Hispanic white, 0.17% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.21% Asian, 0.03% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 2.55% two or more races, and 5.94% Hispanic and Latino American of any race.

In 1969, the Krewe of Apollo\u2014an LGBT social club originating from nearby New Orleans\u2014developed a sister branch for Baton Rouge. Its annual drag balls were targets of further discrimination. Since then, other organizations have been established, such as the Capital City Alliance. The area has grown a sizeable LGBT community, holding festivals such as Baton Rouge Pride.\nReligion and spirituality.\nNative American religions and Afrodiasporic religions were commonplace alongside Christianity in Baton Rouge's early history. Due to French, Spanish, and British colonization and missionary efforts, in addition to American settlement, Baton Rouge became a predominantly Christian city and metropolitan area. In a 2020 study by the Association of Religion Data Archives, Christianity is the most-practiced religion for the Baton Rouge area, being influenced by Catholicism and Protestantism.\nIn 2020, ARDA reported there were 61 congregations and 174,410 Catholics within the metropolitan area. The Catholic population is primarily served by the Latin Church's Roman Catholic Diocese of Baton Rouge\u2014a suffragan diocese of the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of New Orleans.

New religious movements including contemporary paganism have small communities in the area, and a minority practice Haitian Vodou, Louisiana Voodoo, and Hoodoo. In Sperling's 2019 study, 31.9% of the population identified as either spiritual but not religious, agnostic, or atheist\nEconomy.\nBaton Rouge enjoys a strong economy that has helped the city be ranked as one of the \"Top 10 Places for Young Adults\" in 2010 by portfolio.com and one of the top 20 cities in North America for economic strength by the Brookings Institution. In 2009, the city was ranked by CNN as the 9th-best place in the country to start a new business. Lamar Advertising Company has its headquarters in Baton Rouge.

Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company had an office in Baton Rouge before being sold in 2017. In 2023, Aldi established a presence in Baton Rouge.\nBaton Rouge is the farthest inland port on the Mississippi River that can accommodate ocean-going tankers and cargo carriers. The ships transfer their cargo (grain, oil, cars, containers) at Baton Rouge onto rails and pipelines (to travel east\u2013west) or barges (to travel north). Deep-draft vessels cannot pass the Old Huey Long Bridge because the clearance is insufficient. In addition, the river depth decreases significantly just to the north, near Port Hudson.\nBaton Rouge's largest industry is petrochemical production and manufacturing. ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge Refinery complex is the fifth-largest oil refinery in the country; it is the world's tenth largest. Baton Rouge also has rail, highway, pipeline, and deep-water access.

Together with an emerging medical corridor at Essen Lane, Summa Avenue and Bluebonnet Boulevard, Baton Rouge is developing a medical district expected to be similar to the Texas Medical Center. LSU and Tulane University have both announced plans to construct satellite medical campuses in Baton Rouge to partner with Our Lady of the Lake Medical Center and Baton Rouge General Medical Center, respectively.\nSoutheastern Louisiana University and Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady University both have nursing schools in the medical district off Essen Lane. Louisiana State University's Pennington Biomedical Research Center, which conducts clinical and biological research, also contributes to research-related employment in the area around the Baton Rouge medical district.\nThe film industry in Louisiana has expanded dramatically since the beginning of the 21st century, aided by generous tax incentives adopted by the state in 2002.

Several smaller art galleries, including the Baton Rouge Gallery, offering a range of local art, are scattered throughout the city.\nThe city has several designated arts and cultural districts, the most prominent of which are the Mid-City Cultural District and the Perkins Road Arts District. These districts provide tax incentives, mostly in the form of exempting state tax on purchases, to promote cultural activity in these areas. Located in a Qualified Census Tract the North Baton Rouge community of Scotlandville was designated a Cultural District in 2020.\nA performing arts scene is emerging. LSU's Swine Palace is the foremost theatre company in the city, largely made up of students of LSU's MFA acting program, as well as professional actors and stage managers.

LSU's arboretum was originally developed in 1929 and donated to the university in 1981.\nGovernment.\nThe city of Baton Rouge and the Parish of East Baton Rouge have been run by a consolidated government since 1947. It combined the Baton Rouge municipal government with the rural areas of the parish, allowing people outside the limits of the city of Baton Rouge to use city services. Though the city and parish have a consolidated government, this differs slightly from a traditional consolidated city-county government.\nThe cities of Zachary, Baker, Central, and St. George operate their own city governments within East Baton Rouge Parish. Under this system, Baton Rouge has the uncommon office of \"mayor-president\", which consolidates the executive offices of \"mayor of Baton Rouge\" and \"president of East Baton Rouge Parish\". Though Zachary, Baker, and Central each have their own mayors, citizens living in these municipalities are still a part of the constituency who can vote and run in elections for mayor-president and metropolitan council.\nThe mayor-president's duties include setting the agenda for the government and managing the government's day-to-day functions. They are also responsible for supervising departments, as well as appointing the department heads. The mayor does not set the city's public policy because that is the Metropolitan Council's role, but the mayor-president does have some influence on the policy through appointments and relationships with council members.\nThe current mayor-president of Baton Rouge is Republican Sid Edwards.\nMetropolitan council.\nWhen the city and parish combined government, the city and parish councils consolidated to form the East Baton Rouge Parish Metropolitan Council. The Metropolitan Council is the legislative branch of the Baton Rouge government. Its 12 district council members are elected from single-member districts. They elect from among themselves the mayor-president\" pro tempore\". The mayor-president pro tempore presides over the council's meetings and assumes the role of the mayor-president if the mayor-president is unable to serve. The council members serve four-year terms and can hold office for three terms.\nIn the late 1960s, Joe Delpit\u2014a local African American businessman owning and operating the Chicken Shack\u2014was elected as the first black council member in Baton Rouge. As in other cities of Louisiana and the South, African Americans had been largely disenfranchised for decades into the 20th century. The Chicken Shack, with multiple locations, in 2015 was reported as the oldest continually operating business in Baton Rouge.\nThe Metropolitan Council's main responsibilities are setting the policy for the government, voting on legislation, and approving the city's budget. The council makes policies for the following: the city and parish general funds, all districts created by the council, the Greater Baton Rouge Airport District, the Public Transportation Commission, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sewerage Control Commission and the Greater Baton Rouge Parking Authority.\nEducation.\nBaton Rouge is home to many universities. Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, generally known as Louisiana State University or LSU, is a public university that is the flagship campus of the Louisiana State University System. LSU is Louisiana's largest university, with over 30,000 students and 1,300 full-time faculty members. Southern University and A&amp;M College, generally known as Southern University or SU, is the flagship institution of the Southern University System, the nation's only historically black land-grant university system. SU is the largest HBCU and second-oldest public university in Louisiana.\nVirginia College opened in October 2010 and offers students training in areas such as cosmetology, business, health, and medical billing. Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady University is an independent Catholic institution also in the Baton Rouge medical district that has programs in nursing, health sciences, humanities, behavioral sciences, and arts and sciences. It has an associated hospital, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center. Tulane University planned to open a satellite medical school at Baton Rouge General's Mid City Campus in 2011.\nSoutheastern Louisiana University School of Nursing is located in the medical district on Essen Lane in Baton Rouge. Southeastern offers traditional baccalaureate and master's degree programs, as well as LPN and RN to BSN articulation. Baton Rouge Community College is an open-admission, two-year post-secondary public community college, established on June 28, 1995. The college settled into a permanent location in 1998. The college's enrollment is more than 8,000 students. The Pennington Biomedical Research Center houses 48 laboratories and 19 core research facilities.\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nEast Baton Rouge Parish Public Schools operates primary and secondary schools serving the city. The city of Baton Rouge is also home to 27 charter schools with a total enrollment of an estimated 11,000 students as of 2020. One of the latest includes the Mentorship Academy in downtown Baton Rouge, which leverages its location downtown to establish internship opportunities with local businesses as well as provide a high-tech classroom environment to focus on a digital animation curriculum.\nThe East Baton Rouge Parish School System is the second-largest public school system in the state and contains nine U.S. Blue Ribbon schools and a nationally renowned Magnet program. The school system serves more than 42,850 students and with the help of 6,250 teachers and faculty, the district has shown growth and increase in its District Performance Score. The East Baton Rouge Parish Public Schools serve East Baton Rouge Parish and has 90 schools with 56 elementary schools, 16 middle schools, and 18 high schools.\nLibraries.\nThe State Library of Louisiana is in Baton Rouge. The Louisiana Legislature created the Louisiana Library Commission in 1920. This later became the State Library of Louisiana. The State Library provides Louisiana residents with millions of items with its collections, electronic resources, and the statewide network for lending.\nThe East Baton Rouge Parish Library System has 14 local libraries with one main library and 13 community libraries. The main library at Goodwood houses genealogy and local history archives. The library system is an entity of the city-parish government. The system has been in operation since 1939. It is governed by the EBR Parish government and directed by the Library Board of Control. The Baton Rouge Metropolitan Council appoints the seven-member board and then the board appoints a director. According to its website, all branches are open seven days a week to assist the public with reference and information and computer access.\nThe Louisiana State Archives' Main Research Library is located in Baton Rouge, as well. It houses general history books, census indices, immigration schedules, church records, and family histories. The library also has a computerized database of more than two million names that has various information about these people including census, marriage, and social security filing information.\nLouisiana State University and the Louisiana State University Law Center have libraries on their respective Baton Rouge campuses. Southern University and A&amp;M College and the Southern University Law Center also have libraries on their respective Baton Rouge campuses.\nMedia.\nThe major daily newspaper for the Greater Baton Rouge metropolitan area is \"The Advocate\", publishing since 1925. Until 1991, Baton Rouge also had an evening newspaper, \"The State-Times\"\u2014at that time, the morning paper was known as \"The Morning Advocate\". Other publications include: \"Baton Rouge Parents Magazine\", \"Pink &amp; Blue Magazine\", \"The Daily Reveille\", \"The Southern Review\", \"225 magazine\", \"DIG\", \"https://\", \"inRegister magazine\", \"10/12 magazine\", \"Country Roads\" magazine, \"225Alive\", \"Healthcare Journal of Baton Rouge\", \"Southern University Digest\", and \"The South Baton Rouge Journal\".\nOther newspapers in East Baton Rouge Parish include the \"Central City News\" and \"The Zachary Post\". The Greater Baton Rouge area is well served by television and radio. The market is the 95th-largest designated market area in the U.S. Major television network affiliates serving the area include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBaton Rouge also offer local government-access television-only channels on Cox Cable channel 21.\nInfrastructure.\nHealth and medicine.\nBaton Rouge is served by several hospitals and clinics:\nCommunication.\nMost of the Baton Rouge area's high-speed internet, broadband, and fiber optic communications are provided by REV (formerly EATEL), AT&amp;T Inc., Charter Communications, or Cox Communications. In 2006, Cox Communications linked its Lafayette, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans markets with fiber-optic infrastructure. Other providers soon followed suit, and fiber optics have thus far proven reliable in all hurricanes since they were installed, even when mobile and broadband services are disrupted during storms. In 2001, the Supermike computer at Louisiana State University was ranked as the number-one computer cluster in the world, and remains one of the top 500 computing sites in the world.\nMilitary installations.\nBaton Rouge is home station to the Louisiana Army National Guard 769th Engineer Battalion, which had units deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. The armory near LSU has three company-sized units: 769th HSC (headquarters support company); 769th FSC (forward support company); and the 927th Sapper Company. Other units of the battalion are located at Napoleonville (928th Sapper Company); Baker, Louisiana (926th MAC mobility augmentation company); and Gonzales, Louisiana (922nd Horizontal Construction Company).\nThe 769th Engineer Battalion is part of the 225th Engineer Brigade, headquartered in Pineville, Louisiana, at Louisiana National Guard Training Center Pineville. Four engineer battalions and an independent bridging company are in the 225th Engineer Brigade, making it the largest engineer group in the US Army Corps of Engineers.\nBaton Rouge is also home to 3rd Battalion, 23rd Marine Regiment (3/23), a reserve infantry battalion in the United States Marine Corps located throughout the Midwestern United States consisting of about 800 marines and sailors. The battalion was first formed in 1943 for service in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II, taking part in a number of significant battles including those at Saipan and Iwo Jima before being deactivated at the end of the war. In the early 1960s, the unit was reactivated as a reserve battalion. The battalion is headquartered in Saint Louis, Missouri, with outlying units throughout the Midwestern United States. 3/23 falls under the command of the 23rd Marine Regiment and the 4th Marine Division.\nTransportation.\nHighways and roads.\nInterstates.\nBaton Rouge has three interstate highways: I-10, I-12 (Republic of West Florida Parkway), and I-110 (Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway).\nInterstate 10 enters the city from the Horace Wilkinson Bridge over the Mississippi River, curving at an interchange with Interstate 110 southeast, crossing the LSU lakes and Garden District before reaching an interchange with I-12 (referred to as the 10/12 split). It curves further southeast toward New Orleans as it crosses Essen Lane near the Medical District. It passes Bluebonnet Blvd and the Mall of Louisiana at exit 162, and leaves Baton Rouge after interchanges with Siegen Lane and Highland Road.\nInterstate 12 (The Republic of West Florida Parkway) begins in the city at the I-10/I-12 split east of College Drive, and proceeds eastward, crossing Essen Lane, Airline Hwy, Sherwood Forest Blvd, Millerville Road, and O'neal Lane before leaving the city when crossing the Amite River.\nInterstate 110 (The Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway) stretches 8 miles in a north\u2013south direction from the east end of the Horace Wilkinson Bridge to Scenic Highway in Scotlandville, Louisiana. It passes through downtown, North Baton Rouge, and Baton Rouge Metro Airport before ending at Scenic Highway.\nU.S. highways and major roads.\nBaton Rouge has two U.S. highways, along with their business counterparts: Airline Highway (US 61) and Florida Boulevard.\nU.S. 190 enters the city from the Huey P. Long Bridge, beginning a concurrency with U.S. 61 after an interchange with Scenic Highway, near Scotlandville. Its name is Airline Highway from this interchange to the interchange with Florida Blvd. At this interchange, U.S. 190 turns east to follow Florida Blvd through Northeast Baton Rouge, exiting the city at the Amite River.\nU.S. 61 enters Baton Rouge as Scenic Highway until it reaches Airline Highway (U.S. 190). It becomes concurrent with U.S. 190 until Florida Blvd, where it continues south, still called Airline Highway. It passes through Goodwood and Broadmoor before an interchange with I-12. It continues southeast past Bluebonnet Blvd/Coursey Blvd, Jefferson Hwy, and Sherwood Forest Blvd/Siegen Lane before exiting the city at Bayou Manchac.\nU.S. 61/190 Business runs west along Florida Boulevard (known as Florida Street from Downtown east to Mid City) from Airline Highway to River Road in downtown. The cosigned routes run from Florida St. north along River Road, passing the Louisiana State Capitol and Capitol Park Complex before intersecting with Choctaw Drive. North of this intersection River Road becomes Chippewa Street and curves to the East. U.S. 61/190 Business leaves Chippewa Street at its intersection with Scenic Highway. The route follows Scenic Highway to Airline Highway, where it ends. North of Airline on Scenic and East of Scenic Highway on Airline is US 61. U.S. 190 is East and West of Scenic on Airline Highway.\nThese are important surface streets with designated state highway numbers: Greenwell Springs Road (LA 37), Plank Road/22nd Street (LA 67), Burbank Drive/Highland Road (LA 42), Nicholson Drive (LA 30), Jefferson Highway/Government Street (LA 73), Scotlandville/Baker/Zachary Highway (LA 19), Essen Lane (LA 3064), Bluebonnet Blvd/Coursey Blvd (LA 1248), Siegen Lane/Sherwood Forest Blvd (LA 3246), and Perkins Road/Acadian Thruway (LA 427).\nTraffic issues and highway upgrades.\nAccording to the 2008 INRIX National Traffic Scorecard, which ranks the top 100 congested metropolitan areas in the U.S., Baton Rouge was the 33rd-most congested metro area in the country. At a population rank of 67 out of 100, it has the second-highest ratio of population rank to congestion rank, higher than even the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana metropolitan area, indicating a remarkably high level of congestion for the comparatively low population. According to the Scorecard, Baton Rouge was the only area out of all 100 to show an increase in congestion from 2007 to 2008 (+ 6%). The city also tied for the highest jump in congestion rank over the same period (14 places).\nInterstate 12 used to have a major bottleneck at O'Neal Lane. The interstate was three lanes wide in each direction to the O'Neal Lane exit, where the interstate abruptly became two lanes in each direction and crossed the narrow Amite River Bridge. This stretch of road, called \"a deathtrap\" by one lawmaker, had become notorious for traffic accidents, many with fatalities. In 2007, ten people died in traffic accidents within a three-month period on this section of road.\nIn 2009, Governor Bobby Jindal and the Baton Rouge legislative delegation allocated state and federal funding to widen I-12 from O'Neal Lane to Range Avenue (Exit 10) in Denham Springs. The construction was completed in 2012 and has significantly improved the flow of traffic. In 2010, The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act provided committed federal funds to widen I-12 from the Range Avenue Exit to Walker, Louisiana. Noticing the significant improvement in commute times, Jindal further funded widening to Satsuma, Louisiana.\nInterstate 10 West at Bluebonnet Road also ranked within the top 1000 bottlenecks for 2008, and I-10 East at Essen Lane and Nicholson Drive ranked not far out of the top 1000. A new exit to the Mall of Louisiana was created in 2006, and the interstate was widened between Bluebonnet Blvd and Siegen Lane. But the stretch of I-10 from the I-10/I-12 split to Bluebonnet Blvd was not part of these improvements and remained heavily congested during peak hours. In response, a widening project totaling at least $87 million began in late 2008. Interstate 10 was widened to three lanes over a five-year period between the I-10/I-12 split and Highland Road. In 2010, the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act provided supplemental funding for this project to extend to the Highland Road exit in East Baton Rouge Parish.\nSurface streets in Baton Rouge are prone to severe congestion. But roads are beginning to handle the number of vehicles using them after years of stagnation in road upgrades. Baton Rouge Mayor Kip Holden has instituted an extensive upgrade of East Baton Rouge Parish roads known as the Green Light Plan, geared toward improving areas of congestion on the city's surface streets. With its first project completed in 2008, it has seen numerous others reach completion as of 2015, with several more under construction and still others yet to break ground.\nA circumferential loop freeway was proposed for the greater Baton Rouge metro area to help alleviate congestion on the existing through-town routes. The proposed loop would pass through the outlying parishes of Livingston (running alongside property owned and marketed as an industrial development by Al Coburn, a member of President Mike Grimmer's staff), Ascension, West Baton Rouge, and Iberville, as well as northern East Baton Rouge Parish. This proposal has been subject to much contention, particularly by residents living in the outer parishes through which the loop would pass.\nCommuting.\nThe average one-way commute time in Baton Rouge is 26.5 minutes, slightly less than the U.S. average of 27.1 minutes. Interstates 10, 110 and 12, which feed into the city, are highly traveled and connected by highways and four-lane roads that connect the downtown business area to surrounding parishes.\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 81.9% of working Baton Rouge residents commuted by driving alone, 8.5% carpooled, 3% used public transportation, and 2.4% walked. About 1.2% used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 3.1% worked at home. In 2015, 10.4 percent of Baton Rouge households lacked a car, and increased slightly to 11.4 percent in 2016; higher than average for a city of its size. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Baton Rouge averaged 1.55 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.\nBuses and other mass transit.\nCapital Area Transit System (CATS) provides urban transportation throughout Baton Rouge, including service to Southern University, Baton Rouge Community College, and Louisiana State University. Many CATS buses are equipped with bike racks for commuters to easily combine biking with bus transit. Greyhound Bus Lines, offering passenger and cargo service throughout the United States, has a downtown terminal on Florida Boulevard.\nShipping.\nThe Port of Baton Rouge is the ninth-largest in the United States by tonnage shipped, and is the farthest upstream Mississippi River port capable of handling Panamax ships.\nAirport.\nThe Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport, located in the North Baton Rouge community of Scotlandville, is situated just 10 minutes north of downtown and nearby Baker. The airport serves as a vital transportation hub, connecting the area with the four major airline hubs that serve the southern United States. Commercial carriers include American Eagle, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines. Nonstop service is available to Washington, D.C.; Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, and Charlotte.\nRail.\nThree major railroads, Canadian Pacific Kansas City, Union Pacific, and Canadian National provide railroad freight service to Baton Rouge.\nThe Yazoo and Mississippi Valley station had passenger service until the mid-1960s. The Kansas City Southern depot hosted the \"Southern Belle,\" the final train to serve the city, until 1969. Since 2006, Baton Rouge and New Orleans leaders as well as the state government have been pushing to secure funding for a new high-speed rail passenger line between downtown Baton Rouge and downtown New Orleans, with several stops in between. A new New Orleans\u2013Baton Rouge passenger rail service was included as part of the \"Amtrak Connects US\" expansion vision.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57839", "revid": "8747689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57839", "title": "Annapolis, Maryland", "text": "Capital city of Maryland, United States\nAnnapolis ( ) is the capital of the U.S. state of Maryland. It is the county seat of Anne Arundel County and its only incorporated city. Situated on the Chesapeake Bay at the mouth of the Severn River, south of Baltimore and about east of Washington, D.C., Annapolis forms part of the Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area. The 2020 census recorded its population as 40,812, an increase of 6.3% since 2010.\nThis city served as the seat of the Confederation Congress, formerly the Second Continental Congress, and temporary national capital of the United States in 1783\u20131784. At that time, General George Washington came before the body convened in the new Maryland State House and resigned his commission as commander of the Continental Army. A month later, the Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris of 1783, ending the American Revolutionary War, with Great Britain recognizing the independence of the United States.\nThe city and state capitol was also the site of the 1786 Annapolis Convention, which issued a call to the states to send delegates for the Constitutional Convention to be held the following year in Philadelphia. The Annapolis Peace Conference took place in 2007.\nAnnapolis is the home of St. John's College, founded 1696. The U.S. Naval Academy, established 1845, is adjacent to the city limits.\nHistory.\nColonial and early United States (1649\u20131808).\nA settlement in the Province of Maryland named \"Providence\" was founded on the north shore of the Severn River on the middle Western Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in 1649 by Puritan exiles from the Province/Dominion of Virginia led by the third Proprietary Governor of Maryland, William Stone (1603\u20131660). The settlers later moved to a better-protected harbor on the Severn's southern shore. The settlement on the south shore, known from 1683 as \"Town at Proctor's\", then \"Town at the Severn\", became in 1694 \"Anne Arundel's Towne\" (after Lady Anne Arundell (1616\u20131649), the late wife of the late Cecilius Calvert, second Lord Baltimore, 1605\u20131675).\nIn 1654, after the Third English Civil War, Parliamentary forces assumed control of the Maryland colony and Stone went into exile south across the Potomac River in Virginia. Per orders from Lord Baltimore, Stone returned the following spring at the head of a Cavalier royalist force, loyal to the uncrowned King of England. On March 25, 1655, in what became known as the Battle of the Severn (the first colonial naval battle in North America), Stone was defeated, taken prisoner, and replaced by Lt. Gen. Josias Fendall (1628\u20131687) as fifth Proprietary Governor. Fendall governed Maryland during the latter half of the English Commonwealth period. In 1660, he was replaced by Phillip Calvert (1626\u20131682) as fifth/sixth Governor of Maryland, after the restoration of Charles II (1630\u20131685) as King in England.\nIn 1694, soon after the overthrow of the Catholic government of second Royal Governor Thomas Lawrence (1645\u20131714, in office for a few months in 1693), the third Royal Governor Francis Nicholson (1655-1727/28, in office: 1694\u20131698), moved the capital of the royal colony, the Province of Maryland, to Anne Arundel's Towne and renamed the town \"Annapolis\" after Princess Anne of Denmark and Norway, soon to become Queen Anne of Great Britain (1665\u20131714, reigned 1702\u20131714). Annapolis was incorporated as a city in 1708. Colonel John Seymour, the Governor of Maryland from 1704 to 1709, wrote Queen Anne on March 16, 1709, with qualifications for municipal officials and provisions for fairs and market days for the town.\nIn the 17th century, Annapolis was little more than a village, but it grew rapidly for most of the 18th century until the American Revolutionary War as a political and administrative capital, a port of entry, and a major center of the Atlantic slave trade. The \"Maryland Gazette\", which became an important weekly journal, was founded there by Jonas Green in 1745; in 1769 a theater opened; during this period also the commerce was considerable, but it declined rapidly after Baltimore, with its deeper harbor, was made a port of entry in 1780. Water trades such as oyster-packing, boatbuilding and sailmaking became the city's chief industries. Annapolis is home to a large number of recreational boats that have largely replaced the seafood industry in the city.\nDr. Alexander Hamilton (1712\u20131756), a Scottish-born doctor and writer, lived and worked in Annapolis. Leo Lemay says his 1744 travel diary \"Gentleman's Progress: The Itinerarium of Dr. Alexander Hamilton\" is \"the best single portrait of men and manners, of rural and urban life, of the wide range of society and scenery in colonial America.\"\nAnnapolis became the temporary capital of the United States after the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Congress was in session in the state house from November 26, 1783, to August 19, 1784, and it was in Annapolis on December 23, 1783, that General Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army.\nFor the 1783 Congress, the Governor of Maryland commissioned John Shaw, a local cabinetmaker, to create an American flag. Shaw's flag is slightly different from other designs of the time: the blue field extends over the entire height of the hoist. Shaw developed two versions of the flag: one which started with a red stripe and another that started with a white one.\nIn 1786, delegates from all states of the Union were invited to meet in Annapolis to consider measures for the better regulation of commerce. Delegates from only five states\u2014New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey, and Delaware\u2014actually attended the September 1786 gathering, known afterward as the Annapolis Convention. Without proceeding to the business for which they had met, the delegates passed a resolution calling for another convention to meet at Philadelphia in the following year to amend the Articles of Confederation. The resulting Philadelphia Convention drafted and approved the Constitution of the United States, which remains in force.\nCivil War era (1849 \u2013 late 1800s).\nOn April 24, 1861, the midshipmen of the Naval Academy relocated their base in Annapolis and were temporarily housed in Newport, Rhode Island, until October 1865.\nIn 1861, the first of three camps that were built for holding paroled soldiers was created on the campus of St. John's College. The second location of Camp Parole would house over 20,000 and would be located where Forest Drive is currently. The third and final location was finished in late 1863 and would be placed near the Elkridge Railroad, as to make transportation of soldiers and resources easier before and allowing the camp to grow to its highest numbers. This area just west of the city is still referred to as Parole. The soldiers who did not survive were buried in the Annapolis National Cemetery.\nContemporary era.\nIn 1900, Annapolis had a population of 8,585. On December 21, 1906, Henry Davis was lynched in the city. He was suspected of assaulting a local woman. Nobody was ever tried for the crime.\nDuring World War II, shipyards in Annapolis built a number of PT Boats, and military vessels such as minesweepers and patrol boats were built in Annapolis during the Korean and Vietnam wars. It was at Annapolis in July 1940 that Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg arrived in exile during World War II.\nIn the summer of 1984, the Navy Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis hosted soccer games as part of the XXIII Olympiad.\nDuring September 18\u201319, 2003, Hurricane Isabel created the largest storm surge known in Annapolis's history, cresting at . Much of downtown Annapolis was flooded and many businesses and homes in outlying areas were damaged. The previous record was during a hurricane in 1933, and during Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Downtown Annapolis has high-tide \"sunny day\" flooding. A Stanford University study found that this resulted in 3,000 less visits and $172,000 in lost revenue for local business in 2017.\nFrom mid-2007 through December 2008, the city celebrated the 300th anniversary of its 1708 Royal Charter, which established democratic self-governance. The many cultural events of this celebration were organized by Annapolis Charter 300.\nAnnapolis was home of the Anne Arundel County Battle of the Bands, which was held at Maryland Hall from 1999 to 2015. The event was a competition between musical groups from each high school in the county; it raised over $100,000 for the county's high school music programs during its 17-year run.\nOn June 28, 2018, at the Capital Gazette, a gunman killed five journalists and injured two more.\nAn EF-2 tornado struck the western edge of the city on September 1, 2021, during the remnants of Hurricane Ida. Homes, businesses, and restaurants had significant damage near Maryland Route 450, where EF-2 damage was observed with estimated winds of 125\u00a0mph. The tornado dissipated immediately past U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 301.\n2007 Annapolis Conference.\nAs announced by United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Annapolis was the venue for a Middle East summit dealing with the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, with the participation of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (\"Abu Mazen\") and various other leaders from the region. The conference was held at the United States Naval Academy on November 26, 2007.\nHistoric institutions.\nThe State House.\nThe Maryland State House is the oldest in continuous legislative use in the United States. Construction started in 1772, and the Maryland legislature first met there in 1779. It is topped by the largest wooden dome built without nails in the country. The Maryland State House housed the workings of the United States government from November 26, 1783, to August 13, 1784, and the Treaty of Paris was ratified there on January 14, 1784, so Annapolis became the first peacetime capital of the U.S.\nIt was in the Maryland State House that George Washington famously resigned his commission before the Continental Congress on December 23, 1783.\nUnited States Naval Academy.\nThe United States Naval Academy was founded in 1845 on the site of Fort Severn, and now occupies an area of land reclaimed from the Severn River. Students who attend the Naval Academy are enrolled for four years with a following five-year commitment to serving on active duty in the Marine Corps or Navy. Students hold the naval rank of midshipman, and on average about 4,500 are enrolled.\nSt. John's College.\nSt. John's College is a non-sectarian private college that was once supported by the state. It was opened in 1789 as the successor of King William's School, which was founded by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1696 and was opened in 1701. Its principal building, McDowell Hall, was originally to be the governor's mansion; although \u00a34,000 was appropriated to build it in 1742, it was not completed until after the War of Independence.\nGeography.\nLocated south of Baltimore and east of Washington, D.C., Annapolis is the closest state capital to the national capital. In land area Annapolis (proper) is also the smallest of the United States capital cities.\nClimate.\nThe city is a part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and is relatively flat, with the highest point being only above sea level.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nAnnapolis lies within the humid subtropical climate zone (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\"), with hot, humid summers, cool winters, and generous precipitation year-round. Low elevation and proximity to the Chesapeake Bay give the area more moderate spring and summertime temperatures and slightly less extreme winter lows than locations further inland, such as Washington, D.C.\nFlooding.\nIn November 2020, NASA reported that Annapolis had 18 days of high-tide (non-storm-related) flooding from May 2019 to April 2020, an increase over 2018's 12 days, and higher than the 1995-2005 average of 2 days annually. The increase is attributed to sea level rise caused by climate change. Resultant flood damages caused local businesses to lose as much as $172,000 a year. On Naval Academy grounds, seawater came out of storm drains, with McNair Road and Ramsay Road flooding 20 times in 2020 and more than 40 times each in 2018 and 2019. Though a $37 million sea wall was completed in 2024 to adapt to flooding occurring 30 to 40 times a year, adaptation approaches such as sea walls and building up the height of roadways and athletic fields are predicted to last only a few decades.\nAnnapolis has seen the highest increased rate of coastal flooding in the country. The Naval Academy is especially vulnerable to sea rise, as it is surrounded on three sides by water, and has some land only three feet above the 2019 water line. Hurricanes\u2014which have been increasing in intensity because of global warming\u2014pose additional flooding threats, with Hurricane Isabel having caused $100 million in flood damage in 2003. The Academy's Sea Level Rise Advisory Council has created a climate change adaptation plan including seawall repair, door dams, doorway barriers, backflow preventers in storm drain systems, and elevated building entrances.\nAfter 2024's record 120 flooding events, on November 3, 2025, ground was broken on an $87 million City Dock Project designed to protect against expected flooding events through 2060. Specifically, the goal is to protect against flood waters up to above the daily average lowest level of the water\u2014higher than the experienced during 2003's Hurricane Isabel.

Based on the play by Charles Dickens, the 90-minute production by the Colonial Players is an original musical adaptation, with play and lyrics by Richard Wade and music by Dick Gessner. Colonial Players, Inc. is a nonprofit organization founded in 1949. Its first production, \"The Male Animal\", was performed in 1949 at the Annapolis Recreation Center on Compromise Street. In 1955, the organization moved to its venue in a former automotive repair shop on East Street.\nDuring the warmer months, Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre presents three shows on its outdoor stage, which is visible from the City Dock. A nonprofit organization, Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre has been providing \"theatre under the stars\" since 1966, when it performed \"You Can't Take It with You\" and \"Brigadoon\" at Carvel Hall Hotel. It began leasing its site at 143 Compromise Street, the former location of the Shaw Blacksmith Shop, in 1967, and became owner of the property in 1990.\nThe Naval Academy Masqueraders, a theater group at the United States Naval Academy, produces one \"main-stage show\" each fall and student-directed one-act plays in the spring.

The Market House, though relatively modern, stands in a vicinity occupied by similar market houses dating to 1730 when the city market was moved from the State House area to the head of the dock. The dock itself is now used largely by recreational vessels rather than the commercial boats and boats of Chesapeake Bay watermen selling catches. The dock and surroundings are part of the Colonial Annapolis National Historic Landmark (NHL) District.\nThe Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley memorial, located in a park at the head of Annapolis City Dock, commemorates the arrival point of Alex Haley's African ancestor, Kunta Kinte, whose story is related in Haley's 1976 novel \"\".

Some examples are the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade, May Day, and United States Naval Academy Commissioning Week.\nGovernment.\nCity government.\nAnnapolis is governed via the weak mayor system. The city council consists of eight aldermen who are elected from single member wards. The mayor is elected directly in a citywide vote.

Moss Academy, is also in the Annapolis area.\nMedia.\n\"The Capital\" covers the news of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County. In addition to being in the broadcast areas of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., television and most radio stations, Annapolis is home of radio station WNAV.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nRoads and highways.\nNo major highways enter the city limits of Annapolis. Just outside the city limits, I-595/US 50/US 301 traverses the region on an east\u2013west route, connecting the Annapolis area to Washington, D.C., and the Eastern Shore of Maryland. I-97 interchanges with I-595/US 50/US 301 a few miles west of Annapolis and provides the most direct link to Baltimore. MD 2 also passes just outside the city limits and is the best connection to Southern Maryland, while also providing an alternate route to Baltimore.\nThe most prominent roads directly accessing the city include MD 70, which connects downtown Annapolis to US 50/US 301, and MD 665, which does likewise for the southwestern portions of the city. Other state highways serving Annapolis include MD 181, MD 387, MD 393, MD 435, MD 436, MD 450, MD 788 and MD 797.\nBus.\nThe Annapolis Department of Transportation provides bus service with eight routes, collectively branded Annapolis Transit. The system serves the city with recreational areas, shopping centers, educational and medical facilities, and employment hubs. ADOT also offers transportation for the elderly and persons with disabilities. Several Maryland Transit Administration commuter buses also allow for access to Baltimore or Washington, D.C.\nRailway.\nFrom 1840 to 1968, Annapolis was connected to the outside world by railroad. The Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway operated two electrified interurban lines that brought passengers into the city from both the South and the North. The southern route ran down King George Street and Main Street, leading directly to the statehouse, while the northern route entered town via Glen Burnie. In 1935, the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway went bankrupt due to the effects of the Great Depression and suspended service along its southern route, while the newly created Baltimore &amp; Annapolis Railroad retained service on the northern route. Steam trains of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad also occasionally operated over the line to Annapolis, primarily for special Naval Academy movements. Passenger rail service on the Baltimore &amp; Annapolis Railroad was eventually discontinued in 1950; freight service ceased in 1968 after the dilapidated trestle crossing the Severn River was condemned. The tracks were eventually dismantled in 1976.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 1992 film Patriot Games (film) is filmed in part in Annapolis, particularly around the USNA.\nThe 1955 film \"An Annapolis Story\" takes place at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis.\nThe 2006 film \"Annapolis\" is set in the titular city.\nThe 2014 film \"Are You Here\" is partially set in Annapolis.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It had a population of 43,228 at the 2020 United States census, ranking as the 16th most populous city in the state, but the 9th least populous U.S. state capital. It is also the county seat of Cole County and the principal city of the Jefferson City Metropolitan Statistical Area, the second-most-populous metropolitan area in Mid-Missouri and the fifth-most populous in the state. It forms part of the nine-county Columbia\u2013Jefferson City\u2013Moberly combined statistical area, which has 415,747 residents. Most of the city is located within Cole County, with a small northern section extending into adjacent Callaway County.\nJefferson City is named for Thomas Jefferson (1743\u20131826), the third President of the United States, 1801\u20131809, and earlier major author of the Declaration of Independence of the United States on July 4, 1776. He also served several diplomatic posts overseas in Europe and was the first U.S. Secretary of State (1790\u20131793) in the first President's Cabinet of George Washington, and subsequently the second Vice President (1797\u20131801) under second chief executive John Adams.\nJefferson City is located on the northern edge of the Ozark Plateau on the southern side of the Missouri River in a region known as Mid-Missouri, that is roughly mid-way between the state's two large urban areas of Kansas City to the west and St. Louis in the east (along the west bank of the Mississippi River). It is south of Columbia, Missouri, and sits at the western edge of the Missouri Rhineland, one of the major wine-producing regions of the Midwest. The city is dominated by the monumental domed Missouri State Capitol, which rises from a bluff overlooking the nearby Missouri River to the north. Lewis and Clark with their Corps of Discovery passed the bluff here on their historic expedition upriver in 1804, eventually journeying westward to the Pacific Northwest region and the Pacific Ocean, before Europeans or Americans established any settlement there.\nMany of Jefferson City's primary employers are in service and manufacturing industries like Hitachi. Jefferson City is also home to Lincoln University, a public historically black and federal land-grant university founded the year after the American Civil War in 1866, by the Union Army black veterans of the First Missouri Regiment of Colored Infantry &amp; 62nd Regiment of U.S. Colored Troops with support from the Second Missouri Regiment of Colored Infantry / 65th Regiment of U.S. Colored Troops.\nHistory.\nIn pre-Columbian times, this region was home of an ancient people known today as the Mound Builders, likely related to the Mississippian societies. They were subsequently replaced by Osage Native Americans. In the late 17th century, frontiersmen began to inhabit the area, including Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, Louis Jolliet, Jacques Marquette, Robert de LaSalle, and Daniel Boone, with the latter having the greatest influence on the region. Famed Western explorer and settler Daniel Boone's son, Daniel Morgan Boone (1769\u20131839), would later lay out and plat Jefferson City in the early 19th century.\nWhen the Missouri Territory was organized in 1812, St. Louis was Missouri's seat of government for the territorial governor and territorial legislature. Later St. Charles would serve as the next capital town of the old Territory. Jefferson City was chosen as the new state capital in 1821, after Missouri was admitted to the Union as the 24th State. The village on the southern banks of the Missouri River, first was called \"Lohman's Landing\", and when the new state legislature decided to relocate there, they proposed the name \"Missouriopolis\" before settling on the city of \"Jefferson\" to honor former third President Thomas Jefferson, who was still living at his Virginia home estate of Monticello for the next five years.\nOver the years, the city was most often referred to as \"Jefferson City\"; the common name eventually stuck. For years, this village was little more than a trading post located in the wilderness about midway between St. Louis and Kansas City. In 1825, the settlement was formally incorporated, and a year later, the state legislature of the General Assembly of Missouri moved to Jefferson City, where they would continue to meet.\nJefferson City was also chosen by the lawmakers as the site of a state prison. This prison, named the Missouri State Penitentiary, opened in 1836. This prison was the unfortunate home to multiple infamous Americans, including former heavyweight boxing champion Sonny Liston, Martin Luther King Jr. assassin James Earl Ray, and infamous 1930s bank robber Pretty Boy Floyd.\nDuring the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), Jefferson City was occupied by Union / Federal troops. The elected state legislature of the General Assembly were driven from Jefferson City by Union Army General Nathaniel Lyon (1818\u20131861). Some of the rebelling legislators later reconvened in nearby Neosho and passed an ordinance of secession from the Federal Union.\nMissouri was claimed by both the southern Confederacy and the Federal Union of the remaining United States, as was neighboring border state of Kentucky to the east, also split by the impending conflict of civil war. Missourians were strongly divided and many people in the state\u2014especially in St. Louis\u2014supported the Union, while other areas of the state, such as Missouri's Little Dixie were strongly pro-Confederate, further west along the Missouri River between Jefferson City and Kansas City.\nGerman immigrants created vineyards in small towns on either side of the Missouri River, especially on the north from the city east to Marthasville, located outside of St. Louis. Known as the \"Missouri Rhineland\" for its vineyards and first established by German immigrants in the mid-1800s, this region has become part of Missouri's agricultural and tourist economy.\n2019 tornado.\nApproximately 15 minutes before midnight on May 22, 2019, a tornado emergency was issued for the Jefferson City area. Minutes later, a destructive EF-3 tornado caused extensive damage on the southwest side of the city. At least 20 people were injured, but none were killed due to this tornado. The tornado originally touched down west of Eldon before heading its way to Jefferson City.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nClimate.\nJefferson City has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfa\") with hot, rainy summers and cold winters. The city borders on having a humid subtropical climate but falls just short due to January having a mean temperature of which is below the isotherm. Thunderstorms are common in both the spring and summer. Light snow is common during the winter, although about half of wintertime precipitation falls as rain.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nThe 2020 United States census counted 43,228 people, 16,882 households, and 9,327 families in Jefferson City.

Due to the gold rush, Helena became a wealthy city, with approximately 50 millionaires inhabiting the area by 1888. The concentration of wealth contributed to the city's prominent, elaborate Victorian architecture.\nAt the 2020 census Helena's population was 32,091, making it the 5th least populous state capital in the United States and the 6th most populous city in Montana. It is the principal city of the Helena Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Lewis and Clark, and Jefferson counties; the MSA's population being 83,058 according to the 2020 census.\nThe local daily newspaper is the \"Independent Record\". The city is served by Helena Regional Airport (HLN).\nHistory.\nThe Helena area was long inhabited by various indigenous peoples. Evidence from the MacHaffie and Indian Creek sites on opposite sides of the Elkhorn Mountains southeast of the Helena Valley show that people of the Folsom culture lived in the area more than 10,000 years ago. Before the introduction of the horse 300 years ago, and since, other native peoples, including the Salish and the Blackfeet, visited the area seasonally on their nomadic rounds.\nEarly European settlement and gold rush.\nBy the early 1800s, people of European descent from the United States and British Canada began arriving to work the streams of the Missouri River watershed looking for fur-bearing animals such as the beaver, undoubtedly bringing them through the area now known as the Helena Valley.\nGold strikes in Idaho Territory in the early 1860s attracted many migrants who initiated major gold rushes at Grasshopper Creek (Bannack) and Alder Gulch (Virginia City) in 1862 and 1863 respectively. So many people came that the federal government created a new territory called Montana in May 1864. The miners prospected far and wide for new placer gold discoveries. On July 14, 1864, the discovery of gold by a prospecting party known as the \"Four Georgians\" in a gulch off the Prickly Pear Creek led to the founding of a mining camp along a small creek in the area they called \"Last Chance Gulch\". In the 1870s, a Pennsylvania brick and stone mason named Louis Reeder built Reeder's Alley. It is a strong link to the beginnings of the settlement. He invested in the lots along then Cutler Street (now known as Reeder's Alley) and between 1872 and 1884 built over 30 brick and stone one-room tenements for miners.\nIn 1876, Thomas Cruse, a prospector of Irish descent, discovered a massive gold deposit in the mountains, northwest of Helena. He soon filed a mining patent on 20.25 acres and opened the famous Drumlummon Mine which produced a rich bounty of gold and silver worth millions of dollars.\nBy fall of 1864, the population had grown to over 200, and some thought the name \"Last Chance\" was too crass. On October 30, 1864, a group of at least seven self-appointed men met to name the town, authorize the layout of the streets, and elect commissioners. The first suggestion was \"Tomah\", a word the committee thought had connections to the local Indian people. Other nominations included Pumpkinville and Squashtown (as the meeting was held the day before Halloween). Other suggestions were to name the community after various Minnesota towns, such as Winona and Rochester, as a number of settlers had come from Minnesota. Finally, a Scotsman, John Summerville, proposed \"Helena\", which he pronounced , in honor of Helena Township, Scott County, Minnesota. This immediately caused an uproar from the former Confederates in the room, who insisted upon the pronunciation , after Helena, Arkansas, a town on the Mississippi River. While the name \"Helena\" won, the pronunciation varied until approximately 1882 when the pronunciation became dominant. Later tales of the naming of Helena claimed the name came from the island of St. Helena, where Napoleon was exiled, or was that of a miner's sweetheart.\nHelena was surveyed by Captain John Wood in 1865 for the first time. The original streets of Helena followed the paths of miners, thus making the city blocks of Early Helena various sizes and shapes.\nIn 1870, Henry D. Washburn, having been appointed Surveyor General of Montana in 1869, organized the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition in Helena to explore the regions that would become Yellowstone National Park. Mount Washburn, within the park, is named for him. Members of the expedition included Helena residents:\nWealth boom.\nBy 1888 about 50 millionaires lived in Helena, more per capita than in any city in the world. They had made their fortunes from gold. It is estimated about $3.6 billion in today's money was extracted from Helena during this period of time. The Last Chance Placer is one of the most famous placer deposits in the western United States. Most of the production occurred before 1868. Much of the placer is now under Helena's streets and buildings.\nThis large concentration of wealth was the basis of developing fine residences and ambitious architecture in the city; its Victorian neighborhoods reflect the gold years. The numerous miners also attracted the development of a thriving red light district. Among the well-known local madams was Josephine \"Chicago Joe\" Airey, who built a thriving business empire between 1874 and 1893, becoming one of Helena's largest and most influential landowners. Helena's brothels were a successful part of the local business community well into the 20th century, ending with the 1973 death of Helena's last madam, \"Big Dorothy\" Baker.\nHelena's official symbol is a drawing of \"The Guardian of the Gulch\", a wooden fire watch tower built in 1886. It still stands on Tower Hill overlooking the downtown district. The tower, built in 1874, replaced a series of observation buildings, the original being built in response to a series of devastating fires that swept through the early mining camp. On August 2, 2016, an arson attack severely damaged the tower and it was deemed structurally unstable. The tower is to be demolished but will be rebuilt using the same methods as in its original construction.\nIn 1889, railroad magnate Charles Arthur Broadwater opened his Hotel Broadwater and Natatorium west of Helena. The Natatorium was home to the world's first indoor swimming pool. Damaged in the 1935 Helena earthquake, it closed in 1941. The property's many buildings were demolished in 1976. Today, the Broadwater Fitness Center stands just west of the Hotel &amp; Natatorium's original location, complete with an outdoor pool heated by natural spring water running underneath it.\nHelena has been the capital of Montana Territory since 1875 and the state of Montana since 1889. Referendums were held in 1892 and 1894 to determine the state's capital; the result was to keep the capitol in Helena. In 1902, the Montana State Capitol was completed. Until the 1900 census, Helena was the most populous city in the state. That year it was surpassed by Butte (with a population of 30,470), where mining industry was developing.\nAmong the settlers the city's prosperity attracted were Blacks fleeing racism in the South. Many found work in the mines or on the railroads and established a middle class that supported Black-owned businesses, Black churches, Black newspapers and a Black literary society. A Black police officer patrolled the town's wealthiest (white) neighborhood. But in the later 1900s new discriminatory laws, such as a ban on mixed marriages and the establishment of many sundown towns, along with the attendant racist attitudes that led to them drove many Blacks out not just Helena but the state, to the point that the city's Black population today is a small fraction of what it was in the early 20th century.\nIn 1916, the United Daughters of the Confederacy commissioned the construction of the Confederate Memorial Fountain in Hill Park. It was the only Confederate memorial in the Northwestern United States. The fountain was removed on August 18, 2017, after the Helena City Commission deemed it a threat to public safety following a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nThe Archie Bray Foundation, a ceramics center founded in 1952, is just northwest of Helena, near Spring Meadow Lake.\n1980s\u2013present.\nThe Cathedral of Saint Helena and the Helena Civic Center are two of Helena's many significant historic buildings.\nMany working Helenans (approx. 18%) work for agencies of the state government. When in Helena, most people visit the local walking mall. It was completed in the early 1980s after Urban Renewal and the Model Cities Program in the early 1970s had removed many historic buildings from the downtown district. During the next decade, a three-block shopping district was renovated that followed the original Last Chance Gulch. A small artificial stream runs along most of the walking mall to represent the underground springs that originally flowed above ground in parts of the Gulch.\nIn September 1983, the EPA proposed that an approximately 8.4 acre site in East Helena be listed on the Superfund National Priorities List because of a zinc and lead smelting facility had been emitting heavy metals like arsenic, lead, and cadmium into the air and soil for almost a century. Following thorough testing of soil, groundwater, and biological samples (blood, stool, and hair) from local residents, the results showed that residents of East Helena, especially children under seven, recorded significantly higher blood lead levels than those of the average Montana population. Thus, the East Helena site was officially listed in June 1984 and continues to undergo regular remediation and monitoring activities in coordination with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC).\nA significant train wreck occurred on February 2, 1989, in which a 48-car runaway freight train slammed into a parked train near Carroll College, setting off an explosion that blasted out windows up to three miles away, causing most of the city to lose power and forcing some residents to evacuate in subzero weather.\nWith the mountains, Helena has much outdoor recreation, including hunting and fishing. Great Divide Ski Area is northwest of town near the ghost town of Marysville. Helena is also known for its mountain biking. It was officially designated as an International Mountain Bicycling Association bronze level Ride Center on October 23, 2013.\nHelena High School and Capital High School are public high schools in Helena School District No. 1.\nIn 2017, Helena voters elected as mayor former Liberian refugee Wilmot Collins, who was widely reported to be Helena's first black mayor. The \"Independent Record\" reported contested research indicating that in the early 1870s one E. T. Johnson, listed in the city directory as a black barber from Washington D.C., had been elected mayor, before Helena became an incorporated town.\nGeography.\nSurrounding features include the Continental Divide, Mount Helena City Park, Spring Meadow Lake State Park, Lake Helena, Helena National Forest, the Big Belt Mountains, the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness, Sleeping Giant Wilderness Study Area, Bob Marshall Wilderness, Scapegoat Wilderness, the Missouri River, Canyon Ferry Lake, Holter Lake, Hauser Lake, and the Elkhorn Mountains.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nClimate.\nHelena has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\"), with long, cold and moderately snowy winters, hot and dry summers, and short springs and autumns in between. Snowfall has been observed in every month but July, but is usually absent from May to September, and normally accumulates in only light amounts. Winters have periods of moderation, partly due to warming influence from chinooks. Precipitation mostly falls in the spring and is generally sparse, averaging only annually. The hottest temperature recorded in Helena was on August 24, 1969, and July 15, 2002, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 31, 1893, January 25, 1957, and February 2, 1996.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 28,190 people, 12,780 households, and 6,691 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 13,457 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 93.3% White, 0.4% African American, 2.3% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.6% from other races, and 2.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.8% of the population.\nThere were 12,780 households, of which 24.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.2% were married couples living together, 10.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.6% had a male householder with no wife present, and 47.6% were non-families. 39.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.07 and the average family size was 2.77.\nThe median age in the city was 40.3 years. 20.1% of residents were under the age of 18; 11.6% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 23.3% were from 25 to 44; 29.5% were from 45 to 64; and 15.6% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.0% male and 52.0% female.\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 25,780 people, 11,541 households, and 6,474 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 12,133 housing units at an average density of . The ethnic makeup of the city is 94.8% White, 0.2% African American, 2.1% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.4% from other races, and 1.7% from two or more races. 1.7% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nThere were 11,541 households, out of which 27.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 42.5% were married couples living together, 10.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.9% were non-families. 37.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.14 and the average family size was 2.83.\nIn the city, the population was spread out, with 22.4% under the age of 18, 11.1% from 18 to 24, 26.6% from 25 to 44, 26.0% from 45 to 64, and 13.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.6 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $34,416, and the median income for a family was $50,018. Males had a median income of $34,357 versus $25,821 for females. The per capita income for the city was $20,020. About 9.3% of families and 14.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.4% of those under age 18 and 8.3% of those age 65 or over.\nEconomy.\nHelena has a long record of economic stability with its history as being the state capital and being founded in an area rich in silver and lead deposits. However, this situation has resulted in a slow growing economy. Its status as capital makes it a major hub of activity at the county, state, and federal level. According to the Helena Area Chamber of Commerce, the capital's median household income is $50,889, and its unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in 2013, about 1.2% lower than the rest of the state. Education is a major employer, with two high schools and accompanying elementary and middle schools for K\u201312 students as well as Helena College. Major private employers within the city of Helena include Carroll College and the medical community.\nHelena's economy is also bolstered by Fort William Henry Harrison, the training facility for the Montana National Guard, located just outside the city. Fort Harrison is also home to , where many Helena-area residents work.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary education.\nSeveral school districts provide public education from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade.\nThe Helena Public School District has two components: Helena Elementary School District and Helena High School District. Almost all of Helena is in Helena Elementary School District and Helena High School District. A small portion extends into East Helena K-12 Schools.\nThe Helena Elementary School District consists of 13 schools covering students from pre-kindergarten to 8th grade. There were 5,181 students enrolled in the district during the 2021\u20132022 school year.\nThe Helena High School District has two schools for students in 9th through 12th grade. Helena High School had 1,128 students enrolled for the 2021\u20132022 school year while Capital High School had 1,350.\nLibrary.\nHelena's public library is the main branch of the Lewis &amp; Clark Library.

It was the capital of the United States from November 1 until December 24, 1784. Trenton and Princeton are the two principal cities of the Trenton\u2013Princeton metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses those cities and all of Mercer County for statistical purposes and constitutes part of the New York combined statistical area by the U.S. Census Bureau. However, Trenton directly borders the Philadelphia metropolitan area to its west, and the city was part of the Philadelphia combined statistical area from 1990 until 2000.\nIn the 2020 United States census, Trenton was the fifth largest city in Central Jersey and the 10th-most-populous municipality statewide, with a population of 90,871, an increase of 5,958 (+7.0%) from the 2010 census count of 84,913, which in turn had reflected a decline of 490 (\u22120.6%) from the 85,403 counted in the 2000 census. The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program calculated that the city's population was 89,661 in 2022, ranking the city the 382nd-most-populous in the country. Trenton is the only city in New Jersey that is served by three commuter rail transit systems (Amtrak, NJ Transit, and SEPTA), and the city has encouraged a spate of transit-oriented development.\nTrenton dates back at least to June 3, 1719, when mention was made of a constable being appointed for Trenton while the area was still part of Hunterdon County. Boundaries were recorded for Trenton Township as of March 2, 1720. A courthouse and jail were constructed in Trenton around 1720, and the Freeholders of Hunterdon County met annually in Trenton.\nOn November 25, 1790, Trenton became New Jersey's capital, and by November 13, 1792, the City of Trenton was formed within Trenton Township. Trenton Township was incorporated as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798.\nThe city historically had a major manufacturing industry, with factories producing iron, steel, rubber, pottery, and other products that served the nation. Today Trenton's economy is dominated by the Government of New Jersey.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known inhabitants of the area that is today Trenton were the Lenape Native Americans, specifically the Axion band who were the largest tribe on the Delaware River in the mid-17th century.\nThe first European settlement in what would become Trenton was established by Quakers in 1679, in the region then called the Falls of the Delaware, led by Mahlon Stacy from Handsworth, Sheffield, England. Quakers were being persecuted in England at this time, and North America provided an opportunity to exercise their religious freedom.\nBy 1719, the town adopted the name \"Trent-towne\", after William Trent, one of its leading landholders who purchased much of the surrounding land from Stacy's family. This name was later shortened to \"Trenton\".\nThe first municipal boundaries were recorded on March 2, 1720, and a courthouse and jail were constructed around the same time.\nIn 1758, the Old Barracks were built to house British soldiers during the French and Indian War. On January 19, 1764, Benjamin Franklin, Postmaster General of the colonies, appointed Abraham Hunt, a Lieutenant Colonel in the New Jersey Hunterdon County militia and prominent merchant in Trenton, as the city's first postmaster. Hunt was again appointed Trenton's postmaster on October 13, 1775, shortly after the American Revolutionary War broke out.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Trenton was the site of the Battle of Trenton. On December 25\u201326, 1776, George Washington and his army crossed the icy Delaware River to Trenton, where they defeated Hessian troops garrisoned there. The second battle of Trenton, Battle of the Assunpink Creek, was fought here on January 2, 1777. After the war, the Congress of the Confederation met for two months at the French Arms Tavern from November 1, 1784, to December 24, 1784. While the city was preferred by New England and other northern states as a permanent capital for the new country, the southern states ultimately prevailed in their choice of a location south of the Mason\u2013Dixon line. On April 21, 1789, the city hosted a reception for George Washington on his journey to New York City for his first inauguration. The Trenton Battle Monument, a granite column topped with a statue of George Washington, was built in 1893 to commemorate the battle.\nTrenton became the state capital in 1790, but prior to that year the New Jersey Legislature often met in the city. The city was incorporated on November 13, 1792. In 1792, the New Jersey State House was built, making it the third-oldest state house in the country. In 1799, the federal government relocated its offices to Trenton for a period of several months, following an outbreak of yellow fever in the then-capital of Philadelphia.\nDuring the War of 1812, the United States Army's primary hospital was at a site on Broad Street.\nTrenton had maintained an iron industry since the 1730s and a pottery industry since at least 1723. The completion of both the Delaware and Raritan Canal and the Camden and Amboy Railroad in the 1830s spurred industrial development in Trenton. In 1845, industrialist Peter Cooper opened a rolling mill. In 1848, engineer John Roebling moved his wire rope mill to the city, where suspension cables for bridges were manufactured, including the Brooklyn Bridge. Throughout the 19th century, Trenton grew steadily, as European immigrants came to work in its pottery and wire rope mills. Trenton became known as an industrial hub for railroads, trucking, rubber, plastics, metalworking, electrical, automobile parts, glass, and textiles industries.\nThe city's largest and most long-standing industry was ceramics. From the 1850s-1950s, scores of pottery companies called the city home and Trenton became known as the \"Staffordshire of America.\" In the late 19th century Walter Scott Lenox founded the Ceramic Art Company, which eventually became Lenox, Inc., a nationally-known producer of fine china. Lenox designed and manufactured White House china for multiple Presidents of the United States.\nOn February 22, 1834, portions of Trenton Township were taken to form Ewing Township. The remaining portion of Trenton Township was absorbed by the city on April 10, 1837. In 1837, with the population now too large for government by council, a new mayoral government was adopted, with by-laws that remain in operation to this day. During the latter half of the century, Trenton annexed multiple municipalities: South Trenton Borough on April 14, 1851, portions of Nottingham Township on April 14, 1856, Chambersburg and Millham Township on March 30, 1888, and Wilbur borough on February 28, 1898. Portions of Ewing Township and Hamilton Township were annexed to Trenton on March 23, 1900.\nIn 1855, the College of New Jersey was founded in Trenton. In 1865, Rider University was also founded in Trenton. Mercer Community College began in Trenton in 1966.\nThe Trenton Six were a group of black men arrested for the alleged murder of an elderly white shopkeeper in January 1948 with a soda bottle. They were arrested without warrants, denied lawyers and sentenced to death based on what were described as coerced confessions. With the involvement of the Communist Party and the NAACP, there were several appeals, resulting in a total of four trials. Eventually the accused men (with the exception of one who died in prison) were released. The incident was the subject of the book \"Jersey Justice: The Story of the Trenton Six\", written by Cathy Knepper.\nIn the 1950s, the State of New Jersey purchased a large portion of what was then Stacy Park, a large riverfront park located next to downtown that contained large open lawns, landscaping, and promenades. Much of the park was demolished to make way for the construction of Route 29, despite the protests toward its construction. After it was built, the area was then mostly filled with parking lots and scattered state office buildings, disconnecting the city from the riverfront.\nRiots of 1968.\nThe Trenton Riots of 1968 were a major civil disturbance that took place during the week following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis on April 4. Race riots broke out nationwide following the murder of the civil rights activist. More than 200 Trenton businesses, mostly in Downtown, were ransacked and burned. More than 300 people, most of them young black men, were arrested on charges ranging from assault and arson to looting and violating the mayor's emergency curfew. In addition to 16 injured policemen, 15 firefighters were treated at city hospitals for injuries suffered while fighting raging blazes or inflicted by rioters. Area residents pulled false alarms and would then throw bricks at firefighters responding to the alarm boxes. This experience, along with similar experiences in other major cities, effectively ended the use of open-cab fire engines. As an interim measure, the Trenton Fire Department fabricated temporary cab enclosures from steel deck plating until new equipment could be obtained. The losses incurred by downtown businesses were initially estimated by the city to be $7\u00a0million, but the total of insurance claims and settlements came to $2.5\u00a0million.\nTrenton's Battle Monument neighborhood was hardest hit. Since the 1950s, North Trenton had witnessed a steady exodus of middle-class residents, and the riots spelled the end for North Trenton. By the 1970s, the region had become one of the most blighted and crime-ridden in the city.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 8.21 square miles (21.25\u00a0km2), including 7.58 square miles (19.63\u00a0km2) of land and 0.63 square miles (1.62\u00a0km2) of water (7.62%). In terms of land area, Trenton is also the second-smallest of the United States capital cities, behind Annapolis, Maryland.\nTrenton is located near the geographic center of the state, which is located southeast of the city.\nMercer County constitutes its own metropolitan statistical area, the Trenton-Princeton MSA, which is part of the Tri-State Region. Locals consider Trenton to be a part of Central Jersey, and thus part of neither North Jersey nor South Jersey though sometimes included in both. They are generally split as to whether they are within New York or Philadelphia's sphere of influence. While it is closer to Philadelphia, many people commute to New York City and have moved there to escape the New York region's high housing costs.\nTrenton is one of two state capitals that border another state\u2014the other being Carson City, Nevada.\nTrenton borders Ewing Township, Hamilton Township and Lawrence Township in Mercer County; and Falls Township, Lower Makefield Township and Morrisville in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.\nThe Northeast Corridor goes through Trenton. A straight line drawn between Center City, Philadelphia and Downtown Manhattan would pass within 2000 feet of the New Jersey State House.\nSeveral bridges across the Delaware River connect Trenton to Morrisville, Pennsylvania, all of which are operated by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission. The Trenton\u2013Morrisville Toll Bridge, originally constructed in 1952, stretches , carrying U.S. Route 1. The Lower Trenton Bridge, bearing the legend \"TRENTON MAKES THE WORLD TAKES\", is a span that was constructed in 1928 on the site of a bridge that dates back to 1804. The Calhoun Street Bridge, dating back to 1884, is long.\nNeighborhoods.\nTrenton is home to numerous neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods. The main neighborhoods are taken from the four cardinal directions. Trenton was once home to large Italian, Hungarian, and Jewish communities, but, since the 1950s, demographic shifts have changed the city into a relatively segregated urban enclave of middle and lower income African Americans and newer immigrants, many of whom arrive from Latin America. Italians are scattered throughout the city, but a distinct Italian community is centered in the Chambersburg neighborhood, in South Trenton. This community has been in decline since the 1970s, largely due to economic and social shifts to the suburbs surrounding the city. Today Chambersburg has a large Latino community. Many of the Latino immigrants are from Mexico, Guatemala and Nicaragua. There is also a significant and growing Asian community in the Chambersburg neighborhood primarily made up of Burmese and Bhutanese/Nepali refugees.\nThe North Ward, once a mecca for the city's middle class, is now one of the most economically distressed, torn apart by race riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Nonetheless, the area still retains many important architectural and historic sites. North Trenton still has a large Polish-American neighborhood that borders Lawrence Township, many of whom attend St. Hedwig's Roman Catholic Church on Brunswick Avenue. St. Hedwig's church was built in 1904 by Polish immigrants, many of whose families still attend the church. North Trenton is also home to the historic Shiloh Baptist Church\u2014one of the largest houses of worship in Trenton and the oldest African American church in the city, founded in 1888. The church is currently pastored by Rev. Darrell L. Armstrong, who carried the Olympic torch in 2002 for the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Also located just at the southern tip of North Trenton is the city's Battle Monument, also known as \"Five Points\". It is a structure that marks the spot where George Washington's Continental Army launched the Battle of Trenton during the American Revolutionary War. It faces downtown Trenton and is a symbol of the city's historic past.\nSouth Ward is a diverse neighborhood, home to many Latin American, Italian-American, and African American residents. The Chambersburg neighborhood was once noted in the region as a destination for its many Italian restaurants and pizzerias. With changing demographics, many of these businesses have either closed or relocated to suburban locations.\nEast Ward is the smallest neighborhood in Trenton and is home to the Trenton Transit Center and Trenton Central High School.\nWest Ward is the home of Trenton's more suburban neighborhoods.\nNeighborhoods in the city include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Trenton lies in the northern range of the humid subtropical (\"Cfa\") zone, and precipitation fairly evenly distributed through the year. The \"Cfa\" climate is the result of adiabatic warming of the Appalachians, low altitude and proximity to the coast without being on the immediate edge for moderate temperatures.\nSummers are hot and humid, with a July daily average of ; temperatures reaching or exceeding occur on 21.8 days. Episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values reaching . Extremes in air temperature have ranged from on February 9, 1934, up to as recently as July 22, 2011. However, air temperatures reaching or are uncommon.\nWinters are cold and damp: the daily average temperature in January is , and temperatures at or below occur on 3.9 nights annually, while there are 17 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing. Episodes of extreme cold and wind can occur with wind chill values below , every few years. The plant hardiness zone at the Trenton Municipal Court is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of .\nThe average precipitation is per year, which is fairly evenly distributed through the year. The driest month on average is February, with of precipitation on average, while the wettest month is July with of rainfall on average which corresponds with the annual peak in thunderstorm activity. The all-time single-day rainfall record is on September 16, 1999, during the passage of Hurricane Floyd. The all-time monthly rainfall record is in August 1955, due to the passage of Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane. The wettest year on record was 1996, when of precipitation fell. On the flip side, the driest month on record was October 1963, when only of rain was recorded. The of precipitation recorded in 1957 were the lowest ever for the city.\nSnowfall can vary even more year to year. The average seasonal (November\u2013April) snowfall total is , but has ranged from as low as in the winter of 1918\u20131919 to as high as in 1995\u20131996, which included the greatest single-storm snowfall, the Blizzard of January 7\u20138, 1996, when of snow fell. The average snowiest month is February which corresponds with the annual peak in nor'easter activity.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nHispanic or Latino population.\nThe Hispanic or Latino population in Trenton has grown significantly over the past few decades and now represents a substantial portion of the city's residents. According to the 2020 U.S. census, 45.01% of Trenton's population identified as Hispanic or Latino, up from 33.71% in 2010, 21.53% in 2000, and 14.13% in 1990. This demographic shift reflects a broader trend of increasing diversity in the city. The largest Hispanic or Latino ancestry group in Trenton is Guatemalan, accounting for 14.66% of the total Trenton population, followed by Puerto Rican (10.09%), Dominican (4.80%), and other Hispanic groups including Mexican, Honduran, and Ecuadorian communities. This growing population has had a notable cultural, social, and economic impact on the city, contributing to its identity. In recent years, for example, the annual festival celebrating Guatemala's independence on September 15 has attracted crowds in the thousands.\n2010 census.\nThe 2010 United States census counted 84,913 people, 28,578 households, and 17,747 families in the city. The population density was . There were 33,035 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup was 26.56% (22,549) White, 52.01% (44,160) Black or African American, 0.70% (598) Native American, 1.19% (1,013) Asian, 0.13% (110) Pacific Islander, 15.31% (13,003) from other races, and 4.10% (3,480) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 33.71% (28,621) of the population.\nOf the 28,578 households, 32.0% had children under the age of 18; 25.1% were married couples living together; 28.1% had a female householder with no husband present and 37.9% were non-families. Of all households, 30.8% were made up of individuals and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.79 and the average family size was 3.40.\n25.1% of the population were under the age of 18, 11.0% from 18 to 24, 32.5% from 25 to 44, 22.6% from 45 to 64, and 8.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.6 years. For every 100 females, the population had 106.5 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and older there were 107.2 males.\nThe Census Bureau's 2006\u20132010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income was $36,601 (with a margin of error of +/\u2212 $1,485) and the median family income was $41,491 (+/\u2212 $2,778). Males had a median income of $29,884 (+/\u2212 $1,715) versus $31,319 (+/\u2212 $2,398) for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,400 (+/\u2212 $571). About 22.4% of families and 24.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 36.3% of those under age 18 and 17.5% of those age 65 or over.\nEconomy.\nTrenton was a major manufacturing center in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One relic of that era is the slogan \"Trenton Makes, The World Takes\", which is displayed on the Lower Free Bridge (just north of the Trenton\u2013Morrisville Toll Bridge). The city adopted the slogan in 1917 to represent Trenton's then-leading role as a major manufacturing center for rubber, wire rope, ceramics and cigars. It was home to American Standard's largest plumbing fixture manufacturing facility.\nAlong with many other United States cities in the 1970s, Trenton fell on hard times when manufacturing and industrial jobs declined. Concurrently, state government agencies began leasing office space in the surrounding suburbs. State government leaders (particularly governors William Cahill and Brendan Byrne) attempted to revitalize the downtown area by making it the center of state government. Between 1982 and 1992, more than a dozen office buildings were constructed primarily by the state to house state offices. Today, Trenton's biggest employer is still the state of New Jersey. Each weekday, 20,000 state workers commute into the city from the surrounding suburbs.\nNotable businesses of the thousands based in Trenton include Italian Peoples Bakery, a wholesale and retail bakery established in 1936. De Lorenzo's Tomato Pies and Papa's Tomato Pies were also fixtures of the city for many years, though both recently relocated to the suburbs.\nUrban Enterprise Zone.\nPortions of Trenton are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. The city was selected in 1983 as one of the initial group of 10 zones chosen to participate in the program. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half of the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;6+5\u20448% rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants. Established in January 1986, the city's Urban Enterprise Zone status expires in December 2023.\nThe UEZ program in Trenton and four other original UEZ cities had been allowed to lapse as of January 1, 2017, after Governor Chris Christie, who called the program an \"abject failure\", vetoed a compromise bill that would have extended the status for two years. In May 2018, Governor Phil Murphy signed a law that reinstated the program in these five cities and extended the expiration date in other zones.\nIn 2018, the city had an average property tax bill of $3,274, the lowest in the county, compared to an average bill of $8,292 in Mercer County and $8,767 statewide. The city had the sixth-highest property tax rate in New Jersey, with an equalized rate of 5.264% in 2020, compared to 2.760% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.\nSports.\nBecause of Trenton's nearly equal distance between New York City and Philadelphia, two of the nation's largest cities, and because most homes in Mercer County receive network broadcasts from both cities, locals are sharply divided in fan loyalty between both cities. It is common to find fans of the Philadelphia Phillies, Eagles, 76ers, Union, and/or Flyers cheering (and arguing) alongside fans of the New York Yankees, Mets, Nets, Knicks, Rangers, Islanders, Jets, Red Bulls, Giants, and/or the New Jersey Devils.\nBetween 1948 and 1979, Trenton Speedway, located in adjacent Hamilton Township, hosted world class auto racing. Drivers such as Jim Clark, A. J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Al Unser, Bobby Unser, Richard Petty and Bobby Allison raced on the asphalt oval and then reconfigured race track. The speedway, which closed in 1980, was part of the larger New Jersey State Fairgrounds complex, which also closed in 1983. The former site of the speedway and fairgrounds is now the Grounds for Sculpture.\nThe Trenton Thunder, a minor league team owned by Joe Plumeri, plays at 6,341-seat Arm &amp; Hammer Park, the stadium which Plumeri had previously named after his father in 1999. The team was previously affiliated with the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, and, before moving to Trenton, the Chicago White Sox, but became an unaffiliated collegiate summer baseball team of the MLB Draft League beginning in 2021.\nThe Trenton Freedom of the Professional Indoor Football League were founded in 2013 and played their games at the Sun National Bank Center. The Freedom ended operations in 2015, joining the short-lived Trenton Steel (in 2011) and Trenton Lightning (in 2001) as indoor football teams that had brief operating lives at the arena.\nGovernment.\nLocal government.\nTrenton is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government, one of 79 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a seven-member city council. Three city council members are elected at-large, and four come from each of four wards. The mayor and council members are elected concurrently on a non-partisan basis to four-year terms of office as part of the November general election.\nIn April 1887, \"The New York Times\" identified alderman-elect Alexander Weber as the first person of color to hold public office in the city of Trenton.\nIn October 2020, the city council overrode a mayoral veto and shifted municipal elections from May to November, with proponents citing the increased turnout and savings to the city of $180,000 in each election cycle. The mayor and members of council all had their term-end dates extended by six months and moved to December 31 from June 30, 2022. The city retained a provision that would have a December runoff in the event that the candidate with the most votes does not obtain a majority.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], the mayor of Trenton is Reed Gusciora, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the city council are Jasi Edwards (at-large), Crystal Feliciano (at-large), Teska Frisby (West Ward), Yazminelly Gonzalez (at-large), Joseph A. Harrison (East Ward), Jenna Figueroa Kettenburg (South Ward) and Jennifer Williams (North Ward).\nAs they had not exceeded the minimum of 50 percent in the November 2022 general election, a runoff was held in December for the seats in the North and South Wards. Jennifer Williams won the North seat by a single vote against Algernon Ward, which made Williams the first transgender individual to be elected to a city council position in New Jersey history as well as being the first LGBTQ+ city council member in Trenton history. Jenna Figueroa Kettenburg won the South ward seat, defeating Damian G. Malave who had been ahead on Election Day but short of the cutoff, while a January 2023 runoff had Jasi Edwards, Crystal Feliciano and Yazminelly Gonzalez winning the three at-large seats.\nIn February 2023, Judge William Anklowitz of the New Jersey Superior Court heard a case for election challenges in the North Ward runoff election for both candidates Algernon Ward and Jennifer Williams. Three of the ballots Ward contested were all rejected because they were mail-in ballots that were returned without the required inner envelope. The other rejection Ward challenged was a case involving a cure letter that a voter sent to the wrong place, leading to it being not counted. Williams contested one ballot that was not counted due to it having both a vote for Ward and for Williams. Judge Anklowitz determined that the slash through Ward's vote signaled the voter's intention to vote for Williams and thus determined the vote should have been counted. These election challenges were heard following a recount that was held that did not change the outcome of the vote. Jennifer Williams thus remained to hold her seat on Trenton City Council for the North Ward seat.\nMayor's conviction and removal from office.\nOn February 7, 2014, Tony F. Mack and his brother, Raphiel, were convicted by a federal jury of bribery, fraud and extortion, based on the details of their participation in a scheme to take money in exchange for helping get approvals to develop a downtown parking garage as part of a sting operation by law enforcement. Days after the conviction, the office of the New Jersey Attorney General filed motions to have Mack removed from office, as state law requires the removal of elected officials after convictions for corruption. Initially, Mack fought the removal of him from the office but on February 26, a superior court judge ordered his removal and any actions taken by Mack between February 7 and February 26 could have been reversed by Muschal. Previously, Mack's housing director quit after it was learned he had a theft conviction. His chief of staff was arrested trying to buy heroin. His half-brother, whose authority he elevated at the city water plant, was arrested on charges of stealing. His law director resigned after arguing with Mack over complying with open-records laws and potential violations of laws prohibiting city contracts to big campaign donors.\nFrom February 7 to July 1, 2014, the acting mayor was George Muschal who retroactively assumed the office on that date due to Mack's felony conviction, who had taken office on July 1, 2010. Muschal, who was council president, was selected by the city council to serve as the interim mayor to finish the term.\nFederal, state, and county representation.\nTrenton is located in the 12th Congressional District and is part of New Jersey's 15th state legislative district.\nFor the 119th United States Congress, New Jersey congressional district is represented by Bonnie Watson Coleman (D, Ewing Township). New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2027) and Andy Kim (Moorestown, term ends 2031).\nFor the 2024-2025 session, the 15th legislative district of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by Shirley Turner (D, Lawrence Township) and in the General Assembly by Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (D, Trenton) and Anthony Verrelli (D, Hopewell Township).\nMercer County is governed by a County Executive who oversees the day-to-day operations of the county and by a seven-member Board of County Commissioners that acts in a legislative capacity, setting policy. All officials are chosen at-large in partisan elections, with the executive serving a four-year term of office while the commissioners serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats up for election each year as part of the November general election. As of 2025[ [update]], the County Executive is Daniel R. Benson (D, Hamilton Township) whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Mercer County's Commissioners are: \nLucylle R. S. Walter (D, Ewing Township, 2026),\nChair John A. Cimino (D, Hamilton Township, 2026), \nSamuel T. Frisby Sr. (D, Trenton, 2027), \nCathleen M. Lewis (D, Lawrence Township, 2025), \nVice Chair Kristin L. McLaughlin (D, Hopewell Township, 2027), \nNina D. Melker (D, Hamilton Township, 2025) and \nTerrance Stokes (D, Ewing Township, 2027). \nMercer County's constitutional officers are: \nClerk Paula Sollami-Covello (D, Lawrence Township, 2025), \nSheriff John A. Kemler (D, Hamilton Township, 2026) and \nSurrogate Diane Gerofsky (D, Lawrence Township, 2026).\nPolitics.\nAs of March 2011, there were a total of 37,407 registered voters in Trenton, of which 16,819 (45.0%) were registered as Democrats, 1,328 (3.6%) were registered as Republicans and 19,248 (51.5%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There were 12 voters registered to other parties.\nIn the 2012 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 93.4% of the vote (23,125 cast), ahead of Republican Mitt Romney with 6.2% (1,528 votes), and other candidates with 0.4% (97 votes), among the 27,831 ballots cast by the city's 40,362 registered voters (3,081 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 69.0%. In the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 89.9% of the vote here (23,577 cast), ahead of Republican John McCain with 8.2% (2,157 votes) and other candidates with 0.5% (141 votes), among the 26,229 ballots cast by the city's 41,005 registered voters, for a turnout of 64.0%. The 2004, 2020, and 2024 presidential elections were the only elections where the Republican nominee obtained over 10.0% of the vote since at least 2004. Since at least the same year, George W. Bush in 2004 presidential election and Donald Trump in 2024 presidential election were the only Republicans to receive over 15.0% of the vote in Trenton.\nIn the 2013 gubernatorial election, Democrat Barbara Buono received 74.7% of the vote (9,179 cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 24.7% (3,035 votes), and other candidates with 0.6% (77 votes), among the 11,884 ballots cast by the city's 38,452 registered voters (407 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 30.9%. In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Democrat Jon Corzine received 81.6% of the vote here (10,235 ballots cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 12.4% (1,560 votes), Independent Chris Daggett with 2.4% (305 votes) and other candidates with 1.1% (135 votes), among the 12,537 ballots cast by the city's 38,345 registered voters, yielding a 32.7% turnout."}
{"id": "57845", "revid": "18130370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57845", "title": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "text": "Capital city of North Carolina, U.S.\nRaleigh ( ) is the capital city of the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is the second-most populous city in the state (after Charlotte), tenth most populous city in the Southeast, the largest city in the Research Triangle area, and the 39th-most populous city in the U.S. Known as the \"City of Oaks\" for its oak-lined streets, Raleigh covers and had a population of 467,665 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Wake County and is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who founded the lost Roanoke Colony.\nRaleigh is home to North Carolina State University and is part of the Research Triangle, which includes Durham (home to Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill (home to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The Research Triangle area, centered around Research Triangle Park, has a population of over 2.37 million people. The Raleigh\u2013Cary metropolitan statistical area alone has an estimated population of 1.51 million. Raleigh lies primarily in Wake County, with a small portion of the city extending into Durham County. Nearby suburbs include Apex, Cary, Clayton, Fuquay-Varina, Garner, Holly Springs, Knightdale, Morrisville, Rolesville, Wake Forest, Wendell, and Zebulon.\nRaleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city. Following the American Revolutionary War when the U.S. gained independence, the area was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol at the center, in Union Square. During the American Civil War, the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period, related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the Reconstruction Era. The establishment of the Research Triangle Park in 1959 helped create thousands of jobs in the fields of science and technology.\nHistory.\nEarlier capitals.\nBath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, New Bern, was established in 1743.\n18th century.\nIn December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties, and was named for Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury.\nNew Bern, a port town on the Neuse River from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as the capital. From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was Fayetteville.\nRaleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital. The city was incorporated on December 31, 1792, and a charter granted January 21, 1795. The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the \"lost colony\" on Roanoke Island.\nNo known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia. The city was developed on the land of various plantations including Crabtree, Mordecai, Oak View, Pine Hall, Pullen, Spring Hill, and Wakefield.\nThe North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners and an \"Intendant of Police\" (which developed as the office of Mayor) to govern it. After 1803, city commissioners were elected. In 1799, the \"N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser\" was the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.\n19th century.\nIn 1808, Andrew Johnson, the United States' future 17th President, was born at Casso's Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer fire company was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\nIn 1817, the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the North Carolina State House. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried gneiss being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completion of the new State Capitol and new Raleigh &amp; Gaston Railroad Company in 1840.\nIn 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union during the American Civil War on May 20, 1861. After the war began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. Near the end of the Civil War, Governor Vance arranged his evacuation to avoid capture as Union General William Sherman's forces approached the city. Before leaving, Vance met with former governors Graham and Swain to draft a letter of surrender for Raleigh. Their intention was to protect Raleigh from the destruction inflicted on other cities by Union troops. Graham and Swain departed to meet the advancing Federal forces on the morning of April 12, 1865, and were to return by that evening. The evening struck, but Graham and Swain had not returned due to train delays and their temporary capture by Sherman. Governor Vance left the evening after Graham and Sherman failed to return, leaving behind a letter giving Mayor William H. Harrison the authority to surrender. On the morning of April 13, Mayor Harrison among others went to the southern Wake County area to meet General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick and propose surrender. Kenneth Rayner, a long-time resident of Raleigh, delivered the proposal including a promise of no resistance. Kilpatrick agreed to accept the surrender and protect Raleigh from destruction. Kilpatrick's cavalry occupied Raleigh and removed the flagpole from the state capitol, replacing it with a United States Flag above the dome. Sherman arrived shortly after and established his headquarters in the governor's mansion. The city was spared significant destruction during the war. As Confederate cavalry retreated west, Union soldiers followed, leading to the Battle of Morrisville nearby.\nDue to the economic and social problems of the postwar period and Reconstruction, with a state economy still heavily dependent on agriculture, the city grew little over the next several decades.\nShaw University, the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of Black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans.\nIn 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the United States' first school for blind and deaf Black people, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the Federal Building in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the Southern U.S. following the Civil War.\nIn 1880, the newspapers \"News\" and \"Observer\" combined to form \"The News &amp; Observer\". It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.\nIn the late nineteenth century, two Black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for Black citizens and to challenge efforts by White Democrats to reduce Black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and his allies were unsuccessful. Based on a White supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most Black citizens and many poor White citizens. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified Black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising Black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.\nIt was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of Black citizens in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n20th century.\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating.\nFrom 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleighites.\nIn 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\nIn 1923, the Raleigh Fall Festival was formed. The Festival was reorganized as the North Carolina Debutante Ball in 1927.\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI. The Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop.\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.\nDuring the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park.

The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments. Another of Raleigh's oldest Black neighborhoods, Fourth Ward, was demolished starting in 1971, with about 600 homes and 60 businesses south of downtown gone as a result of urban renewal, and 1,600 people forced to move. It was claimed housing was substandard and the area had a lot of crime.\nBy the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and urban sprawl. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman Clarence Lightner defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first Black mayor, and thus the first Black mayor in a major White-majority city in the South.\nIn 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, in an attempt to ease traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.\nThe first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977.

The Raleigh tornado produced over $77\u00a0million in damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in Nash County) and 154 injuries. The damage path from the storm was measured at long, and wide at times. The tornado was rated F4.\nIn 1991, two large skyscrapers in Raleigh were completed, First Union Capitol Center and Two Hannover Square, along with the popular Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek in Southeast Raleigh.\nIn 1996, the Olympic Flame passed through Raleigh while on its way to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Also in 1996, Hurricane Fran struck the area, causing massive flooding and extensive structural damage. In addition, WRAL-TV became the first High-Definition broadcast station in the world.\nIn 1997, the National Hockey League's Hartford Whalers announced their intention to move to Raleigh as the Carolina Hurricanes, becoming the city's first major league professional sports franchise.\nIn 1999, the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later renamed the RBC Center and now called Lenovo Center), opened to provide a home for the Hurricanes and the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team, as well as an up-to-date major concert venue.\n21st century.\nIn 2001, the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium complex was expanded with the addition of the Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts, Meymandi Concert Hall, Fletcher Opera Theater, Kennedy Theatre, Betty Ray McCain Gallery and Lichtin Plaza.\nFayetteville Street reopened to vehicular traffic in 2006. A variety of downtown building projects began around this time including the 34-story RBC Bank Tower, multiple condominium projects and several new restaurants. Additional skyscrapers are in the proposal/planning phase.\nIn 2006, the city's NHL franchise, the Carolina Hurricanes, won the Stanley Cup, North Carolina's first professional sports championship. The NC Courage would go on to win the National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) in 2018 and 2019.\nWith the opening of parts of I-540 from 2005 to 2007, a new loop around Wake County, traffic congestion eased somewhat in the North Raleigh area. Completion of the entire loop is expected to take another 15 years.\nIn 2008, the city's Fayetteville Street Historic District joined the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn September 2010, Raleigh hosted the inaugural Hopscotch Music Festival.\nIn January 2011, Raleigh hosted the National Hockey League All-Star Game.\nIn April 2011, a devastating EF-3 tornado hit Raleigh, and many other tornadoes touched down in the state (ultimately the largest, but not the strongest outbreak to ever hit the state), killing 24 people.

The Neuse River flows through the northeastern corner of the city.\nRaleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic coastal plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain.\nThe city of Raleigh is located southeast of Durham; northeast of Fayetteville; northwest of Wilmington; and southwest of Richmond, Virginia; and northeast of Charlotte. A small portion of Raleigh is located in Durham County, North Carolina.\nCityscape.\nRaleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a ZIP code that begins with the digits 276. PNC Plaza, formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of , with a floor count of 34.\nInside the Beltline.\nOne common division of Raleigh is to differentiate the central part of the city, which lies inside of the circumferential highway known as the Raleigh Beltline (I-440 and I-40) from areas outside of the Beltline. The area inside of the beltline includes the entirety of the central business district known as Downtown Raleigh, as well as several more residential areas surrounding it.\nThe downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel built in the early 20th century, the restored City Market, the Fayetteville Street downtown business district (which includes the PNC Plaza and Wells Fargo Capitol Center buildings), as well as the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, North Carolina State Capitol, William Peace University, the City of Raleigh Museum, Raleigh Convention Center, Shaw University, Campbell University School of Law, and St. Augustine's College. In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: Fayetteville Street, Moore Square, Glenwood South, Warehouse, and Capital District. The nearby Blount Street Historic District includes many of the city's historic Victorian, Georgian Revival, Queen Anne, and Second Empire mansions, including Norris-Heartt House, Andrews-Duncan House, Heck-Andrews House, Bailey-Tucker House, Capehart House, Bailey-Bunn House, and the Garland Scott and Toler Moore Tucker House (the latter was later moved from its original location to Oakwood).\nSome of the names have become commonplace among locals, such as the Warehouse District, Fayetteville Street, and Glenwood South. Other neighborhoods lying inside the Beltline include Forest Park, Boylan Heights, Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, Glenwood-Brooklyn, Hayes Barton Historic District, Moore Square, Mordecai (home to the historic Mordecai House), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and Historic Oakwood. These neighborhoods were typically built before World War II, and roughly correspond to the extent of the city of Raleigh before the population boom of the latter half of the 20th century led to growth of the city limits beyond the historic urban core.\nMidtown Raleigh.\nMidtown Raleigh is a relatively new term used to describe the residential and commercial area lying on the northside of the I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Six Forks Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as North Hills and Crabtree Valley Mall. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. \"The\" \"News &amp; Observer\" newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only. The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011, as a way for community leaders to promote the area. The center of the area, especially around the North Hills development at the junction of Six Forks Road and the Beltline, is experiencing rapid urbanization as several high-rise buildings have been built since 2010.\nEast Raleigh.\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from Capital Boulevard and the eastern side of I-440 beltline to the Neuse River, and extending as far south as Poole Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as U.S. 1 (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road.

This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the Swift Creek watershed district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by Cary, to the east by Garner, to the southwest by Holly Springs and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke and Enchanted Oaks.\nSoutheast Raleigh.\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, Garner on the southwest, and rural Wake County to the southeast.

Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of . There are 48\u00a0days per year with highs at or above . Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two-day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316.

Freezing rain and sleet also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0\u2013 the Winter Storm of January 2000. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air damming that affects the city due to its proximity to the Appalachian Mountains. Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience hurricanes. In 1996, Hurricane Fran caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was Hurricane Florence in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988, tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated F4 on the Fujita scale and affected northwestern portions of the city.

It is the state's second-most populous city, after Fargo. The population was 73,622 at the 2020 census, and was estimated at 77,772 in 2024, while its metropolitan population was 133,626. In 2014, \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Bismarck as the seventh fastest-growing small city in the United States.\nBismarck was founded by European-Americans in 1872 on the east bank of the Missouri River. It has been North Dakota's capital city since 1889, when the state was created from the Dakota Territory and admitted to the Union.\nBismarck is across the river from Mandan, named after a Native American tribe of the area. The two cities comprise the core of the Bismarck metropolitan area.\nThe North Dakota State Capitol is in central Bismarck. The state government employs more than 4,600 in the city. As a hub of retail and health care, Bismarck is the economic center of south-central North Dakota and north-central South Dakota.\nHistory.\nFor thousands of years, various indigenous peoples inhabited present-day central North Dakota. The historic Mandan Native American tribe occupied the area long before Europeans arrived. The Hidatsa name for Bismarck is \"mirahacii arumaaguash\" (\"Place of the tall willows\"); the Arikara name is \"ituhta\u00e1we [itUhta\u00e1we].\"\nIn 1872, European Americans founded a settlement at what was then called Missouri Crossing, so named because the Lewis and Clark Expedition crossed the river there on their exploration of the land acquired by the Louisiana Purchase in 1804\u201306. It had been an area of Mandan settlement. Later, the new town was called Edwinton, after Edwin Ferry Johnson, engineer-in-chief for the Northern Pacific Railway. Its construction of railroads in the territory attracted workers and settlers.\nIn 1873, the Northern Pacific Railway renamed the city Bismarck in honor of German chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Railroad officials hoped to attract German settlers to the area and German investment in the railroad. It is the only U.S. state capital named for a foreign statesman. The discovery of gold in the nearby Black Hills of South Dakota the following year was a great impetus for growth. Thousands of miners came to the area, encroaching on what the Lakota considered sacred territory, leading to heightened tensions with Native Americans.\nBismarck became a freight-shipping center on the \"Custer Route\" from the Black Hills. In 1879, the first recorded tornado in North Dakota history smashed a steamship into the Missouri River's bank near Bismarck, causing major damage.\nIn 1883, Bismarck was designated as the capital of the Dakota Territory in place of Yankton, South Dakota, and in 1889, as the state capital of the new state of North Dakota.\nGeography.\nBismarck is located at (46.8142737, -100.7694052).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and (1.36%) is water.\nCityscape.\nThe city has developed around downtown Bismarck, the center of historic development. It is distinctive because the city's major shopping center, Kirkwood Mall, is in the city center rather than in the suburbs. Several other major retail stores are near Kirkwood Mall, which was developed near the Bismarck Event Center. The two Bismarck hospitals, CHI St. Alexius Medical Center and Sanford Health (previously Medcenter One Health Systems), are downtown. The streets are lined with small stores and restaurants.\nMuch recent commercial and residential growth has occurred in the city's northern section, largely because of expanding retail centers. Among the shopping centers in northern Bismarck are Gateway Fashion Mall, Northbrook Mall, Arrowhead Plaza, and the Pinehurst Square \"power center\" mall.\nThe North Dakota State Capitol complex is just north of downtown Bismarck. The 19-story Art Deco capitol is the tallest building in the state, at a height of . Completed during the Great Depression in 1934, it replaced the original capitol building that burned to the ground in 1930. The capitol grounds encompass the North Dakota Heritage Center, the North Dakota State Library, the North Dakota Governor's Residence, the State Office Building, and the Liberty Memorial Building. The North Dakota State Penitentiary is in eastern Bismarck.\nThe Cathedral District, named after the Art Deco Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, is a historic neighborhood near downtown Bismarck. Some homes in this neighborhood date to the 1880s, although many were built in the first decades of the 20th century. At times, the city has proposed widening the streets in the neighborhood to improve traffic flow. Many residents object because such a project would require the removal of many of the towering American elms which line the streets. These have escaped the elm disease that destroyed street canopies of trees in eastern cities.\nAfter the completion of the Garrison Dam in 1953 by the Army Corps of Engineers, which improved flood control, the floodplain of the Missouri River became a more practical place for development. Significant residential and commercial building has occurred in this area on the city's south side. The Upper Missouri River is still subject to seasonal flooding.\nClimate.\nSituated in the middle of the Great Plains, between the geographic centers of the United States and Canada, Bismarck displays a highly variable four-season humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfa/Dfb\", Trewartha \"Dcac/Dcbc\") bordering on a cold semi arid climate. Bismarck's climate is characterized by cold, somewhat dry, snowy, and windy winters and warm, humid summers. Thunderstorms occur in spring and summer, but much of the rest of the year is dry.\nThe warmest month in Bismarck is July, with a daily mean of , with typically wide variations between day and night.

The city was founded during the Land Run of 1889 and grew to a population of over 10,000 within hours of its founding. It was the site of the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, in which 168 people died.\nSince weather records have been kept beginning in 1890, Oklahoma City has been struck by 13 violent tornadoes, 11 of which were rated F4 or EF4 on the Fujita and Enhanced Fujita scales, and two which were rated F5 or EF5.\nHistory.\nOklahoma City was settled on April 22, 1889, when the area known as the \"Unassigned Lands\" was opened for settlement in an event known as \"The Land Run\". On April 26 of that year, its first mayor was elected, William Couch. Some 10,000 homesteaders settled in the area that would become the capital of Oklahoma. The town grew quickly; the population doubled between 1890 and 1900. Early leaders of the development of the city included Anton H. Classen, John Wilford Shartel, Henry Overholser, Oscar Ameringer, Jack C. Walton, Angelo C. Scott, and James W. Maney.\nBy the time Oklahoma was admitted to the Union in 1907, Oklahoma City had surpassed Guthrie, the territorial capital, as the new state's population center and commercial hub. Soon after, the capital was moved from Guthrie to Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City was a significant stop on U.S. Route\u00a066 during the early part of the 20th century; it was prominently mentioned in Bobby Troup's 1946 jazz song \"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\" made famous by artist Nat King Cole.\nBefore World War II, Oklahoma City developed significant stockyards, attracting jobs and revenue formerly in Chicago and Omaha, Nebraska. With the 1928 discovery of oil within the city limits (including under the State Capitol), Oklahoma City became a major center of oil production. Post-war growth accompanied the construction of the Interstate Highway System, which made Oklahoma City a major interchange as the convergence of I-35, I-40, and I-44. It was also aided by the federal development of Tinker Air Force Base after successful lobbying efforts by the director of the Chamber of Commerce Stanley Draper.\nIn 1950, the Census Bureau reported the city's population as 8.6% black and 90.7% white.\nIn 1959, the city government launched a \"Great Annexation Drive\" that expanded the city's area from by the end of 1961, making it the largest U.S. city by land mass at the time.\nPatience Latting was elected Mayor of Oklahoma City in 1971, becoming the city's first female mayor. Latting was also the first woman to serve as mayor of a U.S. city with over 350,000 residents.\nLike many other American cities, the center city population declined in the 1970s and 1980s as families followed newly constructed highways to move to newer housing in nearby suburbs. Urban renewal projects in the 1970s, including the Pei Plan, removed older structures but failed to spark much new development, leaving the city dotted with vacant lots used for parking. A notable exception was the city's construction of the Myriad Gardens and Crystal Bridge, a botanical garden and modernistic conservatory in the heart of downtown. Architecturally significant historic buildings lost to clearances were the Criterion Theater, the Baum Building, the Hales Building, and the Biltmore Hotel.\nIn 1993, the city passed a massive redevelopment package known as the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS), intended to rebuild the city's core with civic projects to establish more activities and life in downtown. The city added a new baseball park; a central library; renovations to the civic center, convention center, and fairgrounds; and a water canal in the Bricktown entertainment district. Water taxis transport passengers within the district, adding color and activity along the canal. MAPS has become one of the most successful public-private partnerships undertaken in the U.S., exceeding $3\u00a0billion in private investment as of 2010. As a result of MAPS, the population in downtown housing has exponentially increased, with the demand for additional residential and retail amenities, such as groceries, services, and shops.\nSince the completion of the MAPS projects, the downtown area has seen continued development. Several downtown buildings are undergoing renovation/restoration. Notable among these was the restoration of the Skirvin Hotel in 2007. The famed First National Center is also being renovated.\nResidents of Oklahoma City suffered substantial losses on April 19, 1995, when Timothy McVeigh detonated a bomb in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The building was destroyed (the remnants of which had to be imploded in a controlled demolition later that year), more than 100 nearby buildings suffered severe damage, and 168 people were killed, making it the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history. The site of the Murrah Building has been commemorated as the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum. Since its opening in 2000, over three million people have visited.\nThe \"Core-to-Shore\" project was created to relocate I-40 one mile (1.6\u00a0km) south and replace it with a boulevard to create a landscaped entrance to the city. This also allows the central portion of the city to expand south and connect with the shore of the Oklahoma River. Several elements of \"Core to Shore\" were included in the MAPS 3 proposal approved by voters in late 2009.\nIn 2012, Devon Energy completed the construction of their new skyscraper, the Devon Energy Center, which immediately became the tallest building in Oklahoma City as well as the state of Oklahoma at 844 feet (257.25m). Culturally, the \u201cDevon Tower\u201d, as it is called by locals, has been considered the centerpiece of the city\u2019s skyline. Mayor Mick Cornett attended the building\u2019s opening ceremony and stated, \"The visual impact it has on the city is so striking and so identifiable. It took just over three years to complete the building that has quickly become a staple in our city's skyline.\"\nOklahoma City is set to become the home of the Legends Tower, which when complete would be the tallest building in the United States and amongst the tallest buildings in the world.\nGeography.\nOklahoma City lies along one of the primary corridors into Texas and Mexico and is a three-hour drive from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. The city is in the Frontier Country region in the state's center, making it ideal for state government.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city has annexed 480 net acres under the leadership of Mayor David Holt.\nOklahoma City lies in the Sandstone Hills region of Oklahoma, known for hills of and two species of oak: blackjack oak (\"Quercus marilandica\") and post oak (\"Q. stellata\"). The northeastern part of the city and its eastern suburbs fall into an ecological region known as the Cross Timbers.\nThe city is roughly bisected by the North Canadian River (recently renamed the Oklahoma River inside city limits). The North Canadian once had sufficient flow to flood every year, wreaking destruction on surrounding areas, including the central business district and the original Oklahoma City Zoo. In the 1940s, a dam was built on the river to manage the flood control and reduce its level. In the 1990s, as part of the citywide revitalization project known as MAPS, the city built a series of low-water dams, returning water to the portion of the river flowing near downtown. The city has three large lakes: Lake Hefner and Lake Overholser, in the northwestern quarter of the city; and the largest, Lake Stanley Draper, in the city's sparsely populated far southeast portion.\nThe population density typically reported for Oklahoma City using the area of its city limits can be misleading. Its urbanized zone covers roughly resulting in a 2013 estimated density of , compared with larger rural watershed areas incorporated by the city, which cover the remaining of the city limits.\nOklahoma City is one of the largest cities in the nation in compliance with the Clean Air Act.\nNeighborhoods.\nOklahoma City neighborhoods are highly varied, with affluent historic neighborhoods located next to districts that have not wholly recovered from the economic and social decline of the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe city is bisected geographically and culturally by the North Canadian River, which divides North Oklahoma City and South Oklahoma City. The north side is characterized by diverse and fashionable urban neighborhoods near the city center and sprawling suburbs further north. South Oklahoma City is generally more blue-collar working class and significantly more industrial, having grown up around the Stockyards and meat packing plants at the turn of the century. It is also the center of the city's rapidly growing Latino community.\nDowntown Oklahoma City, which has 7,600 residents, is seeing an influx of new private investment and large-scale public works projects, which have helped to revitalize a central business district left almost deserted by the Oil Bust of the early 1980s. The centerpiece of downtown is the newly renovated Crystal Bridge and Myriad Botanical Gardens, one of the few elements of the Pei Plan to be completed. In 2021, a massive new central park will link the gardens near the CBD and the new convention center to be built just south of it to the North Canadian River as part of a massive works project known as \"Core to Shore\"; the new park is part of MAPS3, a collection of civic projects funded by a one-cent temporary (seven-year) sales tax increase.\nClimate.\nOklahoma City has a temperate humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfa\", Trewartha: \"Cfak\"), along with significant continental influences. The city features hot, humid summers and cool winters. Prolonged and severe droughts (sometimes leading to wildfires in the vicinity) and hefty rainfall leading to flash flooding and flooding occur regularly. Consistent winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Severe ice storms and snowstorms happen sporadically during the winter.\nThe average temperature is , with the monthly daily average ranging from in January to in July. Extremes range from on February 12, 1899 to on August 11, 1936, and August 3, 2012; The last sub-zero (Fahrenheit) reading was on February 16, 2021. Temperatures reach on 10.4 days of the year, on nearly 70 days, and fail to rise above freezing on 8.3 days. The city receives about of precipitation annually, of which is snow.\nThe report \"Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment\" (NCA) from 2013 by NOAA projects that parts of the Great Plains region can expect up to 30% (high emissions scenario based on CMIP3 and NARCCAP models) increase in extreme precipitation days by mid-century. This definition is based on days receiving more than one inch of rainfall.\nExtreme weather.\nOklahoma City has an active severe weather season from March through June, especially during April and May. Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to widespread and severe tornadoes, as well as severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes occur every month of the year, and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially in October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been struck by 13 violent tornadoes, eleven rated F/EF4 and two rated F/EF5.\nOn May 3, 1999, parts of Oklahoma City and surrounding communities were impacted by a tornado. It was the last U.S. tornado to be given a rating of F5 on the Fujita scale before the Enhanced Fujita scale replaced it in 2007. While the tornado was in the vicinity of Bridge Creek to the southwest, wind speeds of were estimated by a mobile Doppler radar, the highest wind speeds ever recorded on Earth. A second top-of-the-scale tornado occurred on May 20, 2013; South Oklahoma City, along with Newcastle and Moore, was hit by an EF5 tornado. The tornado was wide and killed 23 people. On May 31, less than two weeks after the May 20 event, another outbreak affected the Oklahoma City area. Within Oklahoma City, the system spawned an EF1 and an EF0 tornado, and in El Reno to the west, an EF3 tornado occurred. This lattermost tornado, which was heading in the direction of Oklahoma City before it dissipated, had a width of , making it the widest tornado ever recorded. Additionally, winds over were measured, one of the two highest wind records for a tornado.\nWith of rainfall, May 2015 was Oklahoma City's record-wettest month since record-keeping began in 1890. Across Oklahoma and Texas generally, there was a record flooding in the latter part of the month.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the 2010 census, there were 579,999 people, 230,233 households, and 144,120 families in the city.

For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.7 males.\nOklahoma City has experienced significant population increases since the late 1990s. It is the first city in the state to record a population greater than 600,000 residents and the first city in the Great Plains region to record a population greater than 600,000 residents. It is the largest municipal population of the Great Plains region (Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota).\nIn the 2020 United States census, there were 268,035 households in the city, out of which 81,374 households (30.4%) were individuals, 113,161 (42.2%) were opposite-sex married couples, 17,699 (6.6%) were unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 2,930 (1.1%) were same-sex married couples or partnerships.\nRace and ethnicity.\nAccording to the 2020 census, the racial composition of Oklahoma City was as follows: White or European American 49.5%, Hispanic or Latino 21.3%, Black or African American 13.8%, Asian 4.6%, Native American 2.8%, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander 0.2%, other race 0.4%, and two or more races (non-Hispanic) 7.6%.

An estimated 8,904 residents practiced Islam during this study.\nCrime.\nLaw enforcement claims Oklahoma City has traditionally been the territory of the notorious Ju\u00e1rez Cartel, but the Sinaloa Cartel has been reported as trying to establish a foothold in Oklahoma City. There are many rival gangs in Oklahoma City, one whose headquarters has been established in the city, the Southside Locos, traditionally known as Sure\u00f1os.\nOklahoma City also has its share of violent crimes, particularly in the 1970s. The worst occurred in 1978 when six employees of a Sirloin Stockade restaurant on the city's south side were murdered execution-style in the restaurant's freezer. An intensive investigation followed, and the three individuals involved, who also killed three others in Purcell, Oklahoma, were identified. One, Harold Stafford, died in a motorcycle accident in Tulsa not long after the restaurant murders. Another, Verna Stafford, was sentenced to life without parole after being granted a new trial after she had been sentenced to death. Roger Dale Stafford, considered the mastermind of the murder spree, was executed by lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in 1995.\nThe Oklahoma City Police Department has a uniformed force of 1,169 officers and 300+ civilian employees. The department has a central police station and five substations covering 2,500 police reporting districts that average 1/4 square mile in size.\nOn April 19, 1995, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed by a fertilizer bomb manufactured and detonated by Timothy McVeigh. The blast and catastrophic collapse killed 168 people and injured over 680. The blast shock-wave destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a 340-meter radius, destroyed or burned 86 cars, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, causing at least an estimated $652 million of damage. McVeigh was convicted and subsequently executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Oklahoma City, once just a regional power center of government and energy exploration, has since diversified to include the sectors of information technology, services, health services, and administration. The city is headquarters to two Fortune 500 companies: Expand Energy and Devon Energy, as well as being home to Love's Travel Stops &amp; Country Stores, which is ranked thirteenth on Forbes' list of private companies.\nAs of March 2024, the top 20 employers in the city were:\nOther major corporations with a significant presence (over 1,000 employees) in the city of Oklahoma City include the United Parcel Service, Farmers Insurance Group, Southwest Beverages Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Deaconess Hospital, Johnson Controls, MidFirst Bank, Rose State College, and Continental Resources.\nWhile not in the city limits, other large employers within the Oklahoma City MSA include United States Air Force \u2013 Tinker AFB (27,000); University of Oklahoma (11,900); University of Central Oklahoma (2,900); and Norman Regional Hospital (2,800).\nAccording to the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce, the metropolitan area's economic output grew by 33% between 2001 and 2005 due chiefly to economic diversification.

By 2016 the GMP had grown to $73.8\u00a0billion.\nIn 2008, \"Forbes\" magazine reported that the city had falling unemployment, one of the strongest housing markets in the country and solid growth in energy, agriculture, and manufacturing. However, during the early 1980s, Oklahoma City had one of the worst job and housing markets due to the bankruptcy of Penn Square Bank in 1982 and then the post-1985 crash in oil prices (oil bust).\nTourism.\nApproximately 23.2 million visitors contributed $4.3 billion to Oklahoma City's economy. These visitors directly spent $2.6 billion, sustained nearly 34,000 jobs, and generated $343 million in state and local taxes.\nBusiness districts.\nBusiness and entertainment districts (and, to a lesser extent, local neighborhoods) tend to maintain their boundaries and character by applying zoning regulations and business improvement districts (districts where property owners agree to a property tax surcharge to support additional services for the community). Through zoning regulations, historic districts, and other special zoning districts, including overlay districts, are well established. Oklahoma City has three business improvement districts, including one encompassing the central business district.\nCulture.\nMuseums and theaters.\nThe Donald W.

There are multiple golf courses and country clubs spread around the city.\nHigh school football.\nThe state of Oklahoma hosts a highly competitive high school football culture, with many teams in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. The Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association organizes high school football into eight distinct classes based on school enrollment size. Beginning with the largest, the classes are 6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A, A, B, and C. Class 6A is broken into two divisions.

The Hornets played their final home game in Oklahoma City during the exhibition season on October 9, 2007, against the Houston Rockets.\n2028 Olympics.\nVenues in Oklahoma City will host two events during the 2028 Summer Olympics, which will primarily be held in Los Angeles. The LA Olympic Organizing Committee opted to have canoe slalom and softball in Oklahoma City, given the lack of acceptable venues for those sports in Los Angeles. Riversport OKC will host the canoe slalom competition, while Devon Park will host the softball competition. Oklahoma City is located approximately 1,300 miles away from Los Angeles.\nParks and recreation.\nOklahoma City has more than 170 parks that cover 6,256 acres, and 100 miles of trails.\nOne of the more prominent landmarks of downtown Oklahoma City is the Crystal Bridge tropical conservatory at the Myriad Botanical Gardens, a large downtown urban park. Designed by I. M. Pei, the park also includes the Water Stage amphitheater, a bandshell, and lawn, a sunken pond complete with koi, an interactive children's garden complete with a carousel and water sculpture, various trails and interactive exhibits that rotate throughout the year including the ice skating in the Christmas winter season. In 2007, following a renovation of the stage, \"Oklahoma Shakespeare In The Park\" relocated to the Myriad Gardens. Bicentennial Park, also downtown located near the Oklahoma City Civic Center campus, is home to the annual \"Festival of the Arts\" in April.\nThe Scissortail Park is just south of the Myriad Gardens, a large interactive park that opened in 2021. This park contains a large lake with paddleboats, a dog park, a concert stage with a great lawn, a promenade including the Skydance Bridge, a children's interactive splash park and playground, and numerous athletic facilities. Farmers Market is a common attraction at Scissortail Park during the season, and there are multiple film showings, food trucks, concerts, festivals, and civic gatherings.\nReturning to the city's first parks masterplan, Oklahoma City has at least one major park in each quadrant outside downtown. Will Rogers Park, the Grand Boulevard loop once connected Lincoln Park, Trosper Park, and Woodson Park, some sections of which no longer exist. Martin Park Nature Center is a natural habitat in far northwest Oklahoma City. Will Rogers Park is home to the \"Lycan Conservatory\", the Rose Garden, and the Butterfly Garden, all built in the WPA era. In April 2005, the \"Oklahoma City Skate Park\" at Wiley Post Park was renamed the \"Mat Hoffman Action Sports Park\" to recognize Mat Hoffman, an Oklahoma City area resident and businessman who was instrumental in the design of the skate park and is a 10-time BMX World Vert champion.\nWalking trails line the Bricktown Canal and the Oklahoma River in downtown. The city's bike trail system follows around Lake Hefner and Lake Overholser in the northwest and west quadrants of the city. The majority of the east shore area of Lake Hefner is taken up by parks and bike trails, including a new leashless dog park and the postwar-era \"Stars and Stripes Park\", and eateries near the lighthouse. Lake Stanley Draper, in southeast Oklahoma City, is the city's largest and most remote lake, offering a genuine rural yet still urban experience.\nThe Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden is home to numerous natural habitats, WPA era architecture and landscaping, and major touring concerts during the summer at its amphitheater. Nearby is a combination racetrack and casino, Remington Park, which hosts both Quarter Horse (March \u2013 June) and Thoroughbred (August\u2014December) seasons.\nOklahoma City is also home to the American Banjo Museum, which houses a large collection of highly decorated banjos from the early 20th century and exhibits the banjo's history and its place in American history. Concerts and lectures are also held there.\nGovernment.\nThe City of Oklahoma City has operated under a council-manager form of city government since 1927. David Holt assumed the office of Mayor on April 10, 2018, after being elected two months earlier. Eight councilpersons represent each of the eight wards of Oklahoma City. The City Council appointed current City Manager Craig Freeman on November 20, 2018. Freeman took office on January 2, 2018, succeeding James D. Couch, who had served in the role since 2000. Before becoming City Manager, Craig Freeman served as Finance Director for the city.\nPolitics.\nSimilar to many American cities, Oklahoma City is politically conservative in its suburbs and liberal in the central city. In the United States House of Representatives, it is represented by Republicans Stephanie Bice, Tom Cole, and Frank Lucas of the 5th, 4th, and 3rd districts, respectively. The city has called on residents to vote for sales tax-based projects to revitalize parts of the city. The Bricktown district is the best example of such an initiative. In the recent MAPS 3 vote, the city's fraternal police order criticized the project proposals for not doing enough to expand the police presence to keep up with the growing residential population and increased commercial activity. In September 2013, Oklahoma City area attorney David Slane announced he would pursue legal action regarding MAPS3 on claims the multiple projects that made up the plan violate a state constitutional law limiting voter ballot issues to a single subject.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nOklahoma City's sister cities are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEducation.\nHigher education.\nThe city is home to several colleges and universities. Oklahoma City University, formerly known as Epworth University, was founded by the United Methodist Church on September 1, 1904, and is known for its performing arts, science, mass communications, business, law, and athletic programs. OCU has its main campus in the north-central section of the city, near the city's Asia District area. OCU Law is in the old Central High School building in the Midtown district near downtown.\nThe University of Oklahoma has several institutions of higher learning in the city and metropolitan area, with OU Medicine and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center campuses east of downtown in the Oklahoma Health Center district, and the main campus to the south in the suburb of Norman. OU Medical Center hosts the state's only Level-One trauma center. OU Health Sciences Center is one of the nation's largest independent medical centers, employing over 12,000 people. OU is one of only four major universities in the nation to operate six medical schools.\nThe third-largest university in the state, the University of Central Oklahoma, is just north of the city in the suburb of Edmond. Oklahoma Christian University, one of the state's private liberal arts institutions, is just south of the Edmond border, inside the Oklahoma City limits.\nOklahoma City Community College in south Oklahoma City is the second-largest community college in the state. Rose State College is east of Oklahoma City in suburban Midwest City. Oklahoma State University\u2013Oklahoma City is in the \"Furniture District\" on the Westside. Northeast of the city is Langston University, the state's historically black college (HBCU). Langston also has an urban campus in the eastside section of the city. Southern Nazarene University, which was founded by the Church of the Nazarene, is a university in suburban Bethany, which is surrounded by the Oklahoma City city limits.\nAlthough technically not a university, the FAA's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center has many aspects of an institution of higher learning. Its FAA Academy is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Its Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) has a medical education division responsible for aeromedical education in general, as well as the education of aviation medical examiners in the U.S. and 93 other countries. In addition, The National Academy of Science offers Research Associateship Programs for fellowship and other grants for CAMI research.\nPrimary and secondary.\nOklahoma City is home to (as of 2009) the state's largest school district, Oklahoma City Public Schools, which covers the most significant portion of the city. The district's Classen School of Advanced Studies and Harding Charter Preparatory High School rank high among public schools nationally according to a formula that looks at the number of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate or Cambridge tests taken by the school's students divided by the number of graduating seniors. In addition, OKCPS's Belle Isle Enterprise Middle School was named the top middle school in the state according to the Academic Performance Index and recently received the Blue Ribbon School Award, in 2004 and again in 2011.\nDue to Oklahoma City's explosive growth, parts of several suburban districts spill into the city. All but one of the school districts in Oklahoma County includes portions of Oklahoma City. The other districts in that county covering OKC include: Choctaw/Nicoma Park, Crooked Oak, Crutcho, Deer Creek, Edmond, Harrah, Jones, Luther, McLoud, Mid-Del, Millwood, Moore, Mustang, Oakdale, Piedmont, Putnam City, and Western Heights. School districts in Cleveland County covering portions of Oklahoma City include: Little Axe, McLoud, Mid-Del, Moore, and Robin Hill. Within Canadian County, Banner, Mustang, Piedmont, Union City, and Yukon school districts include parts of OKC.\nThere are also charter schools. KIPP Reach College Preparatory School in Oklahoma City received the 2012 National Blue Ribbon, and its school leader, Tracy McDaniel Sr., was awarded the Terrel H. Bell Award for Outstanding Leadership.\nThe city also boasts several private and parochial schools. Casady School and Heritage Hall School are both examples of a private college preparatory school with rigorous academics that range among the top in Oklahoma. Providence Hall is a Protestant school. Two prominent schools of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City include Bishop McGuinness High School and Mount Saint Mary High School. Other private schools include the Advanced Science and Technology Education Center and Crossings Christian School.\nThe Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, a school for some of the state's most gifted math and science pupils, is also in Oklahoma City.\nCareerTech.\nOklahoma City has several public career and technology education schools associated with the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education, the largest of which are Metro Technology Center and Francis Tuttle Technology Center.\nPrivate career and technology education schools in Oklahoma City include Oklahoma Technology Institute, Platt College, Vatterott College, and Heritage College. The Dale Rogers Training Center is a nonprofit vocational training center for individuals with disabilities.\nMedia.\nPrint.\n\"The Oklahoman\" is Oklahoma City's major daily newspaper and is the most widely circulated in the state. NewsOK.com is the Oklahoman's online presence. \"Oklahoma Gazette\" is Oklahoma City's independent newsweekly, featuring such staples as local commentary, feature stories, restaurant reviews, movie listings, and music and entertainment. \"The Journal Record\" is the city's daily business newspaper, and \"okcBIZ\" is a monthly publication that covers business news affecting those who live and work in Central Oklahoma.\nNumerous community and international newspapers cater to the city's ethnic mosaic, such as \"The Black Chronicle\", headquartered in the Eastside, the OK VIETIMES and \"Oklahoma Chinese Times\", in Asia District, and various Hispanic community publications. \"The Campus\" is the student newspaper at Oklahoma City University. Gay publications include \"The Gayly Oklahoman\".\nAn upscale lifestyle publication called \"405 Magazine\" (formerly Slice Magazine) is circulated throughout the metropolitan area. In addition, there is a magazine published by \"Back40 Design Group\" called \"The Edmond Outlook\". It contains local commentary and human interest pieces directly mailed to over 50,000 Edmond residents.\n\"Ready Player One\" is set in Oklahoma City in the year 2045.\nBroadcast.\nOklahoma City was home to several pioneers in radio and television broadcasting. Oklahoma City's WKY Radio was the first radio station transmitting west of the Mississippi River and the third radio station in the United States. WKY received its federal license in 1921 and has continually broadcast under the same call letters since 1922. In 1928, WKY was purchased by E.K. Gaylord's Oklahoma Publishing Company and affiliated with the NBC Red Network; in 1949, WKY-TV (channel 4) went on the air and later became the first independently owned television station in the U.S. to broadcast in color. In mid-2002, WKY radio was purchased outright by Citadel Broadcasting, who was bought out by Cumulus Broadcasting in 2011. The Gaylord family earlier sold WKY-TV in 1976, which has gone through a succession of owners (what is now KFOR-TV is owned by Nexstar Media Group as of October 2019).\nThe major U.S. broadcast television networks have affiliates in the Oklahoma City market (ranked 41st for television by Nielsen and 48th for radio by Arbitron, covering a 34-county area serving the central, north-central and west-central sections of Oklahoma); including NBC affiliate KFOR-TV (channel 4), ABC affiliate KOCO-TV (channel 5), CBS affiliate KWTV-DT (channel 9, the flagship of locally based Griffin Media), PBS station KETA-TV (channel 13, the flagship of the state-run OETA member network), Fox affiliate KOKH-TV (channel 25), independent station KOCB (channel 34), CW owned-and-operated station KAUT-TV (channel 43), MyNetworkTV affiliate KSBI-TV (channel 52), and Ion Television affiliate KOPX-TV (channel 62). The market is also home to several religious stations, including TBN owned-and-operated station KTBO-TV (channel 14) and Norman-based Daystar owned-and-operated station KOCM (channel 46).\nDespite the market's geographical size, none of the English-language commercial affiliates in the Oklahoma City designated market area operate full-power satellite stations covering the far northwestern part of the state (requiring cable or satellite to view them). However, KFOR-TV, KOCO-TV, KWTV-DT, and KOKH-TV each operate low-power translators in that portion of the market. Oklahoma City is one of the few markets between Chicago and Dallas to have affiliates of two or more of the significant Spanish-language broadcast networks: Telemundo affiliate KTUZ-TV (channel 30), Woodward-based Univision/UniM\u00e1s affiliate KUOK 35 (whose translator KUOK-CD, channel 36, serves the immediate Oklahoma City area), and Estrella TV affiliate KOCY-LD (channel 48). (Locally based Tyler Media Group, which owns the three stations above, also owns eight radio stations in the market, including Regional Mexican-formatted KTUZ-FM (106.7) and news\u2013talk outlet KOKC (1520 AM).)\nInfrastructure.\nFire department.\nOklahoma City is protected by the Oklahoma City Fire Department (OKCFD), which employs 1015 paid, professional firefighters. The current Chief of Department is Richard Kelley, and the department is commanded by three Deputy Chiefs, who \u2013 along with the department chief \u2013 oversee the Operational Services, Prevention Services, and Support Services bureaus. The OKCFD operates out of 37 fire stations throughout the city in six battalions. The OKCFD operates a fire apparatus fleet of 36 engine companies (including 30 paramedic engines), 13 ladder companies, 16 brush pumper units, six water tankers, two hazardous materials units, one Technical Rescue Unit, one Air Supply Unit, six Arson Investigation Units, and one Rehabilitation Unit along with several special units. Each engine Company is staffed with a driver, an officer, and one to two firefighters, while each ladder company is staffed with a driver, an officer, and one firefighter. The minimum staffing for each shift is 213 personnel. The Oklahoma City Fire Department responds to over 70,000 emergency calls annually.\nTransportation.\nHighways.\nOklahoma City is an integral point on the United States Interstate Network, with three major interstate highways \u2013 Interstate 35, Interstate 40, and Interstate 44 \u2013 bisecting the city. Interstate 240 connects Interstate 40 and Interstate 44 in south Oklahoma City. At the same time, Interstate 235 spurs from Interstate 44 in north-central Oklahoma City into downtown. Interstate 44, between NW 23rd and NW 36th Streets, is the busiest roadway in the city and state, with an average daily traffic count of 167,200 vehicles per day in 2018.\nMajor state expressways through the city include Lake Hefner Parkway (SH-74), the Kilpatrick Turnpike, Airport Road (SH-152), and Broadway Extension (US-77) which continues from I-235 connecting Central Oklahoma City to Edmond. Lake Hefner Parkway runs through northwest Oklahoma City, while Airport Road runs through southwest Oklahoma City and leads to Will Rogers World Airport. The Kilpatrick Turnpike loops around north and west Oklahoma City.\nOklahoma City also has several major national and state highways within its city limits. Shields Boulevard (US-77) continues from E.K. Gaylord Boulevard in downtown Oklahoma City and runs south, eventually connecting to I-35 near the suburb of Moore, Oklahoma. Northwest Expressway (Oklahoma State Highway 3) runs from North Classen Boulevard in north-central Oklahoma City to the northwestern suburbs.\nThe following significant expressways traverse Oklahoma City:\nAir.\nOklahoma City is served by two primary airports, Will Rogers World Airport and the much smaller Wiley Post Airport (incidentally, the two honorees died in the same plane crash in Alaska) Will Rogers World Airport is the state's busiest commercial airport, with 4,341,159 passengers served in 2018, a historical record.\nTinker Air Force Base, in southeast Oklahoma City, is the largest military air depot in the nation. It is a major maintenance and deployment facility for the Navy and the Air Force and the second largest military institution in the state (after Fort Sill in Lawton).\nRail and intercity bus.\nAmtrak has a station downtown at the Santa Fe Depot, with daily service to Fort Worth and the nation's rail network via the Heartland Flyer. Oklahoma City once was the crossroads of several interstate passenger railroads at the Santa Fe Depot, the Union Station, and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad station. But service at that level has long since been discontinued. However, several proposals to extend the current train service have been made, including a plan to expand the Heartland Flyer to Newton, Kansas, which is currently being connected through Amtrak Thruway. Freight service is provided by BNSF Railway, Union Pacific Railroad, and Stillwater Central.\nGreyhound and several other intercity bus companies serve Oklahoma City at the Oklahoma City Bus Station east of downtown.\nPublic transit.\nEmbark (formerly Metro Transit) is the city's public transit company. The primary transfer terminal is downtown at NW 5th Street and Hudson Avenue. Embark maintains limited coverage of the city's primary street grid using a hub-and-spoke system from the main terminal, making many journeys impractical due to the relatively small number of bus routes offered and that most trips require a transfer downtown. The city has recognized transit as a significant issue for the rapidly growing and urbanizing city. It has initiated several recent studies to improve the existing bus system, starting with a plan known as the Fixed Guideway Study. This study identified several potential commuter transit routes from the suburbs into downtown Oklahoma City as well as feeder-line bus and rail routes throughout the city.\nThough Oklahoma City has no light rail or commuter rail service, city residents identified improved transit as one of their top priorities. From the fruits of the Fixed Guideway and other studies, city leaders strongly desire to incorporate urban rail transit into the region's future transportation plans. The greater Oklahoma City metropolitan transit plan identified from the Fixed Guideway Study includes a streetcar system in the downtown area, to be fed by enhanced city bus service and commuter rail from the suburbs including Edmond, Norman, and Midwest City. There is a significant push for a commuter rail line connecting downtown OKC with the eastern suburbs of Del City, Midwest City, and Tinker Air Force Base. In addition to commuter rail, a short heritage rail line that would run from Bricktown just a few blocks away from the Amtrak station to the Adventure District in northeast Oklahoma City is under reconstruction.\nIn December 2009, Oklahoma City voters passed MAPS 3, the $777\u00a0million (7-year, 1-cent tax) initiative. This initiative would generate funding (approx. $130\u00a0million) for the modern Oklahoma City Streetcar system in downtown Oklahoma City and the establishment of a transit hub.\nOn September 10, 2013, the federal government announced that Oklahoma City would receive a $13.8-million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation's TIGER program. This was the first-ever grant for Oklahoma City for a rail-based initiative and is thought to be a turning point for city leaders who have applied for grants in the past, only to be denied continuously. It is believed the city will use the TIGER grant along with approximately $10\u00a0 million from the MAPS 3 Transit budget to revitalize the city's Amtrak station, becoming an Intermodal Transportation Hub, taking over the role of the existing transit hub at NW 5th/Hudson Avenue.\nConstruction of the Oklahoma City Streetcar system in Downtown OKC began in early 2017, and the system opened for service in December 2018. Also known as the Maps 3 Streetcar, it connects the areas of Bricktown, Midtown and Downtown. The system serves the greater Downtown area using modern low-floor streetcars. The initial system consists of two lines connecting Oklahoma City's Central Business District with the entertainment district, Bricktown, and the Midtown District. Expansion to other districts surrounding downtown and more routes in the CBD is already underway.\nWalkability.\nA 2013 study by Walk Score ranked Oklahoma City the 43rd most walkable out of the 50 largest U.S. cities. Oklahoma City has 18 neighborhoods with a Walk Score above 60, mainly close to the downtown core.\nHealth.\nOklahoma City and the surrounding metropolitan area have several healthcare facilities and specialty hospitals. In Oklahoma City's MidTown district near downtown resides the state's oldest and largest single-site hospital, St. Anthony Hospital and Physicians Medical Center.\nOU Medicine, an academic medical institution on the campus of The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, is home to OU Medical Center. OU Medicine operates Oklahoma's only level-one trauma center at the OU Medical Center and the state's only level-one trauma center for children at Children's Hospital at OU Medicine, both of which are in the Oklahoma Health Center district. Other medical facilities operated by OU Medicine include OU Physicians and OU Children's Physicians, the OU College of Medicine, the Oklahoma Cancer Center, and OU Medical Center Edmond, the latter in the northern suburb of Edmond.\nINTEGRIS Health owns several hospitals, including INTEGRIS Baptist Medical Center, the INTEGRIS Cancer Institute of Oklahoma, and the INTEGRIS Southwest Medical Center. INTEGRIS Health operates hospitals, rehabilitation centers, physician clinics, mental health facilities, independent living centers, and home health agencies throughout much of Oklahoma. INTEGRIS Baptist Medical Center ranks high-performing in the following categories: Cardiology and Heart Surgery; Diabetes and Endocrinology; Ear, Nose and Throat; Gastroenterology; Geriatrics; Nephrology; Orthopedics; Pulmonology and Urology.\nThe Midwest Regional Medical Center is in the suburb of Midwest City; other significant hospitals include the Oklahoma Heart Hospital and the Mercy Health Center. There are 347 physicians for every 100,000 people in the city.\nIn the American College of Sports Medicine's annual ranking of the United States' 50 most populous metropolitan areas on the basis of community health, Oklahoma City took last place in 2010, falling five spots from its 2009 rank of 45. The ACSM's report, published as part of its American Fitness Index program, cited, among other things, the poor diet of residents, low levels of physical fitness, higher incidences of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than the national average, low access to recreational facilities like swimming pools and baseball diamonds, the paucity of parks and low investment by the city in their development, the high percentage of households below the poverty level, and the lack of state-mandated physical education curriculum as contributing factors.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57849", "revid": "51012040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57849", "title": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania", "text": "Capital city of Pennsylvania, United States\nHarrisburg ( ; ) is the capital city of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It is the ninth-most populous city in the state, with a population of 50,099 as of the 2020 census, while the Harrisburg\u2013Carlisle metropolitan statistical area has an estimated 615,000 residents and is the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the state. Harrisburg is situated on the east bank of the Susquehanna River southwest of Allentown and northwest of Philadelphia. It is officially incorporated as a third-class city and is the county seat of Dauphin County.\nHarrisburg played a role in American history during the Westward Migration, the American Civil War, and the Industrial Revolution. During part of the 19th century, the building of the Pennsylvania Canal and later the Pennsylvania Railroad allowed Harrisburg to develop into one of the most industrialized cities in the Northeastern United States. In the mid- to late 20th century, the city's economic fortunes fluctuated with its major industries consisting of government, heavy manufacturing, agriculture, and food services. These economic fluctuations contributed to Harrisburg experiencing a decline of nearly half its population between 1950 and 2000. However, the region is seen as financially stable in part due to the high concentration of state and federal government agencies.\nThe Pennsylvania Farm Show, the largest indoor agriculture exposition in the U.S., was first held in Harrisburg in 1917 and has been held there annually in early to mid\u2013January since. The city also hosts the annual Great American Outdoor Show, the largest of its kind in the world, among many other events. Harrisburg experienced the Three Mile Island accident on March 28, 1979, in nearby Middletown.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nHarrisburg's site along the Susquehanna River is thought to have been inhabited by Native Americans as early as 3000 BC. Known to the Native Americans as \"Peixtin\", or \"Paxtang\", the area was an important resting place and crossroads for Native American traders with trails leading from the Delaware to the Ohio rivers and from the Potomac to the Upper Susquehanna intersecting there.\n17th century.\nThe first European contact with Native Americans in Pennsylvania was made by Englishman Captain John Smith, who journeyed from Virginia up the Susquehanna River in 1608 and visited with the Susquehanna tribe.\n18th century.\nIn 1719, John Harris, Sr., an English trader, settled here and 14 years later secured grants of in this vicinity. In 1785, John Harris, Jr. made plans to lay out a town on his father's land, which he named Harrisburg. In the spring of 1785, the town was formally surveyed by William Maclay, who was a son-in-law of John Harris, Sr. In 1791, Harrisburg became incorporated, and in October 1812 it was named the Pennsylvania state capital, which it has remained ever since. The assembling here of the highly sectional Harrisburg Convention in 1827 (signaling what may have been the birth of lobbying on a national scale) led to the passage of the high protective-tariff bill of 1828.\nIn 1839, William Henry Harrison and John Tyler were nominated for president and Vice President of the United States at the first national convention of the Whig Party of the United States, which was held in Harrisburg.\n19th century.\nBefore Harrisburg gained its first industries, it was a scenic, pastoral town: compact and surrounded by farmland. In 1822, the impressive brick capitol was completed for $200,000 (~$ in 2024).\nHarrisburg's strategic location gave it an advantage over many other towns; it was settled as a trading post in 1719 at a location important to westward expansion, past the Blue Mountain range. The Susquehanna River flowed generally west to east at this location, providing a route for boat traffic from the east. The head of navigation was a short distance northwest of the town, where the river flowed through the pass. Persons arriving from the east by boat had to exit at Harrisburg and prepare for an overland journey westward through the mountain pass. Harrisburg assumed importance as a provisioning stop at this point where westward bound pioneers transitioned from river travel to overland travel. It was partly because of its strategic location that the state legislature selected the small town of Harrisburg to become the state capital in 1812.\nThe grandeur of the Colonial Revival capitol dominated the quaint town. The streets were dirt, but orderly and platted in grid pattern. The Pennsylvania Canal was built in 1834 and coursed the length of the town. The residential houses were situated on only a few city blocks stretching southward from the capitol. They were mostly one story. No factories were present but there were blacksmith shops and other businesses. The ownership of land concentrated in the hands of a small number of wealthy families: five people held one-third of private land in 1850.\nDuring the first part of the 19th century, Harrisburg was a notable stopping place along the Underground Railroad, as persons escaping slavery used the Susquehanna River to access food and supplies before heading north towards Canada.\nDuring the American Civil War, Harrisburg became a significant training center for the Union army, with tens of thousands of troops passing through Camp Curtin, which had been established on 18 April 1861 and was named in tribute to Pennsylvania's Civil War-era governor, Andrew Gregg Curtin.\nHarrisburg functioned as a major rail center for the Union and a vital link between the Atlantic coast and the Midwest, with several railroads running through the city and spanning the Susquehanna River. As a result of this importance, the city was targeted by General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia during the army's two invasions. First, during the 1862 Maryland Campaign, when Lee planned to capture the city after taking Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, but was prevented from doing so by the Battle of Antietam and his subsequent retreat back into Virginia. The second attempt was made during the Gettysburg campaign in 1863 and was more substantial. Under orders from Gen. Robert E. Lee directly, Confederate Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps were tasked with capturing Harrisburg and disrupting the vital Union supply and rail lines. However, Ewell's forces were intercepted by the forces of the Department of the Susquehanna under the command of Union Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch in a series of skirmishes surrounding the city, such as the Skirmish of Sporting Hill in Camp Hill, just west of Harrisburg. The Second Corp were ultimately unsuccessful in both overcoming the local Union defenses and crossing the rain bloated Susquehanna into Harrisburg itself, and were forced to retreat southward to regroup with Lee's main Confederate force. This attempt marked the northernmost advance of the Confederate Army during the Civil War.\nOn July 3, 1863, the artillery barrage that marked the beginning of Pickett's Charge of the Battle of Gettysburg was heard from Harrisburg, almost 40 miles away.\nHarrisburg's importance in the latter half of the 19th century was in the steel industry. It was an important railroad center as well. Steel and iron became dominant industries. Steel and other industries continued to play a major role in the local economy throughout the latter part of the 19th century. The city was the center of enormous railroad traffic and its steel industry supported large furnaces, rolling mills, and machine shops. The Pennsylvania Steel Company plant, which opened in nearby Steelton in 1866, was the first in the country; later operated by Bethlehem Steel.\nIts first large scale iron foundries were put into operation shortly after 1850.\nAs industries nationwide entered a phase of great expansion and technological improvement, so did industries\u00a0\u2013 and in particular the steel industry\u00a0\u2013 in Harrisburg. This can be attributed to a combination of factors that were typical of what existed in other successful industrial cities: rapid rail expansion; nearby markets for goods; and nearby sources for raw product.\nWith Harrisburg poised for growth in steel production, Steelton became the ideal location for this type of industry. It was a wide swath of flat land located south of the city, with rail and canal access running its entire 4 mile length. There was plenty of room for houses and its own downtown section. Steelton was a company town, opened in 1866 by the Pennsylvania Steel Company. Highly innovative in its steel making process, it became the first mill in the United States to make steel railroad rails by contract. In its prime, Steelton was home to more than 16,000 residents from 33 different ethnic groups. All were employed in the steel industry, or had employment in services that supported it. In the late 19th century, no less than five major steel mills and foundries were located in Steelton. Each contained a maze of buildings; conveyances for moving the products; large yards for laying down equipment; and facilities for loading their product on trains. Stacks from these factories constantly belched smoke. With housing and a small downtown area within walking distance, these were the sights and smells that most Steelton residents saw every day.\nThe rail yard was another area of Harrisburg that saw rapid and thorough change during the years of industrialization. This was a wide expanse of about two dozen railroad tracks that grew from the single track of the early 1850s. By the late 19th century, this area was the width of about two city blocks and formed what amounted to a barrier along the eastern edge of the city: passable only by bridge. Three large and ornately embellished passenger depots were built by as many rail lines. Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest rail line in Harrisburg. It built huge repair facilities and two large roundhouses in the 1860s and 1870s to handle its enormous freight and passenger traffic and to maintain its colossal infrastructure. Its rails ran the length of Harrisburg, along its eastern border. It had a succession of three passenger depots, each built on the site of the predecessor, and each of high style architecture, including a train shed to protect passengers from inclement weather. At its peak in 1904, it made 100 passenger stops per day. It extended west to Pittsburgh, across the entire state, and east to Philadelphia, serving Steelton along the route. The anthracite coal mines in the Allegheny Mountains were reached by the Northern Central Railroad. The Lebanon Valley Railroad extended east to Philadelphia with spurs to New York City. Another rail line was the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, which provided service to Philadelphia and other points east.\nAllison Hill, Harrisburg's first suburb, is located east of the city on a prominent bluff, accessed by bridges across a wide swath of train tracks. It was developed in the late 19th century and offered affluent Harrisburg residents the opportunity to live in the suburbs only a few hundred yards from their jobs in the city. As the city expanded, it incorporated Allison Hill in its boundaries. In 1886, a single horse trolley line was established from the city to Allison Hill. Easy access was later achieved via the State Street Bridge leading east from the Capitol complex and the Market Street Bridge leading from the city's prominent business district. Among the most desirable sections of Allison Hill at the time was Mount Pleasant, which was characterized by large Colonial Revival-style houses with yards for the very wealthy and smaller but still well-built row houses lining the main street for the moderately wealthy. State Street, leading from the Capitol directly toward Allison Hill, was planned to provide a grand view of the Capitol dome for those approaching the city from Allison Hill. This trend towards outlying residential areas began slowly in the late 19th century and was largely confined to the trolley line, but the growing prevalence of automobile ownership quickened the trend and spread out the population in the 20th century.\n20th century.\nIn the early 20th century, the city of Harrisburg was in need of change. Without proper sanitation, diseases such as typhoid began killing many citizens of Harrisburg. Seeing these necessary changes, several Harrisburg residents became involved in the City Beautiful movement. The project focused on providing better transportation, spaces for recreation, sanitation, landscaping, and parks for those living in cities, as research showed that a person with access to amenities would be a happier person. In December 1900, a reformer named Mira Lloyd Dock, who had recently encountered well-ordered urban centers on an international trip to Europe, gave a lecture on \"The City Beautiful\" to Harrisburg's Board of Trade. Other prominent citizens of the city such as J. Horace McFarland and Vance McCormick advocated urban improvements which were influenced by European urban planning design and the World's Columbian Exposition. Warren Manning was hired to help bring about these changes. Specifically, their efforts greatly enlarged the Harrisburg park system, creating Riverfront Park, Reservoir Park, the Italian Lake and Wildwood Park. In addition, plans were undertaken for new water filtration, burial of electric wires, the paving of roads, and the creation of a modern sanitary sewer system. The efforts to improve the city also paralleled the construction of an expanded monumental Capitol complex in 1906 which led, in turn, to the displacement of the Old Eighth Ward, one of the most ethnically and racially diverse communities in Harrisburg.\nThe decades between 1920 and 1970 were characterized by industrial decline and population shift from the city to the suburbs. Like most other cities which faced a loss of their industrial base, Harrisburg shifted to a service-oriented base, with industries such as health care and convention centers playing a big role. Harrisburg's greatest problem was a shrinking city population after 1950. This loss in population followed a national trend and was a delayed result of the decline of Harrisburg's steel industry. This decline began almost imperceptibly in the late 1880s, but did not become evident until the early 20th century.\nAfter being held in place for about 5 years by WWII armament production, the population peaked shortly after the war, but then took a long-overdue dive as people fled from the city. Hastening the white flight to the suburbs were the cheap and available houses being built away from the crime and deteriorating situation of the city. The reduction in city population coincided with the rise in population of the Metropolitan Statistical Area. The trend continued until the 1990s.\nThe Pennsylvania Farm Show, the largest indoor agriculture exposition in the United States, was first held in 1917 and has been held every January since then. The present location of the Show is the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex &amp; Expo Center, located at the corner of Maclay and Cameron streets.\nOn March 28, 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, along the Susquehanna River located in Londonderry Township which is south of Harrisburg, suffered a partial meltdown. Although the meltdown was contained and radiation leakages were minimal, there were still worries that an evacuation would be necessary. Governor Dick Thornburgh, on the advice of Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Joseph Hendrie, advised the evacuation \"of pregnant women and pre-school age children ... within a five-mile radius of the Three Mile Island facility.\" Within days, 140,000 people had left the area.\nStephen R. Reed was elected mayor in 1981 and served until 2009, making him the city's longest-serving mayor. In an effort to end the city's long period of economic troubles, he initiated several projects to attract new business and tourism to the city. Several museums and hotels such as Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts, the National Civil War Museum and the Hilton Harrisburg and Towers were built during his term, along with many office buildings and residential structures. Several minor league professional sports franchises, including the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League, the Harrisburg Heat indoor soccer club, and Penn FC of the United Soccer League began operations in the city during his tenure as mayor. While praised for the vast number of economic improvements, Reed has also been criticized for population loss and mounting debt. For example, during a budget crisis the city was forced to sell $8\u00a0million worth of Western and American-Indian artifacts collected by Mayor Reed for a never-realized museum celebrating the American West.\n21st century.\nDuring the nearly 30-year tenure of former Mayor Stephen Reed from 1981 to 2009, city officials ignored legal restraints on the use of bond proceeds, as Reed spent the money pursuing interests including collecting Civil War and Wild West memorabilia \u2013 some of which was found in Reed's home after his arrest on corruption charges. Infrastructure was left unrepaired, and the heart of the city's financial woes was a trash-to-electricity plant, the Harrisburg incinerator, which was supposed to generate income but instead, because of increased borrowing, incurred a debt of $320\u00a0million.\nMissing audits and convoluted transactions, including swap agreements, make it difficult to state how much debt the city owes. Some estimates put total debt over $1.5\u00a0billion, which would mean that every resident would owe $30,285. These numbers do not reflect the school system deficit, the school district's $437\u00a0million long-term debt, nor unfunded pension and healthcare obligations.\nHarrisburg was the first municipality ever in the history of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to be charged with securities fraud, for misleading statements about its financial health. The city agreed to a plea bargain to settle the case.\nIn October 2011, Harrisburg filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy when four members of the seven-member City Council voted to file a bankruptcy petition to prevent the Pennsylvania State Government from taking over the city's finances. Bankruptcy Judge Mary France dismissed the petition on the grounds that the City Council majority had filed it over the objection of Mayor Linda Thompson, reasoning that the filing not only required the mayor's approval but had circumvented state laws concerning financially distressed cities.\nInstead, a state-appointed receiver took charge of the city's finances. Governor Tom Corbett appointed bond attorney David Unkovic as the city's receiver, but Unkovic resigned after only four months. Unkovic blamed disdain for legal restraints on contracts and debt for creating Harrisburg's intractable financial problem and said the corrupt influence of creditors and political cronies prevented fixing it.\nAs creditors began to file lawsuits to seize and sell off city assets, a new receiver, William B. Lynch, was appointed. The City Council opposed the new receiver's plans for tax increases and advocated a stay of the creditor lawsuits with a bankruptcy filing, while Mayor Thompson continued to oppose bankruptcy. State legislators crafted a moratorium to prevent Harrisburg from declaring bankruptcy, and after the moratorium expired, the law stripped the city government of the authority to file for bankruptcy and conferred it on the state receiver.\nAfter two years of negotiations, in August 2013 Receiver Lynch revealed his comprehensive voluntary plan for resolving Harrisburg's fiscal problems. The complex plan called for creditors to write down or postpone some debt. To pay the remainder, Harrisburg sold the troubled incinerator, leased its parking garages for 40 years, and was to briefly go further into debt by issuing new bonds. Receiver Lynch had also called for setting up nonprofit investment corporations to oversee infrastructure improvement, repairing the city's crumbling roads and water and sewer lines, and pensions and economic development. These were intended to allow nonprofit fundraising and to reduce the likelihood of mismanagement by the city government.\nHarrisburg's City Council and the state Commonwealth Court approved the plan, and became implemented. The city balanced its budget in the late 2010s, was expected to have a surplus of $1\u00a0million in 2019, and maintained a surplus in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nHarrisburg is located at (40.269789, \u221276.875613) in South Central Pennsylvania, within a two-hour drive of the metro areas of Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and three-hour drive of New York City and Pittsburgh. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (29.11%) is water. Bodies of water include Paxton Creek, which empties into the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, as well as Wildwood Lake and Italian Lake parks. In land area Harrisburg (proper) is also the third smallest of the United States capital cities.\nDirectly to the north of Harrisburg is the Blue Mountain ridge of the Appalachian Mountains. The Cumberland Valley lies directly to the west of Harrisburg and the Susquehanna River, stretching into northern Maryland. The fertile Lebanon Valley lies to the east. Harrisburg is the northern fringe of the historic Pennsylvania Dutch Country.\nThe city is the county seat of Dauphin County. The adjacent counties are Northumberland County to the north; Schuylkill County to the northeast; Lebanon County to the east; Lancaster County to the south; and York County to the southwest; Cumberland County to the west; and Perry County to the northwest.\nAdjacent municipalities.\nHarrisburg's western boundary is formed by the west shore of the Susquehanna River, which runs within the city boundaries and serves as the boundary between Dauphin and Cumberland counties. Harrisburg is divided into numerous neighborhoods and districts. Like many of Pennsylvania's cities and boroughs that are at build-out stage, there are several townships outside of Harrisburg city limits that, although autonomous, use the name \"Harrisburg\" for postal and name-place designation. They include the townships of: Lower Paxton, Middle Paxton, Susquehanna, Swatara and West Hanover in Dauphin County. The borough of Penbrook, located just east of Reservoir Park, was previously known as East Harrisburg. Penbrook, along with the borough of Paxtang, also located just outside the city limits, maintain Harrisburg ZIP codes as well. The United States Postal Service designates 26 ZIP Codes for Harrisburg, including 13 for official use by federal and state government agencies.\nClimate.\nHarrisburg has a variable, four-season climate lying at the beginning of the transition between the humid subtropical and humid continental zones (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\" and \"Dfa\", respectively). The city limits fall within the \"Cfa\" Humid subtropical climate classification, while the suburban areas and rural surroundings fall just into the \"Dfa\" Humid continental climate classification. The hottest month of the year is July, with a daily mean temperature of . Summer is usually hot and humid and occasional heat waves can occur. The city averages around 32 days per year with + highs, although temperatures reaching are rare. Seven months average above and three months average above . The hottest temperature ever recorded in Harrisburg is on July 3, 1966. Summer thunderstorms also occur relatively frequently. Autumn is a pleasant season, when the humidity and temperatures fall to more comfortable values. The hardiness zone is 7a/7b.\nWinter in Harrisburg is mild to cool: January, the coolest month, remains above freezing, as it experiences a daily mean temperature of . A major snowstorm can also occasionally occur, and some winters snowfall totals can exceed , while in other winters, the region may receive very little snowfall. Snow that does fall often melts away quickly. The largest snowfall on a single calendar day was on January 23, 2016, recorded at Harrisburg International Airport in Middletown, while the snowiest month on record was February 2010, with , recorded at the same location. Overall, Harrisburg receives an average of of snow per winter. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Harrisburg was on January 21, 1994. Spring is also a pleasant time of year for outdoor activities. Precipitation is well-distributed and generous in most months, though July is clearly the wettest and February the driest.\nCityscape.\nNeighborhoods.\nDowntown Harrisburg, which includes the Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex, is the central core business and financial center for the Harrisburg\u2013Carlisle metropolitan statistical area and serves as the seat of government for Dauphin County and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. There are over a dozen large neighborhoods and historic districts within the city.\nArchitecture.\nHarrisburg's architecture spans over 200 years of evolving construction and design and thus contains a breadth of various architectural styles. Six Municipal Historic Districts, multiple National Historic Districts, and Architectural Conservation Overlay Districts have in turn have been established to preserve and guide any new development of areas with respect to their character.\nHarrisburg is home to the Pennsylvania State Capitol. Completed in 1906, the central dome rises to a height of and was modeled on that of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, Rome. The building was designed by Joseph Miller Huston and is adorned with sculpture, including \"Love and Labor, the Unbroken Law\" and \"The Burden of Life, the Broken Law\" by sculptor George Grey Barnard; murals by Violet Oakley and Edwin Austin Abbey; tile floor by Henry Mercer, which tells the story of the Pennsylvania. The state capitol is only the third-tallest building of Harrisburg. The five tallest buildings are 333 Market Street the tallest building outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh with a height of , Pennsylvania Place with a height of , the Pennsylvania State Capitol with a height of , Presbyterian Apartments with a height of and the Fulton Bank Building with a height of .\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe six largest ethnic groups in the city are: African American (52.4%), German (15.0%), Irish (6.5%), Italian (3.3%), English (2.4%), and Dutch (1.0%). While the metropolitan area is approximately 15% German-American, 11.4% are Irish-American and 9.6% English-American. Harrisburg has one of the largest Pennsylvania Dutch communities in the nation, and also has the nation's ninth-largest Swedish-American communities in the nation.\nThere were 20,561 households, out of which 28.5% had children under the age of 13 living with them, 23.4% were married couples living together, 24.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.9% were non-families. 39.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.32 and the average family size was 3.15.\nIn the city, the population was spread out, with 28.2% under the age of 18, 9.2% from 13 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 20.8% from 45 to 64, and 10.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 88.7 males. For every 100 females age 13 and over, there were 84.8 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $26,920, and the median income for a family was $29,556. Males had a median income of $90,670 versus $24,405 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,787. About 23.4% of families and 24.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 34.9% of those under age 13 and 16.6% of those age 65 or over. \nThe very first census taken in the United States occurred in 1790. At that time Harrisburg was a small, but substantial colonial town with a population of 875 residents. With the increase of the city's prominence as an industrial and transportation center, Harrisburg reached its peak population build up in 1950, topping out at nearly 90,000 residents. Since the 1950s, Harrisburg, along with other northeastern urban centers large and small, has experienced a declining population that is ultimately fueling the growth of its suburbs, although the decline\u00a0\u2013 which was very rapid in the 1960s and 1970s\u00a0\u2013 has slowed considerably since the 1980s. Unlike Western and Southern states, Pennsylvania maintains a complex system of municipalities and has very little legislation on either the annexation/expansion of cities or the consolidating of municipal entities.\nEconomy.\nHarrisburg is the metropolitan center for some 400 communities. Its economy and more than 45,000 businesses are diversified with a large representation of service-related industries, especially health-care and a growing technological and biotechnology industry to accompany the dominant government field inherent to being the state's capital. National and international firms with major operations include Ahold Delhaize, ArcelorMittal Steel, HP Inc., IBM, Hershey Foods, Harsco Corporation, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Rite Aid Corporation, Tyco Electronics, and Volvo Construction Equipment. The largest employers, the federal and state governments, provide stability to the economy. The region's extensive transportation infrastructure has allowed it to become a prominent center for trade, warehousing, and distribution.\nEmployers.\nTop 10.\nAccording to the Region Economic Development Corporation, the top employers in the region are:\nPeople and culture.\nCulture.\nIn the mid-20th century, Harrisburg was home to many nightclubs and other performance venues, including the Madrid Ballroom, the Coliseum, the Chestnut Street Hall. and the Hi-Hat. These venues featured performances from Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Fletcher Henderson, Andy Kirk, and other jazz greats. Segregationist policy forbade these musicians from staying overnight in downtown Harrisburg, however, making the Jackson Hotel in Harrisburg's 7th Ward a hub of black musicians prior to the 1960s.\nSeveral organizations support and develop visual arts in Harrisburg. The Art Association of Harrisburg was founded in 1926 and continues to provide education and exhibits throughout the year. Additionally, the Susquehanna Art Museum, founded in 1989, offers classes, exhibits and community events. A local urban sketching group, Harrisburg Sketchers, convenes artists monthly.\nDowntown Harrisburg has two major performance centers. The Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts, which was completed in 1999, is the first center of its type in the United States where education, science and the performing arts take place under one roof. The Forum, a 1,763-seat concert and lecture hall built in 1930\u201331, is a state-owned and operated facility located within the State Capitol Complex. Since 1931, The Forum has been home to the Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra. Other performance centers include The Capitol Room at House of Music, Arts &amp; Culture, Open Stage of Harrisburg, Harrisburg Improv Theatre, Gamut Theatre Group, Popcorn Hat Players Children's Theatre and Theatre Harrisburg.\nBeginning in 2001, downtown Harrisburg saw a resurgence of commercial nightlife development. This has been credited with reversing the city's financial decline, and has made downtown Harrisburg a destination for events from jazz festivals to Top-40 nightclubs.\nIn 2004, Harrisburg hosted CowParade, an international public art exhibit that has been featured in major cities all over the world. Fiberglass sculptures of cows are decorated by local artists, and distributed over the city center, in public places such as train stations and parks. They often feature artwork and designs specific to local culture, as well as city life and other relevant themes.\nWith gradual but steady increases in the number and variety of multi-purpose venues, bars, and restaurants since the mid-2010s, as well as large concerts sponsored by Harrisburg University, the live music and entertainment scene expanded to a \"mini-explosion\" by 2022 of big artists with a wide draw from both near and far.\nEvents.\nHarrisburg notably is home to large events occurring throughout the year which attracts visitors from across the country and internationally.\nMedia.\nHarrisburg area is part of the media market which consists of the lower counties in south central Pennsylvania and borders the media markets of Philadelphia and Baltimore. It is the 43rd largest media market in the United States.\nThe Harrisburg area has several newspapers. \"The Patriot-News\", which is published in Cumberland County, serves the Harrisburg area and has a tri-weekly circulation of over 100,000. \"The Sentinel\", which is published in Carlisle, roughly 20\u00a0miles west of Harrisburg, serves many of Harrisburg's western suburbs in Cumberland County. The \"Press and Journal\", published in Middletown, is one of many weekly general information newspapers in the Harrisburg area. There are also numerous television and radio stations in the Harrisburg/Lancaster/York area.\nTelevision.\nThe Harrisburg TV market is served by:\nRadio.\nAccording to Arbitron, Harrisburg's radio market is ranked 78th in the nation.\nThis is a list of FM stations in the greater Harrisburg metropolitan area.\nThis is a list of AM stations in the greater Harrisburg metropolitan area.\nHarrisburg in film.\nSeveral feature films and television series have been filmed or set in and around Harrisburg and the greater Susquehanna Valley.\nParks and recreation.\nThe following is a list of the major parks of Harrisburg:\nSports.\nHarrisburg serves as the hub of professional sports in South Central Pennsylvania. A host of teams compete in the region including three professional baseball teams, the Harrisburg Senators, the Lancaster Stormers, and the York Revolution. The Senators are the oldest team of the three, with the current incarnation playing since 1987. The original Harrisburg Senators began playing in the Eastern League in 1924. Playing its home games at Island Field, the team won the league championship in the 1927, 1928, and 1931 seasons. The Senators played a few more seasons before flood waters destroyed Island Field in 1936, effectively ending Eastern League participation for fifty-one years. In 1940, Harrisburg gained an Interstate League team affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates; however, the team remained in the city only until 1943, when it moved to nearby York and renamed the York Pirates. The current Harrisburg Senators, affiliated with the Washington Nationals, have won the Eastern League championship in the 1987, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 seasons.\nGovernment.\nCity of Harrisburg.\nThe Martin Luther King Jr. City Government Center, the first government building and only city hall in the United States named after the Civil Rights Movement leader, serves as a central location for the city's administrative functions.\nHarrisburg has been served since 1970 by the \"strong mayor\" form of municipal government, with separate executive and legislative branches. The Mayor serves a four-year term with no term limits. As the full-time chief executive, the Mayor oversees the operation of 34 agencies, run by department and office heads, some of whom form the Mayor's cabinet, including the Department of Public Safety (which includes the Bureau of Police, Bureau of Fire, and Bureau of Codes), Public Works, Business Administration, Parks and Recreation, Incineration and Steam Generation, Building &amp; Housing Development, and Solicitor. The city had 424 full-time employees in 2019 (Water and Sewer employees were transferred to Capital Region Water effective 2013). The current mayor of Harrisburg is Wanda Williams whose term expires January 2026.\nThere are seven city council members, all elected at large, who serve part-time for four-year terms. There are two other elected city posts, city treasurer and city controller, who separately head their own fiscally related offices.\nThe city government had been in financial distress for many years in the 2000s. It has operated under the state's Act 47 Harrisburg Strong Plan provisions since 2011. The Act provides for municipalities that are in a state akin to bankruptcy. The city balanced its budget in the late 2010s, was expected to have a surplus of $1\u00a0million in 2019, and maintained a surplus in 2020 despite COVID-19.\nProperty tax reform.\nHarrisburg is also known nationally for its use of a two-tiered land value taxation. Harrisburg has taxed land at a rate six times that on improvements since 1975, and this policy has been credited by its former mayor Stephen R. Reed, as well as by the city's former city manager during the 1980s, with reducing the number of vacant structures located in downtown Harrisburg from about 4,200 in 1982 to fewer than 500 in 1995. During this same period of time between 1982 and 1995, nearly 4,700 more city residents became employed, the crime rate dropped 22.5% and the fire rate dropped 51%.\nHarrisburg, as well as nearly 20 other Pennsylvania cities, employs a \"two-rate\" or \"split-rate\" property tax, which requires the taxing of the value of land at a higher rate and the value of the buildings and improvements at a lower one. This can be seen as a compromise between pure LVT and an ordinary property tax falling on real estate (land value plus improvement value). Alternatively, two-rate taxation may be seen as a form that allows gradual transformation of the traditional real estate property tax into a pure land value tax.\nNearly two dozen local Pennsylvania jurisdictions, such as Harrisburg, use two-rate property taxation in which the tax on land value is higher and the tax on improvement value is lower. In 2000, Florenz Plassmann and Nicolaus Tideman wrote that when comparing Pennsylvania cities using a higher tax rate on land value and a lower rate on improvements with similar sized Pennsylvania cities using the same rate on land and improvements, the higher land value taxation leads to increased construction within the jurisdiction.\nDauphin County.\nDauphin County Government Complex, in downtown Harrisburg, serves the administrative functions of the county. The trial court of general jurisdiction for Harrisburg rests with the Court of Dauphin County and is largely funded and operated by county resources and employees.\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nThe Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex dominates the city's stature as a regional and national hub for government and politics. All administrative functions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are located within the complex and at various nearby locations.\nThe Commonwealth Judicial Center houses Pennsylvania's three appellate courts, which are located in Harrisburg. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which is the court of last resort in the state, hears arguments in Harrisburg as well as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania are located here. Judges for these courts are elected at large.\nFederal government.\nThe Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse, located in downtown Harrisburg, serves as the regional administrative offices of the federal government. A branch of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania is also located within the courthouse. Due to Harrisburg's prominence as the state capital, federal offices for nearly every agency are located within the city.\nThe United States military has a strong historic presence in the region. A large retired military population resides in South Central Pennsylvania and the region is home to a large national cemetery at Indiantown Gap. The federal government, including the military, is the top employer in the metropolitan area.\nMilitary bases in the Harrisburg area include:\nTransport.\nAirports.\nDomestic and international airlines provide service via Harrisburg International Airport (MDT), which is located southeast of the city in Middletown. HIA is the third-busiest commercial airport in Pennsylvania, in terms of both passengers served and cargo shipments. Generally, due to the lack of an airline hub, the more popular airports in the region are Baltimore, Dulles, and Philadelphia. However, nearly 1.2\u00a0million people fly out of Harrisburg each year. Passenger carriers that serve HIA include American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, and Allegiant Air. Capital City Airport (CXY), a moderate-sized business class and general aviation airport, is located across the Susquehanna River in the nearby suburb of New Cumberland, south of Harrisburg. Both airports are owned and operated by the Susquehanna Area Regional Airport Authority (SARAA), which also manages the Franklin County Regional Airport in Chambersburg and Gettysburg Regional Airport in Gettysburg.\nFrom the 1940s to 1960s, the Harrisburg Seaplane Base on the West Shore of the Susquehanna River facilitated the landing and docking of seaplanes in the river between the M. Harvey Taylor Memorial Bridge and the Walnut Street Bridge, until it was converted into a marina and boat dealership.\nPublic transit.\nHarrisburg is served by Capital Area Transit (CAT), which provides public bus and paratransit service throughout the greater metropolitan area. Construction of a commuter rail line designated the Capital Red Rose Corridor, previously named CorridorOne, was planned to link the city with nearby Lancaster until plans went dormant in 2011.\nLong-term plans for the region called for the commuter rail line to continue westward to Cumberland County, ending at Carlisle. In early 2005, the project hit a roadblock when the Cumberland County commissioners opposed the plan to extend commuter rail to the West Shore. Due to lack of support from the county commissioners, the Cumberland County portion, and the two new stations in Harrisburg have been removed from the project. In the future, with support from Cumberland County, the commuter rail project may extend to both shores of the Susquehanna River, where the majority of the commuting base for the Harrisburg\u2013Carlisle metropolitan statistical area resides.\nIn 2006, a second phase of the rail project designated CorridorTwo was announced to the general public. It was planned to link downtown Harrisburg with its eastern suburbs in Dauphin and Lebanon counties, including the areas of Hummelstown, Hershey and Lebanon, and the city of York in York County. Other planned passenger rail corridors also included Route 15 from the Harrisburg area towards Gettysburg, as well as the Susquehanna River communities north of Harrisburg, and the Northern Susquehanna Valley region.\nIntercity bus service.\nThe lower level of the Harrisburg Transportation Center serves as the city's intercity bus terminal. Daily bus services are provided by Greyhound, Capitol Trailways, and Fullington Trailways. They connect Harrisburg to other Pennsylvania cities such as Allentown, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Reading, Scranton, State College, Williamsport, and York and nearby, out-of-state cities such as Baltimore, Binghamton, New York, Syracuse, and Washington, D.C., plus many other destinations via transfers.\nCurbside intercity bus service is also provided by Megabus from the parking lot of the Harrisburg Mall in nearby Swatara Township, with direct service to Philadelphia, State College, and Pittsburgh.\nRegional scheduled line bus service.\nThe public transit provider in York County, Rabbit Transit, operates its RabbitEXPRESS bus service from York via Route 83N and from Gettysburg via Route 15N which serves both downtown Harrisburg and the main campus for Harrisburg Area Community College. The commuter-oriented service is designed to serve residents from these areas who work in Harrisburg, though reverse commutes are possible under the current schedule. Route 83N makes limited stops in the city of York and at two park and rides along Interstate 83 between York and Harrisburg before making multiple stops in Harrisburg, while Route 15N makes two stops in Gettysburg and at two park and rides along U.S. Route 15 between Gettysburg and Harrisburg before making multiple stops in Harrisburg.\nLebanon Transit operates the Commute King A and Commute King B express bus routes which connect Lebanon to Harrisburg via U.S. Route 422 and Interstate 81 respectively.\nA charter/tour bus operator, R &amp; J Transport, also provides weekday, scheduled route commuter service for people working in downtown Harrisburg. R &amp; J, which is based in Schuylkill County, operates two lines, one between Frackville and downtown Harrisburg and the other between Minersville, Pine Grove, and downtown Harrisburg.\nRail.\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad's main line from New York to Chicago passed through Harrisburg. The line was electrified in the 1930s, with the wires reaching Harrisburg in 1938. They went no further. Plans to electrify through to Pittsburgh and thence to Chicago never saw fruition; sufficient funding was never available. Thus, Harrisburg became where the PRR's crack expresses such as the Broadway Limited changed from electric traction to (originally) a steam locomotive, and later a diesel locomotive. Harrisburg remained a freight rail hub for PRR's successor Conrail, which was later sold off and divided between Norfolk Southern and CSX.\nFreight rail.\nNorfolk Southern acquired all of Conrail's lines in the Harrisburg area and has continued the city's function as a freight rail hub. Norfolk Southern considers Harrisburg one of many primary hubs in its system, and operates two intermodal (rail/truck transfer) yards in the immediate Harrisburg area. The Harrisburg Intermodal Yard (formerly called Lucknow Yard) is located approximately three miles north of downtown Harrisburg and the Harrisburg Transport Center, while the Rutherford Intermodal Yard is located approximately six miles east of downtown Harrisburg in Swatara Township, Dauphin County. Norfolk Southern also operates a significant classification yard in the Harrisburg area, the Enola Yard, which is located across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg in East Pennsboro Township, Cumberland County.\nIntercity passenger rail.\nAmtrak provides service to and from Harrisburg. The passenger rail operator runs its \"Keystone Service\" and \"Pennsylvanian\" routes between New York, Philadelphia, and the Harrisburg Transportation Center daily. The \"Pennsylvanian\" route, which operates once daily, continues west to Pittsburgh. As of April 2007, Amtrak operates 14 weekday roundtrips and 8 weekend roundtrips daily between Harrisburg, Lancaster, and 30th Street Station in Philadelphia; most of these trains also travel to and from New York Penn Station. The Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg and Philadelphia was improved in the mid-first decade of the 21st century, with the primary improvements completed in late 2006. The improvements included upgrading the electrical catenary, installing continuously welded rail, and replacing existing wooden railroad ties with concrete ties. These improvements increased train speeds to 110\u00a0mph along the corridor and reduced the travel time between Harrisburg and Philadelphia to as little as 95 minutes. It also eliminated the need to change locomotives at 30th Street Station from diesel to electric and vice versa for trains continuing to or coming from New York City.\nAs of 2008, the Harrisburg Transportation Center was the 2nd busiest Amtrak station in Pennsylvania and 21st busiest in the United States.\nRoads and bridges.\nHarrisburg is served by several major highways, including Interstate\u00a076 (I-76, Pennsylvania Turnpike), which passes south of the city and accesses two interchanges, running west to Pittsburgh and east to Philadelphia. I-81 passes to the north of Harrisburg and heads southwest toward Carlisle and northeast toward Hazleton. I-83 begins at I-81 near Harrisburg and heads south and west through the center of Harrisburg before continuing south toward York and Baltimore. I-283 connects I-76 and I-83 southeast of Harrisburg. U.S. Route\u00a011 (US\u00a011) and US\u00a015 pass through the western suburbs of Harrisburg, heading north concurrently from Camp Hill up the west bank of the Susquehanna River toward Selinsgrove. South of Camp Hill, US\u00a011 heads southwest toward Carlisle and US\u00a015 heads south toward Gettysburg. US\u00a022 and US\u00a0322 head northwest concurrently from Harrisburg toward Lewistown. US\u00a022 passes through the northern portion of Harrisburg before it heads northeast toward Allentown. US\u00a0322 bypasses Harrisburg along I-81 and I-83 before heading east toward Hershey. Pennsylvania Route\u00a0230 (PA\u00a0230) heads south from US\u00a022 in the northern part of Harrisburg and passes through the city along Cameron Street. PA\u00a0283 heads southeast from I-283 on a freeway toward Lancaster. PA\u00a0581 connects I-81 and I-83 on a freeway through the western suburbs of Harrisburg. I-81, I-83, and PA\u00a0581 form the Capital Beltway that circles Harrisburg.\nHarrisburg is the location of over a dozen large bridges, many up to a mile long, that cross the Susquehanna River. Several other important structures span the Paxton Creek watershed and Cameron Street, linking Downtown with neighborhoods in East Harrisburg. These include the State Street Bridge, also known as the Soldiers and Sailor's Memorial Bridge, and the Mulberry Street Bridge. Walnut Street Bridge, now used only by pedestrians and cyclists, links the downtown and Riverfront Park areas with City Island but goes no further as spans are missing on its western side due to massive flooding resulting from the North American blizzard of 1996.\nEducation.\nPublic schools.\nHarrisburg is served by the Harrisburg School District. The school district provides education for the city's youth beginning with all-day kindergarten through twelfth grade. In 2003, SciTech High, a regional math and science magnet school affiliated with Harrisburg University, opened its doors to local students.\nThe city also has several public charter schools: Infinity Charter School, Sylvan Heights Science Charter School, Premier Arts and Science Charter School, and Capital Area School for the Arts.\nThe Central Dauphin School District, the largest public school district in the Harrisburg\u2013Carlisle metropolitan statistical area and the 13th-largest in Pennsylvania, has several Harrisburg postal addresses for many of the District's schools. Steelton-Highspire School District borders much of the Harrisburg School District.\nPrivate schools.\nHarrisburg is home to an extensive Catholic educational system. There are nearly 40 parish-driven elementary schools and seven Catholic high schools within the region administered by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg, including Bishop McDevitt High School and Trinity High School. Numerous other private schools, such as The Londonderry School and The Circle School, which is a Sudbury Model school, also operate in Harrisburg. Harrisburg Academy, founded in 1784, is one of the oldest independent college preparatory schools in the nation. The Rabbi David L. Silver Yeshiva Academy, founded in 1944, is a progressive, modern Jewish day school. Also, Harrisburg is home to Harrisburg Christian School, founded in 1955.\nNotable people.\nSince the early 18th century, Harrisburg has been home to many people of note. Because it is the seat of government for the state and lies relatively close to other urban centers, Harrisburg has played a significant role in the nation's political, cultural and industrial history. \"Harrisburgers\" have also taken a leading role in the development of Pennsylvania's history for over two centuries. Two former U.S. Secretaries of War, Simon Cameron and Alexander Ramsey and several other prominent political figures, such as former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich, hail from Harrisburg. The actor Don Keefer was born near Harrisburg, along with the actor Richard Sanders, most famous for playing Les Nessman in \"WKRP in Cincinnati\". Many notable individuals are interred at Harrisburg Cemetery and East Harrisburg Cemetery.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57851", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57851", "title": "Columbia, South Carolina", "text": "Capital city of South Carolina, United States\nColumbia is the capital city of the U.S. state of South Carolina. It is the second-most populous city in the state, with a population of 136,632 at the 2020 census, while the Columbia metropolitan area has an estimated 870,000 residents. The city serves as the county seat of Richland County, and portions of the city extend into neighboring Lexington County and Kershaw County. The name \"Columbia\", a poetic term referring to the U.S., derives from the name of Christopher Columbus, who explored the Caribbean on behalf of the Spanish Empire. The name of the city is often abbreviated as \"Cola\", leading to its nickname \"Soda City\". \nThe city, located just northwest of the geographic center of South Carolina, was the center of population of South Carolina as of 2020[ [update]]. It is also the primary city of the Midlands region of the state. It lies at the confluence of the Saluda River and the Broad River, which merge at Columbia to form the Congaree River. As the state capital, Columbia is the site of the South Carolina State House, the center of government for the state. In 1860, the South Carolina Secession Convention took place in Columbia; delegates voted for secession, making South Carolina the first state to leave the Union in the events leading up to the Civil War.\nColumbia is home to the University of South Carolina, the state's flagship public university and the largest in the state. The area has benefited from Congressional support for military installations in the South. Columbia is the site of Fort Jackson, the largest United States Army installation for Basic Combat Training. Twenty miles to the east of the city is McEntire Joint National Guard Base, which is operated by the U.S. Air Force and is used as a training base for the 169th Fighter Wing of the South Carolina Air National Guard.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn May 1540, a Spanish expedition led by Hernando de Soto traversed what is now Columbia while moving northward on exploration of the interior of the Southeast. The expedition produced the earliest written historical records of this area, which was part of the regional Cofitachequi chiefdom of the Mississippian culture.\nDuring the colonial era, European settlers encountered the Congaree in this area, who inhabited several villages along the Congaree River. The settlers established a frontier fort and fur trading post named after the Congaree, on the west bank of the Congaree River. It was at the fall line and the head of navigation in the Santee River system.\nIn 1754 the colonial government in South Carolina established a ferry to connect the fort with the growing European settlements on the higher ground on the east bank.\nLike many other significant early settlements in colonial America, Columbia is on the fall line of the Piedmont region. The fall line is often marked by rapids at the places where the river cuts sharply down to lower levels in the Tidewater or Low Country of the coastal plain. Beyond the fall line, the river is unnavigable for boats sailing upstream. Entrepreneurs and later industrialists established mills in such areas, as the water flowing downriver, often over falls, provided power to run equipment.\nDesignation as state capital.\nAfter the American Revolutionary War and United States independence, State Senator John Lewis Gervais of the town of Ninety Six introduced a bill that was approved by the legislature on March 22, 1786, to create a new state capital. Considerable argument occurred over the name for the new city. According to published accounts, Senator Gervais said he hoped that \"in this town we should find refuge under the wings of COLUMBIA\", for that was the name which he wished it to be called. One legislator insisted on the name \"Washington\", but \"Columbia\" won by a vote of 11\u20137 in the state senate.\nThe site was chosen as the new state capital in 1786 due to its central location in the state. The State Legislature first met there in 1790. After remaining under the direct government of the legislature for the first two decades of its existence, Columbia was incorporated as a village in 1805 and then as a city in 1854.\nColumbia received a large stimulus to development when it was connected in a direct water route to Charleston by the Santee Canal. This connected the Santee and Cooper rivers in a section. It was first chartered in 1786 and completed in 1800, making it one of the earliest canals in the United States. With competition later from faster railroad traffic, it ceased operation around 1850.\nThe commissioners designed a town of 400 blocks in a square along the river. The blocks were divided into lots of and sold to speculators and prospective residents. Buyers had to build a house at least long and wide within three years, or face an annual 5% penalty. The perimeter streets and two through streets were wide. The remaining squares were divided by thoroughfares wide. As the capital and one of the first planned cities in the United States, Columbia began to grow rapidly. Its population was nearing 1,000 shortly after the start of the 19th century.\nThe commissioners constituted the local government until 1797, when a Commission of Streets and Markets was created by the General Assembly. Three main issues occupied most of their time: public drunkenness, gambling, and poor sanitation.\n19th century.\nIn 1801, South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) was founded in Columbia. The original building survives. The city was chosen as the site of the state college in an effort to unite residents of the Upcountry and the Lowcountry after the American Revolutionary War. The leaders of South Carolina kept a close eye on the new college: for many years after its founding, commencement exercises were held in December while the state legislature was in session.\nColumbia received its first charter as a town in 1805. An intendant and six wardens governed the town. John Taylor, the first elected intendant, later served in both houses of the General Assembly, both houses of Congress, and eventually was elected as governor. By 1816, some 250 homes had been built in the town and a population was more than 1000.\nIn 1828, the South Carolina Female \"Collegiate\" Institute was founded by Elias Marks for the higher education of young women. (The word \"Collegiate\" was added to its charter in 1835.) Since the school was located on 500 acres in the Barhamville area of Columbia, it was often informally called Barhamville Institute or Barhamville Academy. \"...it was the first and only school of its character at the South. It was of a very high class...\" The Barhamville Institute closed in 1867 due to the economic dislocation of the Civil War.\nColumbia became chartered as a city in 1854, with an elected mayor and six aldermen. Two years later, Columbia had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen. The city continued to grow at a rapid pace, and throughout the 1850s and 1860s, Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas. Railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time. Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales, not passengers, from there to major markets and the port of Charlestown. Cotton was the chief commodity of the state and lifeblood of the Columbia community; in 1850, virtually all of the city's commercial and economic activity was related to cotton. Cotton was sent to New York and New England's textile mills, as well as to England and Europe, where demand was high.\n\"In 1830, around 1,500 slaves lived and worked in Columbia; this population grew to 3,300 by 1860. Some members of this large enslaved population worked in their masters' households. Masters also frequently hired out slaves to Columbia residents and institutions, including South Carolina College. Hired-out slaves sometimes returned to their owners' homes daily; others boarded with their temporary masters.\"\nCivil War.\nColumbia was of considerable importance to the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Columbia was the site of the first Southern secession convention, which assembled in the First Baptist Church on December 17, 1860. Secession may have been declared in Columbia, were it not for a smallpox outbreak that moved the convention to Charleston, where South Carolina became the first state to secede from the Union on December 20. A considerable military infrastructure sprang up in Columbia. The state arsenal was located in Columbia, along with the state military academy. The University of South Carolina grounds were converted into a military hospital since its role as an educational institution had been made moot after its entire student body volunteered for the Confederate Army. Numerous industrial facilities produced war materiel. By 1865, it was also the Confederacy's last breadbasket. All of these factors combined to make it the obvious next target for General William T. Sherman after his successful March to the Sea captured Savannah, Georgia.\nThe Union Army, under Gen. Sherman, captured the city on February 17, 1865. Much of the city was destroyed by fire between the 17th and 18th. The idea that General Sherman ordered the burning of Columbia has persisted as part of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy narrative. However modern historians have concluded that no one cause led to the burning of Columbia and that Sherman did not order the burning. Rather, the chaotic atmosphere in the city on the occasion of its fall led to the ideal conditions for a fire to start and spread. As a newspaper columnist noted in 1874, \"the war burned Columbia.\"\nReconstruction era and beyond.\nDuring the Reconstruction era, when African-American Republicans were among the legislators elected to state government, Columbia became the focus of considerable attention. Reporters, journalists, travelers, and tourists flocked here to see a Southern state legislature whose members included freedmen (former slaves), as well as men of color who had been free before the war. The city began to rebuild and recover from the devastating fire of 1865; a mild construction boom took place within the first few years of Reconstruction. In addition, repair of railroad tracks in outlying areas created more jobs for residents.\nBy the late 19th century, culture was expanding in the city. In 1897 the Columbia Music Festival Association (CMFA) was founded by Mayor William McB. Sloan and the city aldermen. It was headquartered in the Opera House on Main Street, which also served as City Hall. Its role was to book and manage concerts and events in the opera house for the city.\n20th century.\nDuring the early 20th century, Columbia developed as a regional textile manufacturing center. In 1907, Columbia had six mills in operation: Richland, Granby, Olympia, Capital City, Columbia, and Palmetto. Combined, they employed over 3,400 workers with an annual payroll of $819,000, giving the Midlands an economic boost of over $4.8 million. Columbia had no paved streets until 1908, when 17 blocks of Main Street were surfaced. But, it had 115 publicly maintained street crossings, boardwalks placed at intersections to keep pedestrians from having to wade through a sea of mud between wooden sidewalks. As an experiment, Washington Street was once paved with wooden blocks. This proved to be the source of much local amusement when they buckled and floated away during heavy rains. The blocks were replaced with asphalt paving in 1925.\nDuring 1911 and 1912, some $2.5 million worth of construction occurred in the city, as investors used revenues generated by the mills. New projects included construction of the Union Bank Building at Main and Gervais, the Palmetto National Bank, a shopping arcade, and large hotels at Main and Laurel (the Jefferson) and at Main and Wheat (the Gresham). In 1917, the city was selected by the US Army to be developed as the site of Camp Jackson, a U.S. military installation that was officially classified as a \"Field Artillery Replacement Depot\". The first recruits arrived at the camp on September 1, 1917. In the first several decades of the 20th century, white Democrats of the Solid South controlled an outsize amount of power in the House and Senate. The former Confederate states had effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites through passage of discriminatory laws and constitutions that made voter registration and voting more difficult. But they controlled all the seats in Congress related to the total state populations.\nIn 1930, Columbia was the hub of a trading area with about 500,000 potential customers. It had 803 retail establishments, 280 of them being food stores. The city also had 58 clothing and apparel outlets, 57 restaurants and lunch rooms, 55 filling stations, 38 pharmacies, 20 furniture stores, 19 auto dealers, 11 shoe stores, nine cigar stands, five department stores, and one book store. Wholesale distributors located within the city numbered 119, with one-third of them dealing in food.\nIn 1934, the federal courthouse at the corner of Main and Laurel streets was purchased by the city for use as City Hall. Built of granite from nearby Winnsboro, Columbia City Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by Alfred Built Mullett, President Ulysses S. Grant's federal architect, the building was completed in 1876. Mullet, best known for his design of the Executive Office Building in Washington, DC, had originally designed the courthouse with a clock tower. It was not constructed, perhaps because of large cost overruns on the project. Copies of Millet's original drawings can be seen on the walls of City Hall alongside historic photos of other Columbia beginnings. Federal offices were moved to the new J. Bratton Davis United States Bankruptcy Courthouse.\nIn 1940 Camp Jackson was reactivated after war started in Europe, and was designated as Fort Jackson. City leaders and the congressional delegation had lobbied to gain such a permanent military installation. In the early 1940s, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, which catalyzed the entry of the US into World War II, Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle and his group of now-famous pilots began training for the 1942 Doolittle Raid over Tokyo at what is now Columbia Metropolitan Airport. They trained in B-25 Mitchell bombers, the same model as the plane that is installed at Columbia's Owens Field in the Curtiss-Wright hangar.\nDuring the 1940s African Americans increased activism for their civil rights: seeking to reverse Jim Crow laws and racial discrimination that pushed them into second-class status in Columbia and the state. In 1945, a federal judge ruled that the city's black teachers were entitled to equal pay to that of their white counterparts. But, in following years, the state attempted to strip many blacks of their teaching credentials. Other issues in which the blacks of the city sought equality concerned voting rights and segregation (particularly regarding public schools). In 1954, in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", the US Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional.\nOn August 21, 1962, eight downtown chain stores served blacks at their lunch counters for the first time. The University of South Carolina, a public institution, admitted its first black students in 1963. Around that same time, many vestiges of segregation began to disappear from the city: blacks attained membership on various municipal boards and commissions, and the city adopted a non-discriminatory hiring policy. These and other such signs of racial progress helped earn the city the 1964 All-America City Award for the second time (the first being in 1951). A 1965 article in \"Newsweek\" lauded Columbia as a city that had \"liberated itself from the plague of doctrinal apartheid\".\nSince the late 20th century, historic preservation has played a significant part in the city. The historic Robert Mills House was restored in 1967, which inspired the renovation and restoration of other historic structures, such as the Hampton-Preston House and others associated with President Woodrow Wilson, Maxcy Gregg, Mary Boykin Chesnut, and noted free black Celia Mann. In the early 1970s, the University of South Carolina initiated the refurbishment of its \"Horseshoe\". Several area museums also benefited from the increased historical interest of that time, among them the Fort Jackson Museum, the McKissick Museum on the campus of the University of South Carolina, and most notably the South Carolina State Museum, which opened in 1988.\nMayor Kirkman Finlay Jr., was the driving force behind the refurbishment of Seaboard Park, now known as Finlay Park, in the historic Congaree Vista district. His administration developed the $60\u00a0million Palmetto Center package, which resulted in construction of an office tower, parking garage, and the Columbia Marriott hotel, which opened in 1983. In 1980, the Columbia metropolitan population reached 410,088, and in 1990, this figure had hit roughly 470,000. During the 1970s and 1980s skyscrapers were constructed and other real-estate development took place throughout Columbia. To meet demand of businesses, the city constructed The Tower at 1301 Gervais in 1973. In 1983, Hub at Columbia was constructed. In 1987, the Capitol Center was built, which became the tallest building in South Carolina. The Bank of America Plaza was built in 1989.\n21st century and recent history.\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s the city worked to revitalize the downtown, as businesses had been pulled out to the suburbs. The Congaree Vista district along Gervais Street, once known as a warehouse district, became an area of art galleries, shops, and restaurants. The Colonial Life Arena (formerly known as the Colonial Center) opened in 2002, and brought several major entertainers and shows to Columbia. EdVenture, the largest children's museum in the Southeast, opened in 2003. The Village at Sandhill shopping center opened in 2004 in northeast Richland County.\nThe Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center opened in 2004, and a new convention center hotel opened in September 2007. A public-private City Center Partnership has been formed to implement the downtown revitalization and boost downtown growth. In 2009, Columbia's most recent skyscraper, the Tower at Main and Gervais, was completed. Mayor Stephen K. Benjamin started his first term in July 2010, elected as the first African-American mayor in the city's history.\nFounders Park, home of USC baseball, opened in 2009. The South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team won two NCAA national championships in 2010 and in 2011. The 2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team, under coach Steve Spurrier, earned their first appearance in the SEC championship. Historic flooding in the city in October 2015 forced the Gamecocks football team to move their October 10 home game. Segra Park (formerly Spirit Communications Park), home of the Columbia Fireflies, opened in April 2016. In April 2017, the Gamecocks women's basketball team (under coach Dawn Staley) won their first NCAA championship, and the men's basketball team went to the Final Four for the first time. They won their second national championship in 2022 and third in 2024.\nA Mast General Store was opened in 2011. The Music Farm (now called The Senate) opened a location in Columbia on Senate Street in 2014. In 2000, the Confederate battle flag was moved from the South Carolina State House to the Confederate monument. On July 10, 2015, the flag was removed from the monument to a museum in the wake of the Charleston church shooting a month before by Columbia-born resident Dylann Roof. In August 2017, the central path of a total solar eclipse passed directly over the city and state capitol.\nIn March 2019, the murder of Samantha Josephson gained national attention. In Five Points, a neighborhood in Columbia known for its late-night bars, Samantha Josephson mistakenly entered into a car she believed was her Uber. The driver, Nathaniel Rowland, killed Josephson, sparking laws around the United States to further regulate rideshare companies. In South Carolina, the Samantha L. Josephson Ridesharing Act requires rideshare drivers to display identifying lights and prohibits the misrepresentation of non-rideshare drivers as such. Similar laws passed in New Jersey, North Carolina, and New York State. Rowland was caught, convicted, and sentenced to two life sentences without the possibility of parole. On December 28, 2022, federal legislation authorizing a study of ride-sharing safety practices, with passage by the US House and Senate, was sent to President Biden's desk.\nIn May 2019, 10,000 people marched at the Statehouse in the \"All Out Rally\" to protest issues surrounding education, including low teacher pay, high student-to-teacher ratios, and the general underfunding of education. The protest was led by SC for Ed, a left-learning state advocacy group for teachers.\nFollowing the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, protests and riots spread to South Carolina and Columbia, which included the burning of several police cars and the breaking of business windows.\nIn 2021, Republican Daniel Rickenmann was elected mayor of Columbia, defeating Democrat Tameika Isaac Devine. He succeeded Stephen K. Benjamin, who did not seek reelection, in January 2022.\nOn April 16, 2022, a mass shooting at the Columbiana Centre mall resulted in the injuries of 14 people. 10 were struck by gunfire while four sustained stampede-related injuries. Three men were arrested; Columbia police declared that the shooting was the result of an argument, not a random attack or terrorism.\nGeography.\nOne of Columbia's more prominent geographical features is the fall line, the boundary between the upland Piedmont region and the Atlantic Coastal Plain, across which rivers drop as falls or rapids. Columbia developed at the fall line of the Congaree River, which is formed by the confluence of the Broad and Saluda rivers. The Congaree was the farthest inland point of river navigation. The energy of falling water also powered Columbia's early mills.\nThe city has capitalized on this location, which includes three rivers, by identifying as \"The Columbia Riverbanks Region\". Columbia is located roughly halfway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Blue Ridge Mountains, at an elevation around .\nSoils in Columbia are well drained in most cases, with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil. The subsoil may be yellowish-red, sandy clay loam (Orangeburg series), yellowish-brown sandy clay loam (Norfolk series), or strong brown sandy clay (Marlboro series). All belong to the Ultisol soil order.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.68%) is water. Approximately two-thirds of Columbia's land area, , is contained within the Fort Jackson Military Installation, much of which consists of uninhabited training grounds. The actual inhabited area for the city is slightly more than .\nClimate.\nColumbia has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\"), with relatively cool to mild winters and hot and humid summers. The area averages 55 nights below freezing and is subject to temporary cold spells during the winter, but extended cold or days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing are both rare. These cold snaps usually result from atmospheric troughs that bring in cold air from Canada across the Eastern part of the country. The USDA places Columbia in the 8a Hardiness Zone.\nWith an annual average of 5 days with + and 72 days with + temperatures, the city's current promotional slogan describes Columbia as \"Famously Hot\". In the summer months, Columbia usually has the greatest high temperature in the state. One reason for this is its low elevation in comparison to other cities at similar latitudes. For example, Atlanta has a significantly higher elevation, which helps to moderate its summer temperatures. Secondly, the city lies in the heart of the Sandhills region. Since the region's soils are more sandy, they contain less water and can warm up more quickly. This explains why usually only the high temperatures and not the low temperatures are much different from across the state. Thirdly, because of its distance from the Atlantic Ocean, it does not receive the same moderating effects of coastal cities like Charleston. Lastly, the city experiences the urban heat island effect, making it significantly warmer than some surrounding towns and cities.\nPrecipitation, at annually, peaks in the summer months largely because of afternoon thunderstorms, and is the least during spring and fall. Snowfall averages , but is largely variable depending on the year. Snow flurries usually do fall at least once during the winter season during its coldest periods. Like much of the southeastern U.S., the city is prone to inversions, which trap ozone and other pollutants over the area.\nOfficial extremes in temperature at the main weather station have ranged from on June 29 and 30, 2012 down to , set on February 14, 1899. Only one other sub-zero temperature has been recorded in Columbia: on January 21, 1985. A weather station at the University of South Carolina campus measured a reading of on June 29, 2012, which is the highest temperature ever recorded in South Carolina.\nMetropolitan area.\nThe metropolitan statistical area of Columbia is the second-largest in South Carolina, and had an estimated population of 858,302 in 2023.\nColumbia's metropolitan counties include:\nColumbia's suburbs and environs include:\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 136,632 people, 45,474 households, and 22,243 families residing in the city.\nAs of 2023, of the 136,632 people, about 136,045 are in Richland County and about 587 are in Lexington County.\n2010 census.\nAt the 2010 census, there were 129,272 people, 52,471 total households, and 22,638 families residing in the city.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.30% of the population.\nThere were 45,666 households, out of which 22.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.7% were married couples living together, 17.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 50.4% were nonfamilies. 38.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.18 and the average family size was 2.94.\nIn the city, the population was spread out, with 20.1% under the age of 18, 22.9% from 18 to 24, 30.1% from 25 to 44, 16.6% from 45 to 64, and 10.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 29 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.4 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $31,141, and the median income for a family was $39,589. Males had a median income of $30,925 versus $24,679 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,853.

As of the 2020 census, its population was 14,091. Pierre is the eleventh-most populous city of South Dakota, and the second-least populous U.S. state capital (after Montpelier, Vermont).\nFounded in 1880 on the Missouri River, the city was selected to be the state capital when South Dakota was admitted as a state in 1889. Near the center of the state, the then-new settlement was across the river from the settlement of Fort Pierre, and near what became an important railroad crossing of the River.\nHistory.\nPierre was founded in 1880 on the east bank of the Missouri River opposite Fort Pierre, a former trading post that developed as a community. It was designated as the state capital when South Dakota gained statehood on November 2, 1889.\nHuron challenged the city to be selected as the capital, but Pierre was selected for its geographic centrality in the state. Fort Pierre had developed earlier, with a permanent settlement since c.\u20091817 around a fur trading post. Fort Pierre Chouteau, preceding the city, was named after Pierre Chouteau, Jr., an American fur trader from St. Louis, Missouri, who was of colonial French origin.\nPierre's development was also influenced by construction of the Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad, which runs east\u2013west through the city. It increased access to markets for regional products and improved transportation for passengers. The railroad crosses the Missouri River on the Chicago and North Western Railroad Bridge.\nThe capital city became relatively isolated in the post-World War II era of federally subsidized highway construction, as travelers and freight companies began to use automobiles and trucking.

According to weather maps and their data, Pierre can be considered a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"BSk\") aided by its precipitation near the threshold that reaches even northeast of the city in South Dakota. As such, it is the only capital of the Midwest states with a non-humid climate. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to , though the diurnal temperature variation is significantly greater during summer than in winter. Snow primarily falls in light amounts, with the snowiest months being February and March, while the average seasonal total is .

Summers often see spikes in temperature, with 6.6 days of highs above and 37\u201338 days with highs above .\nOn July 23, 1973, an F3 tornado struck Pierre and caused 10 injuries. It was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Hughes County.\nThe beginnings of May and October see the last and first freezing nights, respectively, of the cooler season.

A standard in most drum kits, the ride's function is to maintain a steady pattern, sometimes called a ride pattern, rather than provide the accent of a crash cymbal. It is normally placed on the extreme right (or dominant hand) of a drum set, above the floor tom. It is often described as delivering a \"shimmering\" sound when struck soundly with a drumstick, and a clear ping when struck atop its bell.\nThe ride can fulfill any function or rhythm the hi-hat cymbal does, with the exception of an open and closed sound.\nTypes.\nThe term \"ride\" may depict either the function or characteristic of the instrument. Most cymbal makers manufacture specific cymbals for the purpose.\nAlternatively, some drummers use a china cymbal, a sizzle cymbal or a specialized tone such as a swish or pang as a ride cymbal. When playing extremely softly, when using brushes, and when recording in a studio, even a thin crash may serve well as a ride cymbal.\nWhen playing extremely loudly, a cymbal designed as a ride may deliver a very loud, long crash, due to its superior sustain after being struck. \nCrash/ride.\nCymbals designated crash/ride or more rarely ride/crash serve as either a large slow crash or secondary ride, or in very small kits as the only suspended cymbal.\nFlat ride.\nBell-less ride cymbals, known as flat rides, have a dry crash and clear stick definition. Quieter, they are popular in jazz drumming. Developed by Paiste in the 1960s, flat rides are used by notable drummers Roy Haynes, Jack DeJohnette, Paul Wertico, Carter Beauford, Jo Jones and Charlie Watts.\nThe highly regarded Paiste 602 Flat Ride was reissued in 2010, but is only available in 20\" medium.\nSwish and pang.\nSwish and pang cymbals are exotic ride and crash/ride cymbals similar to china cymbals in tone.\nSizzle cymbal.\nA sizzle cymbal, thinner and one size larger than the main ride, was common in some styles of early rock music as a secondary ride cymbal, particularly for accompanying guitar lead breaks.\nSound.\nWhen struck, a ride cymbal makes a sustained, shimmering sound rather than the shorter, decaying sound of a crash cymbal. The most common diameter for a ride cymbal is about , but anything from to is standard. Smaller and thinner cymbals tend to be darker with more shimmer, while larger and thicker cymbals tend to respond better in louder volume situations, and conversely. Rides of up to and down to are readily available, and down to are currently manufactured. The very thickest and loudest tend to be about 22\u00a0inches, with larger rides restricted to medium and medium thin thicknesses.\nIn rock or jazz, the ride cymbal is most often struck regularly in a rhythmic pattern as part of the accompaniment to the song. Often the drummer will vary between the same pattern either on the hi-hat cymbal or the ride cymbal, playing for example the hi-hat in the verses and the ride in the instrumentals and/or choruses.\nThe sound of a ride cymbal also varies depending on what kind of mallet is used to hit it. In rock and metal, wood and nylon-tipped drum sticks are common; wood creates a smoother, quieter sound, whereas nylon tips create more of a \"ping\". It creates a low vibration to keep a steady beat, but a low sound volume. The bell, the bulge in the center of the cymbal, creates a brighter, less sustained sound. The bell creates such a brilliant tone compared to the subtle sound of the bow that it is often used as somewhat of another cymbal. Some ride cymbals, seen more often in various forms of metal and harder subgenres of rock, have an unusually large bell. This lessens the accuracy required to repeatedly hit the bell in fast patterns, and produces a louder, brighter tone than in most ride-cymbal bells.\nPattern.\nModern use of the ride cymbal was inspired by jazz drummer Baby Dodds's press roll rhythms. According to the Percussive Arts Society, which inducted him into its hall of fame, \"Dodds' way of playing press rolls ultimately evolved into the standard jazz ride-cymbal pattern. Whereas many drummers would play very short press rolls on the backbeats, Dodds would start his rolls on the backbeats but extend each one to the following beat, providing a smoother time flow.\"\nThe most basic ride pattern in rock and other styles is:\nIn jazz, this would normally be played with a swing. \nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57858", "revid": "51036528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57858", "title": "Fifth Beatle", "text": "Informal title for associates of the Beatles\nThe fifth Beatle is an informal title that has been applied to people who were at one point a member of the Beatles or who had a strong association with John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. The term originated in 1964 with the American disc jockey Murray the K, who pronounced himself the \"fifth Beatle\" due to the amount of promotion and coverage he afforded the band on his radio program. In the 2024 film \"Beatles '64\", directed by David Tedeschi and produced by Martin Scorsese, Harrison is seen questioning Murray the K's original proximity to the group.\nThe band's members have offered their own views as to who should be described with the title. McCartney said in a 1997 interview that \"if anyone was the fifth Beatle\", it was manager Brian Epstein, and later applied the honorific to producer George Martin in a 2016 memorial post. Harrison said at the Beatles' 1988 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that there were only two \"fifth Beatles\": Derek Taylor, the Beatles' public relations manager, and Neil Aspinall, their road manager-turned-business-executive. Others referred to as the \"fifth Beatle\" include their early drummer, Pete Best, original bassist Stuart Sutcliffe, and keyboardist Billy Preston.\nEarly group members.\nThough best-known as a four-man ensemble, The Beatles were in their early career a quintet. \nStuart Sutcliffe.\nStuart Sutcliffe was the original bassist of the five-member Beatles. He played with the band primarily during their days as a club act in Hamburg, West Germany. When the band returned to Liverpool in 1961, Sutcliffe remained behind in Hamburg. He died of a brain hemorrhage shortly thereafter. Instead of replacing him with a new member, Paul McCartney changed from rhythm guitar (with Lennon) to bass and the band continued as a four-piece.\nSutcliffe was an accomplished painter, but when compared to those of the other Beatles, his musical skills were described as \"inadequate\", and his involvement in the band was mainly a consequence of his friendship with Lennon. Sutcliffe's input was an important early influence on the development of the band's image; Sutcliffe was the first to wear what later became famous as the Beatles' moptop hairstyle, asking his girlfriend Astrid Kirchherr to cut his hair in emulation of the hairdo worn by friend Klaus Voormann.\nPete Best.\nPete Best was an early drummer of the Beatles. He played with the band during their time as a club act, in both Liverpool and Hamburg, West Germany. The band during this period consisted of Best; bassist Stuart Sutcliffe; and guitarists McCartney, Harrison, and Lennon. Best continued to perform with the band until mid-August 1962, when he was fired and replaced by Ringo Starr. The first official Beatles release to include performances by Best was \"Anthology 1\" in 1995, whereupon he commented, \"Lots of people have laid claim to being the fifth Beatle. I was the fourth, and now I'm getting the credit for it.\"\nTemporary members.\nChas Newby.\nWhen the Beatles returned from West Germany for the first time in 1960, they were short a bass guitarist. Pete Best suggested Chas Newby. Newby had been with the Black Jacks (Pete Best's group), and was now attending university, but was on holiday and so agreed to play with the Beatles. He appeared with them for four engagements in December 1960 (17 December, Casbah Club, Liverpool; 24 December, Grosvenor Ballroom, Liscard; 27 December, Litherland Town Hall; 31 December, Casbah Club). Lennon asked him to go to West Germany for the Beatles' second trip, but he chose to return to university and after Lennon and Harrison both declined to switch to bass guitar, McCartney, who previously played guitar and piano, reluctantly became the band's bassist.\nJimmie Nicol.\nJimmie Nicol played drums for the first eight shows of The Beatles' 1964 world tour. Starr became ill and the opening part of the tour was almost cancelled. Instead of cancelling, the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein hired Nicol to stand in until Starr recovered. Nicol played with the band in early June, in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Australia. Nicol made the most of his time, signing autographs and giving interviews. Starr rejoined the band on 14 June, in Melbourne.\nBusiness, management, and production.\nBrian Epstein.\nBrian Epstein, the band's manager from 1961 until his death in 1967, was instrumental in the Beatles' rise to global fame. Epstein \"discovered\" the band in Liverpool, saw their potential, and never wavered in his faith and commitment to them. He purposefully restricted his oversight of the band, limiting himself to business matters and public image, and gave the band free creative rein in their music. Epstein also doggedly sought a recording contract for the band in London at a crucial moment in their career, fighting their perception as provincial \"northern\" musicians.\nEpstein's death in essence marked the beginning of the Beatles' dissolution, as Lennon admitted later. Because he was not creatively involved with the band, Epstein was only infrequently called the \"fifth Beatle\", but over the years he and producer George Martin have been recognised as the two inner-circle members who most profoundly affected the band's career. In an interview in the 1990s describing Epstein's involvement in the band's rise to fame, Martin declared, \"He's the fifth Beatle, if there ever was one.\"\nWhen the Beatles were awarded their MBEs in 1965, Harrison said that a fifth medal should be given to Epstein since \"MBE really stands for 'Mr Brian Epstein'\".\nMcCartney summarised the importance of Epstein to the Beatles when he was interviewed in 1997 for a BBC documentary about Epstein. He stated: \"If anyone was the fifth Beatle, it was Brian.\"\nIn 2013 Epstein was the subject of a graphic novel entitled \"The Fifth Beatle\" by Vivek Tiwary. The book was released in November and spent several weeks on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list, reaching no. 1 in its third week of release.\nGeorge Martin.\nGeorge Martin produced nearly all of the Beatles' recordings (except for the \"Let It Be\" album, produced by Phil Spector, the songs \"Real Love\" and \"Free as a Bird\", produced by Jeff Lynne and \"Now and Then\", produced by his son Giles Martin) and wrote the instrumental score for the \"Yellow Submarine\" film and soundtrack album, and the string and horn (and even some vocal) arrangements for almost all of their songs (with the famous exception of Spector's re-production on \"Let It Be\", and \"She's Leaving Home\", which was arranged by Mike Leander). His arrangement of the string octet backing for \"Eleanor Rigby\" was widely noted.\nMartin's extensive musical training (which he received at the Guildhall School of Music) and sophisticated guidance in the studio are often credited as fundamental contributions to the work of the Beatles. Writer Ian MacDonald noted that Martin was one of the few record producers in the UK at the time who possessed the sensitivity the Beatles needed to develop their songwriting and recording talent. Martin's piano playing also appears on several of their tracks, including \"Misery\" and \"In My Life\". Martin himself deflected claims of being the \"fifth Beatle\" to Beatles' manager Brian Epstein.\nLennon disparaged Martin's importance to the Beatles' music. In his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, Lennon said that music publisher Dick James is \"another one of those people, who think they made us. They didn't. I'd like to hear Dick James' music and I'd like to hear George Martin's music, please, just play me some.\" In a 1971 letter to Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, \"When people ask me questions about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I have only one answer, 'What does he do now?' I noticed you had no answer for that! It's not a putdown, it's the truth.\" Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music. Commenting on \"Revolution 9\", Lennon said, \"For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask any of the other people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone.\"\nIn a tribute to Martin after his death, McCartney said \"If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle, it was George. From the day that he gave The Beatles our first recording contract, to the last time I saw him, he was the most generous, intelligent and musical person I've ever had the pleasure to know.\" Julian Lennon called him \"The Fifth Beatle, without question\".\nNeil Aspinall.\nA schoolmate of McCartney and Harrison and a close personal friend of Pete Best (he actually lived in Best's house and fathered his youngest brother, Roag), Aspinall joined the Beatles as their road manager, which included driving his old Commer van to and from shows, both day and night. After Mal Evans started work for the Beatles, Aspinall was promoted to become their personal assistant, and eventually ascended to the position of CEO for Apple Corps (a position he held until 10 April 2007).\nAspinall was involved in court cases on behalf of Apple over the years (including cases against the Beatles' then-manager Allen Klein, their label EMI, and the case against Apple Computer). He supervised the marketing of music, videos, and merchandising for the group. Aspinall also temporarily served as the group's manager following Epstein's death.\nAlthough not a musician, Aspinall also made minor contributions to a handful of Beatles' recordings. He played a tambura on \"Within You Without You\", harmonica on \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\", some percussion on \"Magical Mystery Tour\", and was among the many participants singing on the chorus of \"Yellow Submarine\". In January 1988, while accepting the Beatles' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Harrison named Aspinall as one of only two people worthy of the title \"the Fifth Beatle\", the other being Derek Taylor.\nDerek Taylor.\n\"Daily Express\" journalist Derek Taylor first met the band after reviewing their stage performance. Instead of the anticipated negative review of a rock-n-roll group, Taylor gave their act the highest praises. Invited to become acquainted with the Beatles' camp, he soon became a confidant, and gained his share of exclusives on them.\nEventually, he was hired away from his newspaper job by Epstein, who put him in charge of Beatles press releases, and playing media liaison to himself and the band. He also became Epstein's personal assistant.\nBy 1968, he became press officer for Apple Corps. As a VIP at Apple, Taylor had a major role in the company's ups and downs, making or enforcing many crucial business and personal decisions, for the Beatles and Apple's staff, and witnessing many key moments in the latter days of both. In January 1988, while accepting the Beatles' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Harrison named Taylor as one of only two people worthy of the title \"the Fifth Beatle\", the other being Neil Aspinall.\nMusical contributors.\nDuring the Beatles' existence (specifically, 1960\u201370 and the \"Anthology\" project), several musicians recorded with the Beatles in a more limited capacity, either on a Beatles' album, or on another artist's album with two or more Beatles members appearing. Hence, such artists could be dubbed \"the Fifth Beatle\" for a single track or two. Artists include:\nTony Sheridan.\nTony Sheridan employed various backup bands while performing in Hamburg between 1960 and 1963. In 1961 the Beatles (comprising Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Best), who had met Sheridan during their first visit to Hamburg in 1960, worked with him on their second. When German Polydor agent Bert Kaempfert saw the pairing on stage, he suggested that they make some recordings together. (At that period, Sheridan was the bigger name, with the Beatles as his backing band.) In 1962, after a series of singles (the first of which, \"My Bonnie\"/\"The Saints\" made it to no. 5 in the \"Hit Parade\", Polydor released the album \"My Bonnie\" across Germany. The word \"Beatles\" was judged to sound too similar to the German \"Pidels\" (pronounced \"peedles\"), the plural of a slang term for penis, so the album was credited to \"Tony Sheridan and The Beat Brothers\". After The Beatles had gained fame, the album was re-released in the UK, with the credit altered to \"Tony Sheridan and The Beatles\".\nAndy White.\nAndy White played drums on the US pressing of \"Love Me Do\", which was the Beatles' first single in the United States. Ron Richards, assistant producer to George Martin, was in charge of recording on 11 September 1962. In June, the band had recorded \"Love Me Do\" with Best, then a second time in early September with new member Starr, who had only been in the group for three weeks, before deciding to record it a third time. Richards brought experienced session drummer White in for drums on this recording, with Starr playing tambourine. White and Starr also both played percussion on \"P.S. I Love You\" during this session, with White on drums and Starr on maracas.\nBilly Preston.\nApart from Sheridan, the American pianist Billy Preston was the only artist to receive joint credit on a Beatles single, for his playing on \"Get Back\". On the \"Let It Be\" album where Preston's performances are used the song credits list \"with Billy Preston\". Preston also played organ on \"Let It Be\", \"Something\" and \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\", and Fender Rhodes electric piano on \"Don't Let Me Down\", \"One After 909\", \"Dig A Pony\", \"I've Got a Feeling\", and \"Get Back\". Preston first met the Beatles in 1962, but his \"Fifth Beatle\" claim originated in January 1969 when Harrison invited him to join them for recording sessions in order to defuse tensions in the band. Lennon suggested that Preston join the Beatles, even using the term \"Fifth Beatle\", but the idea was dismissed by McCartney. To distinguish Preston from the controversy over who is the Fifth Beatle, he is sometimes given the unique title of the \"Black Beatle\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The population was 55,605 at the 2020 census, while the Olympia metropolitan statistical area has an estimated 300,000 people. Olympia is the county seat of Thurston County and anchors the South Puget Sound region of western Washington, southwest of Seattle.\nThe Squaxin and other Coast Salish peoples inhabited the southern Puget Sound region prior to the arrival of European and American settlers in the 19th century. The Treaty of Medicine Creek was signed in 1854 and followed by the Treaty of Olympia in 1856; these two treaties forced the Squaxin to relocate to an Indian reservation. Olympia was declared the capital of the Washington Territory in 1853 and incorporated as a town on January 28, 1859. It became a city in 1882.\nAside from its role in the state government, Olympia is also recognized as a countercultural hub in the Pacific Northwest. The city's music scene gained prominence in the 1990s for its role in the emergence of punk rock movements such as riot grrrl and grunge. Olympia is also home to The Evergreen State College, a public liberal arts institution known for its non-traditional curriculum. Intercity Transit provides fare-free bus service throughout the Olympia area, which has high per-capita use of public transportation relative to other cities of its size.\nHistory.\nThe site of Olympia had been home to Lushootseed-speaking peoples known as the Steh-Chass (or Stehchass, later part of the post-treaty Squaxin Island Tribe) for thousands of years. Other Native Americans regularly visited the head of Budd Inlet and the Steh-Chass, including the other ancestor tribes of the Squaxin, as well as the Nisqually, Puyallup, Chehalis, Suquamish, and Duwamish. The first recorded Europeans came to Olympia in 1792. Peter Puget and a crew from the British Vancouver Expedition are said to have explored the site, but neither recorded any encounters with the resident Indigenous population. In 1846, Edmund Sylvester and Levi Lathrop Smith jointly claimed the land that is now downtown Olympia. In 1851, the U.S. Congress established the Customs District of Puget Sound for Washington Territory and Olympia became the home of the customs house. Its population steadily expanded from Oregon Trail immigrants. In 1850, the town settled on the name Olympia, at local resident Colonel Isaac N. Ebey's suggestion, because of its view of the Olympic Mountains to the northwest. The area began to be served by a small fleet of steamboats known as the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet. It was declared the capital of the Washington Territories by Governor Isaac I. Stevens in November 1853. Olympia was the first and only capital of Washington in its history as both a territory and a state.\nOver two days, December 24\u201326, 1854, Governor Stevens negotiated the Treaty of Medicine Creek with the representatives of the Nisqually, Puyallup, Squawksin, Steh'Chass, Noo-Seh-Chatl, Squi-Aitl, T'Peeksin, Sah-Heh-Wa-Mish, and S'Hotl-Ma-Mish tribes. Stevens's treaty included the preservation of Indigenous fishing, hunting, gathering and other rights. It also included a section which, at least as interpreted by United States officials, required the Native American signatories to move to one of three reservations. Doing so would effectively force the Nisqually people to cede their prime farming and living space. An additional agreement between the state, city, and indigenous groups, known as the Treaty of Olympia or as the Quinault Treaty, was completed during 1855. One of the leaders of the Nisqually, Chief Leschi, outraged, refused to give up ownership of this land and instead fought for his people's right to their territory, sparking the beginning of the Puget Sound War. The war ended with Leschi's capture in 1856; he was executed two years later.\nOlympia was incorporated as a town on January 28, 1859, and as a city in 1882.\nThe 1949 Olympia earthquake damaged many historic buildings beyond repair, and they were demolished. Parts of the city also suffered damage from earthquakes in 1965 and 2001.\nInterstate 5 was built through the south side of the city in the late 1950s as a replacement for earlier highways that traveled through downtown Olympia. The freeway was originally planned to cut through the city, but was moved farther out to save costs. It opened to traffic on December 12, 1958, and was later expanded in 1991.\nGeography.\nOlympia is located in Thurston County at the southern end of Puget Sound on Budd Inlet, where the Deschutes River estuary enters the Sound. The river was dammed in 1951 to create Capitol Lake; in late 2022 the state government approved the dam's removal to restore the estuary at an unspecified date.\nThe city is southwest of Seattle, the most populous city in Washington, and north of Portland, Oregon. The cities of Lacey and Tumwater border Olympia.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], Olympia had an area of , of which was land and was water.\nThe area is located near the southern limit of the Fraser Glaciation and the underlying sediments consist largely of Vashon-age till and outwash deposited at that time; the area also includes former lakebeds and alluvial deposits associated with proglacial lakes that existed in the area near the end of Vashon-stage glaciation. Residual glacial topography in the area includes drumlins, subglacial channels, and kettle lakes. Much of downtown Olympia sits on reclaimed land. Tidewater areas were filled as early as the 1870s, but the major change occurred in 1910\u201311 with placement of the Carlyon Fill (named for mayor Phillip H. Carlyon). Over of sediment were dredged, thereby creating a deep-water port at Olympia; the dredged material was used to fill tidelands, creating almost 30 blocks of what is now downtown.\nClimate.\nOlympia has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csb\"). The local microclimate has dry summers in July and mildly humid summers in early June and late August, with cool July and August overnight lows. It is part of USDA Hardiness zone 8a, with isolated pockets around Puget Sound in zone 8b. Most of western Washington's weather is brought in by weather systems that form near the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. It contains cold moist air, which brings western Washington cold rain, cloudiness, and fog. November through January are Olympia's rainiest months. City streets, creeks, and rivers can flood from November to February. The monthly mean temperature ranges from in December to in August. Seasonal snowfall for 1981\u20132010 averaged but has historically ranged from trace amounts in 1991\u201392 to in 1968\u201369.\nOlympia averages of precipitation annually and has a year-round average of 75% cloud cover. Annual precipitation has ranged from in 1952 to in 1950; for water year (October 1 \u2013 September 30) precipitation, the range is in 2000\u201301 to in 1998\u201399. With a period of record dating back to 1948, extreme temperatures have ranged from on January 1, 1979, up to , on June 28, 2021; the record cold daily maximum is on January 31, 1950, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is on July 22, 2006. Between 1991 and 2020 the mean coldest daily maximum was right on the freezing point at and the warmest night of the year averaged a very mild .\nOn average, 6.3 days annually reach , 1.8 days stay at or below freezing all day, and 78 nights reach the freezing mark. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 8 through May 3, allowing a growing season of 157 days, nearly 100 days shorter than in Seattle.\nArtesian water.\nOlympia was historically dependent on artesian waters, including springs that supplied early settlers in Swantown and Tumwater. The artesian spring at Fourth Avenue and Main Street (now called Capitol Way) was the main community well where settlers, as well as the local Steh-Chass and visiting Native Americans, gathered to socialize. Settler accounts recall paying Native Americans to collect water here. The artesian well at Artesian Commons park, a former parking lot, is active. Another still flows at the corner of Olympia Avenue and Washington Street. A small park was constructed around another spring in the Bigelow Neighborhood. The northeast end of Capitol Lake was the location of an artesian well until the construction of a new park that included changes to the shoreline. McAllister Springs, Olympia's main water source, is fed by artesian wells, and the former Olympia Brewery is supplied by 26 artesian wells.\nEfforts to protect and preserve the free-flowing artesian well on 4th Avenue in downtown Olympia began in 1991 with support from a local coffee roaster. Donations from the public were used to form \"Friends of the Artesians\", a group that researched the wells, maintained them, and tested their quality. They were later replaced by the non-profit organization H2Olympia in 2009. In 2011, the city of Olympia committed $50,000 toward improvements of an artesian well in a parking lot that the city purchased the same year. Renovations at the well were completed in late 2011, including surface improvements, solar lighting, and a raised area to fill bottles. In spring 2012, sea-themed mosaic artwork created by community members was installed at the site of the well.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 55,605 people within the city. The population density was . There were 25,642 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 78.4% White, 9.6% Hispanic or Latino, 7.3% Asian, 3.1% African American, and 6.9% from other races or multiracial.\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 46,478 people, 20,761 households, and 10,672 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 22,086 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 83.7% White, 2.0% African American, 1.1% Native American, 6.0% Asian, 0.4% Pacific Islander, 1.8% from other races, and 5.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.3% of the population.\nThere were 20,761 households, of which 25.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.2% were married couples living together, 11.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 48.6% were other families. 36.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.18 and the average family size was 2.83.\nThe median age in the city was 38 years. 19.5% of residents were under the age of 18; 11.2% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 28.5% were from 25 to 44; 26.7% were from 45 to 64; and 13.9% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 47.3% male and 52.7% female.\nGovernment.\nThe City of Olympia operates as a Council\u2013manager government, with a mayor and 6 elected council members. The council appoints a city manager to operate the City and direct employees. As of the fiscal year 2023, the city had a general fund budget of $114 million and a full-time staff of 600.\nSanctuary city.\nIn February 2025, the Olympia city council passed a resolution declaring the city a sanctuary city for LGBTQ+ people, guaranteeing municipal-level protections on top of existing state laws enshrining LGBT rights.\nEconomy.\nAs of December 2024[ [update]], the unemployment rate was 4.7% and the median household income was $76,930, a 45% increase from 2015.\nArts and culture.\nMusic.\nDespite its relatively small population, Olympia is internationally known for its local music scene, particularly in the alternative rock and punk genres. It is most notable for its role in incubating the riot grrrl and grunge movements of the 1990s. The Olympia Music History Project formed in 2023 to research and document the area's music scene during the late 20th century, the peak of its influence.\nOlympia has been a starting point or home for numerous bands that have achieved international recognition. Nirvana, among the most popular bands of the 20th century and known for popularizing the Pacific Northwest-based grunge genre, has roots in Olympia: lead singer Kurt Cobain lived in Olympia for several years during the band's rise to fame, and penned most songs on their bestselling album Nevermind while living there. Bikini Kill started the influential feminist punk movement riot grrrl in Olympia in 1990, as a counterpoint to grunge. Other prominent Olympia-based bands in the riot grrrl movement included Sleater-Kinney, named after a street in neighboring Lacey, Washington.\nIn addition, local alternative rock record labels K Records and Kill Rock Stars have played a significant role in shaping alternative rock and its subgenres. K Records, founded by musician Calvin Johnson, supported the early careers of Pacific Northwest artists including Modest Mouse and Phil Elverum. Kurt Cobain is said to have had a tattoo of Johnson's logo on his forearm.

Located at the confluence of the Elk and Kanawha rivers, it is the county seat of Kanawha County. The population was 48,864 at the 2020 census (estimated at 46,482 in 2024). The Charleston metropolitan area has approximately 203,000 residents.\nCharleston was established in the late 18th century and formally incorporated in 1794, with the trustees being Daniel Boone, Leonard Morris, and William Morris. The city gained prominence in the 19th century with the growth of the salt industry and later expanded due to coal mining and the first natural gas well. After West Virginia separated from Virginia, Charleston became the permanent state capital in 1885. Its economy and infrastructure further evolved in the 20th century with the rise of chemical manufacturing and public sector employment.\nCharleston is the home of the Charleston Dirty Birds of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball and the annual Charleston Distance Run. Yeager Airport and the University of Charleston are in the city. West Virginia State University is in the area, as are West Virginia University and Marshall University satellite campuses.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, pioneers began making their way across the Appalachian Mountains into western Virginia. Virginian militia officer William Morris built the first permanent settlement in the Kanawha Valley, named Fort Morris, in 1773. It was about upstream of modern Charleston, at the confluence of Kellys Creek, and was used extensively during the American Revolution. \nThomas Bullitt was deeded of land near the mouth of the Elk River in 1773. It was inherited by his brother, Cuthbert Bullitt, upon his death in 1778, and sold to Colonel George Clendenin in 1786. Clendenin and his company of Virginia Rangers built the first permanent settlement, Fort Lee, in 1787. This structure occupied the area that is now the intersection of Brooks Street and Kanawha Boulevard. Historical conjecture indicates that Charleston is named after Clendenin's father, Charles. In 1794, the Virginia General Assembly officially established Charlestown. On the that made up the town in 1794, 35 people inhabited seven houses.\nIn 1791, Daniel Boone, who was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of the Kanawha County militia, was elected to serve in the Virginia House of Delegates. Boone supposedly walked all the way to Richmond, the state capital. He served alongside Major William Morris Jr, representing Kanawha.\n19th century growth.\nBy the early 19th century, salt brines were discovered along the Kanawha River, and the first salt well was drilled in 1806. This created great economic growth in the area. By 1808, 1,250 pounds of salt were being produced daily, and the \"Farmers' Repository\" newspaper began publication. An area adjacent to Charleston, Kanawha Salines (now Malden), became the world's top salt producer. Brine was heated over open flames, causing the water to evaporate and leaving a residue of salt crystals. Much of the work was done by enslaved peoples. Historian Cyrus Forman estimated that at the height of production as many as 3,000 slaves worked at more than 60 salt furnaces, which operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Holly Grove Mansion was established during this period. In 1818, the Kanawha Salt Company, the first trust in the United States, went into operation. In the same year, \"Charlestown\" was shortened to \"Charleston\" to avoid confusion with another Charles Town in eastern West Virginia, named after George Washington's brother, Charles Washington. A lyceum was established around 1841.\nCaptain James Wilson, while drilling for salt, struck the first natural gas well in 1815. It was drilled at the site that is now the junction of Brooks Street and Kanawha Boulevard (near the present-day state capitol complex). In 1817, coal was first discovered and gradually became used as the fuel for the salt works. The Kanawha salt industry declined in importance after 1861, until the onset of World War I brought a demand for chemical products. The chemicals needed were chlorine and sodium hydroxide, which could be made from salt brine.\nThe town continued to grow until the Civil War began in 1861. After the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 and a referendum, Virginia seceded from the Union. But Charleston, like much of western Virginia, was divided in loyalty between the Union and the Confederacy. On September 13, 1862, the Union and Confederate armies clashed in the Battle of Charleston. The Confederates won, but could not hold the area for long. Union soldiers returned in force six weeks later and retook the city. Charleston remained under Union control for the remainder of the war.\nIn addition to the dispute over slavery, the North wanted to separate West Virginia from the rest of the state for economic reasons. The heavy industries in the North, particularly the steel business of the upper Ohio River region, depended on coal from western Virginia mines. Federal units from Ohio marched into western Virginia early in the war solely to capture the mines and control transportation in the area. The Wheeling Convention of 1861 declared the Ordinance of Succession, and the Confederate state government in Richmond, illegal and void, and formed the Unionist Restored Government of Virginia. The Restored Government and the United States Congress approved the formation of the state of West Virginia, which was admitted on June 20, 1863, as the 35th state, and the Restored Government of Virginia moved to Alexandria.\nChoosing the state capital proved difficult. For several years, the capital moved between Wheeling and Charleston. In 1877, the citizens voted on a permanent location. Charleston received 41,243 votes, Clarksburg 29,442, and Martinsburg 8,046; Wheeling was not considered. Eight years later the state capitol opened in Charleston.\nThe West Virginia Historical and Antiquarian Society was headquartered in Charleston in 1890. In 1891, the West Virginia Colored Institute, now known as West Virginia State University, was established. The next year, Capitol City Commercial College was founded. Charleston's Basilica of the Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart was completed in 1897.\n20th century.\nCharleston became the center of state government. Natural resources, such as coal and natural gas, along with railroad expansion, also contributed to growth. New industries such as chemical, glass, timber and steel migrated to the state, attracted by the area's natural resources. The city established a chamber of commerce in 1900. There was a large amount of new construction in Charleston during this period. A number of those buildings, including churches and office buildings, still stand in the heart of downtown along and bordering Capitol Street. The State Bureau of Archives and History was established in 1905, and the Charleston Public Library was established in 1909.\nThe city's first chemical manufacturer began operation in 1913. Three years later, the Libbey-Owens-Ford glass manufactory was built, as well as Charleston High School. Another large manufacturer, Owens Bottle Company, opened in 1917. Charleston City Hall was built in 1921. In the same year, a fire at the capitol building resulted in a new, hastily built structure being opened, but it too burned down in 1927. A Capitol Building Commission, created by the legislature in 1921, authorized construction of the present capitol. Architect Cass Gilbert designed the buff-colored Indiana limestone structure in the Italian Renaissance style, with a final cost of just under $10 million. After the three stages of construction were completed, Governor William G. Conley dedicated the West Virginia State Capitol on June 20, 1932. Charleston Municipal Airport was established in 1909. In 1934, the city library expanded to become the Kanawha County Public Library system. In 1935, Morris Harvey College relocated to Charleston from Barboursville, West Virginia.\nCharleston Municipal Auditorium was completed in 1939. During World War II, the first and largest styrene-butadiene plant in the U.S. opened in nearby Institute, providing a replacement for rubber to the war effort. After the war ended, Charleston was on the brink of some significant construction. One of the first during this period was Kanawha Airport (now Yeager Airport, named after General Chuck Yeager). Built in 1947, the construction encompassed clearing on three mountaintops and moving more than nine million cubic yards of earth. Kanawha Boulevard, a riverfront four-lane road, was also built in the early 1940s. The Charleston Civic Center opened in 1959. Charleston began to be integrated into the Interstate Highway System in the 1960s when three major interstate systems\u2014I-64, I-77 and I-79 were designated, all converging in Charleston. In 1961, the Kanawha River flooded much of the lower-lying parts of Charleston. In 1973, Morris Harvey College was renamed to be the University of Charleston.\nIn 1983, the Charleston Town Center opened its doors downtown. It was the largest urban-based mall east of the Mississippi River, featuring three stories of shops and eateries. Downtown revitalization began in earnest in the late 1980s. Funds were set aside for streetscaping as Capitol and Quarrier streets saw new building facades, trees along the streets, and brick walkways installed. For a time, the opening of the Charleston Town Center Mall had a somewhat negative impact on the main streets of downtown Charleston, as many businesses closed and relocated into the mall. Also in 1983, West Virginia Public Radio launched a live-performance radio program statewide called \"Mountain Stage\". What began as a live, monthly statewide broadcast went on to national distribution in 1986 through National Public Radio and around the world on the Voice of America satellite service.\nThe Robert C. Byrd Federal Building, Haddad Riverfront Park, and Capitol Market are just a few of the new developments that have helped growth in the downtown area during the 1990s. Charleston launched its city website in 1998.\n21st century.\n2003 marked the opening of the Clay Center for the Arts &amp; Sciences. The center includes the Maier Foundation Performance Hall, the Walker Theatre, the Avampato Discovery Museum and the https://. Also on site is the ElectricSky Theater, a 175-seat combination planetarium and dome-screen cinema. Movies shown at the theatre include educational large format (70 mm) presentations and are often seen in similar Omnimax theatres. Planetarium shows are staged as a combination of pre-recorded and live presentations. The West Virginia Music Hall of Fame was established in 2005.\nMany festivals and events were also incorporated into the calendar, including Multifest, Vandalia Festival, a July 4 celebration with fireworks at Haddad Riverfront Park, and the already popular Sternwheel Regatta, which was founded in 1970, provided a festive atmosphere for residents to enjoy. In 2005 FestivALL Charleston was established and has grown into a ten-day festival offering a variety of performances, events and exhibits in music, dance, theatre, visual arts and other entertainments.\nCharleston has one central agency for its economic development efforts, the Charleston Area Alliance. The Alliance works with local public officials and the private sector to build the economy of the region and revitalize its downtown. Charleston also has an economic and community development organization focused on the East End and West Side urban neighborhood business districts, Charleston Main Streets.\nGeography.\nCharleston is in west-central Kanawha County at (38.3498195, -81.6326235).

{"id": "57863", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57863", "title": "Madison, Wisconsin", "text": "Capital of Wisconsin, United States\nMadison is the capital of the U.S. state of Wisconsin. It is the second-most populous city in the state, with a population of 269,840 at the 2020 census. The Madison metropolitan area has an estimated 708,000 residents. With a downtown centrally located on an isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona, the city also encompasses Lake Wingra. Madison was founded in 1836 and is named after American Founding Father and President James Madison. It is the county seat of Dane County.\nAs the state capital, Madison is home to government chambers, including the Wisconsin State Capitol. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System. Major companies in the city include American Family Insurance and TruStage Financial Group. Tourism also plays a vital role in the local economy, generating over $1 billion in 2018. The city features a variety of cultural and recreational institutions, including the Chazen Museum of Art, Henry Vilas Zoo, Olbrich Botanical Gardens, and Overture Center for the Arts.\nAs of 2024, Madison is the fastest-growing city in the state. The city has a longstanding reputation for progressive political activity and is regarded as Wisconsin's most politically liberal city. The presence of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and other educational institutions significantly shapes the local economy, culture, and demographics. Madison boasts one of the highest numbers of parks and playgrounds per capita among the 100 largest U.S. cities and is widely recognized as a bicycle-friendly community. Within the city are nine National Historic Landmarks, including several buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.\nHistory.\nNative Americans.\nBefore Europeans, humans inhabited the area in and around Madison for about 12,000 years. The Ho-Chunk called the region () meaning 'land of the four lakes' (Mendota, Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa). Numerous effigy mounds, constructed for ceremonial and burial purposes more than 1,000 years earlier, dotted the rich prairies around the lakes. Dugout canoes found near many small lakes and rivers are prompting new anthropological research projects.\nFounding.\nMadison's modern origins begin in 1829, when former federal judge James Duane Doty purchased over a thousand acres (4\u00a0km2) of swamp and forest land on the isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona, with the intention of building a city in the Four Lakes region. He purchased 1,261 acres for $1,500. When the Wisconsin Territory was created in 1836 the territorial legislature convened in Belmont, Wisconsin. One of the legislature's tasks was to select a permanent location for the territory's capital. Doty lobbied aggressively for Madison as the new capital, offering buffalo robes to the freezing legislators and choice lots in Madison at discount prices to undecided voters. He had James Slaughter plat two cities in the area, Madison and \"The City of Four Lakes\", near present-day Middleton.\nDoty named his city for James Madison, the fourth President of the U.S., who had died on June 28, 1836, and he named the streets for the other 38 signers of the U.S. Constitution. Although the city existed only on paper, the territorial legislature voted on November 28, 1836, to make Madison its capital, largely because of its location halfway between the new and growing cities around Milwaukee in the east and the long-established strategic post of Prairie du Chien in the west, and between the highly populated lead mining regions in the southwest and Wisconsin's oldest city, Green Bay, in the northeast.\nExpansion.\nThe cornerstone for the Wisconsin capitol was laid in 1837, and the legislature first met there in 1838. On October 9, 1839, Kintzing Prichett registered the plat of Madison at the registrar's office of the then-territorial Dane County. Madison was incorporated as a village in 1846, with a population of 626. When Wisconsin became a state in 1848, Madison remained the capital, and in 1849 it became the site of the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison). The Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi Railroad (a predecessor of the Milwaukee Road) connected to Madison in 1854. Madison incorporated as a city in 1856, with a population of 6,863, leaving the unincorporated remainder as a separate Town of Madison. The original capitol was replaced in 1863 and the second capitol burned in 1904. The current capitol was built between 1906 and 1917.\nDuring the Civil War, Madison served as a center of the Union Army in Wisconsin. The intersection of Milwaukee, East Washington, Winnebago, and North Streets is known as Union Corners because a tavern there was the last stop for Union soldiers before leaving to fight the Confederates. Camp Randall, on Madison's west side, was built and used as a training camp, a military hospital, and a prison camp for captured Confederate soldiers. After the war, the Camp Randall site was absorbed into the University of Wisconsin, and Camp Randall Stadium was built there in 1917. In 2004 the last vestige of active military training on the site was removed when the stadium renovation replaced a firing range used for ROTC training.\n1960s and 1970s.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Madison counterculture centered on the neighborhood of Mifflin and Bassett streets, known as \"Miffland\". The area contained many three-story apartments where students and counterculture youth lived, painted murals, and operated the cooperative grocery store the Mifflin Street Co-op. Residents of the neighborhood often came into conflict with authorities, particularly during the administration of Republican mayor Bill Dyke. Students saw Dyke as a direct antagonist in efforts to protest the Vietnam War because of his efforts to suppress local protests. The annual Mifflin Street Block Party became a focal point for protest, although by the late 1970s it had become a mainstream community party.\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s, thousands of students and other citizens took part in anti-Vietnam War marches and demonstrations, with more violent incidents drawing national attention to the city and UW campus. These included the 1967 student protest of Dow Chemical Company, with 74 injured; the 1969 strike to secure greater representation and rights for African-American students and faculty, which resulted in the involvement of the Wisconsin Army National Guard; and the 1970 fire that damaged the Army ROTC headquarters housed in the University of Wisconsin Armory and Gymnasium. It culminated with the Sterling Hall bombing in 1970, which was intended to destroy the university's Army Mathematics Research Center. It also caused massive destruction to other parts of the building and nearby buildings and resulted in the death of researcher Robert Fassnacht.\nThese protests are the subject of the 1979 documentary \"The War at Home\". David Maraniss's 2004 book \"They Marched into Sunlight\" incorporates the 1967 Dow protests into a larger Vietnam War narrative. Tom Bates wrote the book \"Rads\" on the subject (). According to Bates, Dyke's attempt to suppress the annual Mifflin Street Block Party \"would take three days, require hundreds of officers on overtime pay, and engulf the student community from the nearby Southeast Dorms to Langdon Street's fraternity row. Tear gas hung like heavy fog across the Isthmus.\" In the fracas, student activist Paul Soglin, then a city alderman, was arrested twice and taken to jail. Soglin was later elected mayor of Madison.\n21st century.\nIn early 2011, Madison was the site of large protests against a bill proposed by Governor Scott Walker that abolished almost all collective bargaining for public worker unions. The protests at the capitol ranged from 10,000 to over 100,000 people and lasted several months.\nOn October 31, 2022, the city of Madison annexed the majority of the remaining Town of Madison. On December 16, 2024, a school shooting occurred at Abundant Life Christian School on the city's east side, resulting in three deaths and six injuries.\nGeography.\nMadison is in the center of Dane County in south-central Wisconsin, west of Milwaukee and northwest of Chicago.

The highest elevation is located along Pleasant View Road on the far west side of the city, atop a portion of a terminal moraine of the Green Bay Lobe of the Wisconsin glaciation, at .\nThe city is sometimes described as \"The City of Four Lakes\", comprising the four successive lakes of the Yahara River: Lake Mendota (\"Fourth Lake\"), Lake Monona (\"Third Lake\"), Lake Waubesa (\"Second Lake\") and Lake Kegonsa (\"First Lake\"), although Waubesa and Kegonsa are not actually in Madison, but just south of it. A fifth smaller lake, Lake Wingra, is within the city as well; it is connected to the Yahara River chain by Wingra Creek. The Yahara flows into the Rock River, which flows into the Mississippi River.\nNeighborhoods.\nLocal identity varies throughout Madison, with over 120 officially recognized neighborhood associations. Historically, the north, east, and south sides were blue collar while the west side was white collar, and to a certain extent this remains true.

It is invasive in many parts of the world, primarily North America.\nThe vine densely climbs over other plants and trees and grows so rapidly that it smothers and kills them by blocking most of the sunlight and taking root space. The plants are in the genus \"Pueraria\", in the pea family Fabaceae, subfamily Faboideae. The name is derived from the Japanese name for the plant East Asian arrowroot, (\"Pueraria montana\" var. \"lobata\"), . Where these plants are naturalized, they can be invasive and are considered noxious weeds. The plant is edible, but often sprayed with herbicides.\nTaxonomy.\nThe name kudzu describes one or more species in the genus \"Pueraria\" that are closely related, and some of them are considered to be varieties rather than full species. The morphological differences between the subspecies of \"P. montana\" are subtle; they can breed with each other, and introduced kudzu populations in\u00a0the United States apparently have ancestry from more than one of the subspecies. They are:\nVarious other species in \"Pueraria\" sensu stricto are also known as \"kudzu\" with an adjective, but they are not as widely cultivated or introduced.\nEcology.\nKudzu has been referred to as \"quasi-wild\" due to its long history of cultivation, selective breeding into various cultivars, and subsequent return to wild conditions. Some researchers suggest that humans are the main predator of kudzu in its native range, and that human use and cultivation of kudzu both contributes to its success as an invasive species and is a form of biological control for kudzu.\nPropagation.\nKudzu spreads by vegetative reproduction via stolons (runners) that root at the nodes to form new plants and by rhizomes. Kudzu also spreads by seeds, which are contained in pods and mature in the autumn, although this is rare. One or two viable seeds are produced per cluster of pods. The hard-coated seeds can remain viable for several years, and can successfully germinate only when soil is persistently soggy for 5\u20137 days, with temperatures above 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F).\nOnce germinated, saplings must be kept in a well-drained medium that retains high moisture. During this stage of growth, kudzu must receive as much sunlight as possible. Kudzu saplings are sensitive to mechanical disturbance and are damaged by chemical fertilizers. They do not tolerate long periods of shade or high water tables. Kudzu is able to withstand environments ranging from sunny to shady upon reaching its mature stage; however, forest edges with greater light availability are optimal.\nInvasive species.\nKudzu's environmental and ecological damage results from its outcompeting other species for a resource. Kudzu competes with native flora for light, and acts to block their access to this vital resource by growing over them and shading them with its leaves. Native plants may then die as a result.When kudzu invades an ecosystem, it makes the leaf litter more labile, thereby lessening the carbon sequestration ability of the soil.\nAmericas.\nKudzu is an infamous weed in the United States, where it can be found in 32 states. It is common along roadsides and other disturbed areas throughout most of the southeast, as far north as rural areas of Pulaski County, Illinois, and along the East Coast in sparser populations as north as the New York City Metropolitan Area and Boston, Massachusetts. The vine has become a sore point in Southern US culture. Estimates of its rate of spreading differ wildly; it has been described as spreading at the rate of annually, although in 2015 the United States Forest Service estimated the rate to be only per year.\nA small patch of kudzu was discovered in 2009 in Leamington, Ontario, the second-warmest growing region of Canada after south coastal British Columbia.\nKudzu was introduced from Japan into the United States at the Japanese pavilion in the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. It was also shown at the Chicago World's Fair. It remained a garden plant until the Dust Bowl era (1930s\u20131940s), when the vine was marketed as a way for farmers to stop soil erosion. The new Soil Conservation Service grew seventy million kudzu seedlings and paid $8 an acre () to anyone who would sow the vine. Road and rail builders planted kudzu to stabilize steep slopes. Farmer and journalist Channing Cope, dubbed \"kudzu kid\" in a 1949 \"Time\" profile, popularised it in the South as a fix for eroded soils. He started the Kudzu Club of America, which, by 1943, had 20,000 members. The club aimed to plant across the South. Cultivation peaked at over by 1945. Once Soil Service payments ended, much of the kudzu was destroyed as farmers turned the land over to more profitable uses. The Soil Conservation Service stopped promoting kudzu altogether by the 1950s. \nKudzu's ongoing mythos as a mile-a-minute invader is likely due to its visibility coating trees at wooded roadsides, thriving in the sunshine at the forest edge. Despite kudzu's notoriety, Asian privet and invasive roses have each proved to be greater threats in the United States.\nEurope.\nIn Europe, kudzu has been included on the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list) since 2016. This means that this species cannot be imported, cultivated, transported, commercialized, planted, or intentionally released into the environment anywhere in the European Union.\nThere are only some kudzu populations in certain regions of Italy and Switzerland. In Switzerland it occurs almost exclusively in Ticino, where it has been found in the wild since at least 1956. Most outbreaks are concentrated around Lake Lugano and Lake Maggiore, where the climate (hot summers and mild winters) encourages its growth. However, outbreaks in peripheral areas such as the Onsernone Valley and Lower Leventina are likely due to the illegal disposal of plant waste. A plan is currently in place to reduce and eventually eradicate the kudzu population in Ticino.\nOther regions.\nDuring World War II, kudzu was introduced to Vanuatu and Fiji by United States Armed Forces to serve as camouflage for equipment and has become a major weed.\nIn Australia, Kudzu is also becoming a problem in Queensland, Northern Territory and New South Wales.\nIn New Zealand, kudzu was declared an \"unwanted organism\" and was added to the Biosecurity New Zealand register in 2002.\nControl.\nCrown removal.\nDestroying the full underground system, which can be extremely large and deep, is not necessary for successful long-term control of kudzu. Killing or removing the kudzu root crown and all rooting runners is sufficient. The root crown is a fibrous knob of tissue that sits on top of the roots. Crowns form from multiple vine nodes that root to the ground, and range from pea- to basketball-sized. These crowns and attached tuberous roots can weigh 400 or 500 pounds (180 to 225 kilograms) and extend up to twenty feet (six meters) into the ground. The age of the crowns is correlated to how deep they are in the ground. Nodes and crowns are the source of all kudzu vines, and roots cannot produce vines. If any portion of a root crown remains after attempted removal, the kudzu plant may still grow back.\nMechanical methods of control involve cutting off crowns from roots, usually just below ground level. This immediately kills the plant. Cutting off the above-ground vines is not sufficient for an immediate kill. Destroying all removed crown material is necessary. Buried crowns can regenerate into healthy kudzu. Transporting crowns in soil removed from a kudzu infestation is one common way that kudzu unexpectedly spreads and shows up in new locations.\nClose mowing every week, regular heavy grazing for many successive years, or repeated cultivation may be effective, as this serves to deplete root reserves. If done in the spring, cutting off vines must be repeated. Regrowth appears to exhaust the plant's stored carbohydrate reserves. Harvested kudzu can be fed to livestock, burned, or composted.\nIn the United States, the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, undertook a trial program in 2010 using goats and llamas to graze on the plant. Similar efforts to reduce widespread nuisance kudzu growth have also been undertaken in the cities of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Tallahassee, Florida. Norfolk Southern, an American railroad company, has used goats to control kudzu at its Inman Yard in Atlanta.\nPrescribed burning is used on old extensive infestations to remove vegetative cover and promote seed germination for removal or treatment. While fire is not an effective way to kill kudzu, equipment, such as a skid loader, can later remove crowns and kill kudzu with minimal disturbance or erosion of soil.\nHerbicide.\nA systemic herbicide, for example, glyphosate, triclopyr, or picloram, can be applied directly on cut stems, which is an effective means of transporting the herbicide into the kudzu's extensive root system. Herbicides can be used after other methods of control, such as mowing, grazing, or burning, which can allow for an easier application of the chemical to the weakened plants. In large-scale forestry infestations, soil-active herbicides have been shown to be highly effective.\nAfter initial herbicidal treatment, follow-up treatments and monitoring are usually necessary, depending on how long the kudzu has been growing in an area. Up to 10 years of supervision may be needed after the initial chemical placement to make sure the plant does not return.\nFungi.\nSince 1998, the United States' Agricultural Research Service has experimented with using the fungus \"Myrothecium verrucaria\" as a biologically based herbicide against kudzu. A diacetylverrucarol spray based on \"M. verrucaria\" works under a variety of conditions (including the absence of dew), causes minimal injury to many of the other woody plants in kudzu-infested habitats, and takes effect quickly enough that kudzu treated with it in the morning starts showing evidence of damage by midafternoon. Initial formulations of the herbicide produced toxic levels of other trichothecenes as byproducts, though the ARS discovered that growing \"M. verrucaria\" in a fermenter on a liquid diet (instead of a solid) limited or eliminated the problem.\nHelium.\nHelium has been used to kill kudzu in the Southern United States by drilling holes into ground infested by kudzu and saturating the soil with helium which kills the plants. Kudzu vines treated with this method exhibits 98% to 100% mortality and dies quickly without harming surrounding plants and trees. The method was discovered by Jacob Schindler, a South Georgia student.\nUses.\nSoil improvement and preservation.\nKudzu has been used as a form of erosion control and to enhance the soil. As a legume, it increases the nitrogen in the soil by a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its deep taproots also transfer valuable minerals from the subsoil to the topsoil, thereby improving the topsoil. In the deforested section of the central Amazon Basin in Brazil, it has been used for improving the soil pore-space in clay latosols, thus freeing even more water for plants than in the soil prior to deforestation.\nAnimal feed.\nKudzu can be used by grazing animals, as it is high in quality as a forage and palatable to livestock. It can be grazed until frost and even slightly after. Kudzu had been used in the southern United States specifically to feed goats on land that had limited resources. Kudzu hay typically has a 22\u201323% crude protein content and over 60% total digestible nutrient value. The quality of the leaves decreases as vine content increases relative to the leaf content. Kudzu also has low forage yields despite its rate of growth, yielding around two to four tons of dry matter per acre annually. It is also difficult to bale due to its vining growth and its slowness in shedding water. This makes it necessary to place kudzu hay under sheltered protection after being baled. Fresh kudzu is readily consumed by all types of grazing animals, but frequent grazing over three to four years can ruin even established stands. Thus, kudzu only serves well as a grazing crop on a temporary basis.\nBasketry.\nKudzu fiber has long been used for fiber art and basketry. The long runners which propagate the kudzu fields and the larger vines which cover trees make excellent weaving material. Some basketmakers use the material green. Others use it after splitting it in half, allowing it to dry and then rehydrating it using hot water. Both traditional and contemporary basketry artists use kudzu.\nPhytochemicals and uses.\nKudzu contains isoflavones, including puerarin (about 60% of the total isoflavones), daidzein, daidzin (structurally related to genistein), mirificin, and salvianolic acid, among numerous others identified. In traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as \"g\u00e9 g\u0113n\" (gegen), kudzu is considered one of the 50 fundamental herbs thought to have therapeutic effects, although there is no high-quality clinical research to indicate it has any activity or therapeutic use in humans. Compounds of icariin, astragalus, and puerarin mitigates iron overload in the cerebral cortex of mice with Alzheimer's disease. Adverse effects may occur if kudzu is taken by people with hormone-sensitive cancer or those taking tamoxifen, antidiabetic medications, or methotrexate.\nFood.\nThe roots contain starch, which has traditionally been used as a food ingredient in East and Southeast Asia. In Vietnam, the starch, called \"b\u1ed9t s\u1eafn d\u00e2y\", is flavoured with pomelo oil and then used as a drink in the summer. In Korea, the plant root is made into \"chikcha\" (\uce61\ucc28; \"arrowroot tea\"), used in traditional medicine, and processed starch used for culinary purposes such as primary ingredient for naengmyeon (\uce61\ub0c9\uba74). In Japan, the plant is known as \"kuzu\" and the starch named \"kuzuko\". \"Kuzuko\" is used in dishes including \"kuzumochi, mizu manj\u016b\", and \"kuzuyu\". It also serves as a thickener for sauces, and can be a substitute for cornstarch.\nThe flowers are used to make a jelly that tastes similar to grape jelly. Roots, flowers, and leaves of kudzu show antioxidant activity that suggests food uses. Nearby bee colonies may forage on kudzu nectar during droughts as a last resort, producing a low-viscosity red or purple honey that tastes of grape jelly or bubblegum.\nFolk medicine.\nKudzu has also been used for centuries in East Asia in folk medicine using herbal teas and tinctures. Kudzu powder is used in Japan to make an herbal tea called \"kuzuyu\". Kakkonto (Chinese and Japanese: \u845b\u6839\u6e6f: r\u014dmaji: lit. 'Kudzu Root Soup') is a herbal drink with its origin in traditional Chinese medicine, intended for people with various mild illnesses such as headache.\nFiber.\nKudzu fiber, known as ko-hemp, is traditionally used to make clothing and paper, and has also been investigated for industrial-scale use. Kudzu fiber is a bast fiber similar to hemp and linen and has been used for clothing in China for at least 6,000 years and in Japan for at least 1,500 years. In ancient China, kudzu was one of three main clothing and textile materials, with silk and ramie being the other two. \nA material made of Kudzu called Kuzu-fu is still currently used in Japan, primarily to weave kimono and worn in the summer.\nOther uses.\nIt may become a valuable asset for the production of cellulosic ethanol. In the Southern United States, kudzu is used to make soaps, lotions, and compost.\nPuerarin which is the main clinical extract from kudzu root, has been used to improve blood flow, reduce chest pain, and support recovery in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located on the island's southern shore at the head of Charlotte Amalie Harbor. The town is known for its historic sites, Danish colonial architecture, harbor, and shopping. In 2020, it had a population of 8,194, making it the most densely populated town in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nIt has a deep-water harbor that was once a haven for pirates (including Blackbeard) and is now one of the busiest ports of call for cruise ships in the Caribbean. About 1.5 million-plus cruise ship passengers land there annually, and hundreds of ferries and yachts pass by each week. Protected by Hassel Island, the harbor has docking and fueling facilities, machine shops, and shipyards and was a U.S. submarine base until 1966.\nName.\nKnown for its many beer halls, the town was founded in 1666 as Taphus (Danish for 'beer house' or most literally 'tap house'). In 1691 the town was renamed Charlotte Amalie in honor of Danish King Christian V's wife, Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel (1650\u20131714). Between 1921 and 1936, the town was called St. Thomas by the United States. In 1936 the capital was recognized as Charlotte Amalie.\nOfficial designation.\nLike the rest of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the town of Charlotte Amalie has no local government and is directly administered by the territorial government. However, it has boundaries defined by the Virgin Islands Code, and it is recognized as a town by the U.S. Census Bureau. Charlotte Amalie sits between the CDPs of Charlotte Amalie West and Charlotte Amalie East; together, these three CDPs comprise the subdistrict of Charlotte Amalie (or \"the City\").\nNeighborhoods.\nDowntown Charlotte Amalie.\nDowntown Charlotte Amalie is divided into three historical quarters, reflecting its Danish colonial past:\nThe transitions between the quarters in downtown Charlotte Amalie are not always clearly marked. However, the best way to identify these changes is by following Virgin Islands Route 308. This road, which passes through all three quarters, provides a practical guide to their boundaries.\nFinally, as Route 308 exits downtown Charlotte Amalie, it becomes Harwood Highway, marking the end of the historic downtown district at the west end.\nDowntown Charlotte Amalie is primarily bordered on the south by Virgin Islands Highway 30, commonly known as Veterans Drive or the Waterfront Highway. The northern boundary is less clearly defined, but a useful rule of thumb is that once the street names transition from Danish to English, you are likely outside of downtown Charlotte Amalie as downtown Charlotte Amalie is the only area of the island of St. Thomas with street names in Danish.\nFrenchtown.\nFrenchtown is a distinctive neighborhood and fishing community within the town limits of Charlotte Amalie, located southwest of downtown and just south of Highway 30. Originally settled by French immigrants from the island of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it has retained a strong French-Caribbean influence that is evident in its traditions, cuisine, and way of life. Frenchtown is known for its vibrant French heritage, with many families in the area tracing their ancestry to Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy. The community celebrates French traditions, including culinary and religious practices. Historically, Frenchtown was a fishing village, and fishing remains an important part of its identity. While downtown Charlotte Amalie is known for its Danish street names, Frenchtown stands out with its French-named streets, reflecting its rich French-Caribbean heritage. \nLandmarks.\nCharlotte Amalie has many buildings of historical importance and other important landmarks:\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nArchaeological records indicate that the present-day U.S. Virgin Islands have been home to native people groups, including the Ta\u00edno, Arawak, Kalinago/Carib, and the Ciboney people. Several of these groups lived in present-day Charlotte Amalie in small fishing communities. When Christopher Columbus arrived in 1493, during his second voyage to the Americas, the archipelago was still inhabited by Carib, Arawak, Ciboney, and Ta\u00edno peoples. As was the case in most of the Americas, these native populations died relatively quickly from disease when the Europeans settled.\nWhile Columbus claimed the present-day U.S. Virgin Islands for Spain, early Spanish settlers were focused more on Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands. As a result, St. Thomas remained unprotected by the Spanish for many years, which left Charlotte Amalie's sheltered coves to be frequented by pirates, like Blackbeard, as well as mariners and other European settlers.\n17th century.\nThe Danish West India Company chartered Charlotte Amalie in 1671 after King Christian V decided to secure them for plantations. As early as in 1672, the Danish government began the construction of Fort Christian on Saint Thomas Harbor in Charlotte Amalie. In 1675, the Danes constructed four pubs near the water's edge on the western side of the Fort. The Danish government supplied convicts to work the plantations but soon allowed colonists from neighboring islands to settle there, as well as to permit the importation of slaves from Africa. In 1680, there were more black African slaves than white European settlers. Adjacent Water and Buck Islands served as pasture lands for the town, and Taphus was renamed Charlotte Amalie in 1691 after King Christian V's wife. It was the main port of the Virgin Islands Archipelago and was connected to about 50 plantations by one road, which remains the main highway today.\n18th century.\nIn the early 18th century, more than 3000 white settlers lived in town, and sugar production and slave trading were the economic mainstay. After the Danish government wanted direct administration of the archipelago in 1754, the capital was moved from Charlotte Amalie to Christiansted on the Island of Saint Croix. That partly made the economy in town to transition from slave trading and agriculture to general commerce. The slight could not hamper the town's growth, as merchants profiteered in arms and rum trades to belligerent countries.\nIn 1764, Charlotte Amalie was declared a free port by King Frederick V, and the town became the busiest harbor in the Caribbean. The American Revolution in the 1770s was good news for the town, as it was thriving times for the local businessfolk. The town began to be filled by immigrants from Europe, Africa and the Caribbean, most of them from other islands of the Lesser Antilles. By 1778, the Danish government had strengthened their military position by building Bluebeard's Castle and Blackbeard's Castle, lookout towers on the crests of the two hills in the town. The town prospered as a free port and United States, Danish, Sephardic, German, French, British, Italian and Spanish importing houses operated here. At the end of the 18th century, United States founding father and future architect of the United States Constitution, Alexander Hamilton, decided the town was so wealthy that \"gold moved through the streets in wheel-barrows\". At one point, the town of Charlotte Amalie in the Danish West Indies was the second-largest city in the Danish Realm, only smaller than the capital of Copenhagen.\n19th century.\nA growing share of the West Indian trade passed through the port in the beginning of the 1800s, and the rise of steamships made Charlotte Amalie an ideal coaling station for ships sailing between North- and South America.\nIn 1804, Charlotte Amalie was struck by a horrendous fire that destroyed more than 1200 homes and stores throughout the town. Two more fires came in 1805 and 1806, and the densely settled town lost another thousand buildings. Neighboring islands gradually began importing coal directly from producers, and Charlotte Amalie was sidestepped in trade in the early 1800s. The abolition of slavery in 1848 further diminished Charlotte Amalie's commercial role and the town suffered from a brutal recession, as did most of the Caribbean following abolition.\nDuring the American Civil War in the early 1860s, the town evolved into a smuggling center for ships running the federal blockade of ports in the Confederacy. As an acknowledgment of the port's smuggling success, the Danish government decided to move the capital of the archipelago back to Charlotte Amalie in 1871. The latter half of the 1800s was also soon hit by a cholera epidemic that killed thousands. Charlotte Amalie fell into an unsuccessful dormancy until the United States purchased the islands from Denmark in 1917.\n20th century.\nIn 1915, the United States became interested in buying the U.S. Virgin Islands. They were concerned over German infiltration in the Lesser Antilles. The U.S. purchased the Danish West Indies in 1917 for $25 million. Charlotte Amalie was under U.S. Navy rule until 1931. The United States decided to make Charlotte Amalie the main headquarters of the renamed United States Virgin Islands.\nWhen American tourists were barred from Cuba in 1960, some began visiting Charlotte Amalie instead. As an unincorporated territory of the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands became a haven for mainland United States citizens seeking luxury vacations or a second home in the Caribbean. During the mid 20th century, resorts began to be built and direct flights from the U.S. to Charlotte Amalie increased tourism. During the last half of the century, Charlotte Amalie experienced extraordinary economic growth, largely as a consequence of being a U.S. territory with a growing U.S. tourism. The tourism has not only led to a growing economy, but also to preservation and conversion of historic buildings and homes. Many ancient commercial buildings were made into restaurants and shops. During the 1980s and 90s, many buildings were restored to how they looked 200 years ago.\nThe tourism industry has thrived on the island, driving the economy of the U.S. Virgin Islands, but limited flatland space in the mountainous terrain constrains Charlotte Amalie's economic and population growth. The spread of hilltop homes overlooking the Caribbean crystal blue waters began trending in the 1960s as well.\nGeography.\nLocated mid-island on the south shore of the mountainous Island of Saint Thomas, Charlotte Amalie stretches about around Saint Thomas Harbor from the Havensight district, where the cruise ships dock in Charlotte Amalie East, to the Crown Bay (Sub Base) area in Charlotte Amalie West. The red walls of the Danish Fort Christian and the open space of Emancipation Garden and the Vendor's Market are the center of downtown. Many of the town's historic buildings and businesses stand on the slopes of Government Hill just north of Emancipation Garden. This is \"Kongens Quarter\". To the west, spanning the area between Waterfront Dr and Dronningens Gade (Main Street), are a score of alleys, each lined with colonial warehouse buildings that have been turned into stores and urban malls. Protected by the peaks of Water Island and Hassel Island, Saint Thomas Harbor makes a deep indentation in the Island. The bay affords vistas from lookout points as high as , including for instance Drake's Seat.\nCharlotte Amalie is built on three low volcanic spurs called Frenchman Hill (Foretop Hill), Berg Hill (Maintop), and Government Hill (Mizzentop). Charlotte Amalie is located at coordinates 18\u00b021' north and 64\u00b057' west.\nClimate.\nCharlotte\u202fAmalie has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen\u202fAw), characterized by warm temperatures year\u2011round and relatively low rainfall. The annual mean temperature is approximately 27\u202f\u00b0C (81\u202f\u00b0F), with average monthly highs ranging from about 29\u202f\u00b0C to 31\u202f\u00b0C (84\u201388\u202f\u00b0F) and average monthly lows around 23\u201325\u202f\u00b0C (73\u201377\u202f\u00b0F).\nNighttime temperatures remain relatively high throughout the year, contributing to the city\u2019s reputation as one of the warmest inhabited settlements under U.S. jurisdiction. While some sources describe Charlotte\u202fAmalie as the warmest inhabited location in the United States, no comprehensive climatological study has definitively ranked all inhabited locations to confirm this claim.\nThe city receives modest rainfall, averaging around 900\u2013950\u202fmm (\u224835\u201337\u202fin) per year, with a wetter season from May through November and a drier period from December through April. Rainfall amounts and seasonal distribution are consistent with a tropical savanna climate. \nAccording to WeatherSpark, Charlotte Amalie averages relatively few rainy days for a tropical climate, with the driest months from January to April typically seeing only about 3\u20135 days with measurable rainfall each, and the wettest months of September and October averaging around 10\u201311 rainy days. Overall, most months receive fewer than 10 days of rain, making precipitation less frequent than is typical for many tropical areas. \nPopulation.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 Census.\nAge:\nReligion.\nAccording to the CIA \"World Factbook\", more than 95 percent of the people describe themselves as Christians. 42% are Baptist, 34% Catholic and 17% Episcopalian. There are also Jewish, Hindu and Muslim populations of European, Middle Eastern, and Caribbean origin.\nHistoric Places of Worship.\nThe town's Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral is the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Thomas, which covers the American Virgin Islands and is the sole suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Washington (D.C.).\nSaint Thomas is home to one of the oldest Jewish communities in the Western Hemisphere as Sephardic Jews began to settle the island in the 18th century as traders and merchants. The St. Thomas Synagogue in Charlotte Amalie is the second oldest synagogue in the western hemisphere and oldest under the United States flag.\nUS Virgin Islands, Frederick Evangelical Lutheran Church was founded in 1666. The present structure was completed in 1793.\nThe Episcopal Diocese of the Virgin Islands (Anglican Church) is a diocese of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA/T.E.C) which includes both the United States Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands. The diocese is a part of Province II of the Episcopal Church.\nLanguages and literacy.\nMore than 95 percent of the population are literate.\nAlthough English is the official language, most people speak a dialect called Virgin Islands Creole, which differs from standard English in many ways. Virgin Islands Creole is used informally and standard United States English (spoken with a uniquely Virgin Islands accent) is usually preferred in school, at work and in more formal conversations. Most older children and adults can quickly switch between Virgin Islands Creole and United States English. Spanish is spoken by 16.8% and French Patois is spoken by 6.6% of the town's population. While Spanish is spoken by migrants from Puerto Rico (US) and immigrants from the Dominican Republic, creoles are spoken by immigrants from St. Barthelemy, Dominica and Haiti; Dutch and Papiamento are spoken by immigrants from Saba, Aruba, St. Maarten and Cura\u00e7ao.\nEconomy.\nThe economy is based on tourism, handicrafts, jewelry, and the production of rum, bay rum, and jams. As well as being the USVI's political capital, \"the City\" is the port capital of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Charlotte Amalie is the third most popular cruise ship destination in the Caribbean Sea. Up to eleven cruise ships can occupy the harbor on any given day, though usually there are about five.\nTourism.\nAbout 1.5 plus million cruise ship passengers visit on average per year.\nTourist attractions include Blackbeard's Castle which is one of the most visited attractions in the town, Bluebeard's Castle, 17th-century Fort Christian, the distinctive Legislature Building, the 99 Steps Stairway, Emancipation Garden, Market Square, Seven Arches Museum, St. Thomas Synagogue, Frederick Lutheran Church, and the Weibel Museum. Tourists usually either arrive by airplane at the Cyril E. King Airport, approximately west of Charlotte Amalie, the Crown Bay cruise ship port, or the Havensight cruise port. In the 21st century, Charlotte Amalie has benefited from proximity to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where passengers from larger aircraft can transfer to smaller aircraft for a 30-minute flight to Charlotte Amalie. The town has also become a jumping-off place for other islands in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. In this century, there have been more high-speed ferries each year leaving Charlotte Amalie for St. Croix, St. John and Tortola. A seaplane wharf is near the west end of the inner harbor; the planes take passengers to St. Croix.\nBecause of its duty-free policies, the Territory is sometimes referred to as \"the duty-free capital of the world\". Charlotte Amalie has more jewelry shops and perfume vendors than anywhere else in the Caribbean and is known for its outdoor shopping Vendors' Plaza. On Main Street (Dronningens Gade) there are many major shops, including Tiffany, Breitling, Rolex, and Fresh Produce.\nHavensight and Crown Bay docks are other shopping areas, with a number of stores adjacent to the cruise ship docks. Along Dronningens Gade are more than 400 shops, most of them selling jewelry and in the Havensight Mall. The western end (near the intersection with Strand Gade) is called \"Market Square.\" Once the site of the biggest slave market auctions in the Caribbean Basin, today it is an open-air cluster of stalls where resident farmers and gardeners gather occasionally to sell their produce.\nCulture.\nThe culture is a mixture of American (US) socio-economic activities- and Afro/Latino-Caribbean culture, with an influence from Danish colonial history. There are American fast food chains in the town, as well as local restaurants serving only Caribbean cuisine. Grocery stores contain items from the US mainland, and local items such as rum. Seafood and local produce can be found at open-air markets.\nDanish influence.\nNamed Charlotte Amalie in honor of the wife of Danish King Christian V, the Danish influence is strong. The heritage is predominant in several ways in Charlotte Amalie today. The Danes left castles, cemeteries, churches, forts, town homes, sugar mills and plantation houses that are still standing. Many geographical names are kept in Danish and many locals have Danish heritage. The most widely spoken language, Virgin Islands Creole, has many words and expressions left from the Danish language. For instance, Danish words like \"sk\u00e5l\" (toast), \"bjerg\" (mountain) and \"frikadeller\" (meatballs) are commonly used. Much of the historic colonial architecture is still standing and words like \"street\" are more commonly referred to by the Danish translation \"gade\".\nArchitecture.\nCharlotte Amalie has the largest collection of colonial buildings in the Caribbean. Most of the buildings are classic Caribbean adaptions of English Georgian architecture built by the Danes, dating to the 1830s.\nMuseums and Art Galleries.\nA list of Museums and Art Galleries in the town of Charlotte Amalie:\nTransportation.\nThere are three main roads in Charlotte Amalie. Waterfront Drive, also called Veteran's Drive, fronts the harbor and extends from Havensight Mall to Frenchtown. This four-lane road is best navigated by car or taxi. Dronningens Gade, also called \"Main Street\", Norre Gade, run parallel to the waterfront. Wimmelskafts Gade or \"Back Street\", is one block farther inland, parallel to the shoreline. Street names in the town are remnants of the Island's Danish past.\nCharlotte Amalie is notable for being the only U.S. capital city (either of a territory or state) where traffic drives on the left side of the road \u2013 this despite a previous fourteen-year period of attempting to conform to the United States' right side principle, which was abandoned and reverted to left side by popular demand. The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) is the only United States jurisdiction of any kind where the rule of the road is to drive on the left. However, virtually all passenger vehicles are left hand drive due to imports of U.S. vehicles. making the driving experience in the USVI very similar to the situation in The Bahamas, and for largely the same vehicle import reasons.\nAirports.\nThe Cyril E. King Airport serves the residents of Charlotte Amalie but it is located in Charlotte Amalie West. The only air transport available in the town of Charlotte Amalie is the Charlotte Amalie Harbor Seaplane Base (IATA: SPB, FAA LID: VI22), also known as St. Thomas Seaplane Base. It is located just east of Frenchtown on Highway 30. This private-use airport is owned by the Virgin Islands Port Authority. At this base, a seaplane shuttle service is operated between Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Croix and Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas\nFerry Terminals.\nThe Edward William Blyden Ferry Terminal, located next to the Charlotte Amalie Harbor Seaplane Base, serves as the only ferry terminal to surrounding islands from the town of Charlotte Amalie. From the terminal nonstop service to Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands and Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. To accommodate the entry of foreign travelers entering into US Virgin Islands, the terminal has U S Customs and Border Patrol Offices and officers stationed at the terminal.\nPublic Transit.\nThe VITRAN (Virgin Islands Transit) system is a comprehensive public transportation system serving the U.S. Virgin Islands. The system encompasses various modes of transportation, including buses, paratransit services and ferries. The buses and paratransit services are the only modes of transport that are available within the Charlotte Amalie however. All VITRAN bus routes on St. Thomas serve the town of Charlotte Amalie.\nAlternative Fixed Path Transit.\n\"Safaris\", as they are called locally, are open air taxis mounted onto the back of a pickup truck. Some \"safari\" drivers operate on several VITRAN bus fixed paths including the suspended VITRAN 101 route. Those that do are locally called \"Dollar Ride\", a term used to describe the original fare charged that matched the old VITRAN fee. Those following a VITRAN fixed path, charge the same amount as VITRAN buses (plus bag/luggage fee) as they are required to do by the rate set by the Taxi Cab Commission. Before entering a \"safari\", riders should verify with the driver that they are \"dollar ride\" and the path.\nOn days when there are many cruise ships in the harbor however, utilizing these fixed path safaris are difficult to catch as most drivers suspend their fixed path service to serve cruise passengers because they make more money doing so.\nHighways and Routes.\nIn the USVI, highways and major routes beginning with 3-4 are located on St. Thomas. Many of these highways and routes pass through or border the town of Charlotte Amalie. Some of the major highways and roads include:\nStep Streets.\nCharlotte Amalie is renowned for its numerous historic staircases (or \u201cstep streets\u201d), which are a unique feature of the town's architectural and cultural heritage. The 45 step streets, in total, date back to the Danish colonial era and were originally built to help residents and visitors navigate the steep hills of the town. They serve as a network of pedestrian pathways connecting different levels of the hilly terrain of Charlotte Amalie. These \"step streets\", like the actual streets in Charlotte Amalie, have names that end with \"Gade\". For example, Store Taarne Gade (English: Great Tower Street) is the famed 99 Steps and Bred Gade (English: Broad Street or Wide Street) are just two of the most famous \"step streets\". Many of the staircases remain functional and in use today, offering not only utility but also a glimpse into the town's history. The steps reflect the ingenuity of Danish urban planning during colonial times, allowing for the development of a town in a challenging, hilly environment. The historic steps are not only a functional part of the town's layout but also an enduring symbol of the architectural ingenuity and cultural legacy of Charlotte Amalie.\nEducation.\nSt. Thomas-St. John School District operates public schools.\nElementary Schools:\nK-8 Schools:\nLockhart K-8 School\nJunior High Schools:\nHigh Schools\nAdult Education\nParochial and Private schools:\nUniversities and Colleges:\nThe University of the Virgin Islands, Orville E. Kean Campus, serves the residents of Charlotte Amalie but is located in Charlotte Amalie West.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57872", "revid": "46710896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57872", "title": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "text": "Capital and largest city of Puerto Rico\nSan Juan ( , ; Spanish for \"Saint John\") is the capital city and most populous municipality in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States. As of the 2020 census, it is the 57th-most populous city under the jurisdiction of the United States, with a population of 342,259. San Juan was founded by Spanish colonists in 1521, who called it Ciudad de Puerto Rico (Spanish for \"Rich Port City\").\nPuerto Rico's capital is the second oldest European-established capital city in the Americas, after Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic, founded in 1496, and is the oldest European-established city under United States sovereignty. Several historical buildings are located in the historic district of Old San Juan; among the most notable are the city's former defensive walls, Fort San Felipe del Morro and Fort San Crist\u00f3bal, and La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas. These historic sites were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.\nToday, San Juan is Puerto Rico's most important seaport and is one of the island's most notable financial, cultural, and tourism centers. The population of the metropolitan statistical area, including San Juan and the municipalities of Bayam\u00f3n, Guaynabo, Cata\u00f1o, Can\u00f3vanas, Caguas, Toa Alta, Toa Baja, Carolina and Trujillo Alto, is about 2.443\u00a0million inhabitants; thus, about 76% of the population of Puerto Rico now lives and works in this area. San Juan is also a principal city of the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area. The city has been the host of events within the sports community, including the 1979 Pan American Games; 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games; events of the 2006, 2009 and 2013 World Baseball Classics; the Caribbean Series and the Special Olympics and MLB San Juan Series in 2010.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian era.\nThe Ta\u00edno people were the original inhabitants of the area before the arrival of the Europeans to the island of Puerto Rico in 1493. Remains of a small indigenous fishing village have been found in Puerta de Tierra where the Puerto Rico National Guard Museum stands today, however most archaeological sites in the region have been destroyed and lost throughout the colonial history. The area of San Juan used to be the boundary between the tribal regions (yucayeques) of \"Guaynabo\" and \"Haimanio\", led by the chiefs (caciques) Mabo and Yuisa (also known as Loa\u00edza), respectively, at the time of the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.\nFounding.\nIn 1508, Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n founded the original settlement which he called Caparra. It was named after a former Roman city in the province of C\u00e1ceres in Spain, the birthplace of Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando, then the Governor of Spain's Caribbean territories. Today, it is part of the Pueblo Viejo district of Guaynabo, directly to the west of the modern municipality of San Juan. A year later, the settlement was moved to a site then called Puerto Rico, Spanish for \"rich port\" or \"good port\".\nThe local Catholic diocese, the second oldest in the Americas and the oldest in the United States, was founded in the newly built settlement on August 8 of 1511. In 1521, the newer settlement was given its formal name: Ciudad de Puerto Rico de San Juan Bautista. Many of the oldest European-founded institutions in the Western Hemisphere, such as the Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino Convent and the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n Hospital, were established during this time in San Juan.\nThe ambiguous use of \"San Juan Bautista\" and \"Puerto Rico\" for both the city and the island in time led to a reversal in practical use by most inhabitants: by 1746 the name for the city (Puerto Rico) had become that of the entire island, leading to the city being identified as \"Puerto Rico de Puerto Rico\" on maps of the era.\nSpanish Colonial era.\nSan Juan, as a settlement of the Spanish Empire, was used by merchant and military ships traveling from Spain as the first stopover in the Americas. Because of its prominence in the Caribbean, a network of fortifications was built to protect the transports of gold and silver from the New World to Europe. Because of the rich cargoes, San Juan became a target of the foreign powers of the time.\nSan Juan underwent attacks from the English led by Sir Francis Drake in 1595 (in what is known as the Battle of San Juan) and by George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, in 1598. Artillery from San Juan's fort, El Morro, repelled Drake; however, Clifford managed to land troops and lay siege to the city. After a few months of English occupation, Clifford was forced to abandon the siege when his troops began to suffer from exhaustion and sickness. In 1625 the city was sacked by Dutch forces led by Captain Balduino Enrico (also known as Boudewijn Hendricksz/Bowdoin Henrick), but El Morro withstood the assault and was not taken. The Dutch were counterattacked by Captain Juan de Am\u00e9zqueta and 50 members of the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico with a sword wound to his neck which he received from the hands of Am\u00e9zqueta.\nThe Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Enrico set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze. Captains Am\u00e9zqueta and Andr\u00e9s Botello decided to put a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's front and rear guard. They drove Enrico and his men from their trenches and into the ocean in their haste to reach their ships.\nThe British attack in 1797, during the French Revolutionary Wars, led by Sir Ralph Abercromby (who had just conquered Trinidad). His army laid siege to the city but was forced to withdraw in defeat as the Puerto Rican defenses proved more resilient than those of Trinidad. Various events and circumstances, including liberalized commerce with Spain, the opening of the island to immigrants as a direct result of the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815, and the colonial revolutions, led to an expansion of San Juan and other Puerto Rican settlements in the late 18th and early 19th century.\nSpanish-American War.\nOn May 8, 1898, United States Navy ships, among them , , , , and , commanded by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson arrived at San Juan Bay. captured the Spanish freighter \"Rita\" in San Juan Bay, thus being the first hostile encounter between the warring sides in Puerto Rico. On May 9, \"Yale\" fought a brief battle with an auxiliary cruiser of Spain, name unknown, resulting in a Spanish victory. Around this time, Captain \u00c1ngel Rivero M\u00e9ndez was assigned the command of the Spanish forces in the fortress of San Crist\u00f3bal in San Juan. On May 10, \"Yale\" returned to San Juan Bay, Rivero-M\u00e9ndez ordered his men to open fire upon \"Yale\" using an Ordo\u00f1ez 15-centimeter cannon, thus becoming the first attack against the Americans in Puerto Rico during the Spanish\u2013American War.\nFor his actions, Captain Rivero-M\u00e9ndez was awarded the \"Cruz de la Orden de M\u00e9rito Militar\" (The Cross of the Order of the Military Merit) first class. The residents of San Juan were furious with Rivero and blamed him for the destruction caused to their city by the American bombardments. Nothing came of those accusations and Capt. Rivero-M\u00e9ndez was ordered to turn over the keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 was signed.\nOn July 25, General Nelson A. Miles landed at Gu\u00e1nica (in southwestern Puerto Rico) with 3,300\u00a0soldiers in what was known as the Puerto Rican Campaign. The American troops found some resistance and engaged the Spanish and Puerto Rican troops in battle, the most notable of these the battles of Yauco and Asomante. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended August 13, 1898, after President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an armistice. Spain ceded the island to the United States later the same year by signing the Treaty of Paris.\n20th century.\nCamp Las Casas, located in the district of Santurce, served as the main training camp for the Puerto Rican soldiers prior to World War I and World War II; the majority of the men trained in this facility were assigned to the \"Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry\" which was renamed the 65th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army by the Reorganization Act of June 4, 1920. The 65th Infantry was deactivated in 1956 and became the only unit ever to be transferred from an active Army component to the Puerto Rico National Guard.\nLieutenant Te\u00f3filo Marxuach (retired as a Lieutenant Colonel), a native of Arroyo, Puerto Rico, fired what is considered to be the first shot of World War I fired by the regular armed forces of the United States against any ship flying the colors of the Central Powers. Marxuach, who was a member of the \"Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry\" and Officer of the Day, on March 25, 1915, opened fire on the \"Odenwald\", an armed German supply vessel, when it was trying to force its way out of San Juan's bay. The shots ordered by Lt. Marxuach were the first fired by the United States in World War I.\nIn 1919, F\u00e9lix Rigau Carrera, \"El Aguila de Sabana Grande\" (The Eagle from Sabana Grande), the first Puerto Rican pilot, became the first native Puerto Rican to fly an aircraft in the island when he flew his Curtiss JN-4 from Las Casas. At the time, the area was used by the military as an air base and it was also Puerto Rico's first commercial airport, and Rigau Carrera was allowed to perform his historic flight from the airfield. Camp Las Casas was eventually closed down, and in 1950 a public housing project by the name of Residencial Fray Bartolome de Las Casas was constructed on its former location.\nOn January 2, 1947, the people of San Juan elected Felisa Rinc\u00f3n de Gautier (also known as Do\u00f1a Fela) (1897\u20131994) as their mayor. Thus, she became the first woman to be elected as the mayor of a capital city in any of the Americas. During the Cold War era, she ordered the establishment of the island's first Civil Defense system under the directorship of Colonel Gilberto Jos\u00e9 Marxuach (Te\u00f3filo's son). Rinc\u00f3n de Gautier served as mayor until January 2, 1969.\nOn October 30, 1950, San Juan was the scene of the San Juan Uprising, one of many uprisings which occurred in various towns and cities in Puerto Rico, by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party against the governments of Puerto Rico and the United States. Among the uprising's main objective was to attack La Fortaleza and the United States Federal Court House Building in Old San Juan. The \"La Fortaleza battle\", which ensued between the nationalists and the police lasted 15 minutes and ended when four of the five attackers were killed.\n21st century.\nSan Juan has experienced periods of both stagnation and development in the recent years. Gentrification has been noticeable in areas of the city such as Lo\u00edza Street in Santurce and Santa Rita in R\u00edo Piedras. In recent years the city has been the location of multiple strikes and protests, such as the 2001 protests against the United States Navy in the island municipality of Vieques, the 2010 and 2011 University of Puerto Rico strikes, and the 2019 protests against Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 which resulted in his resignation.\nOn September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made a direct impact in Puerto Rico, causing widespread damage and a collapse of the infrastructure in San Juan and the rest of Puerto Rico. The damage caused in 2017 was extensive, affecting the electricity, potable water supplies, transportation, and communication, but significant progress had been made in the capital by April 2019, and particularly by October 2019. This was significant for tourism, which had rebounded by October of that year and was close to the pre-Maria era.\nSan Juan today remains an important cultural, financial and industrial center not only of Puerto Rico but of the Caribbean region. As the biggest industrial center of Puerto Rico, it is the home of industries such as tobacco processors, breweries, refining facilities for petroleum and sugar, and distillers of rum as well as manufacturers of metal products, cement, pharmaceuticals, and clothing. The Puerto Rico Convention Center, opened in 2005, is the largest of its kind in the Caribbean and one of the most advanced in the Americas.\nGeography.\nSan Juan is located along the north-eastern coast of Puerto Rico in the Northern Plains region. It lies south of the Atlantic Ocean; north of Caguas and Trujillo Alto; east of Guaynabo; and west of Carolina. The city occupies an area of , of which, (37.83%) is water. San Juan's main water bodies are San Juan Bay and two natural lagoons, the Condado and San Jos\u00e9. \nAt almost 1,030 feet (314 m) above sea level, the highest point in the municipality of San Juan is located on an unnamed hill on the \"Morcelo\" sector of Caimito, close to the municipal border with Caguas.\nThe municipality of San Juan is surrounded by the San Juan metropolitan area, particularly the highly urbanized municipalities of Guaynabo, Trujillo Alto and Carolina. These municipalities, together with Bayam\u00f3n and Cata\u00f1o, form what is locally referred to as the \"\u00c1rea Metro\", the core of the wider San Juan metropolitan area. In total 41 municipalities are included in the entire metropolitan area extends throughout the island's northern coast and central eastern regions.\nClimate.\nSan Juan has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with year-round growing season. It has an average temperature of . Temperatures of or higher are seen on an average 79 days annually, more commonly occurring during the wetter months of the northern summer, especially if the winds come from the south.\nIn the winter, temperatures can drop to around . The average winter low is . The coolest temperature officially recorded was on March 3, 1957, and the hottest was on October 9, 1981. The record cold daily maximum is on February 4, 1935. The record warm daily minimum is on August 11, 1995, the most recent of four occasions.\nWith a mean minimum of 67\u00a0\u00b0F (19 C), San Juan is in USDA plant hardiness zone 13B, which is the highest category. Rainfall is well-distributed throughout the year. The months of January, February, and March are the driest. As March averages just of rain, the city falls under the tropical monsoon category.\nRainfall averages , falling on an average 198.5 days per year. Despite this dampness, the city averages 2,970 hours of sunshine per year, or just over &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 of the possible total. Annual rainfall has historically ranged from in 1991 to in 2010.\nAs with other parts of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, San Juan is often blanketed by waves of Saharan dust coming from the Sahara across the Atlantic Ocean in Northern Africa. Although beneficial to the tropical environment, these dust storms have recently become hazardous to human health causing haze and overheating in urban areas of the island. Due to San Juan's relatively flat geography, the dust often settles in these flat coastal regions of Puerto Rico as its flow is blocked by the higher altitude Cordillera Central to the south, causing intense episodes of haze to settle for long periods of time, especially during periods of more scarce rainfall. Recent advancements include early warning systems to prepare the population for these intense episodes by both local authorities and the EPA.\nHurricane Maria.\nHurricane Maria made landfall in southeastern Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Gusts of up to 113\u00a0mph (182\u00a0km/h) were reported in the capital city shortly before landfall in the municipality of Yabucoa. The municipality of San Juan experienced widespread flooding in most coastal areas, and roofs were blown off from numerous structures. The neighborhood of La Perla was largely destroyed. In the wider metropolitan area, flooding from Lake La Plata produced flash floods that trapped residents of Toa Baja, and in Cata\u00f1o the Juana Matos neighborhood was estimated to be 80% destroyed. At least eight people died from the flooding, while many were unaccounted for.\nBeaches.\nSan Juan is home to numerous beaches, all of which are open to the public. All beaches of San Juan face the Atlantic Ocean. The Islet of San Juan hosts Los Cables Beach and La Perla Beach next to the Old San Juan district of La Perla, the Capitolio Beach located immediately north of the Puerto Rico Capitol, Puerta de Tierra Beach along the \"Paseo de Puerta de Tierra\", and El Escambr\u00f3n Beach at the northeastern edge of the islet. The latter is the most popular beach in the islet due to its shore being protected from the strong Atlantic Ocean waves by reefs that serve as natural breakwaters. From east to west, the beaches in Santurce include Ocean Park Beach (also known as \u00daltimo Trolley Beach), Condado Beach and Playita del Condado. Ocean Park Beach and El Condado Beach are the largest in the city and they host a large number of hotels and businesses that cater to tourists and beachgoers.\nBeach erosion.\nAs with other beaches across Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, the beaches of San Juan are currently under the threat of coastal erosion, particularly that of Ocean Park. The threat has become more evident recently and there are currently no state reports dedicated to the documentation or mitigation planning, according to oceanographer and geologist Maritza Barreto.\nParks.\nThe municipality of San Juan contains numerous parks, including public parks, historic and heritage parks, nature reserves, protected natural areas, and recreational parks. These parks are managed by a number of entities such as the Municipality, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, the National Park Service, the University of Puerto Rico and conservation easements.\nSan Juan Ecological Corridor.\nThe San Juan Ecological Corridor is a conservation project by the Government of Puerto Rico consisting in 6 different units found within the municipality of San Juan: the Cupey Arboretum, which protects the riparian ecosystems along the R\u00edo Piedras; the Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s Mendoza Urban Forest, a small urban forest located next to the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn Foundation in Sabana Llana Sur; Los Capuchinos Forest, a forest which covers a small karst area also in Sabana Llana Sur; the New Millennium State Forest, one of the 20 state forests of Puerto Rico; the San Juan Waterworks, consisting of the Old Piedras River Aqueduct and adjacent historic district; and the University of Puerto Rico Botanical Garden, also known as the San Juan Botanical Garden.\nHistorical parks.\nThe San Juan National Historic Site is home to El Morro Esplanade, a large open area located between El Morro and Ballaj\u00e1 in Old San Juan. The esplanade is located in the promontory which gives \"El Morro\" its name and it offers views of the San Juan Bay and the rest of San Juan. It is very popular for activities such as picnics, stargazing and kite flying.\nThe district of the Capitol of Puerto Rico is home to the Iglesias Pant\u00edn and Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn parks, and a line of monuments located along Constituci\u00f3n Avenue which includes the \"Walkway of the Presidents\", the Puerto Rico Police Memorial Monument and The Holocaust Memorial Monument. The \"Loma de los Vientos\", or \"Loma del Viento\" (Spanish for \"hill of winds\"), is a small open green area located northwest of the Capitol, next to Castle San Crist\u00f3bal, and it often hosts events such as the Epiphany celebrations.\nLuis Mu\u00f1oz Rivera Park is a 27.2 acre recreational and historic park located in Puerta de Tierra, between Luis Mu\u00f1oz Rivera, Ponce de Le\u00f3n and Constituci\u00f3n avenues. It is the largest public square in Puerto Rico, and it is home to several historic sites such as the Polvor\u00edn San Ger\u00f3nimo de Boquer\u00f3n, which used to supply gunpowder to the nearby Fort\u00edn de San Ger\u00f3nimo. The park used to host a small zoo, and currently hosts gazebos, gardens, restaurants and access to the beach. The park has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since November 14, 2007.\nThe Polvorin de Miraflores is a historic district and park located next to the Puerto Rico Convention Center in Isla Grande, Santurce. The ammunition storage house dates to the mid-18th century and it is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nAnother historic district currently under revitalization is the San Juan Waterworks historic district which contains the Old Piedras River Aqueduct. There are plans to revitalize the old aqueduct structures and its surroundings to create a historic park open to visitors and researchers.\nMunicipal parks.\nSome of the recreational parks of the municipality include Bah\u00eda Urbana, a waterfront park located in Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra by the San Juan Bay; the Paseo de Puerta de Tierra, a recreational walkway along the Atlantic Ocean cliffs of Puerta de Tierra that connects the Puerto Rico Capitol with El Escambr\u00f3n Beach and Luis Mu\u00f1oz Rivera Park.\nVentana al Mar, Laguna del Condado Jaime Ben\u00edtez Park, Parque del Indio are some of the parks located in El Condado district of Santurce. Dr. Jos\u00e9 Celso Barbosa Park is located in Ocean Park, also in Santurce. Parque Central, also known as the San Juan Municipal Central Park, is a large park and recreational complex located in southern Santurce near the mouth of the Puerto Nuevo River and the Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a Channel. The Enrique Mart\u00ed Coll Linear Park connects the Central Park to Hato Rey through the Ca\u00f1o Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a Nature Reserve.\nLuis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn Park, La Merced Park, Dr. Jos\u00e9 N. G\u00e1ndara Park, Santiago Iglesias Pant\u00edn Park are some of the parks located in Hato Rey. Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn Park is one of the largest in the municipality. It is located in the Gobernador Pi\u00f1ero district between Hato Rey and Puerto Nuevo. The park has gazebos that can be rented for events, green areas for strolls, biking and picnics, an artificial lake with paddleboats for rent ($6), and a number of playgrounds for children. Its main attraction is the cableway that crosses the park and offers scenic views of the Piedras River and the city while providing transportation to the Roberto Clemente Coliseum and the Hiram Bithorn Stadium.\nNature reserves.\nThe municipality of San Juan is home to various important ecosystems and preserved natural areas. Some of the ecosystems of the San Juan Bay National Estuary, which is the only tropical estuary in the National Estuary Program network, are protected by numerous nature reserves and protected areas such as the Ca\u00f1o Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a Nature Reserve. Other areas protected under the San Juan Bay National Estuary include El Condado Lagoon, the San Jos\u00e9 Lagoon and El Boquer\u00f3n where the San Antonio Creek and the Condado Lagoon connect with the Atlantic Ocean.\nTwo of the 20 state forests of Puerto Rico are located in the municipality of San Juan: the New Millennium Urban Forest, which is also part of the San Juan Ecological Corridor, and the San Patricio Urban Forest, a secondary forest located next to a mogote. The Hermanas Sendra and San Juan Park Protected Natural Areas are located inland within the municipality of San Juan in the barrios of Caimito and Cupey.\nCityscape.\nArchitecture.\nThe architecture of San Juan is very diverse, due to its size and all the cultural influences received during its existence. The oldest part of the city, known as Old San Juan, mostly features the influence of Spanish architecture. This part of the city is comprised by a network of \"setted\" roads usually surrounded by colonial, two-storied houses built on masonry. Some colonial structures have been restored and serve either as government offices or museums. Some examples are the Ballaj\u00e1 Barracks, which now serve as museum and headquarters of several cultural organizations; La Fortaleza, which has served as the residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico since the 16th Century; and the Ancient Welfare Asylum, which now houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, among others. Old San Juan also features several public squares, like the Plaza de Armas, located in front of San Juan City Hall; and cathedrals, like the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista. Old San Juan is also notable for being partly enclosed by massive walls and fortifications built by the Spanish government. The colonial Walls of the city of San Juan had five gates. The main was the Puerta de San Juan, today preserved, built in 1635. It also had the Puerta de San Jos\u00e9, the Puerta de Santa Rosa, the Puerta de San Justo and the Puerta de Santiago, the latter built between 1635 and 1641 by Spanish Captain General \u00cd\u00f1igo de la Mota Sarmiento.\nThe architecture is more varied in other districts of the city, and the different Spanish, American and Puerto Rican construction styles that reflect the historic architecture trends are most evident in the districts of Puerta de Tierra, Santurce, Hato Rey and downtown R\u00edo Piedras, with Gothic, Baroque, Art Deco, and Mid-Century Modern being the most popular styles. Many of the buildings that best exemplify these architectural trends in San Juan are also inscribed in the United States National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), such as the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Lourdes Chapel (Gothic Revival, 1907), the Antiguo Casino de Puerto Rico (Beaux-Arts, 1917), the Normandie Hotel (Art Deco, 1942), and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court Building (Modern, 1955). The University of Puerto Rico, R\u00edo Piedras Campus is also home to a rich variety of buildings that showcase the history of Puerto Rican architecture throughout the past 120 years, with buildings designed by notable architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright's student Henry Klumb, Edward H. Bennett, William E. Parsons, and Rafael Carmoega who designed the distinctive clock tower and the university quadrangle, both of which were inscribed in the NRHP in 1984.\nBarrios.\nAs with the other Puerto Rican municipalities, San Juan is administratively divided into \"barrios.\" What is now known as Old San Juan occupied the western end of a rocky islet, the Isleta de San Juan, at the mouth of San Juan Bay. During the 20th century, the main population centers surged well beyond the walls of the old city and onto Puerto Rico's main island and merged with the existing settlements east and south of Old San Juan. Together with Puerta de Tierra, Old San Juan comprises the barrio of San Juan Antiguo.\nWith the annexation of R\u00edo Piedras in 1951, the municipality of San Juan grew to four times its previous size. As a result, the municipality also went from 2 to 18 barrios (barrios), 16 of which fall within the former municipality of R\u00edo Piedras. Eight of the 18 barrios are further subdivided into subbarrios, including the two barrios (San Juan Antiguo and Santurce) that belonged to the original municipality of San Juan.\nThe 18 barrios are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSan Juan Antiguo.\nDuring the Spanish colonial times most of the urban population resided in what is today known as Old San Juan. This sector is located on the western half of a small island called the Isleta de San Juan, which is connected to the mainland by two bridges and a causeway. The small island, which comprises an area of , also hosts the working-class neighborhood of Puerta de Tierra and most of Puerto Rico's central government buildings, including the Commonwealth's Capitol. This is also the largest and most populated \"subbarrio\" of San Juan Antiguo.\nThe main central part of the old city is characterized by narrow streets made of blue cobblestone and picturesque colonial buildings, some of which date back to the 16th and 17th century. Sections of the old city are surrounded by massive walls and several defensive structures and notable forts. These include the 16th-century Fort San Felipe del Morro and the 17th-century Fort San Crist\u00f3bal, both part of San Juan National Historic Site, and the 16th-century El Palacio de Santa Catalina, also known as La Fortaleza, which serves as the governor's mansion.\nOther buildings of interest predating the 18th century are the \"Ayuntamiento or Alcald\u00eda\" (San Juan City Hall), the \"Diputaci\u00f3n Provincial\" and the \"Real Intendencia\" buildings, which house the Puerto Rico Department of State, the Casa Rosa, the San Jos\u00e9 Church (1523) and the adjacent Hotel El Convento, the former house of the Ponce de Le\u00f3n family known as Casa Blanca, the Teatro Tapia, the former Spanish barracks (now Museum of Ballaj\u00e1), \"La Princesa\" (former municipal jail, now headquartering the Puerto Rico Tourism Company), and the Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery, located just outside the city walls. The Cathedral of San Juan Bautista (construction began in the 1520s) is also located in Old San Juan and contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer and settlement founder Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Old San Juan, also known as the \"old city\", is the main cultural tourist attraction in Puerto Rico; its bayside is lined by dock slips for large cruise ships.\nSanturce.\nSanturce is the largest and most populated barrio in the municipality of San Juan, and one of the most densely populated areas of the island (13,257.4 persons per square mile). Santurce, originally named \"San Mateo de Cangrejos\" (Saint Matthew of the Crabs), was a settlement for freed African slaves during the early days of the city. Santurce was a separate town until it was annexed to San Juan in 1863. After Pablo Ubarri Capetillo, a Spanish railroad developer and \"Count of San Jos\u00e9 de Santurce\" under the Spanish colonial period, sought permission to link San Juan with R\u00edo Piedras proper via steam tramway in 1878, the time it took to travel between both points were shortened and thereby stimulated the colonization and growth of the district. At the beginning of the twentieth century an electric trolley was installed, the township was split into three parts, and its main settlement, merged with the city, was renamed using the Spanish spelling of Santurtzi (\"Saint George\" in Basque), Ubarri's birthplace in Vizcaya, Spain. Puerto Rico Museum of Art and other important cultural venues are located in Santurce.\nThis barrio is further divided into subbarrios such as the tourist-oriented neighborhood of Condado, which occupies land that used to be owned by Ubarri Capetillo. Beaches such as nearby Ocean Park, popular with swimmers, surfers and kitesurfers, are found all along the district's Atlantic coastline which is also the locus of numerous hotels. Miramar is mainly a residential area rising south of the Condado Lagoon. It comprises the former \"barrio\" of Miraflores, as well as drained marshland and landfill over which was built San Juan's first airport, the Isla Grande airport, which was renamed Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport in honor of Major Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci (USAF). Miramar now hosts the Puerto Rico Convention Center as well as some of San Juan Harbor's cruise ship piers. In 2005 Miramar was designated an historical district of Puerto Rico.\nR\u00edo Piedras.\nSouth of Santurce is Hato Rey, part of the former municipality of R\u00edo Piedras. Hato Rey was grazing ground for cattle owned by the royal government (hence its name, the \"King's Herd\" in Spanish) as early as the 16th century, and is now considered the financial center of the island. A section of this district is often referred to as \"Milla de Oro\" (actually long) due in part to the many banks and businesses located there.\nIn the southern part of the city is the socially diversified community of R\u00edo Piedras. Founded in the mid-1850s, R\u00edo Piedras was a separate town which hosted sugar cane plantations and the estates of some of San Juan's wealthiest inhabitants (as well as their working-class staff). The Spanish colonial governors also had their summer home there on land which eventually gave way to the main campus of the University of Puerto Rico. In 1951 the municipalities of San Juan and R\u00edo Piedras were merged to redefine San Juan's current city limits. Today R\u00edo Piedras comprises the largest area of the municipality of San Juan. and is home to the \"Plaza del Mercado\" (R\u00edo Piedras Marketplace), the main campus and the Medical Sciences campus of the University of Puerto Rico and the San Juan Botanical Garden.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe municipality of San Juan has a population of 342,259 as of the 2020 US Census, making it the largest in Puerto Rico, and the 57th largest in the United States and its territories. From 1899 to 1950 the municipality of San Juan excluded the township of R\u00edo Piedras. For this reason, population data and land area for the period make reference only to the Antiguo San Juan and Santurce \"barrios\", or subdivisions, of San Juan. The old municipality of R\u00edo Piedras constituted the third most populated city of Puerto Rico at the time of its annexation in 1951. Its strategic location south of the capital served as a junction for all the principal ways of transportation of the island and as a geographical entry to San Juan, which are factors that prompted R\u00edo Piedras's dramatic urban development in the 20th century.\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the racial composition of San Juan was as follows:\nAmong the Hispanic and Latino population, Puerto Ricans are the largest group; they make up 87.5% of San Juan's Hispanic population. People of Dominican descent make up 7.6% of the Hispanic population, while those of Cuban descent form 1.7% of the Hispanic populace. Other Hispanic and Latino groups collectively form 3.2% of San Juan's Hispanic population.\nThere are 4,822 whites and 1,187 blacks of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan. Non-Hispanic whites and blacks form 1.2% and 0.3% of San Juan's population respectively. There are also approximately 673 Asians of non-Hispanic origin in San Juan; they make up less than 0.1% of the population. However, Asians of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin together number at 6,342.\nThe vast majority of Asians in San Juan are of Chinese descent; of the 6,342 Asians, 4,928 are Chinese. Chinese comprise 1.4% of the population. The only other sizable Asian group in San Juan are Indian Americans; there are 698 people of Indian descent in the city, forming 0.2% of the population. There are very small numbers of people of Filipino, Japanese, and Vietnamese ancestry; none of these groups number more than 100 members.\nAccording to the 2006\u20132008 American Community Survey, 87.5% of San Juan's population was native and 12.5% were foreign-born. Of the native population, 86.9% were born in Puerto Rico or the U.S. proper, of which 75.6% were born in Puerto Rico and 8.9% were born in the U.S. The other 0.7% were born in a different U.S. territory or born abroad to American parents. The remaining 11.9% of the population were born outside the United States and U.S. territories.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of Americans not of Hispanic ancestry (both of African American and of White American descent) have moved to San Juan. In addition, a large number of Stateside Puerto Ricans have settled in the city upon their return to Puerto Rico. There is also a growing West Indian population, both of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin.\nSan Juan today is home to the largest Jewish community in Puerto Rico, and one of the largest Jewish communities in the Caribbean, with more than 2,000 people attending two local synagogues in Santurce (the Conservative Shaare Zedeck Synagogue and the Reform Temple Beth Shalom) and an additional synagogue (the Chabad Jewish Center of Puerto Rico) in Isla Verde in neighboring Carolina.\nIn terms of ancestry, 23,875 people claimed American ancestry, which is equivalent to 5.8% of San Juan's population. Other sizable ancestry groups included those of Italian descent, French descent, and West Indian descent. People of Italian descent numbered at 1,694, forming 0.4% of the population; people of French descent numbered at 1,064, forming 0.2% of the population. Finally, those of West Indian descent numbered at 1,393, forming 0.3% of San Juan's population. Approximately 1,026 people claimed Sub-Saharan African ancestry; 719 claimed Irish ancestry; 646 claimed German ancestry; 431 claimed Arab ancestry, and 346 claimed English ancestry. There are many other ancestry groups in San Juan, but they are very scant.\nAs of 2000, speakers of English as a first language accounted for 12.93% of the population.\nEconomy.\nSan Juan experienced significant economic growth following World War II. During this period the city underwent an industrial revolution, although as of 1984 it had never generated its own economic region. The city's economy relies mostly on companies dedicated to the manufacture of several products, including: chemical substances (bleach and house cleaning products); pharmaceuticals; rum and other beverages; fertilizers; electric tools; electronic devices; plastics, textiles, and food-based products.\nTourism is also a key industry, based on San Juan's proximity to Puerto Rico's main airport, the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport.\nThe tourism focus of the city is located in the district of Condado Beach where there are luxurious hotels. Historical locations such as El Morro, Old San Juan and El Cuartel de Ballaja are promoted in tourism campaigns. The district of Hato Rey contains a corporate sector known as Milla de Oro (Golden Mile) which serves as the headquarters of local and international banks. San Juan's Hato Rey district is often referred to as the \"Wall Street of the Caribbean\", due to the influence of the area on Puerto Rico and the Caribbean's economy.\nSan Juan is also home to the Popular, Inc., parent company of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, Popular Bank, E-Loan, and a Fortune 1000 company as of 2022. Other companies based in San Juan include ATH Network, First BanCorp, Liberty Puerto Rico, The Cervantes Group, and Triple-S Management Corporation. Seaborne Airlines is headquartered on the ninth floor of the World Plaza Building in Hato Rey.\nTourism.\nTechnological advances after World War II in the development of the airliner, coupled with the island's climate and natural setting, have transformed San Juan into the springboard for tourism around the island, and has made the rest of the Caribbean known throughout the world during the last fifty years. Today the capital features hotels, museums, historical buildings, restaurants, parks, beaches and shopping centers. San Juan is the most visited city in Puerto Rico domestically and internationally, with approximately 12.2 million passengers arriving by air and 1.8 million cruise passengers arriving by sea in 2023 according to the Puerto Rico Tourism Company and the Puerto Rico Ports Authority.\nOld San Juan is often emphasized in tourism campaigns, promoting the historic nature of its colonial buildings and narrow streets covered by cobblestones, a blue stone cast from furnace slag; they were brought over as ballast on Spanish ships. This includes the city's ancient defensive wall and forts, most notably El Morro and the Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal. On January 23, 1984, both of these edifices together with La Fortaleza and El Ca\u00f1uelo (in nearby Toa Baja) were included as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, catalogued as being part of humanity's cultural patrimony as part of the National Park Service-administered San Juan National Historic Site. The restaurants and art galleries in the zone are visited by tourists and locals alike.\nOutside of Old San Juan, the Puerto Rico Convention Center District (PRCC) includes the Puerto Rico Convention Center, which hosts a number of local and international events throughout the year such as the Puerto Rico Comic Con, the biggest of its kind in the Caribbean. The PRCC District also hosts a number of hotels, nightclubs, shops, cinemas, bars and restaurants, the Coca-Cola Music Hall, and the Toro Verde Eco Adventure Park.\nOther notable tourist attractions in San Juan include the Condado and Ocean Park Beaches, El Escambr\u00f3n and the Fort\u00edn de San Ger\u00f3nimo, La Placita de Santurce, the Luis A. Ferr\u00e9 Performing Arts Center, the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn and Luis Mu\u00f1oz Rivera Parks, Plaza Las Am\u00e9ricas, The Outlets at Montehiedra, Se\u00f1orial Plaza, and The Mall of San Juan, the Museum of Art of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art, the San Juan Wildlife Museum, and the University of Puerto Rico Botanical Garden, among others. The University of Puerto Rico's main campus in R\u00edo Piedras is also of interest with its historic quadrangle and clock tower, its number of theaters and venues which host events such as the Casals Festivals, and a museum. San Juan is also used by tourists as a base to explore other attractions within and outside the San Juan metropolitan area, such as the Bacardi Cathedral of Rum and boardwalk in Cata\u00f1o, the \"Pork Highway\" of Guavate in Cayey, the bioluminiscent bay in Fajardo, the beaches and street food of Pi\u00f1ones in Lo\u00edza, and El Yunque National Forest recreational areas in the municipalities of Luquillo and R\u00edo Grande.\nPost Hurricane Maria.\nAn April 2019 report indicated that, by that time, repairs after Hurricane Maria were moving rapidly. Only a few hotels were still closed in San Juan and that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal. By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce and Arecibo, were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up 10% of Puerto Rico's GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico.\nIn late November 2019, reports indicated that 90 calls to San Juan by Royal Caribbean ships would be cancelled during 2020 and 2021. This step would mean 360,000 fewer visitors, with a loss to the island's economy of $44\u00a0million. As well, 30 ship departures from San Juan were being canceled.\nArts and culture.\nAs the capital and most populous municipality of Puerto Rico, San Juan is a culturally vibrant city influenced by the heterogenous origins of Puerto Rican culture. The city is the birthplace of artists and musicians who have significantly influenced the arts, design, literature, music and pop culture of Puerto Rico. During the 20th century, the musical aspect of the city was influenced by performers including Afro-Caribbean dancer and choreographer Sylvia del Villard and Jos\u00e9 Enrique Pedreira who became a composer of Puerto Rican \"Danzas\". \nInternational musicians such as opera singer Justino D\u00edaz and Grammy Award winners Ram\u00f3n Ayala (Daddy Yankee) and Ricky Martin were born in the city. Other notable residents include writers Giannina Braschi and Tomas Blanco, award-winning actors Raul Julia and Benicio del Toro, and comedian Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot. Teacher Rafael Cordero (1790\u20131868), was influential in the development of Puerto Rican education and began the process of beatification in 2013, if accepted as a saint he will become only the second black saint from the Americas.\nEntertainment and performing arts.\nSan Juan is host to numerous annual festivals and celebrations. The official patronal festival of the city is the summertime Feast of Saint John (\"Fiestas de San Juan\"). The most famous event is the San Sebasti\u00e1n Street Festival (\"Fiestas de la Calle de San Sebasti\u00e1n\"), celebrated yearly during the third weekend of January in Old San Juan. The event, originally a community festival coinciding with the feast day of Saint Sebastian, has become an important part of Puerto Rican popular culture, being unofficially considered to mark the end of the Christmas and holiday season in the island. It is now one of the most popular and largest festivals in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, drawing around 200,000 visitors each year. Other annual festivals and events in San Juan include the Puerto Rico Heineken JazzFest in March, the Casals Festivals in April, Puerto Rico Comic Con in May, San Juan Fashion Week in September, Puerto Rican Music Festival (\"Festival de la M\u00fasica Puertorrique\u00f1a\") in November, the city-wide events and activities of Christmas in San Juan (\"Navidad en San Juan\") in December, and the New Year's Eve celebrations in Distrito T-Mobile.\nThe Luis A. Ferr\u00e9 Performing Arts Center (Spanish: \"Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A. Ferr\u00e9\") hosts some of the most important musical and artistic events in Puerto Rico. It is home to the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra (PRSO) and hosts the Casals Festival, the most important classical music festival in the Caribbean. The venue also hosts theater and musical performances such as Hamilton, which it hosted in 2019. The Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico is a public music conservatory that hosts Puerto Rican and international students has a longstanding relationship with the classical music movement in the island. The and the theater of the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras also host important music events.\nMuseums and visual arts.\nThe city is also the home of contemporary and classic art museums. The Puerto Rico Museum of Art hosts the largest collection of art in Puerto Rico, housing over 1,100 permanent art pieces and displaying temporary exhibitions containing artwork from various locations through Latin America. The Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art, located in Santurce, specializes in contemporary artwork from Latin America and the Caribbean. The paintings displayed in the permanent exhibition are either acquired by the museum's administrative personnel or donated by artists and collectors. They are judged by a panel of painters, art critics, and scholars before being displayed.\nOther museums such as the Pablo Casals Museum, the San Juan Book Museum, the Museum of the Americas, and the National Gallery display historic items and artwork alongside contemporary art. Miscellaneous museums such as the Children's Museum, the San Juan Wildlife Museum, and the Bacardi Distillery (also known as the \"Rum Cathedral\") in nearby Cata\u00f1o appeal to different audiences through interactive exhibitions.\nThe Casa Dra. Concha Melendez Ramirez in Santurce is a National Historic Landmark and museum and research center that showcases the life and work of one of the most important figures in the literary culture of Puerto Rico. Old San Juan is also home to important art museums, such as the Puerto Rico National Gallery, and numerous private art galleries.\nGovernment.\nStructure.\nAs one of Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities, San Juan's government has two branches, the executive and the legislative. Those citizens eligible to vote directly elect the Mayor of San Juan and the municipal assembly for four-year terms. The municipal government is housed in City Hall or \"Casa Alcaldia\", which is located at 153 San Francisco Street, facing the Plaza de Armas at the center of Old San Juan. City Hall was constructed based on Madrid's City Hall starting in 1604 and completed in 1789.\nThe executive branch is headed by a popularly elected mayor. The office is held by Miguel Romero Lugo who won in the 2020 general election, and was reelected in the 2024 general election. Miguel Romero Lugo took over from Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, who was elected at the 2012 general election. Before her, Jorge A. Santini held the position for 12 years.\nIn addition to running the city's day-to-day operations and supervising associated departments, the mayor is responsible for appointing a secretary-auditor and a treasurer. San Juan's Municipal Legislature is made up of 17 municipal legislators, elected at-large, which represent the city's population.\nCoat of arms and flag.\nThe has an official flag and coat of arms.\nOn March 8, 1948, the city government of San Juan officially adopted as the city's first flag an orange field, in the center of which is the coat of arms of the city. The orange color was based and taken from Father Diego de Torres Vargas' text and it reads:\n\"Escudo de armas dado a Puerto Rico por los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos en el a\u00f1o de 1511, siendo Procurador un vecino llamado Pedro Moreno. Son : un cordero blanco con su banderilla colorada, sobre un libro, y todo sobre una isla verde, que es la de Puerto Rico, y por los lados una F y una I, que quiere decir Fernando e Isabel, los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos que se las dieron, y hoy se conservan en el estandarte real, que es de damasco anaranjado, con que se gan\u00f3 la ciudad\".\n(\"Coat of arms given to Puerto Rico by the Catholic Monarchs in the year 1511 being Procurator a \"vecino\" (citizen) named Pedro Moreno. They are a white lamb with a red flag, on top of a book, and everything above a green island, which is Puerto Rico...which is of orange damask, with which the city was won\"). It appears that the color was changed from orange to white at some point.\nTerritorial and federal government.\nSan Juan is the territorial capital of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and it is home to the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Puerto Rican government. San Juan is the seat of the Puerto Rico Senatorial district I, which is represented by two Senators. \nThe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is located in Hato Rey. There are two additional federal offices in the San Juan metropolitan area: the Jose V. Toledo U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Old San Juan and the GSA Federal Center in Guaynabo. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), along with other federal organisms, has also had regional offices at the Federico Degetau Federal Building, also in Hato Rey.\nSafety.\nLaw enforcement in San Juan is the joint responsibility of the Department of Police and Public Safety, also known as the San Juan Police Department and the Puerto Rico Police Department. The Municipal Police, originally known as the \"San Juan Municipal Guard\", was created in 1521 and had active military and law enforcement functions until 1980, when Act #77 created municipal law enforcement agencies in Puerto Rico. It employs over 1,000 sworn officers plus civilian staff.\nCrime.\nIn 2010, there were 201 homicides in San Juan, a rate of around 50 per 100,000 residents. In 2019, there were 172 homicides, a rate of 53 per 100,000 residents. In the 2019 bulletin ranking of the 50 most violent cities in the world, San Juan ranked as the 16th most violent in the world, with a rate of 54.01 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. San Juan ranked as the 3rd most violent in the United States and its territories, after St. Louis and Baltimore.\nMedia.\nNewspapers.\nMost of Puerto Rico's major newspapers are published in San Juan: El Nuevo D\u00eda, Primera Hora, El Vocero and the English-language San Juan Star.

Other colleges located in San Juan are the University of the Sacred Heart, the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, the Ana G. M\u00e9ndez University System's Metropolitan University, the Metropolitan Campus of the Inter American University of Puerto Rico, the Carlos Albizu University, the Evangelic Seminary of Puerto Rico and the Center for Advanced Studies on Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. There are smaller colleges located in the city, including the ICPR Junior College, the \"Instituto de Banca y Comercio\" and the International Junior College, located in Santurce.\nThere are also several technical schools based in San Juan, including the Technological College of San Juan, the \"Liceo de Artes y Ciencias\", Ramirez College of Business and Technology, and the Puerto Rico Technical Junior College. The Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music and the School of Fine Arts in Old San Juan specialize in education that promotes the fine arts and music.\nPublic and private schools.\nAs of the 2022\u201323 school year, there are 83 public schools serving 24,494 students in San Juan, all of which are operated by the Puerto Rico Department of Education. Most of the specialized schools operated by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are located in San Juan. These schools emphasize topics such as Science and Math, Radio and Television, Arts, Trade, Music, and Sports, but also include other subjects such as Spanish, English, and Social Studies in their curriculum.\nIn addition to dozens of state-run elementary, intermediate, and high schools, the government of the city of San Juan operates two bilingual schools, including one sports-magnet school, the first municipal-run schools in Puerto Rico. Several private schools are located in San Juan, including Robinson and St. John's schools in the Condado, Perpetuo Socorro in Miramar, St. John's Episcopal, Santa M\u00f3nica and Academia San Jorge in Santurce, Commonwealth High School, La Merced and Esp\u00edritu Santo in Hato Rey, Escuela Josefita Monserrate de Selles, San Antonio, Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, San Jos\u00e9 in R\u00edo Piedras and Cupeyville, St. Mary's, Boneville and Cupey Maria Montesory School in Cupey.\nTransportation.\nAirports.\nThe San Juan Metropolitan Area is served by two airports:\nThe Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport (SJU), San Juan's primary commercial airport, is located eight miles () from Old San Juan in the neighboring municipality of Carolina. The airport accommodates more than 30 domestic and international airlines and is the busiest airport in the Caribbean. It is often referred to as \"The Gateway to the Caribbean\" because it serves as the main connection to the island and the rest of the Caribbean for the United States and vice versa.\nThe area's secondary airport is the Fernando Ribas Dominicci Airport (SIG), located directly across the San Antonio Channel (\"Ca\u00f1o San Antonio\") from Old San Juan in the Isla Grande district. Dominicci Airport is used mainly by general aviation aircraft, charter flights and some domestic commercial flights. It used to be the city's and also the island of Puerto Rico's main international gateway until the opening of Luis Mu\u00f1oz Marin International Airport. It is now also widely used by the Isla Grande Flight School and Caribbean Flight Center, the only flight school on the island.\nHighways and roads.\nSome of the major highways and roads of San Juan include:\nThere are 193 bridges in San Juan.\nPublic transport.\nAt 4,300 vehicles per paved mile, San Juan has by far the highest density of vehicles on the road of any city in the world. The city is served by five limited-access expressways and highways and numerous arterial avenues and boulevards but continues to suffer from severe traffic congestion.\nThe Metropolitan Bus Authority (\"Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses\" or \"AMA\" in Spanish) provides daily bus transportation to residents of San Juan, Guaynabo, Bayam\u00f3n, Toa Baja, Trujillo Alto, Cata\u00f1o and Carolina through 30 fixed routes. Its fleet consists of 277 regular buses and 35 handicap-accessible buses. AMA's ridership is estimated at 112,000 on weekdays.\nIn an attempt to decrease vehicle dependency and road congestion, the city built a metro system dubbed \"Tren Urbano\" (\"Urban Train\"). The line connects to 16\u00a0stations. The project, which opened in late 2004, cost $2.25\u00a0billion and was more than $1\u00a0billion over budget and four years late. The Tren Urbano has received less ridership than was originally projected and has not significantly reduced the city's automobile traffic, despite a reported 7.5% ridership increase in 2006 over 2005. There is a planned project to build an \"interurban light rail system\" connecting the cities of San Juan and Caguas.\nIncreased investment in public transportation, however, has not changed the fact that San Juan is an automobile-reliant city and its fast growth has sparked urban sprawl. As of mid-2010, the government has approved plans for a redesign of this Puerto Rican city, featuring a new mass transit system, new roads and intersections, and more beach-access points. No cars will be allowed inside the oldest part of city (Old San Juan). The plans hope to remedy previous poor urban planning in the oldest section of the city, the Isleta, while curbing reliance on motor vehicles. The plans for redevelopment also hope to make the city more appealing in order to attract new residents, as San Juan has suffered from a shrinking population over the past 60 years.\nPort.\nThe Port of San Juan is the fourth busiest seaport in the Western Hemisphere, ranked among the top 17 in the world in terms of container movement. It is also the largest home-based cruise port in the world with over a dozen cruise ships. It is the second busiest port in cruise volume after Miami. It is managed by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority.\nAcuaExpreso is a ferry service in the San Juan Bay, consisting of the Cata\u00f1o Ferry (\"Lancha de Cata\u00f1o\") service between downtown Cata\u00f1o and Old San Juan, and the \"AquaExpress\" which connects Old San Juan to Hato Rey and the Tren Urbano.\nHealthcare.\nSan Juan has an elaborate system of triage, hospital, and preventive care health services. The municipal government sponsors regular health fairs in different areas of the city focusing on health care for the elderly and the disabled. There are 20 hospitals in San Juan, half of them operated by the government. The largest hospital in San Juan and most important of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean is the Rio Piedras Medical Center, or Centro Medico de Rio Piedras in Spanish. This hospital, founded in 1956, is operated by the Medical Services Administration of the Department of Health of Puerto Rico. It is made up of eight other hospitals.\nThe city of San Juan operates 10 hospitals. Of these, nine are Diagnostic and Treatment Centers located in communities throughout San Juan. The main hospital is located at Centro Medico. These 10 hospitals are:\nAlso, there are 10 private hospitals in San Juan. These are:\nSports.\nTeams based in San Juan have been notably successful in athletic competition. The Santurce Crabbers won the National Superior Basketball League championship in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2003 during this period being recognized as a dynasty. The San Juan Senators and the Santurce Crabbers were the two major baseball teams in the city, winning the championship of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League a total of 17 times. The Santurce Crabbers are located third among teams with more championships in the Caribbean Series, winning championships in the 1951, 1953, 1955, 1993 and 2000 editions of the tournament. The city has also been the host of events within the sports community; some examples include:\nThe $28\u00a0million San Juan Natatorium attracts island-wide and regional swim meets, as well as winter training by top-rated mainland U.S. colleges and universities, including the United States Military Academy at West Point and the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.\nIn July 2007, the San Juan Golf Academy and its driving range began operating atop the city's former sanitary landfill in Puerto Nuevo, and will eventually include the city's first and only 9-hole golf course.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 Sister cities.\nSan Juan is twinned with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57873", "revid": "51004742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57873", "title": "Wilhelm Canaris", "text": "5th Chief of the Abwehr, Anti-Nazi German Naval Officer (1887\u20131945)\nWilhelm Franz Canaris (1 January 1887\u00a0\u2013 9 April 1945) was a German admiral and the chief of the \"Abwehr\" (the German military-intelligence service) from 1935 to 1944. Initially a supporter of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, Canaris turned against Hitler and committed acts of both passive and active resistance during World War II following the German invasion of Poland in 1939.\nBeing the head of Nazi Germany's military-intelligence agency, he was in a key position to participate in resistance and sabotage the Nazi war effort. As the war turned against Germany, Canaris and other military officers expanded their clandestine opposition to the leadership of Nazi Germany. By 1945, his acts of resistance and sabotage against the Nazi regime came to light and Canaris was hanged in Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp for high treason as the Allied forces advanced through Southern Germany.\nEarly life.\nCanaris was born on 1 January 1887 in Aplerbeck (now a part of Dortmund) in Westphalia, the son of Carl Canaris, a wealthy industrialist, and his wife, Auguste (n\u00e9e Popp). Canaris believed that his family was related to the 19th-century Greek admiral and politician Konstantinos Kanaris, a belief that influenced his decision to join the Imperial German Navy. On a visit to Corfu, he was given a portrait of the Greek hero, which he always kept in his office. However, according to Richard Bassett, a genealogical investigation in 1938 revealed that his family was actually of Northern Italian descent, was originally Canarisi, and had lived in Germany since the 17th century. His grandfather had converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism.\nCanaris graduated from the Steinbart-Real High School in Duisburg. From an early age, he aspired to be an officer in the Imperial Navy, but his father encouraged him to join the Imperial Army. The death of Carl Canaris in 1904 removed the only obstacle to Canaris pursuing a naval career, which he did a month after his March 1905 graduation. Accepted at the naval academy in Kiel, Canaris began his naval education aboard , a training ship on which sea cadets learned basic seamanship. He attained midshipman's rank in 1906, and beginning in April 1907 attended the academic course required of aspiring naval officers. In the autumn of 1908 he began service aboard , which cruised the Atlantic near Central and South America. In February 1909, Canaris received Venezuela's Order of the Liberator (Knight's Class) from President Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez. The circumstances are not known, but may have included Canaris facilitating discussions between representatives of the German government and then-Vice President G\u00f3mez in early 1908.\nIn August 1910, he received his commission as a lieutenant.\nWorld War I.\nBy the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Canaris was serving as a naval intelligence officer on board , a light cruiser to which he had been assigned in December 1911. This was the only warship of Admiral Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron that managed to evade the Royal Navy for a prolonged period during the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914.\nAfter the Battle of M\u00e1s a Tierra, the immobilized \"Dresden\" anchored in Cumberland Bay, Robinson Crusoe Island and contacted Chile with regard to internment. While in the bay, Royal Navy ships approached and shelled \"Dresden\", and the crew scuttled the ship. Most of the crew was interned in Chile in March 1915, but in August 1915, Canaris escaped under the name \"Reed Rosas\" by using his fluency in Spanish. With the help of some German merchants he was able to return to Germany in October 1915. On the way, he called at several ports, including Plymouth in Great Britain.\nCanaris was then given intelligence work as a result of having come to the attention of German naval intelligence, possibly because of his clever escape from Chile. German plans to establish intelligence operations in the Mediterranean were under way and Canaris seemed a good fit for that role. Eventually, he was sent to Spain, where, in Madrid, his task was to provide clandestine reconnaissance over enemy shipping movements and to establish a supply service for U-boats serving in the Mediterranean. After being assigned to the Inspectorate of Submarines by the Naval Staff on 24 October 1916, he took up training for duty as a U-boat commander and graduated from Submarine School on 11 September 1917.\nHe ended the war as a U-boat commander from late 1917 in the Mediterranean and was credited with a number of sinkings and even came to the attention of the Kaiser. As a result of his exploits in Spain, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class.\nCanaris was fluent in six languages, including English. As a naval officer of the old school, he had a great respect for Britain's Royal Navy, despite the rivalry between the two nations.\nInterwar years.\nDuring the German Revolution of 1918\u201319, Canaris helped organise the formation of \"Freikorps\" paramilitary units to suppress the communist revolutionary movements, whose members were attempting to spread the ideals of the Russian Revolution into Germany. Canaris was also a member of the military court that tried and in many cases acquitted those involved in the murders of the leftist revolutionaries Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg for their involvement in the Spartacist uprising. He helped one of those convicted in the murders, Kurt Vogel, escape from prison and although Canaris was imprisoned for four days over this, he was never prosecuted. Despite these actions, Canaris was eventually appointed to the adjutancy of Defence Minister Gustav Noske.\nIn 1919, he married Erika Waag, the child of an industrialist, with whom he had two children.\nOn 20 July 1920, Canaris became admiral's staff officer at the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Naval Station) command. \nIn the spring of 1924, Canaris was sent to Osaka, Japan, to supervise a secret U-boat construction program in direct violation of the Treaty of Versailles. When that project was shelved by Vice Admiral Adolf Zenker in favour of a more co-operative relationship with the British, Canaris began making deals. Aided by Captain Walter Lohmann, the son of a powerful German shipping magnate, they negotiated with Spanish merchants, German industrialists, some Argentinian venture capitalists and the Spanish Navy so the Germans could continue their clandestine naval activities. Canaris made some enemies within Germany during the course of his secret business and intelligence negotiations, partially as a consequence of the bankruptcy incurred by the film-maker Phoebus Film in his dealings with Lohmann (the 'Lohmann Affair'). Suddenly, the former involvement with the \"Liebknecht affair\" re-emerged and placed Canaris in an unfavourable light, which ended up costing him his position in Spain. Instead, he was sent to Wilhelmshaven. From his new post, Canaris haplessly discovered that Lohmann's \"investments\" had cost upwards of 26 million marks in total losses. \nAt some point in 1928, Canaris was removed from his intelligence post and began two years of conventional naval service aboard the pre-Dreadnought battleship and became captain of the vessel on 1 December 1932. Just two months later, Adolf Hitler became Germany's new chancellor. Canaris was enthused by that development and was known to give lectures about the virtues of Nazism to his crew aboard the \"Schlesien\".\nDetached from the previous government of Weimar, whose republican principles never appealed to Canaris, he looked to the Nazi Party to shape the future. Two things stood out for Canaris about the Nazis; they represented a return to state-centered authoritarian government led by a charismatic leader, which he supported, and they were determined to throw off the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler proselytised a return to world-power status, which for Canaris implied constructing a super-fleet, by the preservation of a virtuous soldier-based society, a \"community under arms\". It is worth recalling that in the turmoil after the First World War in Germany, while the Weimar government was fledgling, Canaris helped establish home guard units in contravention of the treaty, sympathised with the \"Freikorps\" movement and participated in the Kapp Putsch.\nAnother aspect of the Nazis that attracted Canaris was their anticommunism. Many of his friends joined the Nazi crusade, and Canaris \"likewise came to be regarded as an enthusiastic National Socialist\". A former SS general, Werner Best, once described Canaris as an \"inveterate nationalist\" and correspondingly asserted that Canaris felt the Nazis were much better \"than anything that had gone before\". Even after the Night of the Long Knives, Canaris \"preached wholehearted cooperation with the new regime\". Canaris once said, \"we officers... should always recognize that without the F\u00fchrer and his NSDAP, the restoration of German military greatness and military strength would not have been possible... the officer's duty is to be a living example of National Socialism and make the German Wehrmacht (Army) reflect the fulfillment of National Socialist ideology. That must be our grand design\".\nTaking a position as the fortress commander at Swinem\u00fcnde on 29 September 1934, Canaris seemed to be near the end of his career as he settled into a sort of \"provincial exile\" with his family. Then, in short order, Canaris caught wind of the dispute in the Reichswehr Ministry over the impending successor to the \"Abwehr\" chief Captain Conrad Patzig, who was forced to resign. Patzig recommended Canaris as his replacement because of his outstanding service record and because he considered him best suited for the position from his previous experience in intelligence operations. His aspirations were quickly being realized, and in his zeal for his new job, Canaris paid \"little heed\" to the warnings from Patzig about the \"fiendish\" machinations of the party and its police organs. The admonitions principally concerned Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the SS intelligence service known as the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD) who was not well-disposed towards the \"Abwehr\" since he believed that Germany's defeat during the First World War was attributable to military intelligence failures by the organization. Moreover, Heydrich had aspirations to oversee all aspects of political intelligence-gathering for Germany.\nOn 1 January 1935, a little less than two years after Hitler had taken control of the German government, Canaris was made head of the \"Abwehr\", Germany's official military intelligence agency. Records suggest that Canaris was approved in his role as \"Abwehr\" chief as a compromise candidate since the commander-in-chief of the German Navy, Admiral Erich Raeder, a staunch navy man, was initially opposed to his appointment but caved when Patzig manipulated the situation by suggesting an army officer for the post if Canaris was rejected.\nWith the seemingly-amicable relationship between Heydrich and Canaris that then existed, according to former \"Abwehr\" Secretary Inge Haag, it is possible that Heydrich supported the installment of Canaris as head of the \"Abwehr\" at least based on their behaviour toward each other. The two remained \"friendly\" rivals, but Canaris considered Heydrich a \"brutal fanatic\" and was likewise aware that Heydrich's SD constantly monitored the telephone traffic of the \"Abwehr\". Heydrich was suspicious of Canaris, referred to him as a \"wily old fox\", and cautioned his colleagues never to underestimate the man.\nJust a few weeks into his role as head of the \"Abwehr\", Canaris met with Heydrich and some of his officials to parcel out intelligence operations between the \"Abwehr\", Gestapo, and SD. It is clear from sources that Canaris was then a true devotee to Hitler according to a former Gestapo officer, Gerhard Fischer, who claimed that the F\u00fchrer's gentlemanly relationship with Canaris converted the latter into \"an extreme exponent of Hitlerism.\"\nIn May 1935, Canaris first donned the uniform of a rear admiral, a promotion that coincided with his responsibility for shielding Germany's burgeoning rearmament program from enemy counterintelligence agents, which meant a significant expansion of the \"Abwehr\". The enlargement of the \"Abwehr\" mission brought Canaris into contact with \"counterespionage virtuoso\" Major Rudolf Bamler, who assisted him in establishing an extensive surveillance web over munitions factories, seaports, the armed forces and the media. Between 1935 and 1937, Canaris expanded the \"Abwehr\" staff from a mere 150 people to nearly 1,000. He met Heydrich again on 21 December 1936, and the two men signed a document, which came to be known in their orbit as the \"Ten Commandments\". The agreement clarified the respective areas of counterespionage responsibilities between the Gestapo and the \"Abwehr\".\nAccording to the biographer Heinz H\u00f6hne, Canaris subscribed to most of Hitler's views since Hitler's nationalism, his social-Darwinist beliefs, his opposition to the Versailles Treaty, his belief in rebuilding a Greater German Reich, and his anti-Semitic ideology appealed to the \"Abwehr\" chief. Prompted by anti-Semitism, Canaris first suggested the use of the Star of David to identify Jews in 1935 to 1936, which was later used to set them apart from German citizens within the Reich, and eventually heralded their isolation, presaged their compulsory resettlement, and ultimately led to their physical annihilation.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939), Germany signed an international agreement to embargo arms to the warring factions, the Nationalists, led by Francisco Franco, and the Republicans. In fact, Germany provided aid to Franco's side, with Canaris using his contacts at England's Vickers armaments manufacturing company to help supply the Nationalists with weapons.\nOne month before Hitler's annexation of Austria, known as the Anschluss, Canaris put the \"Abwehr\" into action and personally oversaw deception operations, which were designed to give the Austrians the impression of what appeared to be substantial German military preparations for an impending act of aggression. However, the sham action did not move Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, who was forced to resign when German troops marched into Austria, which was followed by its official annexation into Greater Germany (\"Grossdeutschland\") on 13 March 1938.\nAt that development, however, Canaris began spending more and more time in the company of Hans Oster and also began formulating ways to forestall or prevent a European war. Among the first to arrive in Vienna, Canaris had a special team seize records from the Austrian archives since he feared possible references to his Spanish Civil War arms supplier connections in London. He also absorbed as much of the Austrian intelligence service as he could into the \"Abwehr\" while he avoided those who were already Nazi converts.\nCanaris was disturbed by Hitler's intention to absorb Czechoslovakia as were others, who feared another European war. That resulted in the formation of a conspiratorial group consisting of members of the German Foreign Office and ranking members of the military. The assemblage included General Ludwig Beck, the Foreign Office's state secretary Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker, General Erwin von Witzleben and Admiral Canaris.\nMunich Agreement and intrigue.\nCanaris and his associates were not necessarily committed to the overthrow of Hitler's regime, but they were loosely allied to another more radical group: the \"anti-Nazi\" faction, led by Colonel Hans Oster and Hans Bernd Gisevius, which wanted to use the crisis as an excuse for executing a \"putsch\" to overthrow the Nazi regime. The most audacious plan contemplated by Canaris, in collaboration with Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, was to capture and to unseat Hitler and the entire Nazi Party before the invasion of Czechoslovakia. At that particular moment, Kleist visited Britain secretly and discussed the situation with British MI6 and some high-ranking politicians.\nThe high-ranking German military leaders believed that if Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia or any other country, Britain would declare war on Germany. MI6 was of the same opinion. The British declaration of war would have given the General Staff, it thought, both the pretext and the support for an overthrow of Hitler, which many of them were planning because of the prevailing \"anti-war sentiment of the German people\".\nThe reaction of the British government to Hitler's demands on the Sudetenland was more cautious. At a meeting with Hitler in Munich, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister \u00c9douard Daladier chose diplomacy over war. The Munich Agreement was thus a severe disappointment for Kleist and Canaris. It gave Hitler's reputation an important boost and his popularity soared, as he appeared to have brought peace. However, Hitler was scornful of his generals for resisting his plans since he had wanted war. Hermann G\u00f6ring fell out of favour with him for negotiating peace, but Hitler's drive for war remained unabated although the Western powers had granted him concessions. Canaris was relieved that war was averted and sought to re-establish contact with Hitler since many of the \"Abwehr\" reports submitted on the Sudeten crisis had proven to be grossly inaccurate. To Hans Oster and his circle, Canaris suddenly appeared recommitted to Hitler.\nDutch War Scare.\nIn January 1939, Canaris manufactured the \"Dutch War Scare\", which gripped the British government. By 23 January 1939, the British government received information that Germany intended to invade the Netherlands in February 1939 with the aim of using Dutch airfields to launch a strategic bombing offensive intended to achieve a \"knock-out\" blow against Britain by razing British cities to the ground. All of that information was false but was intended by Canaris to achieve a change in British foreign policy. Canaris was successful, and the \"Dutch War Scare\" played a major role in causing Chamberlain to make the \"continental commitment\" by pledging in February 1939 to send a British ground force to the defence of France in the event of war.\nUnited States.\nIn 1937, Canaris created a new office of air intelligence in the \"Abwehr\" and assigned \"Hauptmann\" Nikolaus Ritter of the Luftwaffe to be the chief of I. Luft (Chief of Air Intelligence). Ritter, who had lived in the United States for twelve years, was given primary authority over \"Abwehr\" agents operating in the Americas and Britain. Canaris instructed Ritter to contact and reactivate a former German Naval Intelligence spymaster living in New York City whom Canaris knew from the First World War, Fritz Joubert Duquesne. Duquesne was an Afrikaner who had escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in the British Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda during the Second Boer War and had been falsely credited for the death of British Army Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener in the sinking of during the First World War). Back in 1931, Ritter had met Duquesne in New York, and both spies reconnected in New York on 3 December 1937. Ritter also met with Herman W. Lang, a spy who operated under the code name PAUL.\nHerman Lang worked as a machinist, draftsman and assembly inspector for the Carl L. Norden Company in New York, which had been contracted to manufacture an advanced top-secret military bomber part, the Norden bomb-sight. He provided the \"Abwehr\" a large drawing of the bomb-sight and later went to Germany to work on and finish an improved version. In Germany, Lang debriefed with both Canaris and G\u00f6ring. Ritter employed several other successful agents across the United States, but he also made the mistake of recruiting a man who would later become a double agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), William Sebold. On 8 February 1940, Ritter sent Sebold to New York under the alias of Harry Sawyer and instructed him to set up a shortwave radio-transmitting station to establish contact with the German shortwave station abroad. Sebold was also instructed to use the codename TRAMP and to contact a fellow agent, codenamed DUNN, Fritz Duquesne.\nOn 28 June 1941, after a two-year investigation, the FBI arrested Duquesne and 32 other Nazi spies on charges of relaying secret information on US weaponry and shipping movements to Germany. On 2 January 1942, less than a month after the US was attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor and Germany had declared war on the United States, the 33 members of the Duquesne Spy Ring were sentenced to serve a total of more than 300 years in prison. They were found guilty in what historian Peter Duffy said in 2014 is \"still to this day the largest espionage case in the history of the United States\".\nOne German spymaster later commented that the ring's roundup delivered \"the death blow\" to their espionage efforts in the United States. J. Edgar Hoover called his FBI swoop on Duquesne's ring the greatest spy roundup in US history. In a 1942 memo to his superiors, Canaris reported on the importance of several of his captured spies by noting their valued contributions, and he wrote that Duquesne had \"delivered valuable reports and important technical material in the original, including U.S. gas masks, radio-controlled apparatus, leak proof fuel tanks, television instruments, small bombs for airplanes versus airplanes, air separator, and propeller-driving mechanisms. Items delivered were labeled 'valuable', and several 'good' and 'very good'\".\nSecond World War.\nAfter the outbreak of war between Germany and Poland in September 1939, Canaris visited the front, where he saw the devastation rendered by the German military. Seeing Warsaw in flames nearly brought him to tears and it was reported that he exclaimed, \"our children's children will have to bear the blame for this\". He also witnessed examples of the war crimes committed by the \"Einsatzgruppen\" of the SS, including the burning of the synagogue in B\u0119dzin with 200 Polish Jews inside. Moreover, he received reports from \"Abwehr\" agents about several incidents of mass murder throughout Poland. Canaris visited Hitler's headquarters train on 12 September 1939, then in the Province of Silesia, to register his objection to the atrocities. Canaris told chief of the \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\" (OKW, Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) Wilhelm Keitel about the \"extensive shootings... and that the nobility and clergy were to be exterminated\" to which Keitel informed him that Hitler had already \"decided\" the matter. Keitel warned Canaris to go no further with his protest, as the detailed plan of atrocities came directly from Hitler.\nCanaris began working more actively to overthrow Hitler's regime but he co-operated with the SD to create a decoy. That made it possible for him to pose as a trusted man for some time. He was promoted to the rank of full admiral in January 1940. With his subordinate Erwin Lahousen, he attempted in the autumn of 1940 to form a circle of like-minded Wehrmacht officers, but that had little success at the time. When the OKW decrees regarding the brutal treatment of Soviet prisoners of war related to the Commissar Order came to the attention of Canaris in mid-September 1941, he registered another complaint. Keitel reminded Canaris that he was thinking in terms of \"chivalrous war\", which did not apply, since it was \"a matter of destroying a world ideology\".\nMeanwhile, the complaints and Canaris's apparent squeamishness were noted by Heydrich and added to his file on the \"political unreliability\" of the \"Abwehr\". Canaris also worked to thwart the proposed Operation Felix, the German plan to seize Gibraltar.\nAt a conference of senior officers in Berlin, in December 1941, Canaris is quoted as saying that \"the \"Abwehr\" has nothing to do with the persecution of Jews... no concern of ours, we hold ourselves aloof from it\".\nCanaris had a sexual relationship with a Polish spy based in Switzerland, Halina Szymanska, who passed information from him to the Polish government-in-exile based in London and also put her at the disposal of the British and Americans, including Allen Dulles. A key piece of intelligence that passed from Canaris via Szymanska to the Allies was advance warning of the launch of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union.\nThe head of MI6, Stewart Menzies, who shared Canaris' anticommunism, praised Canaris' courage and bravery at the end of the war. In December 1940, Hitler sent Canaris to Spain to conclude an agreement, through strong coercion if necessary, with Franco for Spanish support in the war against the Allies, but instead of prompting him to acquiesce to Hitler's desire, Canaris reported that Franco would not commit Spanish forces until Britain had been defeated. Conversations from the period between Franco and Canaris remain unknown, since none were recorded, but the Spanish government expressed gratitude to Canaris's widow by paying her a pension. Franco remained \"forever grateful\" to Canaris for his advice to keep Spain out of the war.\nIn June 1942, Canaris sent eight \"Abwehr\" agents to the East Coast of the United States as part of Operation Pastorius. The mission was to sabotage American economic targets and demoralise the US civilian population. However, two weeks later, all were arrested by the FBI thanks to two \"Abwehr\" agents who betrayed the mission. Because the \"Abwehr\" agents were arrested in civilian clothes, they were subject to court martial by a military tribunal in Washington, DC. All were found guilty and sentenced to death. Two others who co-operated with the FBI received sentences of life imprisonment instead. The others were executed by the electric chair in the District of Columbia jail. Because of the embarrassing failure of Operation Pastorius, there were no further sabotage attempts in the United States.\nAfter 1942, Canaris visited Spain frequently and was probably in contact with British agents from Gibraltar. In 1943, in occupied France, Canaris is said to have made contact with British agents. In Paris, he was conducted blindfolded to the Convent of the Nuns of the Passion of Our Blessed Lord, 127 Rue de la Sant\u00e9, where he met the local head of the British Intelligence Services, codenamed \"Jade Amicol\", who was in reality Colonel Ollivier. Canaris wanted to know the terms for peace if Germany got rid of Hitler. Churchill's reply, sent to him two weeks later, was simple: \"Unconditional surrender\".\nSS General Heydrich was suspicious of the \"Abwehr\". Not long after Heydrich was posted in Prague, he requested that Canaris place the \"Abwehr\" under SD and SS control, which pitted the two men against one another over jurisdictional control. Canaris handled the situation diplomatically, with no immediate effect on the \"Abwehr\", but it did mean a greater degree of collaboration and SS control in Prague. Despite the two men experiencing professional differences, Canaris seems to have maintained a personal relationship with Heydrich and was \"deeply shaken\" by the latter's assassination a few weeks after their administrative disagreements.\nPlaying both sides, Canaris established two more links with Britain's MI6, one via Z\u00fcrich and the other via Spain and Gibraltar. Vatican contacts may have also provided a third route to his British counterparts. Canaris also intervened to save a number of victims from Nazi persecution, including Jews, by getting them out of harm's way. He was instrumental, for example, in getting 500 Dutch Jews to safety in May 1941. Many such people were given token training as \"Abwehr\" \"agents\" and then issued papers, which allowed them to leave Germany. One notable person he is said to have assisted was the then Lubavitcher Rebbe in Warsaw, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn. That has led Chabad Lubavitch to campaign for his recognition as a Righteous Gentile by the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\nDownfall and execution.\nThe evidence that Canaris was playing a double game grew, and at the insistence of Heinrich Himmler, Hitler dismissed Canaris and abolished the in February 1944. Its functions were taken over by the , part of the Reich Security Main Office and led by SS- Walter Schellenberg. Previous areas that had been the responsibility of the were divided between Gestapo chief Heinrich M\u00fcller and Schellenberg. Some weeks later, Canaris was put under house arrest. He was released in June 1944 to take up a post in Berlin as the head of the Special Staff for Mercantile Warfare and Economic Combat Measures (HWK), which co-ordinated the resistance to the Allied economic blockade of Germany.\nCanaris was arrested on 23 July 1944 on the basis of the interrogation of his successor at Military Intelligence, Georg Hansen. Schellenberg respected Canaris and was convinced of his loyalty to the Nazi regime even though he had been arrested. Hansen admitted his role in the 20 July plot but accused Canaris of being its \"spiritual instigator\". No direct evidence of his involvement in the plot was discovered, but his close association with many of the plotters and certain documents written by him that were considered subversive led to the gradual assumption of his guilt. Two of the men under suspicion as conspirators who were known in Canaris's circle shot themselves, which incited activity from the Gestapo to prove he was at the very least privy to the plan against Hitler.\nInvestigations dragged on inconclusively until April 1945, when orders were received to dispose of the various remaining prisoners of the plot. Canaris's personal diary was discovered and presented to Hitler in early April 1945, which implicated him in the conspiracy. Canaris was placed on trial by an SS summary court, presided over by Otto Thorbeck with Walter Huppenkothen as prosecutor. He was charged with treason, convicted, and sentenced to death. Together with his deputy general, Hans Oster, the military jurist General Karl Sack, the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and military officer Ludwig Gehre, Canaris was humiliated before witnesses. He was led to the gallows naked and executed on 9 April at the Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp, just weeks before the end of the European war. According to J\u00fcrgen Stroop (SS-Gruppenf\u00fchrer), Canaris was hanged on a butcher's hook, a method deriving from medieval times.\nA prisoner claimed to have heard Canaris tap out a coded message on the wall of his cell on the night before his execution in which he denied he was a traitor and said that he had acted out of duty to his country.\nErwin von Lahousen and Hans Bernd Gisevius, two of Canaris's main subordinates, survived the war and testified during the Nuremberg trials about Canaris's courage in opposing Hitler. Lahousen recalled a conversation between Canaris and General Wilhelm Keitel in which Canaris warned Keitel that the German military would be held responsible for the atrocities in Poland.

{"id": "57874", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57874", "title": "Pago Pago, American Samoa", "text": "Capital city of American Samoa\nPago Pago ( or ; Samoan: ) is the capital of American Samoa. It is in Maoputasi County on Tutuila, the main island of American Samoa.\nPago Pago is home to one of the deepest natural harbors in the South Pacific Ocean, sheltered from wind and rough seas, and strategically located. The harbor is also one of the best protected in the South Pacific, which gives American Samoa a natural advantage because it makes landing fish for processing easier. Tourism, entertainment, food, and tuna canning are its main industries. As of 1993, Pago Pago was the world's fourth-largest tuna processor. In 2009, the total value of fish landed in Pago Pago\u2014about $200,000,000 annually\u2014is higher than in any other port in any U.S. state or territory. It is home to the largest tuna cannery in the world.\nPago Pago is the main port of American Samoa. It is also home to the territorial government. The Greater Pago Pago Metropolitan Area encompasses some six villages strung together along Pago Pago Harbor. One of the villages is itself named Pago Pago, and in 2020, that village had a population of 3,000. The constituent villages are: Utulei, Fagatogo, Malaloa, Pago Pago, Satala and Atu'u. Fagatogo is the downtown area, referred to as \"town\", and is home to the territory's bicameral legislature (the Fono), police department, the Port of Pago Pago, and many shops and hotels. The executive government's seat, Government House, is in Utulei. \nIn 2000, the Greater Pago Pago area was home to 8,000 residents; by 2010 the population had increased to 15,000.\nRainmaker Mountain (Mount Pioa), located near Pago Pago, contributes to a weather pattern that results in the city having the highest annual rainfall of any harbor in the world. It stands protectively over the eastern side of Pago Pago, making the harbor one of the most sheltered deepwater anchorages in the Pacific Ocean.\nHistorically, the strategic location of Pago Pago Bay played a direct role in the political separation of Western and Eastern Samoa. The initial reason that the U.S. was interested in Tutuila was its desire to use Pago Pago Harbor as a coaling station. The town has the distinction of being the southernmost U.S. capital, and the only one located in the Southern Hemisphere.\nEtymology and pronunciation.\nThe origin of the name \"Pago Pago\" is uncertain. One hypothesis suggests that it is derived from the Samoan language, where it is interpreted to mean \"place of prayer.\"\nThe letter \"g\" in Samoan sounds like \"ng\"; thus Pago Pago is pronounced \"pahngo pahngo.\"\nAn early name for Pago Pago was Long Bay (Samoan: O le Fagaloa), which was a name used by the first permanent inhabitants to settle in the Pago Pago area. It was also called O le Maputasi (\"The Single Chief's House\") in compliment to the Mauga, who lived at Gagamoe in Pago Pago and was the senior to all the other chiefs in the area.\nFor a brief period in the 1830s, Pago Pago was also known as Cuthbert's Harbor, named after British Captain Cuthbert, who was the first European to enter Pago Pago Harbor.\nHistory.\nPago Pago was first settled 4,000 years ago. The area was initially settled by Polynesian navigators, who established a vibrant community rooted in agriculture, fishing, and the distinct cultural practices of Samoan society. There is archeological evidence of people living in the Pago Pago Valley at least 1500\u20131300 years ago. The ancient people of Tutuila produced clay pottery known as Samoan Plainware. The majority of these open bowls had plain designs and featured rounded bases. Such pottery has been retrieved from sites in Pago Pago, including at Vaipito. The production of such pottery ceased approximately 1500 years ago. A site in the Vaipito Valley has also revealed more substantial elements, such as constructions made from rocks, like house foundations and terraces (lau mafola).\nCeramic findings have been retrieved at Vaipito, an inland area within Pago Pago village. A deposit here is thought to be an old hill-slope below a living area where people threw away their waste. Numerous large ceramic pieces have been retrieved here. The layer with the ceramics dates back to the time between 350 BCE and 10 CE. Another site, Fo\u2019isia, is located approximately 100 meters from Vaipito, at the same elevation inland in Pago Pago. During sewer line construction, the American Samoa Power Authority noticed many broken pieces of clay pottery. Five dates associated with the ceramics indicate a time range between 370 BCE and 130 CE.\nTongan rule.\nThe island of Tutuila was part of the Tu\u02bbi Tonga Empire from the invasion around 950 CE to when Tongans were expelled in 1250. According to Samoan folklore, a warrior from Pago Pago, Fua\u2019au, is associated with driving the Tongans out of Tutuila. According to the legend, Fua\u2019au's fianc\u00e9, Tauoloasi\u2019i, was kidnapped and taken to Tonga while sleeping on an exquisite mat known as Moeilefuefue. Filled with anger at the loss of his fianc\u00e9 and the renowned mat, Fua\u2019au rallied the Tutuilans, encouraging them to revolt against the Tongan rule imposed by Lautivunia.\nDuring the period of Tongan rule, political opponents and defeated Samoan warriors were exiled to Pago Pago. The surrounding settlements effectively functioned as a Samoan penal colony. In response to the oppression, the Samoans, under the leadership of paramount chief Malietoa, eventually revolted against their Tongan rulers. According to one source, it was Chief Fua\u2019autoa of Pago Pago who successfully expelled the Tongans from Pago Pago.\nOld Pago Pago.\nUntil 1722, Pago Pago, like several other villages in American Samoa such as Fagas\u0101 and Vatia, existed as a ridge-top settlement. This upland community, now part of the National Park of American Samoa, was strategically situated to provide safety during a period marked by inter-island conflicts involving Samoa, Fiji, Tahiti, and Tonga. The elevated location offered protection from coastal raids, as attackers arriving by boat posed a significant threat to shoreline settlements. By 1772, the majority of families had relocated from the highlands to the coast, establishing new homes near the shoreline. However, oral histories indicate that a few households continued to reside or farm in the upland areas into the late 19th century. Archeological findings at the site of Old Pago Pago include ancient rock walls, building foundations, and graves. Some of these graves are believed to belong to chiefs or ceremonial figures, such as a \"taupou\" (a ceremonial maiden), with legends suggesting one may have been interred in a bonito boat. The remnants of Old Pago Pago are accessible via the Mount \u2018Alava Trailhead at Fagas\u0101 Pass, just west of Vaipito Valley.\nWhen Westerners first visited Tutuila, the Mauga was the leading matai (chief) of Pago Pago.\n19th century.\nIn 1791, Captain Edward Edwards, leading the British warship HMS \"Pandora\" in the pursuit of the \"Bounty\" mutineers, arrived at Pago Pago Harbor. During their search, the crew stumbled upon a French military uniform belonging to one of P\u00e9rouse\u2019s men, who had been killed at A\u02bbasu in 1787.\nIn 1824, Otto von Kotzebue is believed to have discovered the entrance to Pago Pago Harbor, according to one source.\nIn 1830, a man named Norval \"Salemi\" from Massachusetts, lived in Pago Pago as part of High Chief Mauga\u2019s household. Driven by a desire to share his faith, he translated portions of the Church of England Prayer Book into Samoan language and counted the Mauga of Pago Pago among his converts.\nIn 1836, the English whaler \"Elizabeth\", captained by Cuthbert, became the first European vessel to enter Pago Pago Harbor. Captain Cuthbert is credited with \u2018discovering\u2019 Pago Pago and naming it Cuthbert Harbor.\nIn the 1830s, two missionaries were assigned to Tutuila Island: Reverend Archibald W. Murray and his wife to Pago Pago and Reverend Barnden to Leone. They landed at Fagasa Bay and hiked over the hill to the High Chief Mauga in Pago Pago. Mauga welcomed the missionaries and gave them support. RMS later moved to Pago Pago, becoming the second ship to enter Pago Pago Harbor. Under the auspices of Maunga, Murray established a wooden residence in Pago Pago, where he endeavored to exemplify Christian living.\nIn 1834, Matthew Hunkin arrived in Pago Pago and served as a companion to Archibald Murray, both residing under the patronage of High Chief Mauga. Together, they conducted visits to villages situated along the eastern end of Tutuila. Subsequently, both men relocated to Leone, where Murray undertook preparations to establish the Mission Institute for Pacific Islanders at Fagatele, situated on the outskirts of Leone.\nBeginning in 1836, whaling vessels started calling at Pago Pago Harbor, quickly transforming it into a favored stopover. Crews found it to be a secure place to rest, take on supplies, and carry out repairs. As of 1866, whalers no longer visited the Samoan Islands as whaling activities had shifted farther north.\nIn 1837, Tutuila\u2019s chiefs and Captain Charles Bethune of H.M.S. \"Conway\" reached an agreement on Pago Pago\u2019s first documented commercial port regulations, finalized on December 27 of that year.\nOn May 9, 1838, the London Missionary Society established a church in Pago Pago.\nIn 1839, the Samoan Islands experienced its first recorded epidemic, which resulted in the death of High Chief Mauga of Pago Pago. After his passing, Manuma assumed the title. After the death of his stepbrother Pomale, Manuma provoked controversy within the Christian community by eloping with Pomale's widow. As a result, the \"aiga\" deposed him from his position. Nevertheless, Manuma was later reinstated, and he presided as the Mauga of Pago Pago until his death in 1849.\nAs early as 1839, American interest was generated for the Pago Pago area when Commander Charles Wilkes, head of the United States Exploring Expedition, surveyed Pago Pago Harbor and the island. Wilkes' favorable report attracted so much interest that the U.S. Navy began planning a move to the Pago Pago area. During his time in Pago Pago, Wilkes negotiated a set of \"Commercial Regulations\" with the matais of Pago Pago under the leadership of Paramount Ali'i Mauga. Wilkes' treaty was never ratified, but captains and Samoan leaders operated by it. Rumors of possible annexation by Britain or Germany were taken seriously by the U.S., and the U.S. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish sent Colonel Albert Steinberger to negotiate with Samoan chiefs on behalf of American interests. American interest in Pago Pago was also a result of Tutuila's central position in one of the world's richest whaling grounds.\nOn August 8, 1844, Archibald Wright Murray wrote a letter recounting how the Tutuilans, at one point, prepared to vacate their settlements and negotiate with the French while taking refuge in the highlands. Recognizing Pago Pago Harbor as the island\u2019s most significant lure for European powers, they planned to cede it to France in return for a pledge safeguarding Tutuila\u2019s independence.\nIn 1868 the Polynesian Land Company - the first major American enterprise in the Samoan Islands - was founded to speculate in real estate. Company agent James Stewart championed Pago Pago as the South Pacific\u2019s best harbor and an ideal commercial depot, urged local chiefs to petition for U.S. annexation, and sought greater American involvement; Washington showed little interest, the firm\u2019s holdings were auctioned, and the company collapsed.\nIn 1871, the local steamer business of W. H. Webb required coal and he sent Captain E. Wakeman to Samoa in order to evaluate the suitability of Pago Pago as a coaling station. Wakeman approved the harbor and alerted the U.S. Navy about Germany's intent to take over the area. The U.S. Navy responded a few months later by dispatching Commander Richard Meade from Honolulu, Hawaii to assess Pago Pago's suitability as a naval station. Meade arrived in Pago Pago on and made a treaty with the Mauga for the exclusive use of the harbor and a set of commercial regulations to govern the trading and shipping in Pago Pago. He also purchased land for a new naval station. High Chief Mauga of Pago Pago stated his wish for the village to be recognized as Tutuila Island\u2019s capital.\nIn 1872, the chief of Pago Pago signed a treaty with the U.S., giving the American government considerable influence on the island. Later, also in 1872, German consul Theodore Weber arrived in Pago Pago soon after Richard W. Meade\u2019s departure. He cautioned Mauga that the treaty with the Americans was not official and insisted that German interests in the harbor be safeguarded.\nOn August 7, 1873, Colonel Albert Barnes Steinberger\u2014an associate of President Ulysses S. Grant and representative of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company\u2014arrived in Pago Pago. He found that High Chief Mauga already regarded himself as under U.S. protection by virtue of his treaty with Richard W. Meade, though its terms had been largely neglected. No pilotage or watering facilities existed, and the buoys once placed by the USS \"Narragansett\" had long since drifted away. With the other members of the Treaty Board living 80 miles away in Apia, Mauga had been left unable to maintain the harbor on his own. Before moving on to Upolu, Steinberger insisted that at least Whale Rock, a hidden hazard to navigation, be properly marked with a buoy.\nTutuila Island was acquired by the United States through a treaty in 1877. One year after the naval base was built at Pearl Harbor in 1887, the U.S. government established a naval station in Pago Pago. It was primarily used as a fueling station for both naval- and commercial ships.\nDuring the Tutuila War of 1877, all buildings in Pago Pago were destroyed. The war emerged during a tumultuous period, where Samoans were sharply divided over the future direction of their government. In response to the growing threat posed by the Puletua\u2014a rising opposition faction\u2014the Samoan leadership based in Apia sent Mamea to Washington, D.C. to negotiate an agreement with the U.S. While Mamea was abroad, the Puletua launched a rebellion, escalating the situation into full-scale war in Tutuila. To regain control, government forces stationed in Leone advanced toward Pago Pago, where the rebel leader Mauga was headquartered. The troops burned every building in Pago Pago and pursued Mauga along with several hundred followers to Aunu\u2019u Island. The Puletua faction on Tutuila, led by the former U.S. Consul to Samoa, S. S. Foster, who had moved to Pago Pago after his dismissal, and Mauga, found Aunu\u2019u incapable of supporting their forces. Consequently, they returned to Tutuila where they soon surrendered.\nIn 1878, the U.S. Navy first established a coaling station, right outside Fagatogo. The United States Navy later bought land east of Fagatogo and on Goat Island, an adjacent peninsula. Sufficient land was obtained in 1898 and the construction of United States Naval Station Tutuila was completed in 1902. The station commander doubled as American Samoa's Governor from 1899 to 1905, when the station commandant was designated Naval Governor of American Samoa. The Fono (legislature) served as an advisory council to the governor.\nDespite the Samoan Islands being a part of the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany maintained a strong naval presence in the area. Twice between 1880 and 1900, the U.S. Navy came close to taking part in a shooting war while its only true interest was the establishment of a coaling station in Pago Pago. The U.S. quietly purchased land around the harbor for the construction of the naval station. It rented land on Fagatogo Beach for $10/month in order to store the coal. Admiral Lewis Kimberly was ordered to Pago Pago while in Apia waiting for transportation home after the hurricane of 1889. In Pago Pago, he selected a site for the new coaling station and naval base. In June 1890, the U.S. Congress passed an appropriation of $100,000 for the purpose of permanently establishing a station for the naval and commercial marine. With the appropriation, the State Department sent Consul Harold M. Sewall from Apia to Pago Pago to buy six tracts of land for the project. Some parts were previously owned by the Polynesian Land Company, while other tracts were still owned by Samoan families. For the defense of the harbor in event of a naval war, the U.S. Navy wanted to purchase headlands and mountainsides above the Lepua Catholic Church which directly faced the harbor's entrance.\nIn 1883, a conflict began at Pago Pago Bay between Mauga Lei and Mauga Manuma. The dispute revolved around the entitlement to the title \"Mauga\". Mauga Lei's actions led to widespread dissatisfaction among the residents of Fagatogo and Aua, culminating in the Taua o Sa\u2019ousoali'i conflict. The residents of Fagas\u0101 joined Pago Pago village in an effort to overthrow Mauga Lei and support Manuma. The uprising forced Mauga Lei's forces to Aunu\u02bbu. Mauga Lei, who had a close friendship with King Malietoa Laupepa, secured intervention through two warships to resolve the hostilities. Intervention came in the form of a peace mission led by HMS \"Miranda\", under Captain William A. Dyke Acland, and supported by the German gunboat SMS \"Hy\u00e4ne\". Both Mauga Lei and Mauga Manuma were summoned to a peace conference aboard the HMS \"Miranda\". Both initially resisted boarding the ship but eventually relented after diplomatic pressure. The agreement that followed emphasized reconciliation and required both parties to disarm publicly. The conflict led to the deaths of 12 people.\nIn 1887, the \"Kaimiloa\", a 171-ton steamer and the only warship in the fleet of King Kal\u0101kaua of Hawai\u2018i, was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Samoan Islands as part of the Hawaiian monarch's initiative to create a united Polynesian kingdom. The journey included visits to several key locations, including Pago Pago, which was an important trading hub at the time. Historical accounts document the trade of the Kaimiloa's cannons to the Samoans, with at least one of these cannons now preserved and on display at the Jean P. Haydon Museum.\nIn 1888, during the Samoan Civil War, German official Eugen Brandeis sought to enforce strict control over the Pago Pago Bay area. When Aua and Fagatogo fell into arrears under new tax laws, he imposed a US$300 fine on each and warned that nonpayment would bring war and the exile of village chiefs. The fines were promptly paid, with the proceeds remitted to the German treasury in Apia.\nThe 1889 Apia cyclone ended a decade-long dispute between the U.S. and Germany over the coaling facilities at Pago Pago. During the storm, British, German, and American warships anchored off the island of Tutuila as part of the Samoan crisis were all sunk. In 1889, author Robert Louis Stevenson also paid a visit to Pago Pago.\nIn 1892, Mauga Lei, High Chief of Pago Pago and a supporter of Malietoa Laupepa, spent extended periods in Upolu, leaving the bay area without his leadership. While Pago Pago remained loyal, Fagatogo - aligned with Mata\u02bbafa - joined Aua in an effort to depose him. A confrontation followed: a canoe flotilla from Aua and Fagatogo advanced on Pago Pago but retreated under heavy gunfire. Warriors from Pago Pago and Fagas\u0101 then attacked Aua and Fagatogo, burning both villages; women and children took refuge at the Catholic mission at Lepua, and the flotilla withdrew to Aunu\u02bbu.\nOn May 27, 1893, a branch of the LDS Church was established in Pago Pago. The church had first arrived on the island in 1863 and became formally organized on Tutuila in 1888.\nIn 1893, acting U.S. consul William Blacklock visited Pago Pago to assess the purchase of land at Blunts and Breakers Points for gun emplacements protecting the coaling station. Ongoing hostilities between Mauga of Pago Pago and Le\u02bbiato of Faga\u02bbitua prevented a binding agreement; Blacklock secured only an option to purchase at a later date.\nIn 1898, a California-based construction and engineering firm was contracted to build the coal depot. The naval engineer in charge was W. I. Chambers. On April 30, 1899, Commander Benjamin Franklin Tilley sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on with a cargo of coal and steel for the project. The U.S. Navy was the only American agency present in the area, and it was made responsible for administering the new territory.\nIn 1899, Pago Pago became the administrative capital of American Samoa. Pago Pago and Tutuila Island were formally part of the Kingdom of Samoa until 1899, when they became U.S. territory. In December of that year, the Tripartite Convention formally partitioned Tutuila as a U.S. territory, thereby granting the United States control over Pago Pago.\nIn 1900, the Oceanic Steamship Company's steamers - the \"Sierra\", the \"Ventura\", and the \"Sonoma\" - shifted their port of call from Apia to Pago Pago.\nOn April 17, 1900, the first American flag was raised at Sogelau Hill above the site of the new wharf and coaling facilities in Fagatogo. For the ceremony, a group of invitees from Apia arrived with German Governor Heinrich Solf onboard . USS \"Abarenda\", home of B. F. Tilley and his new government, was in the harbor. American consul Luther W. Osborn arrived from Apia, and many spectators arrived from American Samoa villages and other countries. Tilley was the master of ceremonies and began the program by reading the Proclamation of the President of the United States, which asserted American sovereignty over the islands. Next was the reading of the Order of the Secretary of the Navy, followed by chiefs who read the Deed of Cession, which they had written and signed. Before raising the flag, reverend E. V. Cooper of the London Missionary Society (LMS) and reverend Father Meinaidier of the Roman Catholic Mission offered prayers. Students from the LMS school in Fagalele sang the national anthem. The two ships, \"Comoran\" and \"Abarenda\", fired the national salutes. The Deed of Cession of Tutuila and Aunu'u Islands was signed on Gagamoe, and formalized the relationship between the U.S. and American Samoa. Gagamoe is an area in Pago Pago which is the Mauga family's communal and sacred land.\n20th century.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Pago Pago became American Samoa's port of entry.\nOn April 11, 1904, the first public school in American Samoa, called \"Fagatogo\", was established in the naval station area. The school had two teachers and forty students at the time of its opening. The first school arose from petitions by Europeans in Pago Pago for a school for their children. Governor Uriel Sebree established it at Fagatogo, allocating US$1,000 from the copra fund, and reserved to himself the selection of pupils from the non-Samoan and part-Samoan population.\nOn September 1, 1912, the first Samoan hospital was completed at Malaloa, on a hillside adjacent to the present-day site of the Sadie Thompson Inn.\nFrom December 16, 1916, to January 30, 1917, English author W. Somerset Maugham and his secretary and lover, Gerald Haxton, visited Pago Pago on their way from Hawai'i to Tahiti. Also on board the ship was a passenger named Miss Sadie Thompson, who had been evicted from Hawaii for prostitution. She was later the main character in the popular short story, \"Rain\" (1921), a story of a prostitute arriving in Pago Pago. Delayed because of a quarantine inspection, they checked into what is now known as Sadie Thompson Inn. Maugham also met an American sailor here, who later appeared as the title character in another short story, \"Red\" (1921). The Sadie Thompson Inn was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2003.\nIn 1920, Mauga Moi Moi, the highest ranking chief of Pago Pago, initiated the Mau movement. The Mau movement first took shape in Pago Pago, where gatherings were held at the doorstep of Mauga. High chiefs, chiefs, talking chiefs, and community members came together to take part. A series of fonos in Pago Pago brought together high and talking chiefs for prolonged oratory and political maneuvering. The meetings halted copra cutting for months, causing a sharp downturn in Tutuila\u2019s economy.\nOn August 31, 1925, Margaret Mead arrived in Pago Pago aboard the SS \"Sonoma\" to begin fieldwork for her Columbia University dissertation, later published as \"Coming of Age in Samoa\".\nOn September 26, 1930, the Bingham Commission reached Pago Pago aboard the USS Omaha. Their arrival was marked by a dockside parade of the Fita Fita Band, which performed The Star-Spangled Banner.\nFirst and Second World Wars.\nIn May 1917, when the U.S. joined World War I, two German ships anchoring in Pago Pago were seized. The 10,000-ton \"Elsass\" was towed to Honolulu and turned over to the U.S. Navy, while its smaller gunboat, \"Solf\", was refitted in Pago Pago and given the name . Wireless messaging between Pago Pago and Hawaii was routed through Fiji. As the British censored all messages through Fiji, the Navy quickly upgraded the facilities to go directly between Pago Pago and Honolulu.\nIn 1937, film director John Ford visited Pago Pago for the filming of \"The Hurricane\" (1937), a movie based on the novel by the same name. With the cooperation of the U.S. Navy, filming took place from May 3 until mid-September. Local residents were recruited as extras, but because the population was under U.S. Navy administration, their wages were converted into goods such as chewing gum and canned salmon rather than paid in cash. The film\u2019s release later that year brought international attention to Pago Pago, including a promotional photo spread in \"Life\" magazine. The film became a box office blockbuster, grossing $4.4 million domestically, and it went on to win the Academy Award for Best Sound Recording in 1938.\nOn January 10, 1938, the flying boat \"Samoan Clipper\" exploded just after leaving Pago Pago Harbor. Pilot Edwin Musick and his crew of six died in the accident.\nPago Pago was a vital naval base for the U.S. during World War II. Limited improvements at the naval station took place in the summer of 1940, which included a Marine Corps airfield at Tafuna. The new airfield was partly operational by April 1942, and fully operational by June. On March 15, 1941, the Marine Corps' 7th Defense Battalion arrived in Pago Pago and was the first Fleet Marine Force unit to serve in the South Pacific Ocean. It was also the first such unit to be deployed in defense of an American island. Guns were emplaced at Blunts and Breakers Points, covering Pago Pago Harbor. It trained the only Marine reserve unit to serve on active duty during World War II, namely the 1st Samoan Battalion, U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. The battalion mobilized after the attack on Pearl Harbor and remained active until January 1944.\nIn January 1942 Pago Pago Harbor was shelled by a Japanese submarine, but this was the only battle action on the islands during World War II. This took place on the morning of January 11, 1942, when a Japanese submarine surfaced in Fagasa Bay and fired fifteen rounds from its 5.5-inch deck guns toward Pago Pago. The shells passed over the hills and landed in several locations around Pago Pago Bay. Commander Edwin B. Robinson, who was cycling on Centipede Row, was struck in the knees by shrapnel. He was the only person in American Samoa to sustain war injuries during World War II.\nOn January 20, 1942, the 2nd Marine Brigade arrived in Pago Pago with about 5,000 men and various supplies of weaponry, including cannons and tanks. On May 30, 1942, Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd arrived in American Samoa to assess the defenses of Pago Pago. He reported that Tutuila\u2019s garrison\u20147,995 U.S. Navy and Marine Corps personnel, along with 100 Fitafita Guards\u2014was sufficient to repel minor raids but inadequate to withstand a major assault.\nOn August 24, 1943, Pago Pago and the U.S. Naval Station was visited by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The First Lady reviewed the Fita Fita Guard and Band and the First S\u0101moan Battalion at the U.S. Naval Station.\nOn October 7, 1949, the , a World War II oil and gas tanker, exploded and sank in Pago Pago Harbor. It remains the only shipwreck from that era found in the harbor and lies just over 100 feet beneath the current fuel dock. Measuring 90 meters in length, the wreck continues to be considered a source of pollution, impacting the water quality as of 2002.\nIn 1953, 56 Tokelauans evicted from Swains Island arrived in Pago Pago, where they had to be supported by American Samoa until their repatriation. In response, Governor Richard Barrett Lowe issued an executive order to prevent similar incidents in the future, including restrictions that limited employment on Swains Island to American Samoans.\nIn the 1953 American Samoan legislative election, Mabel Coleman Reid of Pago Pago became the first woman elected to the American Samoa House of Representatives.\n1960s.\nPago Pago was an important location for NASA's Apollo program from 1961 to 1972. Apollo 10, Apollo 11, Apollo 12, Apollo 13, Apollo 14 and Apollo 17 landed by Tutuila Island, and the crew flew from Pago Pago to Honolulu on their way back to the mainland. At Jean P. Haydon Museum are displays of an American Samoa-flag brought to the Moon in 1969 by Apollo 11, as well as moonstones, all given as a gift to American Samoa by President Richard Nixon following the return of the Apollo Moon missions. The museum was officially opened in October 1971 with an opening featuring Margaret Mead as a guest speaker. The National Endowment for the Arts provided a start-up grant. The most valuable asset was an exquisite mat reputed to be the \"Fala o Futa\", the first important fine mat of Samoa, donated by Senate President HC Salanoa S.P. Aumoeualogo. The other major contribution was a cannon which came off \"Kaimiloa\", a 171-ton steamer and the only warship in the fleet of King Kalakaua of Hawai'i. The Hawaiian king sent the ship to the Samoan Islands in an effort at creating a Polynesian kingdom.\nIn 1965, the Tramway at Mount \u02bbAlava was constructed as access to the TV transmission equipment on the mountain. It ran from atop Solo Hill at the end of the Togotogo Ridge above Utulei. It ascended across Pago Pago Harbor and landed at the Mount \u02bbAlava. It was one of the world's longest single-span cablecar routes.\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson and First Lady Lady Bird Johnson visited Pago Pago on October 18, 1966. Johnson remains the only U.S. president to have visited American Samoa. Lyndon B. Johnson Tropical Medical Center was named in honor of the president. Landing ahead of the Air Force One was the press plane that carried seventy news reporters. The two-hour visit was televised throughout the country and the world. Governor H. Rex Lee and traditional leaders crammed ceremonies, entertainment, a brief tour, and a school dedication: the Manulele Tausala, Lady Bird Johnson School. The President gave a speech where he laid out the American policy for its lone South Pacific territory. The President and First Lady returned to American Samoa in December 1966, on their way to Prime Minister's Harold Holt's funeral in Australia. Governor Owen Aspinall offered a quiet welcome as the White House asked for there to be no ceremonies during the visit.

The tsunami caused moderate to severe damage to villages, buildings and vehicles and caused 34 deaths and hundreds of injuries. It was an 8.3 magnitude earthquake which caused waves to hit the city. It caused major flooding and damaged numerous buildings. A local power plant was disabled, 241 homes were destroyed, and 308 homes had major damage. Shortly after the earthquake, President Barack Obama issued a federal disaster declaration, which authorized funds for individual assistance (IA), such as temporary housing.\nThe largest wave hit Pago Pago at 6:13\u00a0pm local time, with an amplitude of .\nGeography.\nPago Pago is in the Eastern District of American Samoa, in Ma'oputasi County. It is approximately southwest of Hawaii, northeast of New Zealand, and southwest of California. It is located at . Pago Pago is located 18 degrees south of the equator.\nThe city of Pago Pago encompasses several surrounding villages, including Fagatogo, the legislative and judicial capital, and Utulei, the executive capital and home of the Governor. The town is located between steep mountainsides and the harbor. It is surrounded by mountains such as Mount Matafao (2,142\u00a0ft), Rainmaker Mountain (1,716\u00a0ft), Mount \u02bbAlava (1,611\u00a0ft), Mount Siona (892\u00a0ft), Mount Tepatasi (666\u00a0ft), and Mount Matai (850\u00a0ft), all mountains protecting Pago Pago Harbor. The main downtown area is Fagatogo on the south shore of Pago Pago Harbor, the location of the Fono (territorial legislature), the port, the bus station and the market. The banks are in Utulei and Fagotogo, as are the Sadie Thompson Inn and other hotels. The tuna canneries, which provide employment for a third of the population of Tutuila, are in Atu'u on the north shore of the harbor. The village of Pago Pago is at the western head of the harbor.\nPago Pago Harbor nearly bisects Tutuila Island. It is facing south and situated almost midpoint on the island. Its bay is wide and long. A high mountain, Mount Pioa (Rainmaker Mountain), is located at the east side of the bay. Half of American Samoa's inhabitants live along Pago Pago's foothills and coastal areas. The downtown area is known as Fagatogo and is home to government offices, port facilities, Samoan High School and the Rainmaker Hotel. Two tuna factories are located in the northern part of town. The town is centered around the mouth of the Vaopito Stream. Pago Pago Harbor collects water from numerous streams, including the Vaipito Stream, which is the area's largest watershed. Not far from where Route One crosses Vaipito Stream is Laolao Stream, which discharges into the head of Pago Pago Harbor. It merges with Vaipito Stream in Pago Pago Park, a few yards from the harbor. Between the Vaipito Valley and Autapini is a tract of land situated along the headwaters of Pago Pago Bay, and that is called Fusi; hstorically, this area has been the subject of legal disputes and jurisprudence concerning land ownership.\nIn the village of Pago Pago, from Malaloa to Satala, there are a total of eleven rivers or streams. These include Vaipito, Gagamoe, Laolao, Pago, Leau, Vaima, Utumoa, and Aga. Tidal mud flats associated with the mouth of the Vaopito Stream were filled in order to create Pago Pago Park at the head of Pago Pago Harbor. Five species of Gobie fish, Mountain bass, Freshwater eel, Mullet and four shrimp species have been recorded along the lower reach of the Vaipito Stream. One of the Goby species, \"Stiphodon hydoreibatus\", is endemic to the Samoan Islands and found nowhere else on Earth.\nNorth of town is the National Park of American Samoa. A climb to the summit of Mount \u02bbAlava in the National Park of American Samoa provides a bird's-eye view of the harbor and town.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture and fishing still provide sustenance for local families.\nCity features.\nThe Greater Pago Pago Area stretches into neighboring villages:\nSome houses are Western-style; others are more traditional Samoan housing units. All houses have running water and plumbing. It has been described as a \"thoroughly Americanized\" city. Fagatogo is Pago Pago's chief governmental and commercial center.\nPago Pago Park is a public park by the harbor in Pago Pago. It lies by the Laolao Stream at the very end of Pago Pago Harbor. It is a recreational complex and culture center. There are a ball field, sports court and boat ramp in the park. The park houses businesses such as the American Samoa Development Bank. There are basketball and tennis courts, a football field, a gymnasium, a bowling alley and several Korean food kiosks in the park. The Korean House was built as a social center for the Korean fishermen in town.\nNational Park.\nPago Pago is the primary entry point for visits to National Park of American Samoa, and the city is situated immediately south of the park. Its park visitor center is located at the head of Pago Pago Harbor: Pago Plaza Visitor Center (Pago Plaza, Suite 114, Pago Pago, AS 96799). This center also contains a collection of Samoan artifacts, corals, and seashells. The center expanded with 700 sq. ft. in July 2019, adding new demonstrations and exhibits. An item at the new exhibit is the skull of a sperm whale which washed up on Ofu Island in 2015. Several video screens and panels inform visitors about Samoan dolphins and whales. The exhibit also contains a by siapo which was made by college students as well as an \u02bbenu basket woven with traditional materials.\nThe nearest hotels to the national park are also located in Pago Pago. Other parts of the park, on the islands of Ta\u02bb\u016b and Ofu, can be visited via commercial inter-island air carrier from Pago Pago International Airport.\nThe national park is home to tropical rainforest, tall mountains, beaches, and some of the tallest sea cliffs in the world (). It was authorized by the U.S. Congress in 1988 to preserve the paleotropical rain forest, Indo-Pacific coral reefs, and Samoan culture. It officially opened in 1993 when a 50-year lease was signed between the U.S. federal government, the government of American Samoa, and local village chiefs (Matai). It is the only U.S. National Park where the U.S. federal government leases the land from local governments instead of being the land owner. It is a park which provides habitat for a variety of tropical wildlife, including coral reef fish, seabirds, flying fruit bats, and numerous other species of animals. Approximately are on Tutuila, and the remainder is on the other islands and the ocean. The park's offshore coral reefs provide habitat for 1,000 species of coral reef and pelagic fishes. The park is home to over 150 species of coral. Notable terrestrial species are the Pacific tree boa and the Flying Megabat, which has a wingspread.\nNatural hazards.\nPago Pago is vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters. Vulnerabilities include heavy storms, flooding, tsunamis, mudslides, and earthquakes. American Samoa has experienced several cyclones and tropical storms, which also increase risks of rock slides and floodings.\nThe capital city is situated at the head of Pago Pago Harbor in a sheltered area that has been described as relatively safe during hurricanes.'\nIn the past century, Pago Pago has experienced over 50 minor tsunamis. The earliest and most impactful tsunami before the 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami occurred in 1917. This event was triggered by a magnitude 8.3 earthquake at the outer border of the northern end of the Tonga Trench, approximately 200\u00a0km off the Tutuila coast. The initial wave, reaching a height of about 3 m., resulted in the destruction of numerous houses and two churches. No human casualties were reported. Another notable event was the tsunami associated with the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. While waves in the head of Pago Pago Bay reached a maximum height of 5 m., they caused minimal damage to several houses, with no reported casualties. The most destructive tsunami in Pago Pago's recorded history took place in 2009. Studies indicate that during this incident, wave amplification occurred in the Pago Pago Bay due to its long and narrow morphology. Waves that measured approximately 1 m. at the mouth of Pago Pago Bay surged to a maximum height of 7 m. at the head of Pago Pago Bay. The resulting inundation caused extensive damage in Pago Pago Harbor, extending up to 500 m. inland, and reaching a maximum run-up of 8 m., leading to 34 casualties across Tutuila Island.\nGeology.\nTutuila Island is a basaltic volcanic dome created by five volcanoes aligned along two or possibly three rift zones\u2014fractures in the basement rock. The island's formation dates back to the Pliocene and early Pleistocene epochs, approximately 5 million to 500,000 years ago. Volcanic activity ceased around 10,000 years ago, leaving the island volcanically dormant today. The central feature of Tutuila's geology is the Pago Volcano, which was active between 1.54 and 1.28 million years ago. The volcano's caldera, approximately 6 miles long and 3 miles wide, collapsed 1.27 million years ago, creating Pago Pago Harbor. The natural harbor formed in the partially submerged remnants of the caldera, which cuts deeply into the south-central coast of the island. The village of Pago Pago is situated at the narrowest part of Tutuila, near the center of the collapsed caldera. The northern half of the Pago Volcano shield remains, while the southeastern portion has been eroded to form the harbor.\nErosion has also played a significant role in shaping the landscape. Following the collapse of the Pago Volcano, the Vaipito Valley and Pago Pago Bay were sculpted by streams and geological processes. The Vaipito Stream, which follows a fault line associated with the volcano, carved steep valley walls, exposing rock formations of basalt, andesite, and trachyte. Over time, colluvial and fluvial sediments filled the lower reaches of the valley, creating a narrow, flat floodplain. Coralline sands and basaltic sediments deposited at the stream's mouth contributed to the formation of a narrow coral-rubble reef flat along Pago Pago Bay's shoreline. Pago Pago Harbor marks the southeastern boundary of the caldera. The northwest rim of the caldera, known as the Maugaloa Ridge, forms the southern boundary of the National Park of American Samoa.\nClimate.\nPago Pago has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Af\") with hot temperatures and abundant year-round rainfall. All official climate records for American Samoa are kept at Pago Pago. The hottest temperature ever recorded was on February 22, 1958. Conversely, the lowest temperature on record was on October 10, 1964. The average annual temperature recorded at the weather station at Pago Pago International Airport is , with a temperature range of about two degrees Fahrenheit separating the average monthly temperatures of the coolest and hottest months.\nPago Pago has been named one of the rainiest places on Earth. Due to its warm winters, the plant hardiness zone is 13b. It receives of rain per year. The rainy season lasts from October through May, but the town experiences warm and humid temperatures year-round. Besides it being wetter and more humid from November\u2013April, this is also the hurricane season. The frequency of hurricanes hitting Pago Pago has increased dramatically in recent years. The windy season lasts from May to October. As warmer easterlies are forced up and over Rainmaker Mountain, clouds form and drop moisture on the city. Consequentially, Pago Pago experiences twice the rainfall of nearby Apia in Western Samoa. The average yearly rainfall in Pago Pago Harbor is , whereas in neighboring Western Samoa, it is around per year.\nRainmaker Mountain, which is also known as Mount Pioa, is a designated National Natural Landmark. It is notable for its ability to extract rain in tremendous quantities. Rising out of the ocean, the Pioa monolith blocks the path of the low clouds heavy with fresh water as they are pushed along by the southeast tradewinds. The southeast ridge of Rainmaker Mountain reaches up into the clouds creating downfalls of enormous proportions.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe village of Pago Pago proper had a 2010 population of 3,656. However, Pago Pago also encompasses neighboring villages. The Greater Pago Pago Area was home to 11,500 residents in 2011. Around 90 percent of American Samoa's population lives around Pago Pago. American Samoa's population grew by 22 percent in the 1990s; nearly all of this growth took place in Pago Pago.\nAs of the 2000 U.S. census, 74.5% of Pago Pago's population are of \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Island\" race. 16.6% were Asian, while 4.9% were white. In Pago Pago proper, residential communities are mostly found in the Vaipito Valley.\nThe proportion of Pago Pago residents born outside of American Samoa was 26 percent in the early 1980s, and 39 percent in the late 1980s. The percentage of residents born abroad reached 44 percent in 1990. Many of the residents are American Samoans who were born abroad, and the village also has had an increasing number of new residents from Far East countries such as South Korea.\nThe village of Pago Pago, the Greater Pago Pago Area and Ma\u02bbop\u016btasi County observed a notable reduction in population during the period from 2010 to 2020. Specifically, the county registered a 16.8 percent decline in population, while Pago Pago proper recorded an 18 percent decrease. This decline surpassed the overall population decrease for American Samoa, which stood at 10.5 percent during the same timeframe. Among the villages in the county, only Anua experienced a positive growth in population, contrasting with declines in villages such as Fagatogo (\u221216.8%), Satala (\u221226.6%), and Utulei (\u221230%).\nGovernment.\nPago Pago is the seat of the judiciary (Fagatogo), legislature and Governor's Office (Utulei).\nEducation.\nThe Feleti Barstow Public Library is located in Pago Pago. In 1991, severe tropical Cyclone Val hit Pago Pago, destroying the library that existed there. The current Barstow library, constructed in 1998, opened on April 17, 2000.\nThe American Samoa Community College (ASCC) was founded in July 1970 by the American Samoa Department of Education. The college's first courses were taught in 1971 at the Lands and Survey Building in Fagatogo. At the time, the college had a total enrollment of 131 students. In 1972, the college moved to the former Fialloa High School in Utulei, before ultimately moving to its current location in Mapusaga in 1974.\nCulture.\nReligion.\nPago Pago is home to a variety of Christian denominations, including the New Apostolic Church, the Congregational Christian Church of Jesus Christ (CCCJS), the Pago Pago Assembly of God, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), the Susana Uesele Methodist Church, and the First Chinese Baptist Church of American Samoa. The All People\u2019s Pentecostal Church was dedicated in August 2017, and a new Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Kingdom Hall opened in 2016. The town also has a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Center. In neighboring Satala, there is a Seventh-day Adventist Church, while Fagatogo is the site of the Roman Catholic Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph the Worker.\nSeveral congregations in Pago Pago, including Assemblies of God, the Congregational Christian Church of American Samoa (CCCAS), and Methodist churches, participate in joint worship services through the World Council of Churches. However, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and certain other denominations do not take part in these shared services.\nEconomy.\nPago Pago is the center of commerce in American Samoa. It is home to all the industry and most of the commerce in American Samoa. It is the number one port in the United States in terms of value of fish landed \u2013 about $200,000,000 per year. In 2007, tuna exports accounted for 93% of all exports, amounting to $446 million.\nTuna canning is the main economic activity in town. Exports are almost exclusively tuna canneries such as Chicken of the Sea and StarKist, which are both located in Pago Pago. These also occupy 14 percent of American Samoa's total workforce as of 2014. The most industrialized area in the territory can be found between Pago Pago Harbor and the Tafuna-Leone Plain, which also are the two most densely populated places in the islands.\nAmerican Samoa was the world's fourth-largest tuna processor in 1993. The primary industry is tuna processing by the Samoa Packing Co. (Chicken of the Sea) and StarKist Samoa, a subsidiary of H.J. Heinz. The first cannery was opened in 1954. Canned fish, canned pet food, and fish meal from skin and bones account for 93 percent of American Samoa's industrial output.\nDining establishments, amusement facilities, professional services, and bars can be found throughout Pago Pago. Pago Pago proper was home to 225 registered commercial enterprises as of year 2000. Within the Pago Pago watershed, farmland (faatoaga) are located in two areas in the southern half of the Vaipito Valley as well as in Happy Valley and on the west side of Pago Pago village. Farmland is also found by Fagatogo, Atu'u, Punaoa Valley, Lepua, Aua, and Leloaloa.\nCenters for shopping are Pago Plaza, which consists of smaller stores selling handcrafts and souvenirs, and Fagatogo Square Shopping Center, which is home to larger shops. This shopping mall is next-door to Fagatogo Market in Fagatogo, which is considered the main center of Pago Pago. It is home to several restaurants, shops, bars, and often live entertainment and music. Souvenirs are often sold at the market when cruise ships are visiting town. Locals also sell handmade crafts at the dock and on main street. Mount \u02bbAlava, the canneries in Atu'u, Rainmaker Mountain (Mount Pioa), and Pago Pago Harbor are all visible from the market. The main bus station is located immediately behind the market.\nPago Pago is a duty-free port and prices on imported goods are lower than in other parts of the South Pacific Ocean. Governor H. Rex Lee signed a law making Pago Pago a duty-free port in May 1967.\nIt is a wealthier city than nearby Apia, capital of Samoa.\nTourism.\nTourism in American Samoa is centered around Pago Pago. It receives 34,000 visitors per year, which is one-fourth of neighboring country of Samoa. 69.3 percent of visitors are from the United States as of 2014.\nUntil 1980, one could experience the view of Mt. Avala by taking an aerial tramway over the harbor, but on April 17 of that year a U.S. Navy plane, flying overhead as part of the Flag Day celebrations, struck the cable; the plane crashed into a wing of the Rainmaker Hotel. The tramway was repaired, but closed not long after. The tram remains unusable, although according to \"Lonely Planet,\" plans have been put forth to reopen it, but in January 2011 the cable was damaged by Tropical Cyclone Wilma, fell into the harbor and has not been repaired. Governor Lolo Matalasi Moliga announced in 2014 that he would look into restoring the cable car.\nThe Sadie Thompson Inn, on the outskirts of Pago Pago, is a hotel and restaurant that is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\nThe Greater Pago Pago Area is home to more than 10 hotels:\nTransportation.\nPago Pago Harbor is the port of entry for vessels arriving in American Samoa. Many cruise boats and ships land at Pago Pago Harbor for reprovision reasons, such as to restock on goods and to utilize American-trained medical personnel. Pago Pago Harbor is one of the world's largest natural harbors. It has been named one of the best deepwater harbors in the South Pacific Ocean, or one of the best in the world as a whole.\nPago Pago is a port of call for South Pacific cruise ships, including Norwegian Cruise Line and Princess Cruises. However, cruise ships do not take on passengers in Pago Pago, but typically arrive in the morning and depart in the afternoon. Thirteen cruise ships were scheduled to visit Pago Pago in 2017, bringing 31,000 visitors. Pago Pago Harbor can accommodate two cruise ships at the same time, and has done so on several occasions.\nPago Pago International Airport (PPG) is located at Tafuna, southwest of Pago Pago. There are international flights to Samoa 4\u20137 times daily by Polynesian Airlines: Pago Pago is a 35-minute flight from Apia in Samoa. Most flights are to and from Fagali'i. There is only one flight destination from the territory to the United States: Honolulu International Airport, a five-hour flight from Pago Pago by Hawaiian Airlines. Of the 88,650 international arrivals in 2001, only 10 percent were tourists. The rest came to visit relatives, for employment reasons, or in transit. Most international visitors are from the independent country of Samoa.\nScheduled intra-territorial flights are available to the islands of Ta\u02bb\u016b and Ofu, which take 30 minutes by air from Pago Pago.\nA ferry called runs between Pago Pago and Apia, Samoa, once a week.\nBus and taxi services are based in Fagatogo.\nHistorical sites.\nSixteen remaining structures from the U.S. Naval Station Tutuila Historic District are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. These include the Government House, Courthouse of American Samoa, Jean P. Haydon Museum, Navy Building 38, and other buildings.\nWorld War II fortifications.\nNear Pila F. Palu Co. Inc. Store, a road runs up the hill into Happy Valley, and on the side of this road, six World War II ammunition bunkers can be seen on the left before reaching a dirt road. The dirt road, also located on the left side, leads to a big concrete bunker which was used as naval communications headquarters during World War II. Over fifty pillbox fortifications can be found along the coastline on Tutuila Island. The largest of these is the Marine Corps communication bunker in Pago Pago. It is located in the Autapini area, which is between Malaloa and Happy Valley.\nDuring World War II, guns were emplaced at Blunt's and Breaker's Points, covering Pago Pago Harbor.\nFlora.\nAt one time there were a number of mangrove forests around the Pago Pago area, but these are now all gone, with the exception of a few scattered individual trees surviving at Aiia on the east side of Pago Pago Bay. No trace of mangroves are longer found within Fagatogo village limits, thus contradicting its name (\"bay of mangroves\").\nFauna.\nBlack turtles and Hawksbill turtles have been recorded in Pago Pago Harbor. The area also attracts seabirds like the Crested tern and the Blue-gray noddy, which are known to roost and nest nearby. The Cardinal honey-eater frequents the ridges above Pago Pago, feeding on nectar from native plants. Additionally, the Wandering tattler has been spotted along a mountain stream just west of the town. The Black rat has also been recorded in Pago Pago.\nThe Red-vented bulbul, an introduced bird species, has become widespread on Tutuila Island. It was first observed in Apia during the 1940s and later reported in Pago Pago in 1958. Another introduced species, the Rock dove, has a more recent and less well-documented history in the Samoan Islands. Records from the 1950s indicate that a flock of 20 Rock Doves was kept by a family in Pago Pago during this period.\nThe Grey-backed tern is occasionally observed feeding within Pago Pago Harbor, while the Black noddy is frequently sighted flying over the same area. The Common myna, an adaptable urban bird, is commonly encountered in the developed regions surrounding Pago Pago.\nRecreation.\nThe main trailhead for both Mount \u02bbAlava and Mount Matafao is located at the crest of Fagas\u0101 Pass, just above the Vaipito Valley. From this point the Mount \u02bbAlava Trail \u2013 the only hiking trail within the Pago Pago unit of the National Park of American Samoa \u2013 ascends to the 491-meter (1,611-foot) summit, while a separate trail on the opposite side of the road climbs toward Mount Matafao, the highest peak on Tutuila Island.\nThe most popular hiking trail on the island is the World War II Heritage Trail, a 3-kilometer (1.9-mile) ridge walk that ends at Blunt\u2019s Point. Along the way it skirts prehistoric archaeological features and a series of coastal gun emplacements installed in 1942\u201343 to repel a possible Japanese landing. Two short trails provide additional access to wartime fortifications: the Blunt\u2019s Point Trail, a 0.6-kilometer (0.4-mile) climb up Matautu Ridge to the twin 6-inch naval guns of Blunts Point Battery, and the Breakers Point Trail, a 0.5-kilometer (0.3-mile) path across Pago Pago Harbor that reaches Breakers Point Naval Guns.\nLandmarks.\nLandmarks include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In a domestic setting, soaps, specifically \"toilet soaps\", are surfactants usually used for washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping. In industrial settings, soaps are used as thickeners, components of some lubricants, emulsifiers, and catalysts.\nSoaps are often produced by mixing fats and oils with a base. Humans have used soap for millennia; evidence exists for the production of soap-like materials in ancient Babylon around 2800 BC.\nTypes.\nToilet soaps.\nIn a domestic setting, \"soap\" usually refers to what is technically called a toilet soap, used for household and personal cleaning. Toilet soaps are salts of fatty acids with the general formula (RCO2\u2212)M+, where M is Na (sodium) or K (potassium).\nWhen used for cleaning, soap solubilizes particles and grime, which can then be separated from the article being cleaned. The insoluble oil/fat \"dirt\" become associated inside micelles, tiny spheres formed from soap molecules with polar hydrophilic (water-attracting) groups on the outside and encasing a lipophilic (fat-attracting) pocket, which shields the oil/fat molecules from the water, making them soluble. Anything that is soluble will be washed away with the water. In hand washing, as a surfactant, when lathered with a little water, soap kills microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. It also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water.\nWhen used in hard water, soap does not lather well but forms soap scum (related to metallic soaps, see below).\nNon-toilet soaps.\nSo-called metallic soaps are key components of most lubricating greases and thickeners. A commercially important example is lithium stearate. Greases are usually emulsions of calcium soap or lithium soap and mineral oil. Many other metallic soaps are also useful, including those of aluminium, sodium, and mixtures thereof. Such soaps are also used as thickeners to increase the viscosity of oils. In ancient times, lubricating greases were made by the addition of lime to olive oil, which would produce calcium soaps. Metal soaps are also included in modern artists' oil paints formulations as a rheology modifier. Metal soaps can be prepared by neutralizing fatty acids with metal oxides:\n2 RCO2H + CaO \u2192 (RCO2)2Ca + H2O\nA cation from an organic base such as ammonium can be used instead of a metal; ammonium nonanoate is an ammonium-based soap that is used as an herbicide.\nAnother class of non-toilet soaps are resin soaps, which are produced in the paper industry by the action of tree rosin with alkaline reagents used to separate cellulose from raw wood. A major component of such soaps is the sodium salt of abietic acid. Resin soaps are used as emulsifiers.\nSoapmaking.\nThe production of toilet soaps usually entails saponification of triglycerides, which are vegetable or animal oils and fats. An alkaline solution (often lye) induces saponification whereby the triglyceride fats first hydrolyze into salts of fatty acids. Glycerol (glycerin) is liberated. The glycerin is sometimes left in the soap product as a softening agent, although it is sometimes separated. Handmade soap can differ from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat or coconut oil beyond that needed to consume the alkali is used (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called \"superfatting\"), and the glycerol left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer. The addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat, although it can leave a \"greasy\" feel. Sometimes, an emollient is added, such as jojoba oil or shea butter. Sand or pumice may be added to produce a scouring soap. The scouring agents serve to remove dead cells from the skin surface being cleaned. This process is called exfoliation.\nTo make antibacterial soap, compounds such as triclosan or triclocarban can be added. There is some concern that use of antibacterial soaps and other products might encourage antimicrobial resistance in microorganisms.\nThe type of alkali metal used determines the kind of soap product. Sodium soaps, prepared from sodium hydroxide (soda lye), are firm, whereas potassium soaps, derived from potassium hydroxide (potash lye), are softer or often liquid. Historically, potassium hydroxide was extracted from the ashes of bracken or other plants. Lithium soaps also tend to be hard. These are used exclusively in greases.\nFor making toilet soaps, triglycerides (oils and fats) are derived from coconut, olive, or palm oils, as well as tallow. Triglyceride is the chemical name for the triesters of fatty acids and glycerin. Tallow, \"i.e.,\" rendered fat, is the most available triglyceride from animals. Hence, the fat compound in many soap is known as sodium tallowate. Each species offers quite different fatty acid content, resulting in soaps of distinct feel. The seed oils give softer but milder soaps. Soap made from pure olive oil, sometimes called Castile soap or Marseille soap, is reputed for its particular mildness. The term \"Castile\" is also sometimes applied to soaps from a mixture of oils with a high percentage of olive oil.\nHistory.\nProto-soaps in the Ancient world.\nProto-soaps, which mixed fat and alkali and were used for cleansing, are mentioned in Sumerian, Babylonian and Egyptian texts.\nThe earliest recorded evidence of the production of soap-like materials dates back to around 2800\u00a0BC in ancient Babylon. A formula for making a soap-like substance was written on a Sumerian clay tablet around 2500 BC. This was produced by heating a mixture of oil and wood ash, the earliest recorded chemical reaction, and used for washing woolen clothing.\nThe Ebers papyrus (Egypt, 1550\u00a0BC) indicates the ancient Egyptians used a soap-like product as a medicine and created this by combining animal fats or vegetable oils with a soda ash substance called trona. Egyptian documents mention a similar substance was used in the preparation of wool for weaving.\nIn the reign of Nabonidus (556\u2013539\u00a0BC), a recipe for a soap-like substance consisted of \"uhulu\" [ashes], cypress [oil] and sesame [seed oil] \"for washing the stones for the servant girls\".\nTrue soaps in the Ancient world.\nTrue soaps, which we might recognise as soaps today, were different to proto-soaps. They foamed, were made deliberately, and could be produced in a hard or soft form because of an understanding of lye sources. It is uncertain as to who was the first to invent true soap.\nKnowledge of how to produce true soap emerged at some point between early mentions of proto-soaps and the first century AD. Alkali was used to clean textiles such as wool for thousands of years but soap only forms when there is enough fat, and experiments show that washing wool does not create visible quantities of soap. Experiments by Sally Pointer show that the repeated laundering of materials used in perfume-making lead to noticeable amounts of soap forming. This fits with other evidence from Mesopotamian culture.\nPliny the Elder, whose writings chronicle life in the first century AD, describes soap as \"an invention of the Gauls\". The word , Latin for soap, has connected to a mythical Mount Sapo, a hill near the River Tiber where animals were sacrificed. But in all likelihood, the word was borrowed from an early Germanic language and is cognate with Latin , \"tallow\". It first appears in Pliny the Elder's account, \"Historia Naturalis\", which discusses the manufacture of soap from tallow and ashes. There he mentions its use in the treatment of scrofulous sores, as well as among the Gauls as a dye to redden hair which the men in Germania were more likely to use than women. The Romans avoided washing with harsh soaps before encountering the milder soaps used by the Gauls around 58\u00a0BC. Aretaeus of Cappadocia, writing in the 2nd century AD, observes among \"Celts, which are men called Gauls, those alkaline substances that are made into balls [...] called \"soap\"\". The Romans' preferred method of cleaning the body was to massage oil into the skin and then scrape away both the oil and any dirt with a strigil. The standard design is a curved blade with a handle, all of which is made of metal.\nThe 2nd-century AD physician Galen describes soap-making using lye and prescribes washing to carry away impurities from the body and clothes. The use of soap for personal cleanliness became increasingly common in this period. According to Galen, the best soaps were Germanic, and soaps from Gaul were second best. Zosimos of Panopolis, \"circa\" 300\u00a0AD, describes soap and soapmaking.\nIn the Southern Levant, the ashes from barilla plants, such as species of Salsola, saltwort (\"Seidlitzia rosmarinus\") and \"Anabasis\", were used to make potash. Traditionally, olive oil was used instead of animal lard throughout the Levant, which was boiled in a copper cauldron for several days. As the boiling progresses, alkali ashes and smaller quantities of quicklime are added and constantly stirred. In the case of lard, it required constant stirring while kept lukewarm until it began to trace. Once it began to thicken, the brew was poured into a mold and left to cool and harden for two weeks. After hardening, it was cut into smaller cakes. Aromatic herbs were often added to the rendered soap to impart their fragrance, such as yarrow leaves, lavender, germander, etc.\nAncient China.\nA detergent similar to soap was manufactured in ancient China from the seeds of \"Gleditsia sinensis\". Another traditional detergent is a mixture of pig pancreas and plant ash called \"zhuyizi\" (). Soap made of animal fat did not appear in China until the modern era. Soap-like detergents were not as popular as ointments and creams.\nIslamic Golden Age.\nHard toilet soap with a pleasant smell was produced in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, when soap-making became an established industry. Recipes for soap-making are described by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (c. 865\u2013925), who also gave a recipe for producing glycerine from olive oil. In the Middle East, soap was produced from the interaction of fatty oils and fats with alkali. In Syria, soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and lime. Soap was exported from Syria to other parts of the Muslim world and to Europe.\nA 12th-century document describes the process of soap production. It mentions the key ingredient, alkali, which later became crucial to modern chemistry, derived from \"al-qaly\" or \"ashes\".\nBy the 13th century, the manufacture of soap in the Middle East had become a major cottage industry, with sources in Nablus, Fes, Damascus, and Aleppo.\nMedieval Europe.\nSoapmakers in Naples (then under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire) were members of a guild in the late sixth century, and in the eighth century, soap-making was well known in Italy and Spain. The Carolingian capitulary \"De Villis\", dating to around 800, representing the royal will of Charlemagne, mentions soap as being one of the products the stewards of royal estates are to tally. The lands of Medieval Spain were a leading soapmaker by 800, and soapmaking began in the Kingdom of England about 1200. Soapmaking is mentioned both as \"women's work\" and as the produce of \"good workmen\" alongside other necessities, such as the produce of carpenters, blacksmiths, and bakers.\nIn Europe, soap in the 9th century was produced from animal fats and had an unpleasant smell. This changed when olive oil began to be used in soap formulas instead, after which much of Europe's soap production moved to the Mediterranean olive-growing regions. Hard toilet soap was introduced to Europe by Arabs and gradually spread as a luxury item. It was often perfumed.\nBy the 15th century, the manufacture of soap in Christendom often took place on an industrial scale, with sources in Antwerp, Castile, Marseille, Naples and Venice.\n16th\u201317th century.\nIn France, by the second half of the 16th century, the semi-industrialized professional manufacture of soap was concentrated in a few centers of Provence\u2014Toulon, Hy\u00e8res, and Marseille\u2014which supplied the rest of France. In Marseilles, by 1525, production was concentrated in at least two factories, and soap production at Marseille tended to eclipse the other Proven\u00e7al centers.\nEnglish manufacture tended to concentrate in London. The demand for high-quality hard soap was significant enough during the Tudor period that barrels of ashes were imported for the manufacture of soap.\nFiner soaps were later produced in Europe from the 17th century, using vegetable oils (such as olive oil) as opposed to animal fats. Many of these soaps are still produced, both industrially and by small-scale artisans. Castile soap is a popular example of the vegetable-only soaps derived from the oldest \"white soap\" of Italy. In 1634 Charles I granted the newly formed Society of Soapmakers a monopoly in soap production who produced certificates from 'foure Countesses, and five Viscountesses, and divers other Ladies and Gentlewomen of great credite and quality, besides common Laundresses and others', testifying that 'the New White Soap washeth whiter and sweeter than the Old Soap'.\nDuring the Restoration era (February 1665 \u2013 August 1714) a soap tax was introduced in England, which meant that until the mid-1800s, soap was a luxury, used regularly only by the well-to-do. The soap manufacturing process was closely supervised by revenue officials who made sure that soapmakers' equipment was kept under lock and key when not being supervised. Moreover, soap could not be produced by small makers because of a law that stipulated that soap boilers must manufacture a minimum quantity of one imperial ton at each boiling, which placed the process beyond the reach of the average person. The soap trade was boosted and deregulated when the tax was repealed in 1853.\nModern period.\nIndustrially manufactured \"bar soaps\" became available in the late 18th century, as advertising campaigns in Europe and America promoted popular awareness of the relationship between cleanliness and health. In modern times, the use of soap has become commonplace in industrialized nations due to a better understanding of the role of hygiene in reducing the population size of pathogenic microorganisms.\nUntil the Industrial Revolution, soapmaking was conducted on a small scale and the product was rough. In 1780, James Keir established a chemical works at Tipton, for the manufacture of alkali from the sulfates of potash and soda, to which he afterwards added a soap manufactory. The method of extraction proceeded on a discovery of Keir's. In 1790, Nicolas Leblanc discovered how to make alkali from common salt. Andrew Pears started making a high-quality, transparent soap, Pears soap, in 1807 in London. His son-in-law, Thomas J. Barratt, became the brand manager (the first of its kind) for Pears in 1865. In 1882, Barratt recruited English actress and socialite Lillie Langtry to become the poster-girl for Pears soap, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product.\nWilliam Gossage produced low-priced, good-quality soap from the 1850s. Robert Spear Hudson began manufacturing a soap powder in 1837, initially by grinding the soap with a mortar and pestle. American manufacturer Benjamin T. Babbitt introduced marketing innovations that included the sale of bar soap and distribution of product samples. William Hesketh Lever and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in Warrington in 1886 and founded what is still one of the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called Unilever. These soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns.\nLiquid soap.\nLiquid soap was invented in the nineteenth century; in 1865, William Sheppard patented a liquid version of soap. In 1898, B.J. Johnson developed a soap derived from palm and olive oils; his company, the B.J. Johnson Soap Company, introduced \"Palmolive\" brand soap that same year. This new brand of soap became popular rapidly, and to such a degree that B.J. Johnson Soap Company changed its name to Palmolive.\nIn the early 1900s, other companies began to develop their own liquid soaps. Such products as Pine-Sol and Tide appeared on the market, making the process of cleaning things other than skin, such as clothing, floors, and bathrooms, much easier.\nLiquid soap also works better for more traditional or non-machine washing methods, such as using a washboard.\nSee also.\nSoap-related.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the first monarch of France from the House of Bourbon, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. He pragmatically balanced the interests of the Catholic and Protestant parties in France, as well as among the European states. He was assassinated in Paris in 1610 by a Catholic zealot, and was succeeded by his son Louis XIII.\nHenry was baptised a Catholic but raised as a Huguenot in the Protestant faith by his mother, Queen Jeanne III of Navarre. He inherited the throne of Navarre in 1572 on his mother's death. As a Huguenot, Henry was involved in the French Wars of Religion, barely escaping assassination in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. He later led Protestant forces against the French royal army. Henry inherited the throne of France in 1589 upon the death of Henry III. Henry IV initially kept the Protestant faith (the only French king to do so) and had to fight against the Catholic League, which refused to accept a Protestant monarch. After four years of military stalemate, Henry converted to Catholicism, reportedly saying that \"Paris is well worth a Mass\". As a pragmatic politician (\"politique\"), he promulgated the Edict of Nantes (1598), which guaranteed religious liberties to Protestants, thereby effectively ending the French Wars of Religion.\nAn active ruler, Henry worked to regularize state finance, promote agriculture, and encourage education. He began the first successful French colonization of the Americas. He promoted trade and industry, and prioritized the construction of roads, bridges, and canals to facilitate communication within France and strengthen the country's cohesion. These efforts stimulated economic growth and improved living standards.\nWhile the Edict of Nantes brought religious peace to France, some hardline Catholics and Huguenots remained dissatisfied, leading to occasional outbreaks of violence and conspiracies. Henry IV also faced resistance from certain noble factions who opposed his centralization policies, leading to political instability. His main foreign policy success was the Peace of Vervins in 1598, which made peace in the long-running conflict with Spain. He formed a strategic alliance with England. He also forged alliances with Protestant states, such as the Dutch Republic and several German states, to counter the Catholic powers. His policies contributed to the stability and prominence of France in European affairs.\nEarly life.\nHenry was born on the night of 12-to-13 December 1553 at Pau, the capital of the joint Kingdom of Navarre with the sovereign Principality of B\u00e9arn, in his maternal grandfather King Henry II of Navarre's estate, the Ch\u00e2teau de Pau. He was the son of Jeanne III of Navarre (Jeanne d'Albret) and her husband, Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00f4me. As the heir to the throne of Navarre, Henry received the title of Prince of Viana (\"Prince de Viane\"). He was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church a few weeks after his birth, on 6 March 1554, at the chapel of the Ch\u00e2teau de Pau, by Cardinal Georges d'Armagnac. His godfathers were kings Henry II of France and Henry II of Navarre, and his godmothers the Queen of France Catherine de' Medici and Isabella of Navarre, Viscountess of Rohan. During the ceremony, King Henry II of France was represented by the Cardinal de Vend\u00f4me.\nHenry spent part of his early childhood in the countryside of B\u00e9arn at the Ch\u00e2teau de Coarraze. He frequented the peasants during his hunting trips, and acquired the nickname of \"miller of Barbaste\" (\"meunier de Barbaste\"). Faithful to the spirit of Calvinism, Henry's mother Jeanne d'Albret raised him in its strict morality, according to the precepts of the Reformation. On the accession of Charles IX of France in 1561, Henry was brought to live at the French court in Paris by his father Antoine de Bourbon. Henry's parents disagreed on the choice of his religion, with his mother seeking to educate him in Calvinism, and his father in Catholicism.\nWars of Religion.\nDuring the First French War of Religion (1562\u20131563), Henry was moved to Montargis for his safety, where he was placed under the protection of Ren\u00e9e of France. After his father's death and the end of the war, he was kept at the French court as a guarantor of the agreement between the monarchy and the Queen of Navarre. Jeanne d'Albret obtained control of his education from Catherine de' Medici and his appointment as governor of Guyenne in 1563. Between 1564 and 1566, Henry accompanied the French royal family in its grand tour of France, and on this occasion reencountered his mother, whom he had not seen for two years. In 1567, Jeanne d'Albret brought him back to live with her in B\u00e9arn.\nIn 1568, Henry took part as an observer in his first military campaign in Navarre, and continued his military instruction during the Third War of Religion (1568\u20131570). Under the tutelage of Huguenot leader Gaspard II de Coligny, he witnessed the battles of Jarnac, La Roche-l'Abeille, and Moncontour. He saw combat for the first time in 1570, at the Battle of Arnay-le-Duc.\nKing of Navarre.\nFirst marriage and Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre.\nOn 9 June 1572, at the death of his mother Queen Jeanne, the 19-year-old Henry became King of Navarre. Upon his accession, it was arranged for Henry to marry Margaret of Valois, daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici. The wedding took place in Paris on 18 August 1572 on the parvis of Notre Dame Cathedral.\nOn 24 August, the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre began in Paris. Several thousand Protestants who had come to Paris for Henry's wedding were killed, as well as thousands more throughout the country in the days that followed. Henry narrowly escaped death thanks to the help of his wife and his promise to convert to Catholicism. He was forced to live at the court of France, but he escaped in early 1576. On 5 February of that year, he formally abjured Catholicism at Tours and rejoined the Protestant forces in the military conflict. He named his 16-year-old sister, Catherine de Bourbon, regent of B\u00e9arn. Catherine held the regency for nearly thirty years.\nHenry became heir presumptive to the French throne in 1584 upon the death of Francis, Duke of Anjou, brother and heir to the Catholic Henry III, who had succeeded Charles IX in 1574. Given that Henry of Navarre was the next senior agnatic descendant of King Louis IX, King Henry III had no choice but to recognise him as the legitimate successor.\nWar of the Three Henrys (1587\u20131589).\nA conflict for the throne of France then ensued, contested by these three men and their respective supporters:\nSalic law barred inheritance by the king's sisters and all others who could claim descent through only the female line. However, since Henry of Navarre was a Huguenot, many Catholics refused to acknowledge the succession, and France was plunged into a phase of the Wars of Religion known as the War of the Three Henrys (1587\u20131589).\nThe Duke of Guise pushed for complete suppression of the Huguenots and had much support among Catholic loyalists. Political disagreements among the parties set off a series of campaigns and counter-campaigns that culminated in the Battle of Coutras.\nIn December 1588, King Henry III had the Duke of Guise murdered, along with his brother Louis, Cardinal of Guise, thinking the removal of the brothers would restore his authority. However, the populace was horrified and rose against him. The King was no longer recognized in several cities; his effective power was limited to Blois, Tours, and the surrounding districts.\nIn the general chaos, Henry III relied on Henry of Navarre and his Huguenots. The two kings were united by a common interest\u2014to win France from the Catholic League. Henry III recognized the King of Navarre as a true subject and Frenchman, not a fanatic Huguenot aiming to subjugate Catholics, and Catholic royalist nobles also rallied to them. With this combined force, the two kings marched to Paris. The morale of the city was low, and even the Spanish ambassador believed the city could not hold out longer than a fortnight. However, on 2 August 1589, a monk infiltrated Henry III's camp and assassinated him.\nKing of France: Early reign.\nSuccession (1589\u20131594).\nWhen Henry III died, his ninth cousin once removed, Henry of Navarre, nominally became king of France. The Catholic League, however, strengthened by foreign support\u2014especially from Spain\u2014was strong enough to prevent a universal recognition of his new title. Pope Sixtus V excommunicated Henry and declared him ineligible to inherit the crown. Most of the Catholic nobles who had joined Henry III for the siege of Paris also refused to recognize Henry of Navarre, and abandoned him. He set about winning his kingdom by force of arms, aided by English money and German troops. Henry's Catholic uncle Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon was proclaimed king by the League, but the Cardinal was Henry's prisoner at the time. Henry was victorious at the Battle of Arques and the Battle of Ivry, but failed to take Paris after besieging it in 1590.\nWhen Cardinal de Bourbon died in 1590, the League could not agree on a new candidate at the Estates General called to settle the question, also attended by the envoys of Spain. While some supported various Guise candidates, the strongest candidate was probably the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, daughter of Philip II of Spain, whose mother Elisabeth had been the eldest daughter of Henry II of France. In the religious fervor of the time, the Infanta was considered a suitable queen, provided she married a suitable husband. The French overwhelmingly rejected Philip's first choice, Archduke Ernest of Austria, the Emperor's brother, also a member of the House of Habsburg. In case of such opposition, Philip indicated that princes of the House of Lorraine would be acceptable to him: the Duke of Guise; a son of the Duke of Lorraine; and the son of the Duke of Mayenne. The Spanish ambassadors selected the Duke of Guise, to the joy of the League. However, at that moment of seeming victory, the envy of the Duke of Mayenne was aroused, and he blocked the proposed election of a king.\nThe Parlement of Paris also upheld the Salic law. They argued that if the French accepted natural hereditary succession, as proposed by the Spaniards, and accepted a woman as their queen, then the ancient claims of the English kings would be confirmed, and the monarchy of centuries past would be rendered illegal. The Parlement admonished Mayenne, as lieutenant-general, that the kings of France had resisted the interference of the pope in political matters, and that he should not raise a foreign prince or princess to the throne of France under the pretext of religion. Mayenne was angered that he had not been consulted prior to this admonishment, but yielded, since their aim was not contrary to his present views. Despite these setbacks for the League, Henry remained unable to take control of Paris.\nConversion to Catholicism: \"Paris is well worth a Mass\" (1593).\nOn 25 July 1593, with the encouragement of his mistress, , Henry permanently renounced Protestantism and converted to Catholicism to secure his hold on the French crown, thereby earning the resentment of the Huguenots and his ally Elizabeth I of England. He was said to have declared that (\"Paris is well worth a Mass\"), although the attribution is doubtful. His acceptance of Catholicism secured the allegiance of the vast majority of his subjects.\nCoronation and recognition (1594\u20131595).\nReims, traditional coronation place of French kings, was still occupied by the Catholic League, and thus Henry was crowned King of France at the Cathedral of Chartres on 27 February 1594. Pope Clement VIII lifted excommunication from Henry on 17 September 1595. He did not forget his former Calvinist coreligionists, however, and was known for his religious tolerance. In 1598 he issued the Edict of Nantes, which granted circumscribed liberties to the Huguenots.\nCivil war and the Edict of Nantes.\nHenry IV successfully ended the civil wars. He and his ministers appeased Catholic leaders using bribes of about 7 million \u00e9cus, a sum greater than France's annual revenue. In combination with other fiscal problems, the king was faced with a financial crisis by the middle of the 1590s. In response to this crisis, Henry resolved to convene an Assembly of Notables in November 1596 that he hoped would approve the creation of new royal revenues. The assembly approved the creation of a new tax on goods entering towns that would be known as the \"pancarte\", however in 1597 the crown was again rocked by military crisis when the Spanish seized Amiens.\nHuguenot leaders were placated by the Edict of Nantes, which had four separate sections. The articles laid down the tolerance which would be accorded to the Huguenots including the exact places where worship may or may not take place, the recognition of three Protestant universities, and the allowance of Protestant synods. The king also issued two personal documents (called \"brevets\") which recognized the Protestant establishment. The Edict of Nantes signed religious tolerance into law, and the brevets were an act of benevolence that created a Protestant state within France.\nDespite this, it would take years to restore law and order to France. The Edict was met by opposition from the \"parlements\", which objected to the guarantees offered to Protestants. The Parlement de Rouen did not formally register the edict until 1609, although it begrudgingly observed its terms.\nLater reign.\nDomestic policies.\nDuring his reign, Henry IV worked through the minister Maximilien de B\u00e9thune, Duke of Sully, to regularize state finance, promote agriculture, drain swamps, undertake public works, and encourage education. He established the \"Coll\u00e8ge Royal Henri-le-Grand\" in La Fl\u00e8che (today the Prytan\u00e9e Militaire de la Fl\u00e8che). He and Sully protected forests from further devastation, built a system of tree-lined highways, and constructed bridges and canals. He had a 1200-metre canal built in the park at the Ch\u00e2teau Fontainebleau (which may be fished today) and ordered the planting of pines, elms, and fruit trees.\nThe King restored Paris as a great city, with the Pont Neuf, which still stands today, constructed over the river Seine to connect the Right and Left Banks of the city. Henry IV also built the \"Place Royale\" (known since 1800 as Place des Vosges), and added the \"Grande Galerie\" to the Louvre Palace. Stretching more than 400 metres along the Seine river bank, at the time it was the longest edifice of its kind in the world. He promoted the arts among all classes of people, and invited hundreds of artists and craftsmen to live and work on the building's lower floors. This tradition continued for another two hundred years, until ended by Napoleon I. The art and architecture of his reign have become known as the Henry IV style.\nEconomically, Henry IV sought to reduce imports of foreign goods to support domestic manufacturing. To this end, new sumptuary laws limited the use of imported gold and silver cloth. He also built royal factories to produce luxuries such as crystal glass, silk, satin, and tapestries (at Gobelins Manufactory and Savonnerie manufactory workshops). The king re-established silk weaving in Tours and Lyon, and increased linen production in Picardy and Brittany. He had distributed 16,000 free copies of the practical manual \"The Theatre of Agriculture\" by Olivier de Serres.\nKing Henry's vision extended beyond France, and he financed several expeditions of Samuel de Champlain and Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts, to North America. France laid claim to New France (now Canada).\nInternational relations.\nDuring the reign of Henry IV, rivalry continued among France, Habsburg Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire for the mastery of Western Europe. The conflict was not resolved until after the Thirty Years' War.\nSpain and Italy.\nDuring Henry's struggle for the crown, Spain had been the principal backer of the Catholic League, and it tried to thwart Henry. Under the Duke of Parma, an army from the Spanish Netherlands intervened in 1590 against Henry and foiled his siege of Paris. Another Spanish army helped the Catholic League nobles opposing Henry to win the Battle of Craon in 1592. The Spanish war was not ended with Henry's coronation, but after his victory at the Siege of Amiens in September 1597, the Peace of Vervins was signed in 1598. This freed his armies to settle the dispute with the Duchy of Savoy, ending with the Treaty of Lyon of 1601, which arranged territorial exchanges.\nOne of Henry's major problems was the Spanish Road which traversed Spanish territory through Savoy to the Low Countries. His first opportunity to cut the Spanish Road was a dispute over the ownership of the Marquisate of Saluzzo. The last marquis left Saluzzo to the French crown in 1548 (when Savoy was occupied by France), but the territory became disputed during the chaos of the Wars of Religion. The pope was asked to arbitrate between the claims of France and the Duke of Savoy. The Duke offered to cede Bresse to France if he could retain Saluzzo. Henri IV accepted this, but Spain objected that Bresse was a vital part of the Spanish Road, and persuaded the Duke to reject the decision. Henry IV was already at Lyon and had soldiers ready, and four days later he marched fifty thousand men against the duchy, occupying almost all of its area west of the Alps. In January 1601, Henry accepted another offer of papal arbitration and gained not only Bresse, but Bugey and Gex. Savoy retained a narrow corridor through the Val de Ch\u00e9zery. This still allowed Spanish troops to cross from Lombardy to Franche Comt\u00e9 without going through France, but it created a choke point where the Spanish Road was a single bridge across the Rh\u00f4ne River.\nThe Saluzzo conflict was Henry IV's last major military operation, but he continued to finance Spain's enemies. He generously assisted the Dutch Republic with over 12 million livres between 1598 and 1610. In some years, the payment was 10% of France's total annual budget. France also sent subsidies to Geneva after the Duke of Savoy attempted to capture the city in 1602.\nHoly Roman Empire.\nIn 1609, the death of the childless Johann William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg, meant that the succession of the wealthy Duchies was in dispute. Henry aimed to maintain peace among the Protestant princes of the Holy Roman Empire to present a united front against the Habsburgs. To achieve this, Henry encouraged a peaceful settlement over the succession between the two main Protestant claimants: Wolfgang Wilhelm of Palatinate-Neuburg and Johann Sigismund of Brandenburg. He communicated this with Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, a significant Protestant leader, who then sought to facilitate an agreement between Wolfgang and Johann Sigismund. When peace was negotiated in the Treaty of Dortmund, Henry sent congratulatory messages to the Protestant claimants, and voiced his support, particularly against the Habsburgs who were likely to challenge the treaty.\nWhen Habsburg forces invaded J\u00fclich, starting the War of the J\u00fclich Succession, Henry decided to act. On 29 July, after consulting his advisors, Henry ordered a French army to support the Protestant claimants. Maximilien de B\u00e9thune, Duke of Sully, his financial advisor, was particularly keen on joining the war, as France's finances at the time were secure. Henry declared that he was defending the rights of the Imperial princes, and also that he was honoring his previously agreements to defend the Protestant claimants. Henry also was seeking to curb the power of the Habsburgs.\nHenry's actions faced critique. Some saw him as a warmonger. The Papacy in particular was concerned that Henry was supporting Protestant princes. Henry responded to the papacy declaring that he was keeping the peace. When Habsburg ambassadors told Henry that he was contributing to the decline of Catholicism by supporting the Protestant claimants, Henry declared that he was merely trying to contain the Habsburgs. He also warned the Papacy to keep religion out of succession affairs. France assured the Protestant princes of the Empire that despite being Catholic, the French would still provide aid. Henry also sought to gain the aid of the English and Dutch. Henry greatly pressured the Dutch for support, appealing directly to states-general.\nDespite Henry's defense of the Protestant princes during the J\u00fclich War, many of the German states distrusted him. Afterall, Henry had converted to Catholicism in 1593. Also, France owed debts to some German states, which France struggled to repay. There were also concerns that Henry sought to become Emperor. It was widely believed that in 1610 Henry was preparing to escalate the war against the Holy Roman Empire, which was prevented by his assassination and the subsequent rapprochement with Spain under the regency of Marie de' Medici. \nOttoman Empire.\nEven before Henry's accession to the French throne, the French Huguenots were in contact with Aragonese Moriscos in plans against the Habsburg government of Spain in the 1570s. Around 1575, plans were made for a combined attack of Aragonese Moriscos and Huguenots from B\u00e9arn under Henry against Spanish Aragon, in agreement with the Dey of Algiers and the Ottoman Empire, but this project floundered with the arrival of John of Austria in Aragon and the disarmament of the Moriscos. In 1576, a three-pronged Ottoman fleet from Constantinople was planned to disembark between Murcia and Valencia while the French Huguenots would invade from the north and the Moriscos accomplish their uprising, but the fleet failed to arrive.\nAfter his crowning, Henry continued the policy of a Franco-Ottoman alliance and received an embassy from Sultan Mehmed III in 1601. In 1604, a \"Peace Treaty and Capitulation\" was signed between Henry IV and the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I, granting France numerous advantages in the Ottoman Empire. In 1606\u201307, Henry IV sent Arnoult de Lisle as Ambassador to Morocco to request the observance of past friendship treaties. An embassy was sent to Ottoman Tunisia in 1608 led by Fran\u00e7ois Savary de Br\u00e8ves.\nEast Asia.\nUnder Henry IV, various enterprises were set up to develop long-distance trade. In December 1600, a company was formed through the association of Saint-Malo, Laval, and Vitr\u00e9 to trade with the Moluccas and Japan. Two ships, the \"Croissant\" and the \"Corbin\", were sent around the Cape of Good Hope in May 1601. The \"Corbin\" was wrecked in the Maldives, leading to the adventure of Fran\u00e7ois Pyrard de Laval, who managed to return to France in 1611. The \"Croissant\", carrying Fran\u00e7ois Martin de Vitr\u00e9, reached Ceylon and traded with Aceh in Sumatra, but was captured by the Dutch on the return leg at Cape Finisterre. Fran\u00e7ois Martin de Vitr\u00e9 was the first Frenchman to write an account of travels to the Far East in 1604, at the request of Henry IV.\nFrom 1604 to 1609, following the return of Fran\u00e7ois Martin de Vitr\u00e9, Henry attempted to set up a French East India Company on the model of England and the Netherlands. On 1 June 1604, he issued letters patent to Dieppe merchants to form the first French East Indies Company, giving them exclusive rights to Asian trade for 15 years, but no ships were sent until 1616. In 1609, another adventurer, Pierre-Olivier Malherbe, returned from a circumnavigation of the globe and informed Henry of his adventures. He had visited China and India, and met with Emperor Akbar.\nReligion.\nHistorians have assessed that Henry IV was a convinced Calvinist, and only changed his formal religious confession to achieve his political goals. Henry IV was baptized as a Catholic on 5 January 1554. He was raised in the Reformed Tradition by his mother Jeanne III of Navarre. In 1572, after the massacre of French Calvinists, he was forced by Catherine de' Medici and the royal court to convert. In 1576, after escaping from Paris, he abjured Catholicism and returned to Calvinism. In 1593, to gain recognition as King of France, he converted again to Catholicism. Although a formal Catholic, he valued his Calvinist upbringing and was tolerant toward the Huguenots until his death in 1610, and issued the Edict of Nantes which granted them many concessions.\nNicknames.\nHenry was nicknamed \"Henri\" \"le Grand\" (the Great), and in France is also called \"le bon roi Henri\" (good king Henry) and \"le vert galant\" (The Green Gallant) for his numerous mistresses. In English he is most often referred to as Henry of Navarre.\nRelationship with Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency.\nIn 1609, Henry had grown infatuated with Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, Princess of Cond\u00e9, much to the chagrin of her husband, Henry II, Prince of Cond\u00e9. On 28 November 1609, the Prince and Princess fled to Brussels in the Spanish Netherlands. King Henry was furious, and believed that the Prince was conspiring against him, so he threatened to raise an army of 60,000 to capture him and bring back the princess. This corresponded with the War of the J\u00fclich Succession, so it added to the tension, especially with Spain.\nAssassination.\nThough generally well-liked, Henry was considered a heretical usurper by some Catholics and a traitor to their faith by some Protestants. Henry was the target of at least 12 assassination attempts, including by Pierre Barri\u00e8re in August 1593, and by Jean Ch\u00e2tel in December 1594.\nHenry was killed in Paris on 14 May 1610 by Fran\u00e7ois Ravaillac, a Catholic zealot who stabbed him while his coach was stopped on Rue de la Ferronnerie. The carriage was stopped by traffic congestion associated with the Queen's coronation ceremony, as depicted in the engraving by Gaspar Bouttats. Hercule de Rohan, riding in the coach with the king, was wounded in the attack but survived. Ravaillac was immediately seized, and executed days later. Henry was buried at the Saint Denis Basilica. His widow, Marie de' Medici, served as regent for their nine-year-old son, Louis XIII, until 1617.\nLegacy.\nIn 1614, four years after Henry IV's death, his statue was erected on the Pont Neuf. During the early phase of the French Revolution, when it aimed to create a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic, Henry IV was held up as a model for King Louis XVI. When the Revolution radicalized and came to reject monarchy altogether, Henry IV's statue was torn down along with other royal monuments. It was nevertheless the first to be rebuilt, in 1818, and it still stands on the Pont Neuf today.\nHenry IV was much lauded during the Bourbon Restoration (1814\u201330), as the restored dynasty was keen to play down the controversial reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI in favor of Good King Henry. The song Marche Henri IV (Long Live Henry IV) was popular. After the assassination in 1820 of the indirect heir to the throne, Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, by a Republican fanatic, his widow Princess Caroline gave birth seven months later to their son, heir to the throne of France, and conspicuously named him \"Henri\" after his royal forefather. \nThe boy was baptised with Juran\u00e7on wine and garlic in the tradition of B\u00e9arn and Navarre, as Henry IV had been baptised in Pau. Henry serves as a loose inspiration for the character Ferdinand, King of Navarre, in William Shakespeare's 1590s play \"Love's Labour's Lost\".\nA 1661 biography, \"Histoire du Roy Henry le Grand,\" was written by Hardouin de P\u00e9r\u00e9fixe de Beaumont for the edification of Henry's grandson Louis XIV. A 1663 English translation was published for another grandson, King Charles II of England. On 14 September 1788, when anti-tax riots broke out during the incipient French Revolution, rioters stopped travellers and demanded they dismount to salute Henry IV's statue. Henry's minister Sully published his \"Royal Economies\" in 1611 after de Sully's fall from power, but subsequent research has shown that it exaggerates the economic accomplishments of Sully's ministry. Many of the official source documents were altered, or even forged to make them more impressive.\nMarriages and legitimate children.\nOn 18 August 1572, Henry married his second cousin Margaret of Valois. The marriage was not a happy one, and the couple was childless. Henry and Margaret separated even before Henry acceded to the throne in August 1589; Margaret retired to the Ch\u00e2teau d'Usson in the Auvergne and lived there for many years. After Henry became king of France, it was of the utmost importance that he provide an heir to the crown to avoid the problem of a disputed succession.\nHenry favoured the idea of obtaining an annulment of his marriage to Margaret and marrying his mistress Gabrielle d'Estr\u00e9es, who had already borne him three children. Henry's councillors strongly opposed this idea, but the matter was resolved unexpectedly by Gabrielle's sudden death in the early hours of 10 April 1599, after she had given birth to a premature stillborn son. His marriage to Margaret was annulled in 1599. On 17 December 1600, Henry married Marie de' Medici, daughter of Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Archduchess Joanna of Austria.\nFor the royal entry of Marie into Avignon on 19 November 1600, the citizens bestowed on Henry the title of the \"Hercule Gaulois\" (\"Gallic Hercules\"), concocting a genealogy that traced the House of Navarre back to a nephew of Hercules' son Hispalus. His marriage to Marie de' Medici produced six children:\nArmorial.\nThe arms of Henry IV changed throughout his lifetime:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFiction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
