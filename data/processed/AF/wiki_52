Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (often referred to simply as Sgt. Pepper) is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26May 1967, \"Sgt. Pepper\" is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the roles of sound composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record sleeves, and the producer in popular music. The album had an immediate cross-generational impact and was associated with numerous touchstones of the era's youth culture, such as fashion, drugs, mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment. Critics lauded the album for its innovations in songwriting, production and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture.\nAt the end of August 1966, the Beatles had permanently retired from touring and pursued individual interests for the next three months. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band, forming the impetus of the \"Sgt. Pepper\" concept. For this project, they continued the technological experimentation marked by their previous album, \"Revolver\" (1966), this time without an absolute deadline for completion. Sessions began on 24November at EMI Studios with compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, but after pressure from EMI, the songs \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\" were released as a double A-side single in February 1967 and left off the LP. The album was then loosely conceptualised as a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band, an idea that was conceived after recording the title track. \nA landmark work of British psychedelia, \"Sgt. Pepper\" is considered one of the first art rock LPs and a progenitor to progressive rock. It incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. With assistance from producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, many of the recordings were coloured with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" and \"A Day in the Life\". Recording was completed on 21April. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities and historical figures, was designed by the pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth.\n\"Sgt. Pepper\"'s release was a defining moment in pop culture, heralding the album era and the 1967 Summer of Love, while its reception achieved full cultural legitimisation for popular music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form. The first Beatles album to be released with the same track listing in both the UK and the US, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the \"Record Retailer\" chart in the United Kingdom and 15 weeks at number one on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart in the United States. In 1968, it won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honour; in 2003, it was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It has topped several critics' and listeners' polls for the best album of all time, including those published by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine and in the book \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\", and the UK's \"Music of the Millennium\" poll. More than 32 million copies had been sold worldwide as of 2011. It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time and was, as of 2018, the UK's best-selling studio album. A of the album was released in 2017.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little mop-top approach. We were not boys, we were men\u00a0... and thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers. \n\u2013 Paul McCartney\nBy late 1965, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \"send out four waxworks\u00a0... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\" In June 1966, two days after finishing the album \"Revolver\", the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.\nThe publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \"more popular than Jesus\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released \"Revolver\" LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.\nOn the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up. George Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but he was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film \"The Family Way\" and holidayed in Kenya with Mal Evans, one of the Beatles' tour managers. Lennon acted in the film \"How I Won the War\" and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.\nInspiration and conception.\nWhile in London without his bandmates, McCartney took the hallucinogenic drug LSD (or \"acid\") for the first time, having long resisted Lennon and Harrison's insistence that he join them and Starr in experiencing its perception-heightening effects. According to author Jonathan Gould, this initiation into LSD afforded McCartney the \"expansive new sense of possibility\" that defined the group's next project, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". Gould adds that McCartney's succumbing to peer pressure allowed Lennon \"to play the role of psychedelic guide\" to his songwriting partner, thereby facilitating a closer collaboration between the two than had been evident since early in the Beatles' career. For his part, Lennon had turned deeply introspective during the filming of \"How I Won the War\" in southern Spain in September 1966. His anxiety over his and the Beatles' future was reflected in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", a song that provided the initial theme, regarding a Liverpool childhood, of the new album. On his return to London, Lennon embraced the city's arts culture, of which McCartney was a part, and shared his bandmate's interest in avant-garde and electronic-music composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage and Luciano Berio.\nIn November, during his and Evans's return flight from Kenya, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the \"Sgt. Pepper\" concept. His idea involved an Edwardian-era military band, for which Evans invented a name in the style of contemporary San Francisco-based groups such as Big Brother and the Holding Company and Quicksilver Messenger Service. In February 1967, McCartney suggested that the new album should represent a performance by the fictional band. This alter ego group would give them the freedom to experiment musically by releasing them from their image as Beatles. Martin recalled that the concept was not discussed at the start of the sessions, but it subsequently gave the album \"a life of its own\".\nPortions of \"Sgt. Pepper\" reflect the Beatles' general immersion in the blues, Motown and other American popular musical traditions. The author Ian MacDonald writes that when reviewing their rivals' recent work in late 1966, the Beatles identified the most significant LP as the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\", which Brian Wilson, the band's leader, had created in response to the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\". McCartney was highly impressed with the \"harmonic structures\" and choice of instruments used on \"Pet Sounds\", and said that these elements encouraged him to think the Beatles could \"get further out\" than the Beach Boys had. He identified \"Pet Sounds\" as his main musical inspiration for \"Sgt. Pepper\", adding that \"[we] nicked a few ideas\", although he felt it lacked the avant-garde quality he was seeking. \"Freak Out!\" by the Mothers of Invention has also been cited as having influenced \"Sgt. Pepper\". According to the biographer Philip Norman, during the recording sessions McCartney repeatedly stated: \"This is our \"Freak Out!\"\" The music journalist Chet Flippo stated that McCartney was inspired to record a concept album after hearing \"Freak Out!\"\nIndian music was another touchstone on \"Sgt. Pepper\", principally for Lennon and Harrison. In a 1967 interview, Harrison said that the Beatles' ongoing success had encouraged them to continue developing musically and that, given their standing, \"We can do things that please us without conforming to the standard pop idea. We are not only involved in pop music, but all music.\" McCartney envisioned the Beatles' alter egos being able to \"do a bit of B. B. King, a bit of Stockhausen, a bit of Albert Ayler, a bit of Ravi Shankar, a bit of \"Pet Sounds\", a bit of the Doors\". He saw the group as \"pushing frontiers\" similar to other composers of the time, even though the Beatles did not \"necessarily like what, say, Berio was doing\".\nRecording and production.\nRecording history.\nSessions began on 24 November 1966 in Studio Two at EMI Studios (subsequently Abbey Road Studios), marking the first time that the Beatles had come together since September. Afforded the luxury of a nearly limitless recording budget, and with no absolute deadline for completion, the band booked open-ended sessions that started at 7\u00a0pm and allowed them to work as late as they wanted. They began with \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", followed by two other songs that were thematically linked to their childhoods: \"When I'm Sixty-Four\", the first session for which took place on 6 December, and \"Penny Lane\".\n\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\" were subsequently released as a double A-side in February 1967 after EMI and Epstein pressured Martin for a single. When it failed to reach number one in the UK, British press agencies speculated that the group's run of success might have ended, with headlines such as \"Beatles Fail to Reach the Top\", \"First Time in Four Years\" and \"Has the Bubble Burst?\" In keeping with the band's approach to their previously issued singles, the songs were then excluded from \"Sgt. Pepper\". Martin later described the decision to drop these two songs as \"the biggest mistake of my professional life\". In his judgment, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", which he and the band spent an unprecedented 55 hours of studio time recording, \"set the agenda for the whole album\". He explained: \"It was going to be a record\u00a0... [with songs that] couldn't be performed live: they were designed to be studio productions and that was the difference.\" McCartney declared: \"Now our performance is that record.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMusic papers started to slag us off\u00a0... because [\"Sgt. Pepper\"] took five months to record, and I remember the great glee seeing in one of the papers how the Beatles have dried up\u00a0... and I was sitting rubbing my hands, saying \"You just wait.\"\n\u2013 Paul McCartney\nAccording to the musicologist Walter Everett, \"Sgt. Pepper\" marks the beginning of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote more than half of the album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions. In an effort to get the right sound, the Beatles attempted numerous re-takes of McCartney's song \"Getting Better\". When the decision was made to re-record the basic track, Starr was summoned to the studio, but called off soon afterwards as the focus switched from rhythm to vocal tracking. Much of the bass guitar on the album was mixed upfront. Preferring to overdub his bass part last, McCartney tended to play other instruments when recording a song's backing track. This approach afforded him the time to devise bass lines that were melodically adventurous \u2013 one of the qualities he especially admired in Wilson's work on \"Pet Sounds\" \u2013 and complemented the song's final arrangement. McCartney played keyboard instruments such as piano, grand piano and Lowrey organ, in addition to electric guitar on some songs, while Martin variously contributed on Hohner Pianet, harpsichord and harmonium. Lennon's songs similarly showed a preference for keyboard instruments.\nAlthough Harrison's role as lead guitarist was limited during the sessions, Everett considers that \"his contribution to the album is strong in several ways.\" He provided Indian instrumentation in the form of sitar, tambura and swarmandal, and Martin credited him with being the most committed of the Beatles in striving for new sounds. Starr's adoption of loose calfskin heads for his tom-toms ensured his drum kit had a deeper timbre than he had previously achieved with plastic heads. As on \"Revolver\", the Beatles increasingly used session musicians, particularly for classical-inspired arrangements. Norman comments that Lennon's prominent vocal on some of McCartney's songs \"hugely enhanced their atmosphere\", particularly \"Lovely Rita\".\nWithin an hour of completing the last overdubs on the album's songs, on 20 April 1967, the group returned to Harrison's \"Only a Northern Song\", the basic track of which they had taped in February. The Beatles overdubbed random sounds and instrumentation before submitting it as the first of four new songs they were contracted to supply to United Artists for inclusion in the animated film \"Yellow Submarine\". In author Mark Lewisohn's description, it was a \"curious\" session, but one that demonstrated the Beatles' \"tremendous appetite for recording\". During the \"Sgt. Pepper\" sessions, the band also recorded \"Carnival of Light\", a McCartney-led experimental piece created for the Million Volt Light and Sound Rave, held at the Roundhouse Theatre on 28 January and 4 February. The album was completed on 21 April with the recording of random noises and voices that were included on the run-out groove, preceded by a high-pitched tone that could be heard by dogs but was inaudible to most human ears.\nStudio ambience and happenings.\nThe Beatles sought to inject an atmosphere of celebration into the recording sessions. Weary of the bland look inside EMI, they introduced psychedelic lighting to the studio space, including a device on which five red fluorescent tubes were fixed to a microphone stand, a lava lamp, a red darkroom lamp, and a stroboscope, the last of which they soon abandoned. Harrison later said the studio became the band's clubhouse for \"Sgt. Pepper\"; David Crosby, Mick Jagger and Donovan were among the musician friends who visited them there. The band members also dressed up in psychedelic fashions, leading one session trumpeter to wonder whether they were in costume for a new film. Drug-taking was prevalent during the sessions, with Martin later recalling that the group would steal away to \"have something\".\nThe 10 February session for orchestral overdubs on \"A Day in the Life\" was staged as a happening typical of the London avant-garde scene. The Beatles invited numerous friends and the session players wore formal dinner-wear augmented with fancy-dress props. Overseen by NEMS employee Tony Bramwell, the proceedings were filmed on seven handheld cameras, with the band doing some of the filming. Following this event, the group considered making a television special based on the album. Each of the songs was to be represented with a clip directed by a different director, but the cost of recording \"Sgt. Pepper\" made the idea prohibitive to EMI. For the 15 March session for \"Within You Without You\", Studio Two was transformed with Indian carpets placed on the walls, dimmed lighting and burning incense to evoke the requisite Indian mood. Lennon described the session as a \"great swinging evening\" with \"400 Indian fellas\" among the guests.\nThe Beatles took an acetate disc of the completed album to the flat of American singer Cass Elliot, off King's Road in Chelsea. There, at six in the morning, they played it at full volume with speakers set in open window frames. The group's friend and former press agent, Derek Taylor, remembered that residents of the neighbourhood opened their windows and listened without complaint to what they understood to be unreleased Beatles music.\nTechnical aspects.\nIn his book on ambient music, \"The Ambient Century\", Mark Prendergast views \"Sgt. Pepper\" as the Beatles' \"homage\" to Stockhausen and Cage, adding that its \"rich, tape-manipulated sound\" shows the influence of electronic and experimental composer Pierre Schaeffer. Martin recalled that \"Sgt. Pepper\" \"grew naturally out of \"Revolver\"\", marking \"an era of almost continuous technological experimentation\". The album was recorded using four-track equipment, since eight-track tape recorders were not operational in commercial studios in London until late 1967. As with previous Beatles albums, the \"Sgt. Pepper\" recordings made extensive use of reduction mixing, a technique in which one to four tracks from one recorder are mixed and dubbed down onto a master four-track machine, enabling the engineers to give the group a virtual multitrack studio. EMI's Studer J37 four-track machines were well suited to reduction mixing, as the high quality of the recordings that they produced minimised the increased noise associated with the process. When recording the orchestra for \"A Day in the Life\", Martin synchronised a four-track recorder playing the Beatles' backing track to another one taping the orchestral overdub. The engineer Ken Townsend devised a method for accomplishing this by using a 50\u00a0Hz control signal between the two machines.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nListening to each stage of their recording, once they've done the first couple of tracks, it's often hard to see what they're still looking for, it sounds so complete. Often the final complicated, well-layered version seems to have drowned the initial simple melody. But they know it's not right, even if they can't put it into words. Their dedication is impressive, gnawing away at the same song for stretches of ten hours each.\n\u2013 Hunter Davies, 1968\nThe production on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" was especially complex, involving the innovative splicing of two takes that were recorded in different tempos and pitches. Emerick remembers that during the recording of \"Revolver\", \"we had got used to being asked to do the impossible, and we knew that the word 'no' didn't exist in the Beatles' vocabulary.\" A key feature of \"Sgt. Pepper\" is Martin and Emerick's liberal use of signal processing to shape the sound of the recording, which included the application of dynamic range compression, reverb and signal limiting. Relatively new modular effects units were used, such as running voices and instruments through a Leslie speaker. Several innovative production techniques feature prominently on the recordings, including direct injection, pitch control and ambiophonics. The bass part on \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" was the first example of the Beatles recording via direct injection (DI), which Townsend devised as a method for plugging electric guitars directly into the recording console. In Kenneth Womack's opinion, the use of DI on the album's title track \"afforded McCartney's bass with richer textures and tonal clarity\".\nSome of the mixing employed automatic double tracking (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. ADT was invented by Townsend during the \"Revolver\" sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who regularly expressed a desire for a technical alternative to having to record doubled lead vocals. Another important effect was varispeeding, a technique that the Beatles used extensively on \"Revolver\". Martin cites \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" as having the most variations of tape speed on \"Sgt. Pepper\". During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed. For the album's title track, the recording of Starr's drum kit was enhanced by the use of damping and close-miking. MacDonald credits the new recording technique with creating a \"three-dimensional\" sound that, along with other Beatles innovations, engineers in the US would soon adopt as standard practice.\nArtistic experimentation, such as the placement of random gibberish in the run-out groove, became one of the album's defining features. \"Sgt. Pepper\" was the first pop album to be mastered without the momentary gaps that are typically placed between tracks as a point of demarcation. It made use of two crossfades that blended songs together, giving the impression of a continuous live performance. Although both stereo and monaural mixes of the album were prepared, the Beatles were minimally involved in what they regarded as the less important stereo mix sessions, leaving the task to Martin and Emerick. Emerick recalls: \"We spent three weeks on the mono mixes and maybe three days on the stereo.\" Most listeners ultimately heard only the stereo version. He estimates that the group spent 700 hours on the LP, more than 30 times that of the first Beatles album, \"Please Please Me\", which cost \u00a3400 to produce. The final cost of \"Sgt. Pepper\" was approximately \u00a325,000 ().\nBand dynamics.\nAuthor Robert Rodriguez writes that while Lennon, Harrison and Starr embraced the creative freedom afforded by McCartney's band-within-a-band idea, they \"went along with the concept with varying degrees of enthusiasm\". Studio personnel recalled that Lennon had \"never seemed so happy\" as during the \"Sgt. Pepper\" sessions. In a 1969 interview with Barry Miles, however, Lennon said he was depressed and that while McCartney was \"full of confidence\", he was \"going through murder\". Lennon explained his view of the album's concept: \"Paul said, 'Come and see the show', I didn't. I said, 'I read the news today, oh boy.'\"\nEverett describes Starr as having been \"largely bored\" during the sessions, with the drummer later lamenting: \"The biggest memory I have of \"Sgt. Pepper\"\u00a0... is I learned to play chess\". In \"The Beatles Anthology\", Harrison said he had little interest in McCartney's concept of a fictitious group and that, after his experiences in India, \"my heart was still out there... I was losing interest in being 'fab' at that point.\" Harrison added that, having enjoyed recording \"Rubber Soul\" and \"Revolver\", he disliked how the group's approach on \"Sgt. Pepper\" became \"an assembly process\" whereby, \"A lot of the time it ended up with just Paul playing the piano and Ringo keeping the tempo, and we weren't allowed to play as a band as much.\"\nIn Lewisohn's opinion, \"Sgt. Pepper\" represents the group's last unified effort, displaying a cohesion that deteriorated immediately following the album's completion and entirely disappeared by the release of \"The Beatles\" (also known as the \"White Album\") in 1968. Martin recalled in 1987 that throughout the making of \"Sgt. Pepper\", \"There was a very good spirit at that time between all the Beatles and ourselves. We were all conscious that we were doing something that was great.\" He said that while McCartney effectively led the project, and sometimes annoyed his bandmates, \"Paul appreciated John's contribution on \"Pepper\". In terms of quantity, it wasn't great, but in terms of quality, it was enormous.\"\nSongs.\nOverview.\nAmong musicologists, Allan Moore says that \"Sgt. Pepper\" is composed mainly of rock and pop music, while Michael Hannan and Naphtali Wagner both see it as an album of various genres; Hannan says it features \"a broad variety of musical and theatrical genres\". According to Hannan and Wagner, the music incorporates the stylistic influences of rock and roll, vaudeville, big band, piano jazz, blues, chamber, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. Wagner feels the album's music reconciles the \"diametrically opposed aesthetic ideals\" of classical and psychedelia, achieving a \"psycheclassical synthesis\" of the two forms. Musicologist John Covach describes \"Sgt. Pepper\" as \"proto-progressive\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe didn't really shove the LP full of pot and drugs but, I mean, there was an effect. We were more consciously trying to keep it out. You wouldn't say, \"I had some acid, baby, so groovy,\" but there was a feeling that something had happened between \"Revolver\" and \"Sgt. Pepper\".\n\u2013 John Lennon, 1968\nAccording to author George Case, all of the songs on \"Sgt. Pepper\" were perceived by contemporary listeners as being drug-inspired, with 1967 marking the pinnacle of LSD's influence on pop music. Shortly before the album's release, the BBC banned \"A Day in the Life\" from British radio because of the phrase \"I'd love to turn you on\"; the BBC stated that it could \"encourage a permissive attitude towards drug-taking\". Although Lennon and McCartney denied any drug-related interpretation of the song at the time, McCartney later suggested that the line referred to either drugs or sex. The meaning of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" became the subject of speculation, as many believed that the title was code for LSD. In \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\", the reference to \"Henry the Horse\" contains two common slang terms for heroin. Fans speculated that Henry the Horse was a drug dealer and \"Fixing a Hole\" was a reference to heroin use. Others noted lyrics such as \"I get high\" from \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", \"take some tea\" \u2013 slang for cannabis use \u2013 from \"Lovely Rita\", and \"digging the weeds\" from \"When I'm Sixty-Four\".\nThe author Sheila Whiteley attributes \"Sgt. Pepper\"'s underlying philosophy not only to the drug culture, but also to metaphysics and the non-violent approach of the flower power movement. The musicologist Oliver Julien views the album as an embodiment of \"the social, the musical, and more generally, the cultural changes of the 1960s\". The album's primary value, according to Moore, is its ability to \"capture, more vividly than almost anything contemporaneous, its own time and place\". Whiteley agrees, crediting the album with \"provid[ing] a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love\". Several scholars have applied a hermeneutic strategy to their analysis of \"Sgt. Pepper\"'s lyrics, identifying loss of innocence and the dangers of overindulgence in fantasies or illusions as the most prominent themes.\nSide one.\n\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" opens with the title track, starting with 10 seconds of the combined sounds of a pit orchestra warming up and an audience waiting for a concert, creating the illusion of the album as a live performance. McCartney serves as the master of ceremonies, welcoming the audience to a twentieth-anniversary reunion concert by Sgt. Pepper's band, who, led by Lennon, then sing a message of appreciation for the crowd's warm response. Womack says the lyric bridges the fourth wall between the artist and their audience. He argues that, paradoxically, the lyrics \"exemplify the mindless rhetoric of rock concert banter\" while \"mock[ing] the very notion of a pop album's capacity for engendering authentic interconnection between artist and audience\". In his view, the mixed message ironically serves to distance the group from their fans while simultaneously \"gesturing toward\" them as alter egos.\nThe song's five-bar bridge is filled by a French horn quartet. Womack credits the recording's use of a brass ensemble with distorted electric guitars as an early example of rock fusion. MacDonald agrees, describing the track as an overture rather than a song, and a \"fusion of Edwardian variety orchestra\" and contemporary hard rock. Hannan describes the track's unorthodox stereo mix as \"typical of the album\", with the lead vocal in the right speaker during the verses, but in the left during the chorus and middle eight. McCartney returns as the master of ceremonies near the end of the song, announcing the entrance of an alter ego named Billy Shears.\n\"With a Little Help from My Friends\".\nThe title track segues into \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" amid the sound of screaming fans recorded during a Beatles concert at the Hollywood Bowl. In his role as Billy Shears, Starr contributes a baritone lead vocal that Womack credits with imparting an element of \"earnestness in sharp contrast with the ironic distance of the title track\". Written by Lennon and McCartney, the song's lyrics centre on a theme of questions, beginning with Starr asking the audience whether they would leave if he sang out of tune. In the call-and-response style, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison go on to ask their bandmate questions about the meaning of friendship and true love; by the final verse, Starr provides unequivocal answers. In MacDonald's opinion, the lyric is \"at once communal and personal\u00a0... [and] meant as a gesture of inclusivity; everyone could join in.\" Everett comments that the track's use of a major key double-plagal cadence became commonplace in pop music following the release of \"Sgt. Pepper\".\n\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\nDespite widespread suspicion that the title of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" contained a hidden reference to LSD, Lennon insisted that it was derived from a pastel drawing by his four-year-old son Julian. A hallucinatory chapter from Lewis Carroll's 1871 novel \"Through the Looking-Glass\", a favourite of Lennon's, inspired the song's atmosphere. According to MacDonald, \"the lyric explicitly recreates the psychedelic experience\".\nThe first verse begins with what Womack characterises as \"an invitation in the form of an imperative\" through the line: \"Picture yourself in a boat on a river\", and continues with imaginative imagery, including \"tangerine trees\", \"rocking horse people\" and \"newspaper taxis\". The musical backing includes a phrase played by McCartney on a Lowrey organ, treated with ADT to sound like a celeste, and tambura drone. Harrison also contributed a lead guitar part that doubles Lennon's vocal over the verses in the style of a sarangi player accompanying an Indian khyal singer. The music critic Tim Riley identifies the track as a moment \"in the album, [where] the material world is completely clouded in the mythical by both text and musical atmosphere\".\n\"Getting Better\".\nMacDonald considers \"Getting Better\" to contain \"the most ebullient performance\" on \"Sgt. Pepper\". Womack credits the track's \"driving rock sound\" with distinguishing it from the album's overtly psychedelic material; its lyrics inspire the listener \"to usurp the past by living well and flourishing in the present\". He cites it as a strong example of Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, particularly Lennon's addition of the line \"It can't get no worse\", which serves as a \"sarcastic rejoinder\" to McCartney's chorus: \"It's getting better all the time\". Lennon's contribution to the lyric also includes a confessional regarding his having been violent with female companions: \"I used to be cruel to my woman\". In Womack's opinion, the song encourages the listener to follow the speaker's example and \"alter their own angst-ridden ways\": \"Man I was mean, but I'm changing my scene and I'm doing the best that I can.\"\n\"Fixing a Hole\".\n\"Fixing a Hole\" deals with McCartney's desire to let his mind wander freely and to express his creativity without the burden of self-conscious insecurities. Womack interprets the lyric as \"the speaker's search for identity among the crowd\", in particular the \"quests for consciousness and connection\" that differentiate individuals from society as a whole. MacDonald characterises it as a \"distracted and introverted track\", during which McCartney forgoes his \"usual smooth design\" in favour of \"something more preoccupied\". He cites Harrison's electric guitar solo as serving the track well, capturing its mood by conveying detachment. Womack notes McCartney's adaptation of the lyric \"a hole in the roof where the rain leaks in\" from Elvis Presley's \"We're Gonna Move\".\n\"She's Leaving Home\".\nIn Everett's view, the lyrics to \"She's Leaving Home\" address the problem of alienation \"between disagreeing peoples\", particularly those distanced from each other by the generation gap. McCartney's narrative details the plight of a young woman escaping the control of her parents, and was inspired by a piece about teenage runaways published in the \"Daily Mail\". Lennon supplies a supporting vocal that conveys the parents' anguish and confusion. It is the first track on \"Sgt. Pepper\" that eschews the use of guitars and drums, featuring only a string nonet with a harp. Music historian Doyle Greene views it as the first of the album's songs to address \"the crisis of middle-class life in the late 1960s\" and comments on its surprisingly conservative sentiments, given McCartney's absorption in the London avant-garde scene.\n\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\".\nLennon adapted the lyrics for \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" from an 1843 poster for Pablo Fanque's circus that he purchased at an antique shop in Kent on the day of filming the promotional film for \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". Womack views the track as an effective blending of a print source and music, while MacDonald describes it as \"a spontaneous expression of its author's playful hedonism\". Tasked by Lennon to evoke a circus atmosphere so vivid that he could \"smell the sawdust\", Martin and Emerick created a sound collage comprising randomly assembled recordings of harmoniums, harmonicas and calliopes. Everett says that the track's use of Edwardian imagery thematically links it with the album's title song. Gould also views \"Mr. Kite!\" as a return to the LP's opening motif, albeit that of show business and with the focus now on performers and a show in a radically different setting.\nSide two.\n\"Within You Without You\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe're not trying to outwit the public. The whole idea is to try a little bit to lead people into different tastes.\n\u2013 George Harrison, 1967\nHarrison's Hindustani classical music-inspired \"Within You Without You\" reflects his immersion in the teachings of the Hindu Vedas, while its musical form and Indian instrumentation, such as sitar, tabla, dilrubas and tamburas, recalls the Hindu devotional tradition known as bhajan. Harrison recorded the song with London-based Indian musicians from the Asian Music Circle; none of the other Beatles played on the recording. He and Martin then worked on a Western string arrangement that imitated the slides and bends typical of Indian music. The song's pitch is derived from the eastern Khamaj scale, which is akin to the Mixolydian mode in the West.\nMacDonald regards \"Within You Without You\" as \"the most distant departure from the staple Beatles sound in their discography\", and a work that represents the \"conscience\" of the LP through the lyrics' rejection of Western materialism. Womack calls it \"quite arguably, the album's ethical soul\" and views the line \"With our love we could save the world\" as a concise reflection of the Beatles' idealism that soon inspired the Summer of Love. The track ends with a burst of laughter gleaned from a tape in the EMI archive; some listeners interpreted this as a mockery of the song, but Harrison explained: \"It's a release after five minutes of sad music\u00a0... You were supposed to hear the audience anyway, as they listen to Sergeant Pepper's Show. That was the style of the album.\"\n\"When I'm Sixty-Four\".\nMacDonald characterises McCartney's \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" as a song \"aimed chiefly at parents\", borrowing heavily from the English music hall style of George Formby, while invoking images of the illustrator Donald McGill's seaside postcards. Its sparse arrangement includes clarinets, chimes and piano. Moore views the song as a synthesis of ragtime and pop, adding that its position following \"Within You Without You\" \u2013 a blend of Indian classical music and pop \u2013 demonstrates the diversity of the album's material. He says the music hall atmosphere is reinforced by McCartney's vocal delivery and the recording's use of chromaticism, a harmonic pattern that can be traced to Scott Joplin's \"The Ragtime Dance\" and \"The Blue Danube\" by Johann Strauss. Varispeeding was used on the track, raising its pitch by a semitone in an attempt to make McCartney sound younger. Everett comments that the lyric's protagonist is sometimes associated with the Lonely Hearts Club Band, but in his opinion the song is thematically unconnected to the others on the album.\n\"Lovely Rita\".\nWomack describes \"Lovely Rita\" as a work of \"full-tilt psychedelia\" that contrasts sharply with the preceding track. Citing McCartney's recollection that he drew inspiration from learning that the American term for a female traffic warden was a meter maid, Gould deems it a celebration of an encounter that evokes Swinging London and the contemporaneous chic for military-style uniforms. MacDonald regards the song as a \"satire on authority\" that is \"imbued with an exuberant interest in life that lifts the spirits, dispersing self-absorption\". The arrangement includes a quartet of comb-and-paper kazoos, a piano solo by Martin, and a coda in which the Beatles indulge in panting, groaning and other vocalised sounds. In Gould's view, the track represents \"the show-stopper in the Pepper Band's repertoire: a funny, sexy, extroverted song that comes closer to the spirit of rock 'n' roll than anything else on the album\".\n\"Good Morning Good Morning\".\nLennon was inspired to write \"Good Morning Good Morning\" after watching a television commercial for Kellogg's Corn Flakes, the jingle of which he adapted for the song's refrain. The track uses the bluesy Mixolydian mode in A, which Everett credits with \"perfectly express[ing] Lennon's grievance against complacency\". According to Greene, the song contrasts sharply with \"She's Leaving Home\" by providing \"the more 'avant-garde' subversive study of suburban life\". The time signature varies across 5/4, 3/4 and 4/4, while the arrangement includes a horn section comprising members of Sounds Inc. MacDonald highlights the \"rollicking\" brass score, Starr's drumming and McCartney's \"coruscating pseudo-Indian guitar solo\" among the elements that convey a sense of aggression on a track he deems a \"disgusted canter through the muck, mayhem, and mundanity of the human farmyard\". A series of animal noises appear during the fade-out that are sequenced \u2013 at Lennon's request \u2013 so that each successive animal could conceivably scare or devour the preceding one. The sound of a chicken clucking overlaps with a stray guitar note at the start of the next track, creating a seamless transition between the two songs.\n\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\".\n\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\" follows as a segue to the album's finale. The hard-rocking song was written after Neil Aspinall, the Beatles' road manager, suggested that since \"Sgt. Pepper\" opened the album, the fictional band should make an appearance near the end. Sung by all four Beatles, the reprise omits the brass section from the title track and has a faster tempo. With Harrison on lead guitar, it serves as a rare example from the \"Sgt. Pepper\" sessions where the group taped a basic track live with their usual stage instrumentation. MacDonald finds the Beatles' excitement tangibly translated on the recording, which is again augmented with ambient crowd noise.\n\"A Day in the Life\".\n\"A Day in the Life\" is the final track on the album. The last chord of the \"Sgt. Pepper\" reprise segues amid audience applause to acoustic guitar strumming and the start of what Moore calls \"one of the most harrowing songs ever written\". \"A Day in the Life\" consists of four verses by Lennon, a bridge, two aleatoric orchestral crescendos, and an interpolated middle part written and sung by McCartney. The first crescendo serves as a segue between the third verse and the middle part, leading to a bridge known as the \"dream sequence\". Lennon drew inspiration for the lyrics from a \"Daily Mail\" report on potholes in the Lancashire town of Blackburn and an article in the same newspaper relating to the death of Beatles friend and Guinness heir Tara Browne.\nAccording to Martin, Lennon and McCartney were equally responsible for the decision to use an orchestra. Martin said that Lennon requested \"a tremendous build-up, from nothing up to something absolutely like the end of the world\", while McCartney realised this idea by drawing inspiration from Cage and Stockhausen. Womack describes Starr's performance as \"one of his most inventive drum parts on record\". The thunderous piano chord that concludes the track and the album was produced by recording Lennon, Starr, McCartney and Evans simultaneously sounding an E major chord on three separate pianos; Martin then augmented the sound with a harmonium.\nRiley characterises the song as a \"postlude to the \"Pepper\" fantasy\u00a0... that sets all the other songs in perspective\", while shattering the illusion of \"Pepperland\" by introducing the \"parallel universe of everyday life\". MacDonald describes the track as \"a song not of disillusionment with life itself, but of disenchantment with the limits of mundane perception\".\nAs \"A Day in the Life\" ends, a 15-kilohertz high-frequency tone is heard; it was added at Lennon's suggestion with the intention that it would annoy dogs. This is followed by the sounds of backwards laughter and random gibberish that were pressed into the record's concentric run-out groove, which loops back into itself endlessly on any record player not equipped with an automatic needle return. Lennon can be heard saying, \"Been so high\", followed by McCartney's response: \"Never could be any other way.\"\nConcept.\nAccording to Womack, with \"Sgt. Pepper\"'s opening song \"the Beatles manufacture an artificial textual space in which to stage their art.\" The reprise of the title song appears on side two, just before the climactic \"A Day in the Life\", creating a framing device. In Lennon and Starr's view, only the first two songs and the reprise are conceptually connected. In a 1980 interview, Lennon stated that his compositions had nothing to do with the Sgt. Pepper concept, adding: \"\"Sgt. Pepper\" is called the first concept album, but it doesn't go anywhere\u00a0... it works because we said it worked.\"\nIn MacFarlane's view, the Beatles \"chose to employ an overarching thematic concept in an apparent effort to unify individual tracks\". Everett contends that the album's \"musical unity results\u00a0... from motivic relationships between key areas, particularly involving C, E, and G\". Moore argues that the recording's \"use of common harmonic patterns and falling melodies\" contributes to its overall cohesiveness, which he describes as narrative unity, but not necessarily conceptual unity. MacFarlane agrees, suggesting that with the exception of the reprise, the album lacks the melodic and harmonic continuity that is consistent with cyclic form.\nIn a 1995 interview, McCartney recalled that the Liverpool childhood theme behind the first three songs recorded during the \"Sgt. Pepper\" sessions was never formalised as an album-wide concept, but he said that it served as a \"device\" or underlying theme throughout the project. MacDonald identifies allusions to the Beatles' upbringing throughout \"Sgt. Pepper\" that are \"too persuasive to ignore\". These include evocations of the postwar Northern music-hall tradition, references to Northern industrial towns and Liverpool schooldays, Lewis Carroll-inspired imagery (acknowledging Lennon's favourite childhood reading), the use of brass instrumentation in the style of park bandstand performances (familiar to McCartney through his visits to Sefton Park),&lt;ref name=\"Irvin/Mojo\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the album cover's flower arrangement akin to a floral clock. Norman partly agrees; he says that \"In many ways, the album carried on the childhood and Liverpool theme with its circus and fairground effects, its pervading atmosphere of the traditional northern music hall that was in both its main creators' [McCartney and Lennon's] blood.\"\nPackaging.\nFront cover.\nPop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth designed the album cover for \"Sgt. Pepper\". Blake recalled of the concept: \"I offered the idea that if they had just played a concert in the park, the cover could be a photograph of the group just after the concert with the crowd who had just watched the concert, watching them.\" He added, \"If we did this by using cardboard cut-outs, it could be a magical crowd of whomever they wanted.\"&lt;ref name=\"Humphries/MojoSpecial\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to McCartney, he himself provided the ink drawing on which Blake and Haworth based the design. The cover was art-directed by Robert Fraser and photographed by Michael Cooper.\nThe front of the LP includes a colourful collage featuring the Beatles in costume as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing with a group of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of famous people. Each of the Beatles sports a heavy moustache, after Harrison had first grown one as a disguise during his visit to India. The moustaches reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends, while the group's clothing, in Gould's description, \"spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions\". The centre of the cover depicts the Beatles standing behind a bass drum on which fairground artist Joe Ephgrave painted the words of the album's title. In front of the drum is an arrangement of flowers that spell out \"Beatles\". The group are dressed in satin day-glo-coloured military-style uniforms that were manufactured by the London theatrical costumer M. Berman Ltd. Next to the Beatles are wax sculptures of the band members in their suits and moptop haircuts from the Beatlemania era, borrowed from Madame Tussauds. Amid the greenery are figurines of the Eastern deities Buddha and Lakshmi.\nThe cover collage includes 57 photographs and nine waxworks. Author Ian Inglis views the tableau \"as a guidebook to the cultural topography of the decade\" that conveyed the increasing democratisation of society whereby \"traditional barriers between 'high' and 'low' culture were being eroded\", while Case cites it as the most explicit demonstration of pop culture's \"continuity with the avant-gardes of yesteryear\". The final grouping included Stockhausen and Carroll, along with singers such as Bob Dylan and Bobby Breen; film stars Marlon Brando, Tyrone Power, Tony Curtis, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West and Marilyn Monroe; artist Aubrey Beardsley; boxer Sonny Liston and footballer Albert Stubbins. Also included were comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy; writers H.G. Wells, Oscar Wilde and Dylan Thomas; and the philosophers and scientists Karl Marx, Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Harrison chose the Self-Realization Fellowship gurus Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar and Paramahansa Yogananda. The Rolling Stones are represented by a doll wearing a shirt emblazoned with a message of welcome to the band.\nFearing controversy, EMI rejected Lennon's request for images of Adolf Hitler and Jesus Christ and Harrison's for Mahatma Gandhi. When McCartney was asked why the Beatles did not include Elvis Presley among the musical artists, he replied: \"Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention.\"&lt;ref name=\"Fleming/RS\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Starr was the only Beatle who offered no suggestions for the collage, telling Blake, \"Whatever the others say is fine by me.\" The final cost for the cover art was nearly \u00a33,000 (), an extravagant sum for a time when album covers would typically cost around \u00a350 ().\nBack cover, gatefold and cut-outs.\nThe 30 March 1967 photo session with Cooper also produced the back cover and the inside gatefold, which Inglis describes as conveying \"an obvious and immediate warmth\u00a0... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images\". McCartney recalled the inner-gatefold image as an example of the Beatles' interest in \"eye messages\", adding: \"So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this!'... [And] if you look at it you'll see the big effort from the eyes.\" In Lennon's description, Cooper's photos of the band showed \"two people who are flying [on drugs], and two who aren't\".\nThe album's lyrics were printed in full on the back cover, the first time this had been done on a rock LP. The record's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth. These consisted of a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper (probably based on a photograph of British Army officer James Melville Babington, but also noted as being similar to a statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover), a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges, and a stand-up cut-out of the band in their satin uniforms. Moore writes that the inclusion of these items helped fans \"pretend to be in the band\".\nRelease.\nRadio previews and launch party.\nThe album was previewed on the pirate radio station Radio London on 12 May and officially on the BBC Light Programme's show \"Where It's At\", by Kenny Everett, on 20 May. Everett played the entire album apart from \"A Day in the Life\". The day before Everett's broadcast, Epstein hosted a launch party for music journalists and disc jockeys at his house in Belgravia in central London. The event was a new initiative in pop promotion and furthered the significance of the album's release. \"Melody Maker\"'s reporter described it as the first \"listen-in\" and typical of the Beatles' penchant for innovation.\nThe party marked the band's first group interaction with the press in close to a year. Norrie Drummond of the \"NME\" wrote that they had been \"virtually incommunicado\" over that time, leading a national newspaper to complain that the band were \"contemplative, secretive and exclusive\".&lt;ref name=\"Drummond/NME\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the journalists present were shocked by the Beatles' appearance, particularly that of Lennon and Harrison, as the band members' bohemian attire contrasted sharply with their former image.&lt;ref name=\"Womack/LaunchParty\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Music journalist Ray Coleman recalled that Lennon looked \"haggard, old, ill\" and clearly under the influence of drugs. Biographer Howard Sounes likens the Beatles' presence to a gathering of the British royal family and highlights a photo from the event that shows Lennon shaking McCartney's hand \"in an exaggeratedly congratulatory way, throwing his head back in sarcastic laughter\".\nOn 26 May, \"Sgt. Pepper\" was given a rush-release in the UK, ahead of the scheduled date of 1 June. The band's eighth LP, it was the first Beatles album where the track listings were exactly the same for the UK and US versions. The US release took place on 2 June. Capitol Records' advertising for the album emphasised that the Beatles and Sgt. Pepper's band were one and the same.\nPublic reaction.\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" was widely perceived by listeners as the soundtrack to the Summer of Love, during a year that author Peter Lavezzoli calls \"a watershed moment in the West when the search for higher consciousness and an alternative world view had reached critical mass\". \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's Langdon Winner recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The closest Western Civilization has come to unity since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 was the week the \"Sgt. Pepper\" album was released. In every city in Europe and America the radio stations played [it]\u00a0... and everyone listened\u00a0... For a brief while the irreparable fragmented consciousness of the West was unified, at least in the minds of the young.\nAccording to Riley, the album \"drew people together through the common experience of pop on a larger scale than ever before\". In MacDonald's description, an \"almost religious awe surrounded the LP\"; he says that its impact was cross-generational, as \"Young and old alike were entranced\", and era-defining, in that the \"psychic shiver\" it inspired across the world was \"nothing less than a cinematic dissolve from one \"Zeitgeist\" to another\". In his view, \"Sgt. Pepper\" conveyed the psychedelic experience so effectively to listeners unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs that \"If such a thing as a cultural 'contact high' is possible, it happened here.\" Music journalist Mark Ellen, a teenager in 1967, recalls listening to part of the album at a friend's house and then hearing the rest playing at the next house he visited as if the record was emanating communally from \"one giant Dansette\". He says the most remarkable thing was its acceptance by adults who had turned against the Beatles when they became \"gaunt and enigmatic\", and how the group, recast as polished \"masters of ceremony\", were now \"the very family favourites they'd sought to satirise\".\nWriting in his book \"Electric Shock\", Peter Doggett describes \"Sgt. Pepper\" as \"the biggest pop happening\" to take place between the Beatles' debut on American television in February 1964 and Lennon's murder in December 1980, while Norman writes: \"A whole generation, still used to happy landmarks through life, would always remember exactly when and where they first played it...\" The album's impact was felt at the Monterey International Pop Festival, the second event in the Summer of Love, organised by Taylor and held over 16\u201318 June in county fairgrounds south of San Francisco. \"Sgt. Pepper\" was played in kiosks and stands there, and festival staff wore badges carrying Lennon's lyric \"A splendid time is guaranteed for all\".\nAmerican radio stations interrupted their regular scheduling, playing the album virtually non-stop, often from start to finish. Emphasising its identity as a self-contained work, none of the songs were issued as singles at the time or available on spin-off EPs. Instead, the Beatles released \"All You Need Is Love\" as a single in July, after performing the song on the \"Our World\" satellite broadcast on 25 June before an audience estimated at 400 million. According to sociomusicologist Simon Frith, the international broadcast served to confirm \"the Beatles' evangelical role\" amid the public's embrace of \"Sgt. Pepper\".&lt;ref name=\"Frith/HoR\"&gt; Available at https:// (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, \"Our World\" also quelled the furore that followed McCartney's repeated admission in mid-June that he had taken LSD. In Norman's description, this admission was indicative of how \"invulnerable\" McCartney felt after \"Sgt. Pepper\"; it made the band's drug-taking public knowledge and confirmed the link between the album and drugs.\nCommercial performance.\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" topped the \"Record Retailer\" albums chart (now the UK Albums Chart) for 23 consecutive weeks from 10 June, with a further four weeks at number one in the period through to February 1968. The record sold 250,000 copies in the UK during its first seven days on sale there. The album held the number one position on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart in the US for 15 weeks, from 1 July to 13 October 1967, and remained in the top 200 for 113 consecutive weeks. It also topped charts in many other countries.\nWith 2.5\u00a0million copies sold within three months of its release, \"Sgt. Pepper\"'s initial commercial success exceeded that of all previous Beatles albums. In the UK, it was the best-selling album of 1967 and of the decade.&lt;ref name=\"Mawer/1969\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to figures published in 2009 by former Capitol executive David Kronemyer, further to estimates he gave in \"MuseWire\" magazine, the album had sold 2,360,423 copies in the US by 31 December 1967 and 3,372,581 copies by the end of the decade.\nContemporary critical reception.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Sgt. Pepper\"'s arrival in late spring 1967 came at a most opportune moment in Western cultural history: mainstream journalism had at last warmed to the idea that the \"rock\" world... could produce a lasting masterpiece that transcended the genre's lowly origins, while a new and legitimate niche called \"rock journalism\" was working up its own head of steam... [E]veryone wanted the Beatles to succeed \u2013 and to lead. The wind was at their back, and they knew it.\n\u2013 Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez, 2012\nThe release of \"Sgt. Pepper\" coincided with a period when, with the advent of dedicated rock criticism, commentators sought to recognise artistry in pop music, particularly in the Beatles' work, and identify albums as refined artistic statements.&lt;ref name=\"Hamilton/Slate\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In America, this approach had been heightened by the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" / \"Penny Lane\" single, and was also exemplified by Leonard Bernstein's television program \"\", broadcast by CBS in April 1967. Following the release of the Beatles' single, in author Bernard Gendron's description, a \"discursive frenzy\" ensued as \"Time\", \"Newsweek\" and other publications from the cultural mainstream increasingly voiced their \"ecstatic approbation toward the Beatles\".\nThe vast majority of contemporary reviews of \"Sgt. Pepper\" were positive, with the album receiving widespread critical acclaim. Schaffner said that the consensus was aptly summed up by Tom Phillips in \"The Village Voice\", when he called the LP \"the most ambitious and most successful record album ever issued\". Among Britain's pop press, Peter Jones of \"Record Mirror\" said the album was \"clever and brilliant, from raucous to poignant and back again\", while \"Disc and Music Echo\"'s reviewer called it \"a beautiful and potent record, unique, clever, and stunning\". In \"The Times\", William Mann described \"Sgt. Pepper\" as a \"pop music master-class\" and commented that, so considerable were its musical advances, \"the only track that would have been conceivable in pop songs five years ago\" was \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". Having been among the first British critics to fully appreciate \"Revolver\", Peter Clayton of \"Gramophone\" magazine said that the new album was \"like nearly everything the Beatles do, bizarre, wonderful, perverse, beautiful, exciting, provocative, exasperating, compassionate and mocking\". He found \"plenty of electronic gimmickry on the record\" before concluding: \"but that isn't the heart of the thing. It's the combination of imagination, cheek and skill that make this such a rewarding LP.\" Wilfrid Mellers, in his review for \"New Statesman\", praised the album's elevation of pop music to the level of fine art, while Kenneth Tynan, \"The Times\"' theatre critic, said it represented \"a decisive moment in the history of Western civilisation\". \"Newsweek\"'s Jack Kroll called \"Sgt. Pepper\" a \"masterpiece\" and compared its lyrics with literary works by Edith Sitwell, Harold Pinter and T. S. Eliot, particularly \"A Day in the Life\", which he likened to Eliot's \"The Waste Land\". \"The New Yorker\" paired the Beatles with Duke Ellington, as artists who operated \"in that special territory where entertainment slips into art\". \nOne of the few well-known American rock critics at the time, and another early champion of \"Revolver\", Richard Goldstein wrote a scathing review in \"The New York Times\". He characterised \"Sgt. Pepper\" as a \"spoiled\" child and \"an album of special effects, dazzling but ultimately fraudulent\", and was critical of the Beatles for sacrificing their authenticity to become \"cloistered composers\". Although he admired \"A Day in the Life\", comparing it to a work by Richard Wagner, Goldstein said that the songs lacked lyrical substance such that \"tone overtakes meaning\", an aesthetic he blamed on \"posturing and put-on\" in the form of production effects such as echo and reverb. As a near-lone voice of dissent, he was widely castigated for his views. Four days later, \"The Village Voice\", where Goldstein had become a celebrated columnist since 1966, reacted to the \"hornet's nest\" of complaints, by publishing Phillips' highly favourable review. According to Schaffner, Goldstein was \"kept busy for months\" justifying his opinions, which included writing a defence of his review, for the \"Voice\", in July.\nAmong the commentators who responded to Goldstein's critique, composer Ned Rorem, writing in \"The New York Review of Books\", credited the Beatles with possessing a \"magic of genius\" akin to Mozart and characterised \"Sgt. Pepper\" as a harbinger of a \"golden Renaissance of Song\". \"Time\" quoted musicologists and avant-garde composers who equated the standard of the Beatles' songwriting to Schubert and Schumann, and located the band's work to electronic music; the magazine concluded that the album was \"a historic departure in the progress of music \u2013 any music\". Literary critic Richard Poirier wrote a laudatory appreciation of the Beatles in the journal \"Partisan Review\" and said that \"listening to the \"Sgt. Pepper\" album one thinks not simply of the history of popular music but the history of this century.\" In his December 1967 column for \"Esquire\", Robert Christgau described \"Sgt. Pepper\" as \"a consolidation, more intricate than \"Revolver\" but not more substantial\". He suggested that Goldstein had fallen \"victim to overanticipation\", identifying his primary error as \"allow[ing] all the filters and reverbs and orchestral effects and overdubs to deafen him to the stuff underneath, which was pretty nice\".\nSociocultural influence.\nContemporary youth and counterculture.\nIn the wake of \"Sgt. Pepper\", the underground and mainstream press widely publicised the Beatles as leaders of youth culture, as well as \"lifestyle revolutionaries\". In Moore's description, the album \"seems to have spoken (in a way no other has) for its generation\". An educator referenced in a July 1967 \"New York Times\" article was reported to have said on the topic of music studies and its relevance to the day's youth: \"If you want to know what youths are thinking and feeling... you cannot find anyone who speaks for them or to them more clearly than the Beatles.\"\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" was the focus of much celebration by the counterculture. American Beat poet Allen Ginsberg said of the album: \"After the apocalypse of Hitler and the apocalypse of the Bomb, there was here an exclamation of joy, the rediscovery of joy and what it is to be alive.\" The American psychologist and counterculture figure Timothy Leary labelled the Beatles \"avatars of the new world order\" and said that the LP \"gave a voice to the feeling that the old ways were over\" by stressing the need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda. According to author Michael Frontani, the Beatles \"legitimiz[ed] the lifestyle of the counterculture\", just as they did popular music, and formed the basis of Jann Wenner's scope on these issues when launching \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in late 1967. Further to Lennon wearing an Afghan sheepskin coat at the album launch party, \"Afghans\" became a popular garment among hippies, and Westerners increasingly sought out the coats on the hippie trail in Afghanistan.\nMcCartney's LSD admission formalised the link between rock music and drugs, and attracted scorn from American religious leaders and conservatives. Vice president Spiro Agnew contended that the \"friends\" referred to in \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" were \"assorted drugs\". As part of an escalating national debate that triggered an investigation by the US Congress, he launched a campaign in 1970 to address the issue of American youth being \"brainwashed\" into taking drugs through the music of the Beatles and other rock artists. In the UK, according to historian David Simonelli, the album's obvious drug allusions inspired a hierarchy within the youth movement for the first time, based on listeners' ability to \"get\" psychedelia and align with the elite notion of Romantic artistry. Harrison was eager to separate the message of \"Within You Without You\" from the LSD experience, telling an interviewer: \"It's nothing to do with pills... It's just in your own head, the realisation.\"\nThe Beatles' presentation as Sgt. Pepper's band resonated at a time when many young people in the UK and the US were seeking to redefine their own identity and were drawn to communities that espoused the transformational power of mind-altering drugs. In the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, the recognised centre of the counterculture, \"Sgt. Pepper\" was viewed as a \"code for life\", according to music journalist Alan Clayson, with street people such as the Merry Band of Pranksters offering \"Beatle readings\". American social activist Abbie Hoffman credited the album as his inspiration for staging the attempted levitation of the Pentagon during the Mobe's anti-Vietnam War rally in October 1967. The Byrds' David Crosby later expressed surprise that by 1970 the album's powerful sentiments had not been enough to stop the Vietnam War.\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" informed Frank Zappa's parody of the counterculture and flower power on the Mothers of Invention's 1968 album \"We're Only in It for the Money\". By 1968, according to music critic Greil Marcus, \"Sgt. Pepper\" appeared shallow against the emotional backdrop of the political and social upheavals of American life. Simon Frith, in his overview of 1967 for \"The History of Rock\", said that \"Sgt. Pepper\" \"defined the year\" by conveying the optimism and sense of empowerment at the centre of the youth movement. He added that the Velvet Underground's \"The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico\" \u2013 an album that contrasted sharply with the Beatles' message by \"offer[ing] no escape\" \u2013 became more relevant in a cultural climate typified by \"the Sex Pistols, the new political aggression, the rioting in the streets\" during the 1970s. In a 1987 review for \"Q\" magazine, Charles Shaar Murray asserted that \"Sgt. Pepper\" \"remains a central pillar of the mythology and iconography of the late '60s\",&lt;ref name=\"CSM/Q\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while Colin Larkin states in his 1989 \"Encyclopedia of Popular Music\": \"[it] turned out to be no mere pop album but a cultural icon, embracing the constituent elements of the 60s' youth culture: pop art, garish fashion, drugs, instant mysticism and freedom from parental control.\"\nCultural legitimisation of popular music.\nIn \"The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature\", Kevin Dettmar writes that \"Sgt. Pepper\" achieved \"a combination of popular success and critical acclaim unequaled in twentieth-century art... never before had an aesthetic and technical masterpiece enjoyed such popularity.\" Through the level of attention it received from the rock press and more culturally elite publications, the album achieved full cultural legitimisation for pop music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form. Riley says that pop had been due this accreditation \"at least as early as \"A Hard Day's Night\" in 1964. He adds that the timing of the album's release and its reception ensured that \"Sgt. Pepper\" has attained the kind of populist adoration that renowned works often assume regardless of their larger significance \u2013 it's the Beatles' 'Mona Lisa'.\" At the 10th Annual Grammy Awards in March 1968, \"Sgt. Pepper\" won awards in four categories: Album of the Year; Best Contemporary Album; Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical; and Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts. Its win in the Album of the Year category marked the first time that a rock LP had received this honour.\nAmong the recognised composers who helped legitimise the Beatles as serious musicians at the time were Luciano Berio, Aaron Copland, John Cage, Ned Rorem and Leonard Bernstein. According to Rodriguez, an element of exaggeration accompanied some of the acclaim for \"Sgt. Pepper\", with particularly effusive approbation coming from Rorem, Bernstein and Tynan, \"as if every critic was seeking to outdo the other for the most lavish embrace of the Beatles' new direction\". In Gendron's view, the cultural approbation represented American \"highbrow\" commentators (Rorem and Poirier) looking to establish themselves over their \"low-middlebrow\" equivalent, after \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\" had led the way in recognising the Beatles' artistry, and over the new discipline of rock criticism. Gendron describes the discourse as one whereby, during a period that lasted for six months, \"highbrow\" composers and musicologists \"jostl[ed] to pen the definitive effusive appraisal of the Beatles\".\nAside from the attention afforded the album in literary and scholarly journals, the American jazz magazines \"Down Beat\" and \"Jazz\" both began to cover rock music for the first time, with the latter changing its name to \"Jazz &amp; Pop\" as a result. In addition, following \"Sgt. Pepper\", established American publications such as \"Vogue\", \"Playboy\" and the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" started discussing rock as art, in terms usually reserved for jazz criticism. Writing for \"Rolling Stone\" in 1969, Michael Lydon said that reviewers had had to invent \"new criticism\" to match pop's musical advances, since: \"Writing had to be an appropriate response to the music; in writing about, say, \"Sgt. Pepper\", you had to try to write something as good as \"Sgt. Pepper\". Because, of course, what made that record beautiful was the beautiful response it created in you; if your written response was true to your listening response, the writing would stand on its own as a creation on par with the record.\"\nThrough its acceptance by \"serious\" composers, according to Schaffner, \"Sgt. Pepper\" satisfied the ambitions of a staid, middle-age American audience keen to be seen as in tune with young people's tastes, and every major rock LP was subsequently given the same level of critical analysis. In 1977, the LP won Best British Album at the inaugural Brit Awards, held by the BPI to celebrate the best British music of the last 25 years as part of Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. When EMI issued the Beatles' catalogue on CD in 1987, \"Sgt. Pepper\" was the only album afforded a dedicated release. EMI marketed it as \"the most important record ever released on compact disc\".&lt;ref name=\"Petridis/Guardian\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nDevelopment of popular music.\nIndustry and market changes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[Because of \"Sgt. Pepper\"] people then started thinking that you could spend a year making an album and they began to consider an album as a sound composition and not just a musical composition. The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance.\n\u2013 Producer and EMI engineer Alan Parsons\nJulien describes \"Sgt. Pepper\" as a \"masterpiece of British psychedelia\" and says that it represents the \"epitome of the transformation of the recording studio into a compositional tool\", marking the moment when \"popular music entered the era of phonographic composition\". Many acts copied the album's psychedelic sounds and imitated its production techniques, resulting in a rapid expansion of the producer's role. In this regard, Lennon and McCartney complained that Martin had received too much attention for his part in the album's creation, so beginning a feeling of resentment by the Beatles towards their longtime producer.\nIn 1987, Anthony DeCurtis of \"Rolling Stone\" described \"Sgt. Pepper\" as the album that \"revolutionized rock and roll\", while music journalists Andy Greene and Scott Plagenhoef credit it with marking the beginning of the album era. For several years following its release, straightforward rock and roll was supplanted by a growing interest in extended form, and for the first time in the history of the music industry, sales of albums outpaced those of singles. In Gould's description, \"Sgt. Pepper\" was \"the catalyst for an explosion of mass enthusiasm for album-formatted rock that would revolutionize both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways that far out-stripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by the Elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the Beatlemania phenomenon of 1963\". The music industry swiftly grew into a billion-dollar enterprise, although record company executives were blindsided by the appeal of new acts who defied established formulas.\nMusic critic Greg Kot said that \"Sgt. Pepper\" introduced a template not only for creating album-oriented rock but also for consuming it, \"with listeners no longer twisting the night away to an assortment of three-minute singles, but losing themselves in a succession of 20-minute album sides, taking a journey led by the artist\". In Moore's view, the album was \"pivotal\" in heralding \"the realignment of rock from its working-class roots to its subsequent place on the college circuit\", as students increasingly embraced the genre and record companies launched labels targeted towards this new market. As another result of \"Sgt. Pepper\", US record companies no longer altered the content of albums by major British acts such as the Rolling Stones, the Kinks and Donovan, and their LPs were released in the artists' intended configuration.\nAlbums and artistry.\nAccording to Simonelli, \"Sgt. Pepper\" established the standard for rock musicians, particularly British acts, to strive towards in their self-identification as artists rather than pop stars, whereby, as in the Romantic tradition, creative vision dominated at the expense of all commercial concerns. In the US, the album paved the way for British groups such as Pink Floyd and the Incredible String Band, whose work echoed the eclectic, mystical and escapist qualities of \"Sgt. Pepper\".\nFollowing the Beatles' example, many acts spent months in the studio creating their albums, focused on an artistic aesthetic and in the hope of winning critical approval. Among the many LPs influenced by \"Sgt. Pepper\" were Jefferson Airplane's \"After Bathing at Baxter's\", the Rolling Stones' \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\" and the Moody Blues' \"Days of Future Passed\", all released in 1967; and the Zombies' \"Odessey and Oracle\", the Small Faces' \"Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake\" and the Pretty Things' \"S.\u00a0F. Sorrow\", all issued the following year.&lt;ref name=\"Chilton/uDiscover\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; All rock albums were subsequently measured against \"Sgt. Pepper\". Discussing \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\", Wenner referred to \"the post\u2013\"Sgt. Pepper\" trap of trying to put out a 'progressive,' 'significant' and 'different' album, as revolutionary as the Beatles. But it couldn't be done, because only the Beatles can put out an album by the Beatles.\"\n\"The Guardian\" viewed the album's effect on Carla Bley as one of the \"50 key events in the history of dance music\".&lt;ref name=\"Lewis/Guardian\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bley spent four years crafting her musical response to \"Sgt. Pepper\" \u2013 the 1971 avant-jazz triple album \"Escalator Over the Hill\" \u2013 which combined rock, Indo-jazz fusion and chamber jazz. Roger Waters cited \"Sgt. Pepper\" as his influence when Pink Floyd created their 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", saying: \"I learned from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison that it was OK for us to write about our lives and express what we felt... More than any other record it gave me and my generation permission to branch out and do whatever we wanted.\"\nOver subsequent decades, musical acts referred to their major artistic work as \"our \"Sgt. Pepper\"\". In this regard, \"Mojo\" magazine recognises Prince's \"Around the World in a Day\" (1985), Tears for Fears' \"The Seeds of Love\" (1989), The Smashing Pumpkins' \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\" (1995), Radiohead's \"OK Computer\" (1997), Oasis' \"Be Here Now\" (1997) and the Flaming Lips' \"The Soft Bulletin\" (1999) as albums that \"for better or for worse... would not have existed\" without \"Sgt. Pepper\". Writing for \"Mojo\" in 2007, John Harris said that the album's influence resonates in the \"identity games\" of Gnarls Barkley, in the ambitious song cycle of Green Day's 2004 album \"American Idiot\", in the respect afforded adventurous musicians such as Damon Albarn and Wayne Coyne, and particularly in the audience's expectation that foremost artists will \"progress\" and perhaps \"ascend to a watershed point at which influence, experience and ambition cohere into something that just might blow our minds\".\nStylistic developments.\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" was highly influential on bands in the US acid rock (or psychedelic rock) scene. Lavezzoli views it as a key factor in 1967's standing as the \"annus mirabilis\" for Indian classical music's acceptance in the West, with the genre having been fully absorbed into psychedelic music. \"Sgt. Pepper\" is commonly recognised as having originated progressive rock, due to the album's self-conscious lyrics, its studio experimentation, and its efforts to expand the barriers of conventional three-minute tracks. In addition to influencing Pink Floyd records such as \"Atom Heart Mother\", it was a source of inspiration for Robert Fripp when he formed King Crimson.&lt;ref name=\"Hughes/Prog\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The band's 1969 debut \"In the Court of the Crimson King\" was intended as a homage to \"Sgt. Pepper\".\nMacFarlane writes that, despite concerns regarding its thematic unity, \"Sgt. Pepper\" \"is widely regarded as the first true concept album in popular music\". According to author Martina Elicker, despite earlier examples, it was \"Sgt. Pepper\" that familiarised critics and listeners with the notion of a \"concept and unified structure underlying a pop album\", thus originating the term \"concept album\". Further to \"Sgt. Pepper\", musicians increasingly explored literary and sociological themes in their concept albums and adopted its anti-establishment sentiments. It also inspired rock opera works such as the Who's double album \"Tommy\" and the musical \"Jesus Christ Superstar\".\nAuthor Carys Wyn Jones locates \"Pet Sounds\" and \"Sgt. Pepper\" as the beginning of art rock. Doyle Greene says that \"Sgt. Pepper\" provides a \"crucial locus in the assemblage of popular music and avant-garde/experimental music\", notwithstanding the Beatles' presentation of the latter within formal song structures. He also says that, although the band are usually viewed as modernists, the album \"can be heard as a crucial \"postmodernist\" moment\", through its incorporation of self-conscious artistry, irony and pastiche, and \"arguably marked rock music's entry into postmodernism as opposed to high-modernism\". During the 1970s, glam rock acts co-opted the Beatles' use of alter ego personas, including David Bowie when he adopted the guise of Ziggy Stardust. \nGraphic design.\nInglis states that almost every account of the significance of \"Sgt. Pepper\" emphasises the cover's \"unprecedented correspondence between music and art, time and space\". The cover helped to elevate album art as a respected topic for critical analysis whereby the \"structures and cultures of popular music\" could henceforth justify intellectual discourse in a way that \u2013 before \"Sgt. Pepper\" \u2013 would have seemed like \"fanciful conceit\". He writes: \"[The \"Sgt. Pepper\"] cover has been regarded as groundbreaking in its visual and aesthetic properties, congratulated for its innovative and imaginative design, credited with providing an early impetus for the expansion of the graphic design industry into popular music, and perceived as largely responsible for the connections between art and pop to be made explicit.\"\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" contributed to the popular trend for military-style fashions as adopted by London's boutique shops. Following the LP's release, rock acts afforded cover art greater consideration and increasingly sought to create a thematic link between their album artwork and the record's musical statements. Riley describes the cover as \"one of the best-known works that pop art ever produced\", while Norman calls it \"the most famous album cover of all time\". The Beatles' 1968 self-titled double LP became known as the White Album for its plain white sleeve, which the band chose as a contrast with the wave of psychedelic imagery and album covers inspired by \"Sgt. Pepper\". In the late 1990s, the BBC included the \"Sgt. Pepper\" cover in its list of British masterpieces of twentieth-century art and design, placing it ahead of the red telephone box, Mary Quant's miniskirt, and the Mini motorcar.\nRetrospective appraisal.\nAlthough few critics initially agreed with Richard Goldstein's criticism of the album, many came to appreciate his sentiments by the early 1980s. In his 1979 book \"Stranded: Rock and Roll for a Desert Island\", Greil Marcus described \"Sgt. Pepper\" as \"playful but contrived\" and \"a Day-Glo tombstone for its time\". Marcus believed that the album \"strangled on its own conceits\" while being \"vindicated by world-wide acclaim\". Lester Bangs \u2013 the so-called \"godfather\" of punk rock journalism \u2013 wrote in 1981 that \"Goldstein was right in his much-vilified review\u00a0... predicting that this record had the power to almost singlehandedly destroy rock and roll.\" He added: \"In the sixties rock and roll began to think of itself as an 'art form'. Rock and roll is not an 'art form'; rock and roll is a raw wail from the bottom of the guts.\"\nIn a 1976 article for \"The Village Voice\", Christgau revisited the \"supposedly epochal Works of Art\" from 1967 and found that \"Sgt. Pepper\" appeared \"bound to a moment\" amid the year's culturally important music that had \"dated in the sense that it speaks with unusually specific eloquence of a single point in history\". Christgau said of the album's \"dozen good songs and true\", \"Perhaps they're too precisely performed, but I'm not going to complain.\" In his 1981 assessment, Simon Frith described \"Sgt. Pepper\" as \"the last great pop album, the last LP ambitious to amuse everyone\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt was inevitable that some of the critical assessment of subsequent generations would grumble. Some have griped about the archness of the band-within-a-band concept, the elaborate studio artifice, the dominance of McCartney's songs (routinely but unfairly considered as lightweight and bourgeois), the virtual freezing out of George Harrison... and the only episodic interest of a perpetually tripping Lennon.\n\u2013 Chris Ingham, 2006\nOnce the Beatles' catalogue became available on CD in 1987, a critical consensus formed around \"Revolver\"'s standing as the band's best work; the White Album also surpassed \"Sgt. Pepper\" in many critics' estimation.&lt;ref name=\"Quantick/ClassicRock\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his feature article on \"Sgt. Pepper\"'s 40th anniversary, for \"Mojo\", John Harris said that, such was its \"seismic and universal\" impact and subsequent identification with 1967, a \"fashion for trashing\" the album had become commonplace. He attributed this to iconoclasm, as successive generations identified the album with baby boomers' retreat into \"nostalgia-tinged smugness\" during the 1970s, combined with a general distaste for McCartney following Lennon's death. Citing its absence from the \"NME\"'s best-albums list in 1985 after it had topped the magazine's previous poll, in 1974, Harris wrote:\nThough by no means universally degraded... \"Sgt. Pepper\" had taken a protracted beating from which it has perhaps yet to fully recover. Regularly challenged and overtaken in the Best Beatle Album stakes... it suffered more than any Beatles record from the long fall-out after punk, and even the band's Britpop-era revival mysteriously failed to improve its standing.\nWriting in the 2004 edition of \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\", Rob Sheffield described \"Sgt. Pepper\" as \"a revelation of how far artists could go in a recording studio with only four tracks, plenty of imagination, and a drug or two\", but also \"a masterwork of sonics, not songwriting\". In his review for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham said that, while the album's detractors typically bemoan McCartney's dominant role, the reliance on studio innovation, and the unconvincing concept, \"as long as there are pairs of ears willing to disappear under headphones for forty minutes... \"Sgt. Pepper\" will continue to cast its considerable spell.\" Among reviews of the 2009 remastered album, Neil McCormick of \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote: \"It is impossible to overstate its impact: from a contemporary Sixties perspective it was utterly mind-blowing and original. Looking back from a point when its sonic innovations have been integrated into the mainstream, it remains a wonky, colourful and wildly improbable pop classic, although a little slighter and less cohesive than it may have seemed at the time.\" Mark Kemp, writing for \"Paste\", said the album was a \"blast of avant-rock genius\" but also \"one of rock's most overrated albums\".\nAccording to BBC Music critic Chris Jones, while \"Sgt. Pepper\" has long been subsumed under \"an avalanche of hyperbole\", the album retains an enduring quality \"because its sum is greater than its whole... These guys weren't just recording songs; they were inventing the stuff with which to make this record as they went along.\" Although the lyrics, particularly McCartney's, were \"a far cry from the militancy of their American peers\", he continues, \"what was revolutionary was the sonic carpet that enveloped the ears and sent the listener spinning into other realms.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considers the album to be a refinement of \"Revolver\"'s \"previously unheard-of level of sophistication and fearless experimentation\" and a work that combines a wide range of musical styles yet \"Not once does the diversity seem forced\". He concludes: \"After \"Sgt. Pepper\", there were no rules to follow \u2013 rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse.\"\nLegacy.\nFurther public and critical recognition.\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" sustained its immense popularity into the 21st century while breaking numerous sales records. With certified sales of 5.1\u00a0million copies in the UK, as of April 2019, \"Sgt. Pepper\" is the third-best-selling album in UK chart history and the best-selling studio album there. It is one of the most commercially successful albums in the US, where the RIAA certified sales of 11 million copies in 1997. By 2000, \"Sgt. Pepper\" was among the top 20 best-selling albums of all time worldwide. As of 2011, it had sold more than 32 million copies worldwide, making it one of the highest-selling albums of all time.\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" has topped many \"best album\" lists. It was voted in first place in Paul Gambaccini's 1978 book \"\", based on submissions from around 50 British and American critics and broadcasters including Christgau and Marcus, and again in the 1987 edition. In the latter year, it also topped \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of \"The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years\". In 1994, it was ranked first in Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\". It was voted best album of all time in the 1998 \"Music of the Millennium\" poll conducted by HMV and Channel 4, and in the following year's expanded survey, which polled 600,000 people across the UK. Among its appearances in other critics' polls, the album was third in \"Q\"'s 2004 list \"The Music That Changed the World\" and fifth in the same magazine's 2005 list \"The 40 Greatest Psychedelic Albums of All Time\".\nIn 1993, \"Sgt. Pepper\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and ten years later it was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, honouring the work as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" placed it at number one in the magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", a ranking it retained in the revised list of 2012, and described the album as \"the pinnacle of the Beatles' eight years as recording artists\". The editors also said that \"Sgt. Pepper\" was \"the most important rock 'n' roll album ever made\", a point to which June Skinner Sawyers adds, in her 2006 collection of essays \"Read the Beatles\": \"It has been called the most famous album in the history of popular music. It is certainly among the most written about. It is still being written about.\" On \"Rolling Stone\"'s third such list, published in September 2020, \"Sgt. Pepper\" appears at number 24.\nIn 2006, \"Sgt. Pepper\" was chosen by \"Time\" as one of the 100 best albums of all time. Writing that year, Kevin Dettmar described it as \"quite simply, the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded\". It is featured in Chris Smith's 2009 book \"101 Albums That Changed Popular Music\", where Smith highlights the album among the most \"obvious\" choices for inclusion due to its continued commercial success, the wealth of imitative works it inspired, and its ongoing recognition as \"a defining moment in the history of music\". In the \"NME\"'s 2014 article \"25 Albums With the Most Incredible Production\", Emily Barker described \"Sgt. Pepper\" as \"kaleidoscopic\" and an \"orchestral baroque pop masterpiece the likes of which has rarely been matched since\".\nIn 2017, \"Pitchfork\" placed the album at number 28 on its list of the best albums of the 1960s. Staff writer Jeremy D. Larson wrote: \"Many of the greatest albums of the \u201960s looked outside the artist, preserving in amber what was happening in fractious and romantic times. But \"Sgt. Pepper's\" reacted more to what was happening in 1967 inside the Beatles, the biggest band in the world. [...] But for all of \"Sgt. Pepper's\" big conceits, it is still such a massively human accomplishment, the sound of four Liverpool lads embracing the circus only they knew how to conduct.\"\nAdaptations, tributes and anniversary projects.\nThe Sgt. Pepper mythology was reimagined for the plot of \"Yellow Submarine\". In the animated film, the Beatles travel to Pepperland and rescue Sgt. Pepper's band from evildoers, the Blue Meanies. The album inspired the 1974 off-Broadway musical \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road\", directed by Tom O'Horgan, and the 1978 film \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", produced by Robert Stigwood. In July 2012, athletes donned Sgt. Pepper uniforms to pay tribute to the Beatles' album during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" has been the subject of many tribute albums, including a multi-artist CD available with the March 2007 issue of \"Mojo\" and a 2009 live album, \"Sgt. Pepper Live\", by Cheap Trick. Other tribute recordings include \"Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father\", a multi-artist charity compilation released by the \"NME\" in 1988; Big Daddy's 1992 album \"Sgt. Pepper's\", which Moore recognises as \"the most audacious\" of all the interpretations of the Beatles' LP up to 1997; and the Flaming Lips' \"With a Little Help from My Fwends\", released in 2014. BBC Radio 2 broadcast \"Sgt. Pepper's 40th Anniversary\" in June 2007. The programme contained new versions of the songs by artists such as Oasis, the Killers and Kaiser Chiefs, produced by Emerick using EMI's original four-track recording equipment.\nThe 1987 CD release attracted considerable media interest and coincided with a Granada TV documentary, \"It Was Twenty Years Ago Today\", that located the album at the centre of the Summer of Love.&lt;ref name=\"Jensen/UPI\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reissue peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and topped \"Billboard\"'s CDs chart. The album's 25th anniversary was observed with \"The South Bank Show\"'s presentation of Martin's TV documentary \"The Making of Sgt. Pepper\", which included interviews with the three surviving Beatles. Although there was no official campaign for the 30th anniversary, BBC Radio 2 broadcast \"Pepper Forever\" in the UK and some 12,000 schools across the US listened to a radio special dedicated to the album on 2 June 1997. Aside from Radio 2's June 2007 project, the 40th anniversary was marked by the University of Leeds hosting a meeting of British and American commentators to debate the extent of the album's social and cultural impact.\nOn 26 May 2017, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" was as a six-disc box set. The first CD contains a new stereo remix of the album, created by Giles Martin using first-generation tapes rather than their subsequent mixdowns. Apple Corps produced the TV documentary \"Sgt. Pepper's Musical Revolution\" to commemorate the anniversary, which was also celebrated with posters, billboards and other decorations in cities around the world. In Liverpool, the anniversary was the focus of a three-week cultural festival that included events dedicated to each of the album's thirteen songs.&lt;ref name=\"Kennedy/Guardian\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the festival, Mark Morris choreographed \"Pepperland\" to four of the songs from \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"Penny Lane\", arranged by Ethan Iverson, plus six original compositions by Iverson, and a dawn-to-dusk celebration of Indian music was held in recognition of Harrison's absorption in the genre. The 50th anniversary edition of \"Sgt. Pepper\" topped the UK Albums Chart.\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney, except \"Within You Without You\" by George Harrison.

It is one of four species in the genus \"Alpinia\", and is known for its pungent, aromatic flavor. \nGreater galangal (\"Alpinia galanga\") is most commonly used, and is similar to ginger and turmeric. It is native to South Asia and Southeast Asia. Lesser galangal (\"Alpinia officinarum\") and other types are also used, though less frequently.

{"id": "65453", "revid": "46834214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65453", "title": "Rickey Henderson", "text": "American baseball player (1958\u20132024)\nRickey Nelson Henley Henderson (December 25, 1958 \u2013 December 20, 2024), nicknamed \"Man of Steal\", was an American professional baseball left fielder who played 25 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine teams from 1979 to 2003, including four separate tenures with his original team, the Oakland Athletics. He is widely regarded as baseball's greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner. He holds MLB records for career stolen bases, runs, unintentional walks, and leadoff home runs. At the time of his last major league game in 2003, the 10-time American League (AL) All-Star ranked among the sport's top 100 all-time home run hitters and was its all-time leader in walks. In 2009, he was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.\nHenderson holds the single-season record for stolen bases (130 in 1982) and is the only player in AL history to steal 100 bases in a season, having done so three times (in 1980, 1982, and 1983). His 1,406 career steals is nearly 50% higher than the previous record of 938 by Lou Brock. Henderson is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland Athletics and previously held the New York Yankees' franchise record from 1988 to 2011. He was among the league's top ten base stealers in 21 different seasons.\nHenderson was named the AL's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1990, and he was twice the lead-off hitter for World Series champions: the 1989 Oakland Athletics and the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays. A 12-time stolen base champion, Henderson led the league in runs five times. His 25-season career elevated him to the top ten in several other categories, including career at-bats, games, and outfield putouts and total chances. His high on-base percentage, power hitting, and stolen base and run totals made him one of the most dominant and innovative players of all time. He was further known for his passion for playing baseball and a buoyant, eccentric, and quotable personality that both perplexed and entertained fans. Once asked if he thought Henderson was a future Hall of Famer, statistician Bill James replied, \"If you could split him in two, you'd have two Hall of Famers.\"\nEarly life.\nRickey Nelson Henley Henderson was born on December 25, 1958, in Chicago, Illinois in the back seat of an Oldsmobile on the way to the hospital. Henderson later joked, \"I was already fast. I couldn't wait.\" The son of John L. Henley and Bobbie Henley, he was named Rickey Nelson Henley, after singer-actor Ricky Nelson. When he was two years old, his father moved to Oakland, California. Rickey lived with his grandmother in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, from when he was two until he was seven, when he migrated to Oakland with his family. His father died in an automobile accident 10 years after leaving home. His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley's junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname. \nAs a child in Oakland, Henderson learned to bat right-handed although he was a naturally left-handed thrower\u2014a rare combination for baseball players, especially non-pitchers. Through the 2008 season, only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left in the Major Leagues. Henderson is by far the most successful (and the only one inducted into the Hall of Fame). Henderson later said, \"All my friends were right-handed and swung from the right side, so I thought that's the way it was supposed to be done.\"\nIn 1976, Henderson graduated from Oakland Technical High School in Oakland, California, where he played baseball, basketball, and football and was an All-American running back with two 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball. Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nHenderson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the fourth round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft. For the first season of his minor league career he was with the Boise A's of the Northwest League. In 46 games, he batted .336 and hit three home runs and two triples. Henderson spent the following season with the Modesto A's, where he batted .345 in 134 games during a record-setting season. Henderson, along with Darrell Woodard, nearly broke the league record for team stolen bases. The Modesto A's finished the season with 357 stolen bases, just shy of the league record of 370. While Woodard tied the single-season player record with 90 stolen bases, Henderson beat the record by stealing 95 bases, and was awarded the Sundial Trophy, given to the Modesto A's Most Valuable Player.\nHenderson spent the 1978 season with the Jersey City A's of the Eastern League. After the minor league season ended, he played the 1978\u20131979 winter season for the Navojoa Mayos of the Mexican Pacific League. He played in six games for the team, which won its first championship. In 1979, Henderson started the season with the Ogden A's of the Pacific Coast League. In 71 games for Ogden, he had a batting average of .309 and stole 44 bases.\nOakland Athletics (1979\u20131984).\nHenderson made his major league debut with Oakland on June 24, 1979, getting two hits in four at-bats, along with a stolen base. He batted .274 with 33 stolen bases in 89 games. In 1980, Henderson became the third modern-era player to steal 100 bases in a season (Maury Wills stole 104 in 1962, and Lou Brock stole 118 in 1974). His 100 steals broke Eddie Collins's franchise record of 81 in 1910 with the Philadelphia Athletics and set a new American League (AL) record, surpassing Ty Cobb's 96 in 1915. He also batted .303, had 179 hits (tied for ninth in AL), scored 111 runs (fourth in AL), drew 117 walks (second in AL), had a .420 on-base percentage (third in AL), and led the AL by reaching base 301 times.\nThat winter, Henderson played in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League; his 42 stolen bases broke that league's record as well.\nHenderson was an MVP candidate a year later, in a season shortened by the 1981 players' strike. He hit .319, fourth in the AL, and led the league in hits (135), runs (89), and steals (56). Henderson was also third in on-base percentage (.408), tied for second in triples (7), fourth in walks (64), eighth in total bases (185), and second in times reaching base (201). In so doing, he became the emblematic figure of Oakland manager Billy Martin's aggressive \"Billy Ball\" philosophy, which received much media attention. Finishing second to the Milwaukee Brewers' Rollie Fingers in the MVP voting, Henderson earned his only Gold Glove Award in fielding that season. He later became known for his showboat \"snatch catches\", in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls, then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch.\nIn 1982, Henderson broke Lou Brock's modern major league single season record by stealing 130 bases, a total which has not been approached since. He stole 84 bases by the All-Star break; no player has stolen as many as 84 bases in an entire season since 1988, when Henderson himself stole 93. He also led the AL in walks (116) and was fourth in runs (119) and third in on-base percentage (.398).\nInspired by Dodger leadoff hitter Rudy Law, Henderson adopted an exaggerated crouch as his batting stance, which reduced his strike zone without sacrificing much power. Sportswriter Jim Murray described Henderson's strike zone as being \"smaller than Hitler's heart\". In 1982, he described his approach to \"Sports Illustrated\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I found that if I squatted down real low at the plate ... I could see the ball better. I also knew it threw the pitcher off. I found that I could put my weight on my back foot and still turn my hips on the swing. I'm down so low I don't have much of a strike zone. Sometimes, walking so much even gets me mad. Last year Ed Ott of the Angels got so frustrated because the umpire was calling balls that would've been strikes on anybody else that he stood up and shouted at me, \"Stand up and hit like a man.\" I guess I do that to people.\nRegarding Henderson's 1982 season, the mid-1980s book \"The Hidden Game of Baseball\" looked at such statistics as 0.78 expected runs with a runner on first and no outs, 1.07 expected runs with runner on second and no outs, and only 0.25 expected runs with no one on and one out. The authors concluded that with Henderson's 130 stolen bases he contributed 22.2 runs to the A's offense. By being caught stealing 42 times, he cost his team 20.6 runs. Therefore, the authors concluded, the net effect of his running activity was merely 1.6 extra runs for the season. A later analysis determined his net contribution was 5.3 runs for the season.\nIn 1983, he led the AL in stolen bases (108) and walks (103) while finishing fourth in runs scored (105). He was also second in on-base percentage (.414), tied for ninth in triples (7), and fifth in times on base, reaching 257 times.\nIn 1984, Henderson hit 16 home runs while leading the league in stolen bases (66) and finishing second in runs scored (113) and third in on-base-percentage (.399). After the season, he was traded to the New York Yankees along with Bert Bradley for five players: Tim Birtsas, Jay Howell, Stan Javier, Eric Plunk, and Jos\u00e9 Rijo.\nNew York Yankees (1985\u20131989).\nIn his first season with the Yankees, Henderson led the league in runs scored (146) and stolen bases (80), was fourth in batting average (.314), walks (99) and on-base percentage (.419), seventh in slugging (.516), third in OPS (.934). Combining his stolen bases with his 24 home runs, he became the first AL player to join the 20\u201350 club, and its first member to reach 20\u201380. He also won the Silver Slugger Award, and was third in the voting for the MVP award. His 146 runs scored were the most since Ted Williams had 150 in 1950, and he became the first player since Jimmie Foxx in 1939 to amass more runs scored than games played. Henderson also became the first player in major league history to reach 80 stolen bases and 20 home runs in the same season. He matched the feat in 1986, as did Eric Davis of the Cincinnati Reds; they remain the only players in major league history to reach those thresholds. It was with the Yankees that Henderson, who had previously worn number 35 with Oakland, which was already taken by his Yankees teammate Phil Niekro, switched to his now famous 24, a number he would wear for the rest of his career (with exceptions: (1) he briefly wore number 14 in 1993 while playing with the Blue Jays, (2) he wore his \"old\" number 35 in 2000 and 2002 while playing with the Mariners and the Red Sox, and (3) he wore number 25 while playing with the Dodgers).\nIn 1986, he led the AL in runs scored (130) and stolen bases (87) for the second year in a row, and was seventh in walks (89) and extra base hits (64) while hitting 28 home runs (9 of which led off games) and recording a career-high 74 runs batted in (RBIs).\nIn 1987, he had a below-average season by his standards, fueling criticism from the New York media, which had never covered Henderson or his eccentricities kindly. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner issued a press release claiming that manager Lou Piniella wanted to trade Henderson for \"jaking it\" (playing lackadaisically). Still, Henderson had his best on-base percentage to that point in his career (.423), with a .291 batting avg., was fifth in the AL in stolen bases (41) and hit 17 home runs despite playing only 95 games. It was the only season from 1980 to 1991 in which Henderson did not lead the AL in steals. Seattle's Harold Reynolds led the league with 60 steals; Reynolds tells the story of getting an impish phone call from Henderson after the season:\nThe phone rings. \"Henderson here.\" I say, \"Hey, what's going on, Rickey?\" I think he's calling to congratulate me, but he goes, '\"\"Sixty\" stolen bases? You ought to be ashamed. Rickey would have 60 at the break\"... then click, he hung up.\nIn 1988, Henderson led the AL in steals (93), was third in runs scored (118), fifth in OBP (.394) and seventh in walks (82), while hitting .305. Though only in New York for &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4+1\u20442 seasons, Henderson set the Yankees' franchise record with 326 stolen bases; the previous high (248) had been held by Hal Chase, who last played for the Yankees in 1913, when the team was still known as the Highlanders. On May 28, 2011, Henderson's total was surpassed by Derek Jeter, who by that point had already played 1,700 more games as a Yankee than Henderson.\nSecond stint with Oakland Athletics (1989\u20131993).\nIn the final year of his contract, the Yankees and Rickey could not come to terms on an extension. On June 21, 1989, the Yankees traded Henderson back to Oakland for Plunk, Greg Cadaret, and Luis Polonia. After the trade, his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the Athletics into the postseason; his 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since Frank Howard's 132 in 1970. Henderson was named MVP of the 1989 American League Championship Series (ALCS) after hitting .400, scoring eight runs and delivering two home runs, five RBIs, seven walks and a 1.000 slugging percentage. He had eight stolen bases in the five-game series, breaking Brock's postseason series record of seven, which he set in 1967 and repeated in 1968. Leading the Athletics to a four-game sweep over the San Francisco Giants and the franchise's first World Series title since 1974, Henderson hit .474 with an .895 slugging average (including two triples and a homer), while stealing three more bases. On August 22, 1989, he became Nolan Ryan's 5,000th strikeout victim, but Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence, saying, \"If you haven't been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you're nobody.\"\nA year later, Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325, losing out to the Kansas City Royals' George Brett on the final day of the season. Henderson had a remarkably consistent season, with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game, the third of the year. Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games, he led the league in runs (119), stolen bases (65), on-base percentage (.439) and OPS (1.016) was second in slugging percentage (.577), fourth in walks (97) and extra base hits (66), sixth in home runs (28) and total bases (282) and had 61 RBIs. Henderson won the AL's MVP award and helped Oakland to another pennant. He again performed well in the World Series (.333 batting, .667 slugging, a home run and three steals in four games), but the A's were swept by the underdog Cincinnati Reds.\nOn May 1, 1991, Henderson broke one of baseball's most noted records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than Brock's total compiled from 1961 to 1979, mainly with the St. Louis Cardinals. After his historic achievement, Henderson shouted out: \"I'm the Greatest\".\nOn July 16, 1993, Henderson broke the world stolen base record by stealing his 1,066th base, breaking the record held by Yutaka Fukumoto. In 90 games with Oakland, he was batting .327 with 17 home runs and 47 RBIs. He also scored 77 runs, stole 31 bases, drew 85 walks, had a .469 on-base percentage, and was slugging .553.\nToronto Blue Jays (1993).\nIn July 1993, the Athletics traded Henderson to the playoff-bound Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and Jos\u00e9 Herrera. He performed disappointingly for the Blue Jays, hitting only .215 in 44 games, which was probably due to the fact that he fractured a bone on his hand early on with the team, after being hit by a pitch, although he still contributed 22 stolen bases and 37 runs scored. However, his hitting woes continued in the post-season, batting .120 in the American League Championship Series and .227 in the World Series. Nevertheless, Henderson was involved in the final play of the World Series that year. He and Paul Molitor scored on Joe Carter's Series-ending home run, one of the most famous moments in baseball history.\nThird stint with Oakland Athletics (1994\u20131995).\nAfter the 1993 season, Henderson re-signed as a free agent with Oakland in December 1993. In 1994 and 1995, Henderson finished in the top 10 in the league in walks, steals and on-base percentage. His .300 average in 1995 marked his sixth and final season in the AL with a .300 or better average.\nSan Diego Padres (1996\u20131997).\nHenderson signed with the San Diego Padres in the offseason. In 1996, he again finished in the top ten in the National League (NL) in walks, OBP, steals and runs.\nAnaheim Angels (1997).\nOn August 13, 1997, the Padres traded Henderson to the Anaheim Angels for minor leaguers Ryan Hancock and Stevenson Agosto, as well as a player to be named later. The Padres later acquired George Arias to complete the trade. As an Angel, Henderson batted only .183 for the rest of the season.\nFourth stint with Oakland Athletics (1998).\nIn January 1998, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Athletics, the fourth time he played for the franchise. That season he led the majors in stolen bases (66) and the AL in walks (118), while scoring 101 runs. In so doing, the 39-year-old became the oldest player to lead a league in stolen bases, and the oldest player to reach 50 steals.\nNew York Mets (1999\u20132000).\nIn 1999, he was seventh in the NL in on-base percentage. Henderson was voted the 1999 National League comeback player of the year by \"The Sporting News\". He wore number 24, which\u2014although not officially retired\u2014had not been regularly worn by a Mets player since Willie Mays' retirement in 1973. Nonetheless, Henderson and the Mets were an uneasy fit. After the Mets' loss in the 1999 NLCS, the New York press made much of a card game between Henderson and Bobby Bonilla. Both players had been substituted out of the lineup, and they reportedly left the dugout before the playoff game had concluded.\nHenderson sought a raise on his $1.9\u00a0million salary for the 2000 season, but the Mets refused to renegotiate. He also feuded with manager Bobby Valentine and complained about traveling to Tokyo for the 2000 season opening series against the Chicago Cubs. Worse, he put in minimal effort, effectively tanking, and forcing his release. Henderson batted .219 with no home runs and two RBIs. The Mets offered him to every team in the league, with no takers. The team then put him on waivers and granted him his release in May, which Mets' general manager Steve Phillips called \"addition by subtraction\".\nSeattle Mariners (2000).\nAfter his release from the Mets, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Seattle Mariners. In his second game as a Mariner, on May 20, Henderson hit a leadoff home run, thus becoming the third player to hit a home run in four different decades (Ted Williams and Willie McCovey were the others). Despite starting the season in the National League, Henderson finished fourth in the AL in stolen bases (31).\nSecond stint with San Diego Padres (2001).\nA free agent in March 2001, Henderson returned to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and on the final day of the season (October 7) collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson in San Diego. That final game was also Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play.\nBoston Red Sox (2002).\nAt age 43, Henderson was the oldest player in the American League.\nWhile playing in Boston, Henderson wore his old number 35, as his regular number 24 was already taken by Red Sox teammate Manny Ramirez.\nNewark Bears and Los Angeles Dodgers (2003).\nAs the 2003 season began, Henderson was without a team for the first time in his career. He played in the independent Atlantic League with the Newark Bears, hoping for a chance with another major league organization. After being named the Atlantic League All-Star Game MVP, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed him in July. In 30 games with the Dodgers, he had 15 hits and three stolen bases, with a .208 batting average.\nCareer statistics.\nNote: All-time MLB leader in category is in bold.\nSource:\nIn 60 postseason games, including 3 World Series (1989, '90, and '93), Henderson batted .284 (63-for-222) with 47 runs scored, 12 doubles, 4 triples, 5 home runs, 20 RBI, 33 stolen bases, 37 walks, .389 on-base percentage, .441 slugging percentage, and .831 on-base plus slugging percentage.\nRetirement.\nBefore the 2003 season, his last in the majors, Henderson discussed his reputation for hanging onto his lengthy baseball career:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each and every day I set a record, but we never talk about it. We'll talk about a home run hitter 24/7. Well, they haven't broken any all-time records, but they hit homers, and that's what matters nowadays. You continue playing, you accomplish a lot, and you'd think people would look at it as a fantastic career. Instead, Rickey thinks people want Rickey to quit more than anything.\"\nHenderson played his last major league game on September 19, 2003; he was hit by a pitch in his only plate appearance, and came around to score his 2,295th run. Though it became increasingly unlikely that he would return, he continued to publicly debate his own official retirement. After leaving the Dodgers, Henderson started his second consecutive season with the Newark Bears in May 2004. In 91 games he had a .462 OBP, with more than twice as many walks (96) as strikeouts (41), and stole 37 bases while being caught only twice. On May 9, 2005, Henderson signed with the San Diego Surf Dawgs of the Golden Baseball League, an independent league. This was the Surf Dawgs' and the Golden Baseball League's inaugural season, and Henderson helped the team to the league championship. In 73 games he had a .456 OBP, with 73 walks while striking out 43 times, and 16 steals while being caught only twice. It would be his final professional season.\nHenderson would not accept the end of his major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN reported that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the Surf Dawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. Six weeks later, though, on August 11, he claimed \"It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off\", adding, \"I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens.\"\nOn May 18, 2007, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" reported that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided it did not \"infringe on the integrity of the roster or of the season\", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, \"One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum\u2014and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know.\" The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.\nHenderson finally conceded his \"official retirement\" on July 13, 2007: \"I haven't submitted retirement papers to MLB, but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired.\" Characteristically, he added, \"If it was a situation where we were going to win the World Series and I was the only player that they had left, I would put on the shoes.\"\nContrary to speculation, Henderson's refusal to officially retire had not been delaying his eligibility for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period has been based on major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, \"I believe today, and people say I'm crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them ... they can always ring my phone and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game.\"\nIn 2011, on the 20th anniversary of his record-breaking stolen base, the Oakland A's held \"Rickey Henderson Bobblehead Day\". At Henderson's insistence, the giveaway plastic dolls had one atypical modification: \"I told them, put a little dirt on mine, make sure that [it looks] like I'm playing the game.\" Almost eight years after his final game, Henderson also reiterated his desire to return: \"Sometimes when I sit around and look at the game and things ain't going right, I just think, 'Just let me put on the uniform and go out there and take a chance'.\"\nCoaching career.\nNew York Mets (2007).\nThe New York Mets hired Henderson as a special instructor in 2006, primarily to work with hitters and to teach base stealing. Henderson's impact was noticeable on Jos\u00e9 Reyes, the Mets' former leadoff hitter. \"I always want to be around the game,\" Henderson said in May 2007. \"That's something that's in my blood. Helping them have success feels just as good.\"\nOn July 13, 2007, the Mets promoted Henderson from special instructor to first base coach, replacing Howard Johnson, who became the hitting coach. Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008. Henderson had periodically been a special instructor in the Athletics' spring training camps. In 2010, he worked on base stealing (most notably with Rajai Davis and Coco Crisp) and outfield drills.\nImage and personality.\n\"Sports Illustrated\"'s Tom Verducci wrote in 2003, \"There are certain figures in American history who have passed into the realm of cultural mythology, as if reality could no longer contain their stories: Johnny Appleseed. Wild Bill Hickok. Davy Crockett. Rickey Henderson. They exist on the sometimes narrow margin between Fact and Fiction.\"\nHenderson referred to himself in the third-person.\nAccording to Verducci, during one off-season, Henderson called Padres general manager Kevin Towers and left this message: \"Kevin, this is Rickey. Calling on behalf of Rickey. Rickey wants to play baseball.\" However, Henderson denied that this happened in a February 26, 2009, interview on Mike and Mike in the Morning. In 2003, he discussed his unusual phraseology, saying, \"People are always saying, 'Rickey says Rickey.' But it's been blown way out of proportion. Rickey says it when Rickey doesn't do what Rickey needs to be doing. Rickey uses it to remind himself, like, 'Rickey, what you doing, you stupid. ... ' Rickey's just scolding himself.\" Henderson did use the first person pronoun on occasion, such as when he defended his position during a contract dispute: \"All I'm asking for is what I want.\"\nHenderson was so proud of a $1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months' interest. Similarly, Henderson refused to spend his per diem money that all players receive on road trips: instead, he would put the envelopes containing the cash in a box, and when one of his children performed well in school he would invite them to choose an envelope out of the box and keep its contents. In 2002, following an argument with pitcher Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, Henderson stated, \"He needs to grow up a little bit. I ain't a kid. When I broke into the game, he was crawling on his hands and knees. Unless he's as old as I am. He probably is.\" (Hern\u00e1ndez is approximately seven years younger.)\nHenderson had a reputation for forgetting or not learning people's names, including those of his teammates.\nThere are many unconfirmed stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn) once offered him a seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, \"Ten years? What are you talking about? Rickey got 16, 17 years.\" One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player. While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson was said to have commented on first baseman John Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, \"That was me.\" The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, as well as with the 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.\nVerducci wrote, \"Rickey is the modern-day Yogi Berra, only faster.\" Henderson himself was resigned to his persona: \"A lot of stuff they had me doing or something they said I had created, it's comedy. I guess that's how they want to judge me, as a character.\"\nA bobblehead of Henderson as an Athletic appeared in \"Toy Story 4\".\nPersonal life and death.\nIn 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They had three children.\nHenderson died on December 20, 2024, five days before his 66th birthday, at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center following a bout of pneumonia. According to Dave Stewart, Henderson, who was asthmatic and endured related sinus issues, was admitted to the hospital that day for a related surgery, but never recovered. News of Henderson's death spread that evening on X as an unconfirmed rumor, but was not confirmed by his family in the media until the following day.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt took a long time, huh [Pause for cheers] First of all, I would like to thank God for giving me the opportunity. I want to thank the Haas family, the Oakland organization, the city of Oakland, and all you beautiful fans for supporting me. [Pause for cheers] Most of all, I'd like to thank my mom, my friends, and loved ones for their support. I want to give my appreciation to Tom Trebelhorn and the late Billy Martin. Billy Martin was a great manager. He was a great friend to me. I love you, Billy. I wish you were here. [Pause for cheers] Lou Brock was the symbol of great base stealing. But today, I'm the greatest of all time. Thank you.\n\u2014Rickey Henderson's full speech after breaking Lou Brock's record.\nOn May 1, 1991, Henderson stole his 939th base to pass Lou Brock and became the sport's all-time stolen base leader. Henderson's speech after breaking Brock's record was similar to the standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words \"greatest of all time.\" These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant, although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer \"had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was going to say that day.\" On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, \"He spoke from his heart.\" Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, \"How are we gonna break it?\"\nHenderson has mixed feelings about his comments:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As soon as I said it, it ruined everything. Everybody thought it was the worst thing you could ever say. Those words haunt me to this day, and will continue to haunt me. They overshadow what I've accomplished in this game.\nAt the end of his July 2009 Hall of Fame induction, Henderson alluded to his earlier speech, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In closing, I would like to say my favorite hero was Muhammad Ali. He said at one time, quote, \"I am the greatest,\" end of quote. That is something I always wanted to be. And now that the Association has voted me into the Baseball Hall of Fame, my journey as a player is complete. I am now in the class of the greatest players of all time. And at this moment, I am ... \"[pause]\" ... very, very humble. Thank you.\nAsked if he believes the passage of time will improve his reputation, Henderson said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If you talk about baseball, you can't eliminate me, because I'm all over baseball... It's the truth. Telling the truth isn't being cocky. What do you want me to say, that I didn't put up the numbers? That my teams didn't win a lot of games? People don't want me to say anything about what I've done. Then why don't you say it? Because if I don't say it and you don't say it, nobody says it.\nHenderson had 468 more stolen bases in his career than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game's second-most prolific basestealer. In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the world record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan's Pacific League. In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he led the league in steals every season except 1987, when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury, allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader. However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history. (Carlos Beltran ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at just over 86%.)\nOn July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signaling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.\nLongtime scout Charlie Metro remembered the havoc caused by Henderson: '\"I did a lot of study and I found that it's impossible to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it.\"\nSportswrite Joe Posnanski marveled that Henderson had 796 career walks when leading off an inning:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Think about this again. There would be nothing, absolutely nothing, a pitcher would want to avoid more than walking Rickey Henderson to lead off an inning. And yet he walked SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX times to lead off an inning. He walked more times just leading off in an inning than Lou Brock, Roberto Clemente, Luis Aparicio, Ernie Banks, Kirby Puckett, Ryne Sandberg and more than 50 other Hall of Famers walked in their entire careers.\nHenderson was a headfirst slider. In September 2008, Henderson discussed his base-stealing technique at length with \"Sports Illustrated\":\nI wanted to know how to dive into the base because I was getting strawberries on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [low-to-the-ground] technique from airplanes... I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think.Padres closer Trevor Hoffman said, \"I don't know how to put into words how fortunate I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game. I can't comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth.\" When Henderson was 44 years old and playing for the Newark Bears in 2003, Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, \"I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.'... I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody... We've had some special players come through San Diego. But there's an aura about him nobody else has.\"\nTony La Russa, Henderson's manager in the late 1980s in Oakland, said, \"He rises to the occasion\u2014the big moment\u2014better than anybody I've ever seen.\" Coach Rene Lachemann said, \"If you're one run down, there's nobody you'd ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey.\" Teammate Mitchell Page said, \"It wasn't until I saw Rickey that I understood what baseball was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That's it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don't care when, the score's already 1\u20130. If he's with you, that's great. If he's not, you won't like it.\"\nA's pitching coach Dave Duncan said of Henderson, \"You have to be careful because he can knock one out. But you don't want to be too careful because he's got a small strike zone and you can't afford to walk him. And that's only half the problem. When he gets on base he's more trouble still.\" Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote, \"Baseball is designed to be an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate... Yet in the past quarter-century Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game.\"\nIn July 2007, \"New York Sun\" sportswriter Tim Marchman posited that Henderson's accomplishments were \"not because of his body, but because of his brain\". He praised his ability to detect if a pitcher was throwing to first or home plate, and his discipline to coax walks as a means to get on base. Added Marchman:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Maybe he'd get a bit more credit for all this if he were some boring drip like Cal Ripken Jr., blathering on endlessly about humility and apple pie and tradition and whatever else, but we're all better off with things the way they are... Everyone had their fun when he broke Lou Brock's stolen base record and proclaimed, 'I am the greatest', but he was, of course, just saying what was plainly true.\"\nCareer milestones.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], Henderson ranks first all-time in runs scored (2,295) and stolen bases (1,406), fourth in career games played (3,081), 13th in at bats (10,961), and 27th in hits (3,055). He has the second-highest career power\u2013speed number, behind Barry Bonds, at 490.4. Henderson reached 20+ homers and 50+ steals in the same season a record four times. His record for most career walks (2,190) was broken by Bonds; Henderson is now second but continues to hold the record for most unintentional walks (2,129). While his career batting average of .279 is considered somewhat modest for a leadoff hitter, his walks helped him post a stout .401 on-base percentage (OBP) for his career. He posted an OBP of at least .400 in 16 separate seasons, with a high mark of .439 in his 1990 MVP season. Henderson averaged 115 walks per 162 games over his career.\nHenderson also holds the record for most home runs to lead off a game, with 81; George Springer is second with 63, as of September\u00a02025[ [update]]. During the 2003 season, Henderson surpassed Babe Ruth for the career record in secondary bases (total bases compiled from extra base hits, walks, stolen bases, and times hit by pitch). In 1993, he led off both games of a doubleheader with homers. At the time of his last major league game, Henderson was still in the all-time top 100 home run hitters, with 297. Bill James wrote in 2000, \"Without exaggerating one inch, you could find fifty Hall of Famers who, all taken together, don't own as many records, and as many \"important\" records, as Rickey Henderson.\"\nHenderson's record for the most postseason stolen bases was broken by Kenny Lofton's 34th career steal during the 2007 ALCS; Henderson is the only American League player to steal more than 100 bases in a single season (having accomplished the feat three times), and he is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland A's.\nIn 1999, before breaking the career records for runs scored and walks, Henderson was ranked number 51 on \"The Sporting News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2005, \"The Sporting News\" updated their 100 Greatest Players list, and Henderson had inched up to number 50. On January 12, 2009, Henderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot, receiving 94.8% of the vote. This was the 13th highest percentage in major league history.\nAsked to choose the best player in history, Henderson declined, saying, \"There are guys who have done different things very well, but I don't know of anyone who mastered everything.\" Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, \"I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. The little things, I probably mastered.\" Of his various records and achievements, he valued his career-runs-scored mark the most: \"You have to score to win.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65456", "revid": "50393593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65456", "title": "London Stansted Airport", "text": "International airport in Essex, England\nStansted Airport () is an international airport serving the south-east of England. It is located near Stansted Mountfitchet, in the district of Uttlesford, Essex; it lies north-east of Central London.\nAs London's third-busiest airport, Stansted serves over 180 destinations across Europe, Asia and North Africa. London Stansted is a base for a number of European low-cost carriers; this includes being the largest base for low-cost airline Ryanair, with over 150 destinations served by the airline. As of 2022[ [update]], it is the fourth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom, after Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, it ranked second in the country. Stansted's runway is also used by private companies, such as the Harrods Aviation, Titan Airways and XJet terminals, which are private ground handlers that can handle private flights, charter flights and state visits.\nConverted to civil use from RAF Stansted Mountfitchet in the late 1940s, Stansted was used by charter airlines. It came under British Airports Authority control in 1966. The privatised BAA sold Stansted in February 2013 to Manchester Airports Group as a result of a March 2009 ruling by the Competition Commission against BAA's monopoly position.\nThe airport has one main passenger terminal, which opened in 1991, with three passenger satellites containing the departure gates. The terminal building was designed by Foster and Partners and is regarded as influential for airport architecture.\nFrom 1997 to 2007, Stansted had rapid expansion of passenger numbers on the back of the boom in low-cost air travel, peaking at 24million passengers in the 12 months to October 2007, but passenger numbers declined in the next five years. Passenger totals later increased and it recorded an annual increase of 8.0% to 24.3million in 2016; numbers have since continued to rise.\nHistory.\nSecond World War.\nThe airfield opened in early July 1943 with a dedication ceremony for the Stansted Airfield with a parade of builders, the 825th Engineer Aviation Battalion EAB and the 850th Engineer Aviation Battalion EAB of the United States Army, along with a small group of the British Royal Engineers who offered to help and wanted to learn how to operate the heavy construction equipment. Stansted Mountfitchet Airport was used during the Second World War as RAF Stansted Mountfitchet by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces as a bomber airfield and as a major maintenance depot. Although the official name was Stansted Mountfitchet, the base was known as simply Stansted in both written and spoken form.\nThe station was first allocated to the USAAF Eighth Air Force in August 1942 as a heavy-bomber airfield. As well as an operational bomber base, Stansted was also an Air Technical Services Command maintenance and supply depot concerned with major overhauls and modification of B-26s. After D-Day, these activities were transferred to France, but the base was still used as a supply storage area for the support of aircraft on the continent.\nPostwar use.\nAfter the withdrawal of the Americans on 12 August 1945, Stansted was taken over by the Air Ministry and used by No. 263 Maintenance Unit, RAF, for storage purposes. In addition, between March 1946 and August 1947, Stansted was used for housing German prisoners of war.\nIn November 1946, the recently established British cargo airline, London Aero and Motor Services, equipped with ex-RAF Handley Page Halifaxes, moved into Stansted, using it as a base for its operations until it was wound up in July 1948.\nThe Ministry of Civil Aviation finally took control of Stansted in 1949 and the airport was then used as a base by several UK charter airlines. The US military returned in 1954 to extend the runway for a possible transfer to NATO. The transfer to NATO was never realised, however, and the airport continued in civil use, ending up under BAA control in 1966.\nDuring the 1960s, '70s, and early '80s, the Fire Service Training School was based on the eastern side of the airfield under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Civil Aviation Authority. The school was responsible for the training of all aviation fire crews for British airfields, as well as those of many overseas countries.\nUnder BAA ownership (1966\u20132013).\nBeginning in 1966, after Stansted was placed under BAA control, the airport was used by holiday charter operators wishing to escape the higher costs associated with operating from Heathrow and Gatwick.\nStansted had been held in reserve as a third London airport since the 1950s. However, after a public inquiry at Chelmsford in 1966\u201367, the government set up the Roskill Commission to review the need afresh. The Commission for the Third London Airport (the \"Roskill Commission\") of 1968\u201371 did not include Stansted as one of its four short-listed sites and recommended that Cublington in Buckinghamshire should be developed as London's third airport. However, the Conservative government under Ted Heath agreed with a minority recommendation that a site at Foulness in the Thames Estuary, later renamed Maplin, should be developed, but in 1974, the incoming Labour government under Harold Wilson cancelled the Maplin project because of the economic situation.\nStansted was then considered as an option for long-term development in the Advisory Committee on Airports Policy and the Study Group on South East Airports and was selected from a short list of six by the Conservative government in December 1979. The proposal, for a new terminal associated with the existing runway and the safeguarding of land for a second runway, was considered at the Airports Inquiries of 1981\u201383. The \"Inspector's Report\" was published in 1984 and the decision, announced in a white paper in 1985, was to approve a plan to develop Stansted in two phases, involving both airfield and terminal improvements that would increase the airport's capacity to 15million passengers per year, but to reject the second runway.\nRedevelopment into London's third airport.\nThe redevelopment of Stansted into London's third airport began with outline planning permission granted in 1985, for a new terminal building to accommodate up to 15million passengers annually.\nInitially, the project was planned in two phases. The first phase was designed to permit an annual capacity of 8million passengers, while the second phase was intended to expand the terminal's capacity to 15million passengers per annum. It was initially believed that any future development beyond this capacity would require the construction of a second major terminal building.\nFoster Associates terminal.\nFoster Associates, founded by architect Norman Foster, was commissioned to design the new terminal building, with structural engineering led by Peter Rice at principal engineers Ove Arup &amp; Partners. The plans were approved in 1985, and construction took place between 1988 and 1991 by the John Laing company at a cost of \u00a3100million. The terminal building originally comprised a square structure of 11 bays by 11 bays, and opened to the public in 1991. It received the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture (Mies van der Rohe Award) in 1990. As part of the development, a railway branch was built to the airport for Stansted Airport railway station, built at ground level within the terminal.\nThe building was recognised as a landmark work of high-tech architecture. Foster + Partners' design for Stansted Airport is widely regarded as a transformative influence on airport architecture. The building features open canopies that visually connect the landside and airside, and challenged conventional airport layouts by relocating essential services underground, instead creating an open and flexible main concourse that is naturally illuminated. The \"floating\" roof, supported by a space frame of inverted-pyramid roof trusses, creates the impression of a stylised swan in flight. The base of each truss structure is a \"utility pillar\", which provides indirect uplighting illumination and is the location for air-conditioning, water, telecommunications, and electrical outlets. The layout of the airport was originally designed to provide an unobstructed flow for passengers to arrive at the short-stay car park, move through the check-in hall, and go through security and on to the departure gates, all on the same level. These principles influenced the design of future projects around the world.\nIn 1999, planning permission was granted for Phase 2 of the terminal expansion, which included extending the width to 15 bays, as well as the addition of the third satellite building.\nFurther developments.\nA major expansion programme to the terminal took place between 2007 and 2009, extending the width by 2 bays, with nearly of floorspace, to give space for additional baggage carousels, a new immigration and passport control hall.\nIn November 2006, Uttlesford District Council rejected a BAA planning application to increase the permitted number of aircraft movements and to remove the limit on passenger numbers. BAA immediately appealed against the decision and a public inquiry opened, lasting from May until October 2007. Planning Inspector Alan Boyland made his recommendations in January 2008. Those recommendations were largely followed by the Secretary of State for Transport (Geoff Hoon) and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears), who jointly allowed the applicant's appeal in October 2008. A legal challenge by community campaign group Stop Stansted Expansion was rejected by the High Court in March 2009.\nThe Competition Commission ruled in March 2009 that BAA should sell Gatwick and Stansted Airports within two years. The ruling was quashed within a year following an appeal, but was subsequently upheld. The Competition Commission reconfirmed its ruling in July 2011 that the airport be sold, and the Court of Appeal turned down an appeal by BAA on 26 July 2012. In light of the result, BAA chose not to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and confirmed on 20 August 2012 that the airport would be sold.\nUnder MAG ownership (2013\u2013).\nIn January 2013 it was announced that MAG (Manchester Airports Group) had agreed to purchase London Stansted Airport for \u00a31.5billion. The sale was completed on 28 February 2013.\nMAG announced on 20 June 2013 as part of a visit to the airport by the Secretary of State for Transport that it would be launching an \u00a380million terminal redevelopment programme. MAG has invested \u00a340million and the remainder was invested by other commercial partners. The redevelopment included relocation of the security area, doubling the amount of seating, and improving the information displays. The new Departure Lounge offers a food court, new shops, and an Escape Lounge.\nIn 2017, Antonov Airlines opened a UK office at Stansted for cargo charter flights, generally of outsize loads.\nCOVID-19 pandemic and recovery.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on London Stansted Airport, leading to a significant reduction in passenger numbers and operational challenges. In 2020, the airport served just over 7.5million passengers, a large decline from its pre-pandemic levels of around 28million annually. At the height of the crisis, Stansted experienced a 95% drop in passenger footfall compared to 2019. Cargo operations, however, saw a 53% increase as the airport adapted to new demands. Airport authorities described the situation as an unprecedented crisis, likening the passenger levels to those seen in the early 1990s.\nAs travel restrictions began to ease in July 2021, London Stansted Airport experienced widespread disruption as passenger numbers surged during the summer holidays. The airport faced staff shortages and increased COVID-19 documentation requirements, leading to long queues and chaotic scenes, with insufficient personnel available to manage the crowds effectively. The airport showed signs of recovery by late 2022, with passenger levels nearing 97% of pre-pandemic volumes.\nIn the wake of this recovery, in 2023 Stansted Airport announced a \u00a31.1billion expansion plan including a \u00a3600million extension of the terminal and facilities, to increase its capacity to serve up to 43million passengers per year. This expansion is expected to add 200 flights per day to the airport's schedule and create over 5,000 jobs over the next five years.\nInfrastructure.\nTerminal and satellite buildings.\nThe terminal is separated into three general areas: Check-in and main concourse along the front, departures towards the southern end, and international arrivals to the northern end of the building. There is a separate baggage reclaim for Domestic arrivals. No gates are in the main terminal building; instead, they are located in three separate oblong satellite buildings, one connected to the main terminal by air bridges, one by the Stansted Airport Transit System people mover, and one by both. Four further bussing gates are accessed from below the main terminal building. The airport has 52 gates with 12 serviceable jetbridges. Long-term plans for Satellite 4, approved in 1999 and revised in 2005, have not been realised, but its site was developed as remote stands in 2018.\nAs of 2013, Satellite 1 (Gates 1-19) had been redeveloped with the aim to attract more long-haul airlines to Stansted. Furthermore, a dual jetbridge has been added at Stand 13 (Boarding Gate 12), allowing faster boarding and deboarding of wide-body aircraft. An additional building, known as the Advanced Passenger Vehicle (APV), was brought back into use in 2016 for flights departing during the busy 06:00 to 09:00 period. The APV building is linked to the main terminal building by an accessible route and acts as a bus terminal for international flights at remote stands. Prior to the completion of Satellite 3, this terminal (then consisted of gates 90\u201395) was in regular passenger use.\nDomestic arrivals (from the UK) use a separate exit route, located at the opposite end of the Terminal to the International arrivals hall. This exit is connected solely by footbridge from Satellite 2 gates 81\u201388. When a domestic flight arrives at a gate which is not located in Satellite 2, passengers are transported to a gate on Satellite 2 by a courtesy bus service from the aircraft.\nCommon Travel Area arrivals are coached from stand, and taken to a separate entrance located at the North East of the terminal which leads to the main terminal baggage reclaim belts, bypassing Border Force, but without bypassing Customs.\nCar parks.\nStansted has a variety of car parking including long-, mid-, and short-stay options along with valet and meet-and-greet parking services. Two drop off areas also are available. The express area is located near the short-stay car park, while a free service is within the mid-stay area. A fee is charged for the express service. Terminal Road North and its free drop-off area directly outside the terminal was closed shortly after MAG took over the airport in 2013.\nControl tower.\nStansted's air traffic control tower was completed in 1996 and was the tallest in Britain at the time of its construction. It is located on the southside of the airfield alongside the main terminal building. It replaced the old control tower, which offered poor views of the airfield once the current terminal building was opened in 1991.\nCargo handling.\nThere are several cargo buildings and hangars around the airfield. The main cargo centre is located by the control tower and handles most cargo operations, including aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and the Boeing 747. There are a small number of hangars on the other side of the runway to the rest of the airport. The largest are located at the south east of the airfield, one of which is used by Ryanair.\nOther facilities.\nTitan Airways has its head office in the Enterprise House on the airport property. Several airlines at one time had their head offices on the airport property. AirUK (later KLM uk) had its head office in the Stansted House. When Buzz existed, its head office was in the Endeavour House. When AB Airlines existed, its head office was in the Enterprise House. For a period Lloyd International Airways had its head office at the Lloyd House at Stansted. When Go Fly existed its head office was at the Enterprise House.\nSince 2004, Stansted also offers a range of hotel accommodation including Holiday Inn Express, Novotel, Premier Inn, and Radisson Blu hotels and the recently opened Hampton by Hilton, the last two of which are both within two minutes of the terminal building via an undercover walkway. Regular bus service handles transfers between the terminal building and Stansted's car parks and hotels.\nProposed developments.\nRunway.\nPlans for a second runway.\nOn 11 March 2008, BAA submitted a planning application (titled \"G2\") to expand the airport by and for the construction of a second runway and terminal, etc., in line with a recommendation in the 2003 Air Transport White Paper (ATWP). This would have been the subject of a public inquiry, and if approved, would have allowed Stansted to handle more passengers than Heathrow did at the time of the application.\nIn May 2010, BAA withdrew its plans to build a second runway at Stansted and withdrew the plans to build a new runway at Heathrow.\nThe ATWP had anticipated that a second runway would be operational by 2011, but this date continued to slip. BAA's 2008 planning application envisaged operation commencing in 2015, and in 2009, BAA revised the anticipated opening date to 2017.\nPrior to the United Kingdom's May 2010 general election, all three major political parties pledged not to approve a second runway. Soon after the election, the new government confirmed this, and BAA withdrew its application for planning permission, having spent nearly \u00a3200million preparing for the public inquiry and buying up properties.\nThe public inquiry into BAA's second runway application had been scheduled to start on 15 April 2009, but the start was delayed by Secretary of State Hazel Blears to allow time for BAA and the government to consider the implications of the March 2009 Competition Commission's ruling that BAA must sell Stansted within two years. As 2011 drew to a close, BAA was still appealing against the Competition Commission ruling. On 20 August 2012, after losing a case at the Court of Appeal, BAA agreed to cease challenging the Competition Commission's ruling and to sell Stansted.\nOn 10 February 2010, Secretary of State John Denham, in an open letter, concluded that the inquiry could not reasonably start until after the general election. In addition, he commented that the planning application documents were nearly two years old and would require updating. Eventually, BAA realised the futility of pursuing its G2 application in the context of the new government policy and withdrew it on 24 May 2010.\nStop Stansted Expansion.\nThe advocacy group Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE) was formed in 2002, as a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, runway expansion plans for Stansted Airport subsequently defined in the Air Transport white paper in December 2003. In September 2012, as a result of pressure from the aviation industry, the government set up the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, to consider what, if anything, needed to be done to maintain the UK's status as a global aviation hub. The commission concluded that an additional runway would be required for South East England and that it should be added to either Heathrow or Gatwick. Following the 2015 election, the commission made a final recommendation to expand Heathrow subject to certain environmental constraints.\nTerminal.\nOngoing Terminal extension.\nIn July 2023, MAG announced a new proposal for a reconfiguration and three-bay extension to the existing terminal building, which will increase its size by a third. This plan aims to create increased passenger amenities, with an expected cost of \u00a3600million. The extension plan will increase the terminal's size by 16,500 square metres, and is designed to accommodate an increase in passenger capacity from 35million to 43million annual passengers. On 1 November 2023, the government's Planning Inspectorate approved the expansion plan. The new terminal design will incorporate a larger departure lounge, an enlarged security hall, and new amenities, including additional shops, bars, and restaurants. The baggage reclaim area will also feature new carousels and increased baggage handling capacity. The redevelopment will include the installation new check-in desks, and next-generation security scanners. Satellite 2 (gates 20-39) is also currently undergoing an upgrade and modernisation programme, with new flooring, lighting, and gate area seating. The existing gate areas are also being reconfigured to model conventional gate-rooms as seen in other airports, with the aim to create more space for passengers when pre-boarding their aircraft \nAs part of the redevelopment project, the existing passenger transit system will be decommissioned and replaced with new walkways that will connect the terminal to the satellite buildings. Additionally, the immigration hall will be relocated to a new area downstairs within the terminal. Also included in the programme is the installation of a 14.3-megawatt on-site solar farm.\nConstruction of the extension is planned to begin in 2025 and is expected to last two to three years.\nProposed Satellite 4.\nPlans for Satellite 4 have never been realised. Located to the northeast of Satellite 3, Satellite 4 was approved for planning permission in 1999 as part of an expansion strategy to increase the airport's capacity from 8 to 15million passengers per annum. A revised scheme in 2005 included a pier link for the proposed satellite, with construction planned for 2013-2015, however plans did not proceed after the sale of BAA to Ferrovial, and construction never commenced. In 2018, the site of Satellite 4 was instead built as remote stands. The current expansion plans for 2024 do not include Satellite 4, and instead focuses on other airfield and terminal improvements.\nFormerly proposed Arrivals Terminal.\nIn December 2016, London Stansted Airport unveiled plans for a new \u00a3130million arrivals terminal aimed to handle increasing passenger numbers and relieve pressure on the existing single-terminal setup, which is the busiest of its kind in the UK.\nThe new arrivals terminal was to be located adjacent to the existing terminal and Radisson Blu Hotel. It would feature a larger immigration and baggage reclaim area. This new facility would allow the existing terminal to be reconfigured exclusively for departures, expanding space for check-in, security, and the international departures lounge, and would make London Stansted the only airport in the UK with separate arrivals and departures terminals.\nInitial construction was due to start in 2018, taking three years to complete. However, the arrivals terminal was put on hold at the end of 2019, due to fluctuating travel demand and economic uncertainties. In 2020, Uttlesford District Council refused planning permission for the expansion plan, but the Planning Inspectorate overturned this decision following a public inquiry in 2021. Despite the approval, further delays and changes to the airport's priorities led to the arrivals terminal being deferred.\nIn 2023, following a review of various proposals for increasing terminal capacity, Stansted Airport decided to cancel the arrivals terminal project, opting instead to focus on expanding the existing 1991 terminal building.\nFormerly proposed artwork.\nAs part of the terminal's initial development, in 1988 Norman Foster and British architectural artist Brian Clarke made several proposals for an integral artwork for the terminal building. The principal proposal would have seen the east and west elevations of the terminal clad in two sequences of traditionally mouth-blown, leaded stained glass, along the full length of the building. However, for technical and security reasons, the artwork was not executed. In 1991, the British Airports Authority commissioned a second, smaller stained glass project from Clarke for Stansted Airport in place of the 1988 proposal. The artist designed two stained glass friezes and a high tower of stained glass for a circulation area in the centre of the terminal which, in their composition, echoed elements of Foster's structure; by 1994 the tower had been removed to 'allow greater flow of traffic through the space', and later the friezes were likewise removed.\nAirlines and destinations.\nPassenger.\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled flights to and from Stansted Airport:\nRoute development.\nLong-haul scheduled services commenced in 1987 with a short lived service from the Scottish airline Highland Express to Newark Liberty International Airport via Prestwick Airport. In the early 1990s American Airlines operated a transatlantic service between Stansted and Chicago\u2013O'Hare, but the route was unprofitable and was withdrawn in 1993. Continental Airlines also operated a short lived service from 2 May 2001 from Newark Liberty International Airport, but this service was stopped shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001.\nLong-haul services to the United States returned in late 2005, when Eos Airlines and MAXjet Airways commenced all-business class services from Stansted to New York\u2013JFK. In 2006, MAXjet expanded their service with flights to Washington\u2013Dulles, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. American Airlines began daily flights to Stansted in October 2007 from New York\u2013JFK and was originally expected to operate a second daily flight from April 2008. However, because of the 2000s energy crisis, the 2008 financial crisis, and worsening credit environment at the time, all three services to the United States have since been discontinued following the demise of MAXjet Airways in December 2007 and Eos Airlines in April 2008. Finally, in July 2008, American Airlines withdrew from Stansted, alongside its services to Gatwick, and consolidated all operations at Heathrow.\nLong-haul transatlantic operations made a brief return to Stansted in June 2010, when Sun Country Airlines announced a seasonal weekly service from Stansted to Minneapolis/St. Paul. The flights made a refuelling stopover in Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador as the aircraft used for the flight, a Boeing 737-800, would not be able to complete a nonstop westbound flight from Stansted to Minneapolis. The flights operated from 11 June to 15 August 2010. In 2011, Sun Country operated to Gatwick rather than Stansted and then discontinued flights due to the price involved in carrying fuel on long-haul flights. .\nLong-haul services to Asia commenced in March 2009 with Malaysian low-cost airline AirAsia X providing direct flights to Kuala Lumpur International Airport; however, on 24 October 2011, this service moved to Gatwick Airport before being later withdrawn completely. Low-cost airline Primera Air launched non-stop flights from Stansted to Boston, Newark, Toronto-Pearson and Washington\u2013Dulles, until the collapse of the airline meant the discontinuation of the routes by 2018, leaving Stansted without transatlantic routes once more. In 2018, Emirates began operating daily flights to its hub at Dubai-International using its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. The route has since increased to a twice daily service.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the aviation industry, with Stansted Airport not being immune from the fallout. Ural Airlines (to Moscow\u2013Domodedovo), Scandinavian Airlines (to Copenhagen), Air India (to Amritsar and Mumbai), Air Senegal (to Dakar\u2013Diass) and El Al (to Tel Aviv), were either scheduled to begin in 2020, or had recently begun operation but have since not returned. Additionally, easyJet, one of the largest operators at the airport at the time, announced the closure of their base at Stansted, which had more than two dozen routes and existed for more than a decade, in August 2020.\nStatistics.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1988, over 1.1million passengers passed through Stansted, the first time annual passenger numbers had exceeded 1million at the airport. Consistent year-on-year growth followed, and by 1997, the total had reached over 5million, rapidly rising to almost 12million in 2000.\nIn 2007, passenger numbers peaked at nearly 24million, but then declined for five years, and in 2012, the total was around 17.5million. An increase of 2.2% was recorded in 2013 to 17.8million passengers, then 11.7% in 2014 to 19.9million, followed by 12.8% in 2015 to 22.5million, and 8.0% in 2016 to a record total of 24.3million, making Stansted the fourth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom. Stansted also is a major freight airport, the third-busiest in the UK during 2016, behind London Heathrow and East Midlands Airport, handling in excess of 223,203tonnes per annum, although freight throughput has declined slightly from its 2005 peak level.\nPassenger numbers for the year ending September 2016 increased by 8.4% to over 24million for the first time since 2007. Passenger numbers for 2023 was 28million.\nGround transport.\nAirside Transit system.\nThe Stansted Airport Transit System connects the terminal to the satellite buildings via a free automated people mover service, which runs on dual concrete tracks. The system uses a mix of Adtranz C-100 and CX-100 vehicles to carry passengers to departure gates. Unlike the similar Gatwick Airport Shuttle Transit, the Stansted transit is only accessible \"airside\" (i.e. only after passengers pass through security). As part of the airport expansion plans, it is planned to decommission the Transit System in spring 2026 to make way for an expanded terminal. The transit will be replaced with pedestrian bridges.\nTrains.\nStansted Airport railway station is situated in the terminal building directly below the main concourse.\nServices to London are on the Stansted Express train to and from Liverpool Street in Central London. This service operates every 15minutes and the usual journey time is between 45 and 53minutes. Liverpool Street is served by London Underground and the Elizabeth line, offering access throughout London. The Stansted Express also calls at Tottenham Hale, for the Underground's Victoria line and connections to various destinations in North London and the West End. Some Stansted Express services also call at Stansted Mountfitchet, Bishop's Stortford and/or Harlow Town en route to London Liverpool Street.\nCrossCountry operates an hourly service from the airport to Birmingham New Street, via Cambridge, Peterborough and Leicester. Greater Anglia operates services to Norwich via Cambridge.\nBuses and coaches.\nScheduled express bus or coach services which run to and from London are provided by National Express and Flibco. The bus station is next to the terminal building.\nAirport Bus Express operates service A21 to and from Liverpool Street Station via Stratford. National Express operates nearly 200 round trips a day and runs services A6 to Paddington Station typically every 30minutes and taking 100minutes (via Golders Green, Finchley Road, St. John's Wood, Baker Street and Marble Arch), A7 to Victoria Coach Station typically every 30minutes and taking 115minutes (via Bow, Mile End, Whitechapel, Southwark, and Waterloo), A8 to King's Cross Station typically every 30minutes and taking 115minutes (via Tottenham Hale, Shoreditch and Liverpool Street) and A9 non-stop to Stratford typically up to three times an hour and taking 50minutes.\nNational Express also runs direct coach services to the airport from Luton Airport and Heathrow, and additionally from Birmingham (11 per day), Oxford (eight per day), Norwich (ten per day), and Cambridge (11 per day).\nStansted is also the start of the Essex Airlink X30 coach service to Southend-on-Sea via Chelmsford and London Southend Airport, the X20 coach service to Colchester via Braintree and the X10 coach service to Basildon via Chelmsford, all operated hourly by First Essex.\nLocal bus services operate to nearby communities, including the 510/509/508 (Harlow to Stansted via Stansted Mountfitchet, Parsonage Lane and Takeley, respectively), 7/7a (Bishops Stortford to Stansted), 133 (Braintree), and 6 (Saffron Walden), operated by Arriva.\nRoads.\nStansted is connected to northeast London and Cambridge by the M11 motorway and to Braintree, Colchester, and Harwich by the A120, which is dual-carriageway until Braintree. The road distance to London is .\nAs of October 1996, the airport has 2,500 short-stay parking spaces within walking distance to the terminal. In addition, as of the same month, the airport has over 8,000 long-stay spaces located near the M11 motorway and A120 junction. A courtesy bus service links the long-stay spaces to the terminal. The airport also offers mid-stay parking, closer to the terminal than its long-stay spaces. Stansted Airport also offers valet parking and a meet-and-greet service, which is similar to valet, but marketed more at the leisure-traveller market; both are run from the short-stay car park.\nIncidents and accidents.\nStansted has been designated by the UK government as its preferred airport for any hijacked planes requesting to land in the UK. This is because its design allows a hijacked airliner to be isolated well away from any terminal buildings or runways, allowing the airport to continue to operate while negotiations are carried out, or even while an assault or rescue mission is undertaken. For this reason, Stansted has been involved in more hijack incidents than might be expected for an airport of its size.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was written by Michael Palin and Terry Jones of Monty Python fame and transmitted on BBC Two. Following an initial pilot episode in January 1976, it ran for two series \u2014 five episodes in September and October 1977 and three episodes in October 1979. Each episode had a different setting and characters, looking at a different aspect of British culture and parodying pre-World War II literature aimed at schoolboys. In the title, \"ripping\" is a chiefly British slang colloquialism for \"exciting\" or \"thrilling\", with \"yarn\" used in the sense of a story.\nPilot episode.\nIn 1975, the BBC commissioned a pilot episode from Palin and Jones, which was envisaged to be a light entertainment comedy piece. The result was \"Tomkinson's Schooldays\" (a title loosely inspired by \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\" and suggested by BBC director Terry Hughes). Palin and Jones both wrote and starred in multiple roles. Once the series was picked up, Jones did not appear in any further episodes, following a decision by James Gilbert that it should be a \u201cMichael Palin series\u201d.\nEpisodes.\nThe nine episodes and their original airdates are:\nProduction details.\n\"Tomkinson's Schooldays\" was shot on videotape in front of a studio audience, with filmed exterior scenes. The remaining episodes were all shot on film, and were originally shown with laugh tracks (recorded by showing each completed film to an audience), but with a couple of exceptions these have been omitted from reruns.\nIn 2014, the series was repeated on BBC Four, commencing with \"Tomkinson's Schooldays\" on 3 April. This broadcast included a laugh track. The first episode was preceded by a documentary, \"Alexander Armstrong's Real Ripping Yarns\", which examined the assumptions and outlook of the original boys' magazines of which \"Ripping Yarns\" were a parody. Both Palin and Jones contributed to the programme.\nThe theme tune for the series was \"Fanfare\" from the \u2018Facade Suite No. 2', by Sir William Walton, played by the City of Birmingham Orchestra, conducted by Louis Fr\u00e9maux.\nDirectors.\nTerry Hughes, who had directed \"The Two Ronnies\" and would later direct \"The Golden Girls\" and \"3rd Rock from the Sun\", directed early episodes of \"Ripping Yarns\". Jim Franklin, known for \"The Goodies\", directed other episodes and two episodes in the second series were directed by Alan J. W. Bell, known for \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" and \"Last of the Summer Wine\". Bell used Michael Radford, who later became noted for the films \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", \"White Mischief\" and \"Il Postino\", as cinematographer.\nCast.\nEach episode featured several guest character actors including Ian Ogilvy, Kenneth Colley, Isabel Dean, Liz Smith, Roy Kinnear, Frank Middlemass, Iain Cuthbertson, John Le Mesurier, Jan Francis, Denholm Elliott, Gwen Taylor, Harold Innocent, Richard Vernon, Gwen Watford, Barbara New, Gerald Sim, Gilly Flower, Joan Sanderson, Roger Sloman and David Griffin. John Cleese makes a cameo appearance in the episode \"Golden Gordon\".\nReception.\nThe series was nominated for a BAFTA award in 1978 for 'Best Film Cameraman' (Peter Hall) and won in 1980 for 'Best Light Entertainment Programme/Series'.\nIn a review for the Guardian, Phelim O'Neill praised the show for its superior production values, stating it was \"charming, insightful and very, very silly.\"\nBooks.\nThe scripts were published in book form, with sepia-tinted stills, as \"Ripping Yarns\" (1978; ) and \"More Ripping Yarns\" (1980; ) and later collected in an omnibus volume, \"The Complete Ripping Yarns\" (1999; ).\n\"Across the Andes by Frog\" originally appeared in \"Bert Fegg's Nasty Book for Boys and Girls\", co-authored by Palin and Jones.\nHome media.\nThe series was released on three VHS tapes in the UK in the 1990s. Two of these compilations were reissued by Revelation Films on Region 0 (worldwide) DVD in 2000, though the six episodes included were not remastered.\nThe fully restored series was released in October 2004 as \"The Complete Ripping Yarns\". This two-disc Region 2 DVD set included commentaries on all nine episodes by Palin and Jones and a deleted scene (without soundtrack) from \"Murder at Moorstones Manor\". All of the episodes, except \"Tomkinson's Schooldays\" and \"Murder at Moorstones Manor\", have optional laugh-free soundtracks.\nThe DVD set also includes the only surviving (and rather poor quality) recording of Palin and Jones's comic BBC play \"Secrets\" from 1973, as well as a documentary by Michael Palin entitled \"Comic Roots\" in which he goes back to visit his home town. Not linked in the menu are scans of the first drafts of the scripts for six episodes (\"Tomkinson's Schooldays\", \"The Testing of Eric Olthwaite\", \"Murder at Moorstone Manor\", \"Across the Andes by Frog\", \"The Curse of the Claw\" and \"Whinfrey's Last Case\"), type-written with Palin's handwritten comments and changes in the margin. There is an informative booklet enclosed. This set was also released in Region 1 with all of the above included, apart from \"Secrets\". A further box set, fully remastered, including the directors commentary, was released in 2004.\nThe DVD was re-released in March 2012. To publicise the event, Network hosted a \"Hopathon\" to recreate the \"Tomkinson's School Days\" episode. The intention was to break a Guinness World Record, but not enough people took part.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Over a record 27-year playing career in Major League Baseball (MLB), Ryan pitched for the New York Mets, California Angels, Houston Astros, and Texas Rangers. After his retirement in 1993, Ryan served as chief executive officer (CEO) of the Texas Rangers and an executive advisor to the Houston Astros. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 in his first year of eligibility, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest pitchers of all time.\nRyan was a right-handed power pitcher who consistently threw pitches that were clocked above 100 miles per hour (161\u00a0km/h), being one of the first pitchers to officially be able to do so. He maintained this velocity throughout his pitching career, being known as one of the top pitchers in Major League Baseball into his mid-40s. Ryan was also known to throw a devastating 12\u20136 curveball at exceptional velocity for a breaking ball.\nRyan had a lifetime win\u2013loss record of 324\u2013292 (.526) and was an eight-time All-Star. He has 5,714 career strikeouts, an MLB record that is 839 more than runner-up Randy Johnson. Similarly, Ryan's 2,795 bases on balls lead second-place Steve Carlton by 962 \u2013 walking over 50% more hitters than any other pitcher in MLB history. Ryan's lifetime batting average against of .204 is also a major league record. He recorded 300 strikeouts in a season six different times, a Major League record. Ryan, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, Johnson, Trevor Hoffman, Sandy Koufax, and Billy Wagner are the only six pitchers inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame who had more strikeouts than innings pitched. Ryan is one of three players in history to have his number retired by at least three teams, along with Jackie Robinson (whose number was retired by Major League Baseball) and Frank Robinson.\nRyan is the all-time leader in no-hitters with seven, three more than any other pitcher. He is tied with Bob Feller for the most one-hitters, with 12. Ryan also pitched 18 two-hitters. Despite this, he never pitched a perfect game, nor did he ever win a Cy Young Award; both were largely attributed to his high walk rate. Ryan is one of only 31 players in baseball history to have appeared in MLB games in four different decades, and retired over 7 years later than the next longest-tenured player of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft, Tom Seaver.\nEarly life.\nLynn Nolan Ryan Jr. was born on January 31, 1947, in Refugio, Texas, a small town located just south of Victoria in the southern part of the state. Ryan was the youngest of six children born to Martha Lee (\"n\u00e9e\" Hancock; 1913\u20131990) and Lynn Nolan Ryan Sr. (1907\u20131970). The senior Ryan operated a newspaper delivery service for the \"Houston Post\" that required him to rise in the early morning hours to prepare 1,500 newspapers for delivery over a route. The children were expected to help with the daily tasks. Ryan's family lived in nearby Woodsboro, Texas, in Refugio County, until they moved to Alvin, Texas, in Brazoria County, when Nolan was six weeks old. As a young boy, Nolan enjoyed throwing objects at any target. His father thought baseball was a better usage for his arm; therefore, he encouraged Nolan to play the game.\nRyan joined Alvin Little League Baseball when he was nine, made the all-star team when he was 11 and 12, and pitched the first no-hitter of his life a few years later. Ryan also played various positions besides pitcher. In junior high school, Ryan could throw a softball over 100 yards. After ninth grade, Ryan quit playing football after a tackle and fumble caused by future NFL running back Norm Bulaich made him decide to focus on baseball.\nRyan played baseball for Coach Jim Watson at Alvin High School for all of his high school career. Ryan held the school's single game strikeout record for 44 years, striking out 21 hitters in a seven-inning game. The record was tied by Alvin High School pitchers Aaron Stewart and Josh Land in the same week in 2009. In 1963, at an Alvin High School game at Clear Creek High School in League City, Texas, Red Murff, a scout for the New York Mets, first noticed sophomore pitcher Ryan. Coach Watson recounted to Murff that some opponents refused to bat against Ryan and how his hard pitches would sometimes break bones in his catchers' hands. In his subsequent report to the Mets, Murff stated that Ryan had \"the best arm I've seen in my life.\" As a senior in 1965, Ryan had a 19\u20133 record and led the Alvin Yellow Jackets to the Texas high school state finals. Ryan pitched in 27 games, with 20 starts. He had 12 complete games, with 211 strikeouts and 61 walks.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nAfter he graduated from Alvin, the New York Mets selected Ryan in the 12th round, with the 295th overall pick, of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. Ryan signed with the Mets and pitched for the Marion Mets in the Appalachian League and for the Mets team in the Florida Instructional League. Overall, he was 6\u20139 in 1965 with a 4.33 earned run average (ERA) and 150 strikeouts in 120 innings. In 1966, Ryan pitched for the Class A Greenville Mets of the Western Carolinas League, where he went 17\u20132 with a 2.51 ERA and 272 strikeouts in 183 innings. He was then promoted to the Class AA Williamsport Mets of the Eastern League, where he was 0\u20132 with a 0.95 ERA, striking out 35 batters in 19 innings. Overall, Ryan had 307 strikeouts in 202 minor league innings in 1966, earning a late-season call-up to the New York Mets. In 1967, Ryan pitched three games in relief for the Class AAA Jacksonville Suns, started one game for the Class A Winter Haven Mets and pitched eight games for the Mets team in the Florida Instructional League. In 34 total innings, Ryan had 54 strikeouts in 1967.\nNew York Mets (1966, 1968\u20131971).\nWhen Ryan was called up by the New York Mets in 1966, he was the second-youngest player in the league. Playing in only two games, his first strikeout was Pat Jarvis, and he gave up his first major league home run to Joe Torre.\nRyan missed much of the 1967 season due to illness, an arm injury, and service with the Army Reserve; he pitched only seven innings for the Mets' minor league affiliate in Jacksonville. In the 1968 season, Ryan returned to the major leagues, where he stayed until his retirement in 1993. Ryan was unable to crack into the Mets' pitching rotation, led by Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman. Ryan was used as a reliever and spot starter by the 1969 Mets. Ryan had frequent blisters on his throwing hand and tried several remedies including dipping his fingers in pickle brine.\nAgainst the Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship Series (NLCS), Ryan completed a Mets sweep by throwing seven innings of relief in Game 3, getting his first playoff win (it took him 12 years to get another). Then in the 1969 World Series, Ryan saved Game 3, pitching &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20443 shutout innings against the Baltimore Orioles. The Game 3 victory gave the Mets a 2\u20131 lead in the Series, which they went on to win in five games. It was Ryan's only World Series appearance in his career.\nOn April 18, 1970, Ryan tied a Mets record by striking out 15 batters in one game. Four days later, Ryan's teammate Seaver topped it with a then-MLB record 19 against the San Diego Padres (Ryan tied this record four years later). Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him from just a flamethrower into a pitcher.\nRyan's performance declined sharply in the second half of his final season with the Mets. His ERA for the first half of the 1971 season was 2.24; in the second half, it was 7.74. As of 2021[ [update]], this was the steepest second half increase in ERA for a starting pitcher in MLB history.\nIn five seasons with the Mets, 105 games and 74 starts, Ryan had a 29\u201338 record, with a 3.58 ERA, 1.39 WHIP, with 344 walks and 493 strikeouts in 511 innings.\nCalifornia Angels (1972\u20131979).\nOn December 10, 1971, the 24-year-old Ryan was traded to the California Angels along with pitcher Don Rose, catcher Francisco Estrada, and outfielder Leroy Stanton for shortstop Jim Fregosi (who later managed Ryan in Anaheim). The deal has been cited as one of the worst in Mets history, but was not viewed as unreasonable at the time given Ryan's relatively unremarkable numbers as a Met and Fregosi's good career to that point.\nIn his first season with the Angels, Ryan was given a chance to pitch regularly as a starter for the first time in his career, mainly because by then he had fulfilled his military obligation and no longer had to commute to Houston every other week. He had a league-leading 329 strikeouts\u2014nearly a third more than the AL runner-up, and the fourth-highest total of the 20th century to that point. Within five seasons, the season was only Ryan's fourth-highest strikeout total. He also set a still-standing Major League record by allowing only 5.26 hits per nine innings, breaking Luis Tiant's 5.30 in 1968, as well as posting a 2.28 earned run average that year, to date the second-lowest in franchise history, trailing only Dean Chance's 1.65 in 1964. Though Ryan's actual winning percentage hovered only slightly over .500, his strikeouts and no-hitters brought him media attention. Meanwhile, Fregosi failed to produce as a Met, making no significant contribution to the Mets' 1973 pennant-winning campaign; he was sold to the Texas Rangers mid-season.\nAlthough the Angels were a sub-.500 team and remained one for much of Ryan's time with them, he managed to post some winning records, notably 19\u201316 in 1972, 21\u201316 in 1973, and 22\u201316 in 1974 (the 22 wins tied what remains the Angels franchise record, set by Clyde Wright in 1970). He finished second in the Cy Young Award balloting (losing to Jim Palmer 88\u201362) in 1973. It was the closest he ever came to winning the award. Ryan also led the league in losses in 1976 with a 17\u201318 record (one short of the franchise record for losses). In the early 1970s, many teams used a four-man rotation and expected the starter to complete the game; thus most of the games Ryan started ended in a decision.\nOn July 9, 1972, Ryan struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 3\u20130 win over the Boston Red Sox; he became the seventh American League pitcher to accomplish the immaculate inning, and the first pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat in both leagues (on April 19, 1968, he had struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 2\u20131 win over the St.\u00a0Louis Cardinals, becoming the eighth National League pitcher and the 14th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat).\nRyan threw a no-hitter against the Kansas City Royals on May 15, 1973. He threw a second no-hitter on July 15 against the Detroit Tigers, he struck out 17 batters \u2013 the most in a recorded no-hitter. (This record was later tied by Max Scherzer on October 3, 2015.) Ryan was so dominant in this game, it led to one of baseball's best-remembered pranks. Tigers first baseman and cleanup hitter Norm Cash came to the plate with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, having already struck out twice, and was carrying a clubhouse table leg instead of a bat. Plate umpire Ron Luciano ordered Cash to go back and get a regulation bat, to which Cash replied, \"Why? I won't hit him anyway!\" With a regulation bat in hand, Cash did finally make contact, but popped out to end the game. Cash's teammate Mickey Stanley commented on facing Ryan that day by saying, \"Those were the best pitches I ever heard.\"\nIn 1973, Ryan set his first major record when he struck out 383 batters in one season, beating Sandy Koufax's old mark by one. Remarking on this feat, Koufax joked, \"Yeah, and he also surpassed my total for bases on balls in a single season by 91. I suspect half of those guys he struck out swung rather than get hit.\" Ryan finished second in balloting for the Cy Young Award, behind Jim Palmer.\nPitching 13 innings against the Boston Red Sox on June 14, 1974, Ryan threw 235 pitches, striking out 19, walking 10 and getting a no-decision.\nDuring a September 7, 1974 game against the Chicago White Sox at Anaheim Stadium, Ryan became the first Major League pitcher to have his pitch speed measured during a game. A primitive radar gun clocked a ninth-inning fastball at when it was in front of home plate. This exceeded an earlier pitch by Bob Feller which was measured at at home plate and previously thought to be the fastest pitch ever recorded.\nRyan added a third no-hitter in 1974 and a fourth in 1975, tying another of Koufax's records. In 1974 he twice struck out 19 batters, tying Tom Seaver and Steve Carlton for the single-game record for a nine-inning game. Roger Clemens became the first pitcher with a 20-strikeout game in 1986.\nThe Angels finally made the playoffs in Ryan's eighth and final year there in 1979. He started Game 1 of the ALCS against the Baltimore Orioles and threw seven innings against the Orioles' Jim Palmer, but neither man was involved in the decision as Baltimore won in the 10th inning. Ryan was scheduled to pitch Game 5, but the Angels were eliminated in four. The season complete, Ryan became a free agent.\nRyan led the American League in strikeouts seven times during his eight seasons with the Angels, but he also led the league in walks in six of those years, and finished second the other two seasons: 1975 and 1979. Aside from Bob Feller in 1938, Ryan is the only man since 1900 to walk 200 batters in a season, which he did twice: in 1974 and 1977. Emblematic of this, his 1974 no-hitter against the Minnesota Twins included eight walks.\nThough Ryan's strikeouts and no-hitters got him considerable media attention, he did not persuade Angels general manager Buzzie Bavasi, who dismissed him as a flashy .500 pitcher (Ryan was 26\u201327 in the last two years he was with the Angels).\nIn his eight seasons with the Angels, Ryan was 138\u2013121, a 3.07 ERA, 1.29 WHIP, with 1,302 walks and 2,416 strikeouts in 2181 innings over 288 starts and 156 complete games.\nHouston Astros (1980\u20131988).\nOn November 19, 1979, Ryan signed a four-year contract worth $4.5\u00a0million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024) with the Houston Astros, becoming MLB's first million-dollar player. The salary quadrupled what he had been making with the California Angels. In a nationally televised game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 12, 1980, Ryan hit a three-run home run off Don Sutton. It was the first of two homers in Ryan's career and produced half of the six RBIs he got that year. On July 4 at Riverfront Stadium, Ryan recorded his 3,000th career strikeout, the victim being C\u00e9sar Ger\u00f3nimo of the Cincinnati Reds. The Astros made the 1980 MLB postseason. In the 1980 NLCS versus the Philadelphia Phillies, Ryan pitched well in Game 2, leaving the game tied 2\u20132 in the seventh (having contributed to both Astros runs with a run scored following a walk, and a sacrifice bunt leading to a run) but again got a no-decision in a game that went extra innings. In the fifth and final game of the series, Ryan and the Astros held a 5\u20132 lead entering the 8th inning. But Ryan allowed three consecutive singles before walking in the third run. The Houston bullpen allowed the Phillies to take a 7\u20135 lead, and only a game-tying Astro rally permitted Ryan to escape the loss.\nOn September 26, 1981, Ryan threw his fifth no-hitter, breaking Koufax's mark while becoming the third pitcher to throw a no-hitter in each league. That season, his 1.69 ERA was the best in the National League.\nFacing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1981 NLDS, Ryan threw a complete game two-hitter in the opener, outlasting the Dodgers' rookie sensation Fernando Valenzuela. It was Ryan's second and last career postseason win. In the fifth and final game of the series, Ryan left trailing 3\u20130 and took the loss.\nBy the end of the 1982 season, both Ryan and Steve Carlton were approaching Walter Johnson's all-time strikeout record, sometimes passing one another's career totals in successive starts. On April 27, 1983, Ryan won the race with his 3,509th whiff, against Brad Mills of the Montreal Expos. (Carlton reached the same mark two weeks after Ryan, and Gaylord Perry did so later that season.) On July 11, 1985, Ryan struck out Danny Heep for his 4,000th career strikeout.\nIn 1986, Ryan's Astros faced the New York Mets in the National League Championship Series. Ryan had a shaky start in Game 2, taking the loss. He returned in Game 5, throwing 9 innings of 2-hit, 1-run, 12-strikeout ball, but one of those hits was a Darryl Strawberry home run that tied the game at 1, as Dwight Gooden matched Ryan pitch for pitch. Ryan got a no-decision as his Astros lost in 12 innings.\nIn 1987, Ryan led the major leagues in both ERA (2.76) and strikeouts (270) at the age of 40, but finished 8\u201316 as the result of extremely poor run support; the Astros scored a total of 27 runs in his 16 losses\u2013an average of 1.69 runs per game. Despite his .333 winning percentage, Ryan tied for 5th place in the 1987 Cy Young voting. Ryan hit his second and final career home run in a 12\u20133 win on May 1, 1987, against the Atlanta Braves.\nIn nine seasons as a pitcher with the Astros (his longest tenure with any team), Ryan compiled a 106\u201394 record in 282 starts, a 3.13 ERA, 1.20 WHIP, with 796 walks and 1,866 strikeouts in 1,854 innings.\nTexas Rangers (1989\u20131993).\nRyan left Houston after a contract dispute following the 1988 season and signed with the Texas Rangers at age 42. He became the first player to play for all four MLB original expansion teams: the Mets, Angels, Houston Colt .45s/ Astros and Washington Senators/Texas Rangers. (Ryan was joined in this category by Darren Oliver, who made his major league debut as Ryan's teammate in September 1993. Oliver's father Bob had also been a teammate of Ryan's, with the Angels from 1972 to 1974.) In 1989, he went 16\u201310 and led the league with 301 strikeouts. Against the Oakland Athletics on August 22, Ryan struck out Rickey Henderson, becoming the only pitcher to record 5,000 career strikeouts. Following the game, Henderson was quoted as saying, \"If he ain't struck you out, then you ain't nobody.\" His 4,999th and 5,001st strikeouts were against the same man, Athletics catcher Ron Hassey. Two years later, at 44, Ryan finished fifth in the league in ERA (2.91) and third in strikeouts (203).\nIn 1990, Ryan threw his sixth no-hitter on June 11 against the Athletics, and earned his 300th win on July 31 against the Milwaukee Brewers. On May 1, 1991, at age 44, Ryan extended his record by throwing the seventh no-hitter of his career, striking out Roberto Alomar of the Toronto Blue Jays for the final out. On August 6, 1992, Ryan had the only ejection of his career after engaging in a shouting match with Oakland Athletics outfielder Willie Wilson with two outs in the eighth inning.\nBefore the 1993 season began, Ryan announced that he would retire as a player at the end of that season. On August 4, Ryan hit Robin Ventura of the Chicago White Sox with a pitch, and Ventura charged the mound in order to fight Ryan, who was 20 years his senior. Ryan secured the 26-year-old Ventura in a headlock with his left arm, while pummeling Ventura's head with his right fist six times before catcher Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez was able to pull Ventura away from Ryan. Ryan stated afterwards that it was the same maneuver he used on steers he had to brand on his Texas ranch. Videos of the incident were played that evening throughout the country. While Ventura was ejected, Ryan\u2013who had barely moved from his spot on the mound in the fracas\u2013was allowed to remain in the game. White Sox manager Gene Lamont vehemently argued this, leading to his own ejection. Ryan pitched a hitless game the rest of the way. He had been determined to be more aggressive after coming out on the wrong side of an altercation with Dave Winfield in 1980.\nRyan tore a ligament in his pitching arm in Seattle on September 22, 1993. The injury ended his career two starts earlier than planned, at age 46. Ryan briefly attempted to pitch past the injury, and he threw one additional pitch after tearing his ligament. Ryan's last start was his career-worst; he allowed a single, four walks, and a grand slam in the top of the first without recording an out. It was his record-setting 10th grand slam given up of his career. (Ryan left trailing 5\u20130, and the fourth walk was completed by a reliever after Ryan's injury, but credited to Ryan.) Greg Myers of the California Angels was the last strikeout victim of Nolan Ryan's career, on September 17, 1993.\nRyan finished his career having played in the major leagues a record of 27 seasons. He was the final active player from the 1960s to retire from Major League Baseball, outlasting Carlton Fisk (the final active position player) by three months.\nIn five seasons with the Rangers, Ryan had a 51\u201339 record, a 3.43 ERA, 1.12 WHIP, with 353 walks and 939 strikeouts in 840 innings over 129 starts.\nSeven no-hitters.\nRyan threw a record seven no-hitters during his major league career, three more than any other pitcher. The no-hitters spanned three decades of pitching. In those seven games, Ryan accumulated a total of 94 strikeouts and 26 walks; a ratio of 3.6 strikeouts per walk (his career K:BB was 2.0). Ryan struck out 17 in his no-hitter on July 15, 1973, versus Detroit and walked eight in his subsequent no-hitter against Minnesota, both respective highs for his no-hitters.\nMLB records.\nRyan holds 51 total MLB records, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLater activity.\nNolan Ryan's post-retirement business interests include being the principal owner of Ryan Sanders Sports and Entertainment, which is the ownership group for the Round Rock Express, the Triple-A affiliate of the Texas Rangers.\nRyan threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 of the 2005 World Series between the Astros and the White Sox, the first World Series game played in Texas. That game went 14 innings, equaling the longest in innings in World Series history (at 5 hours and 41 minutes, it was the longest in time). ESPN suggested the Astros might have needed to pull the 58-year-old Ryan out of retirement if the game had gone much longer.\nRyan has co-written six books: autobiographies \"Miracle Man\" (with Jerry Jenkins, 1992), \"Throwing Heat\" (with Harvey Frommer, 1988) and \"The Road to Cooperstown\" (with Mickey Herskowitz and T.R. Sullivan, 1999); \"Kings of the Hill\" (with Mickey Herskowitz, 1992), about contemporary pitchers; and instructional books \"Pitching and Hitting\" (with Joe Torre and Joel Cohen, 1977), and \"Nolan Ryan's Pitcher's Bible\" (with Tom House, 1991).\nIn addition to his baseball activities, Ryan was majority owner and chairman of Express Bank of Alvin but sold his interest in 2005. He also owned a restaurant in Three Rivers, Texas. He served on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission from 1995 to 2001. He appeared as a TV spokesman for Advil for several years. He also has appeared in various television commercials shown in the Texas market.\nAfter retiring from baseball, Ryan teamed up with the federal government to promote physical fitness. His likeness was used in the \"Nolan Ryan Fitness Guide\", published by The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports in 1994. \nRyan suffered a heart attack on April 25, 2000, and had to receive a double coronary bypass.\nRyan owns Nolan Ryan Beef Company, operating out of Round Rock, Texas.\nTexas Rangers president and CEO (2008\u20132013).\nIn February 2008, the Rangers hired Ryan as team president. After the 2009 season, Ryan and Chuck Greenberg submitted a bid to purchase the Rangers from owner Tom Hicks. At midnight on August 5, 2010, the Ryan/Greenberg group, Rangers Baseball Express, was announced as the winner of the final auction to purchase the Rangers, after final approval from Major League Baseball. The final cash bid to purchase the franchise was $385 million. The opposing high bidder was Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. Greenberg became managing general partner and CEO, while Ryan remained as team president.\nGreenberg left the group in March 2011, reportedly due to a philosophical clash with Ryan. Ryan was immediately named as CEO while keeping the title of president. Although Texas oil magnates Ray Davis and Bob Simpson served as co-chairmen and held larger stakes, Ryan became the undisputed head of the franchise, with Davis and Simpson serving mostly as senior consultants.\nRyan was named the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth's 2012 CEO of the Year by Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business.\nDuring the baseball owners' meetings in Scottsdale, Arizona, on March 1, 2013, the Rangers announced that general manager Jon Daniels would add president of baseball operations to his title. Rick George was promoted to president of business operations. Ryan's title was changed simply to CEO, but he remained operating head of the franchise; both Daniels and George reported to him. On October 17, 2013, Ryan announced that he was stepping down as Rangers CEO effective October 31, 2013.\nHouston Astros special assistant (2014\u20132019).\nOn February 11, 2014, Ryan accepted a position as an executive adviser for the Houston Astros under owner Jim Crane. Ryan's son, Reid Ryan, was hired the previous year as president of business operations for the Astros. The Astros won the 2017 World Series and won the 2019 American League pennant. Reid Ryan was demoted by the Astros after the 2019 World Series, and shortly thereafter Nolan Ryan sent a text message to a reporter indicating that he would not return to the Astros front office for the 2020 season.\nLegacy.\nRyan played in more seasons (27) than any other major league player since 1900. (He is tied with Cap Anson for the most all time.) Ryan ranks first for all-time in strikeouts (5,714), fewest hits allowed per nine innings (6.56), and no-hitters (7). He is also fifth in innings pitched (5,386), second in games started (773), seventh in shutouts (61), is tied for 14th in wins (324), and is third in losses (292).\nOpposing hitters hit only .204 against Ryan during his career, although they had a .309 on-base percentage against him. He also limited hitters to a .298 slugging percentage. Ryan had 15 or more strikeouts in a game 26 times, second only to Randy Johnson, who had 28. Ryan's lengthy career spanned generations as he struck out seven pairs of fathers and sons (for example, Bobby Bonds and Barry Bonds), another major league record. Ryan also played during the administrations of seven U.S. Presidents\u2014Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.\u00a0W. Bush, and Bill Clinton\u2014equaling a 20th-century record that had been set by Jim Kaat.\nRyan also ranks high on the list for four \"negative\" records; he ranks first all-time in walks allowed (2,795), first in wild pitches (277), third in losses (292 \u2013 most in the post-1920 live-ball era), and ninth in batters hit (158). Ryan was the first pitcher in MLB history to give up ten grand slam home runs, including one to Dann Howitt, the next-to-last batter Ryan faced in his career; that record has since been surpassed.\nBill James focused on this dichotomy between Ryan's positive and negative statistics. While ranking him as the 24th best pitcher of all time, he noted, \"Ryan has been retired almost ten years [as of 2001], in another ten perhaps we will begin to get a little bit of perspective on him. Ryan's log of spectacular accomplishments is as thick as Bill Clinton's little black book; his list of flaws and failures is lengthy but dry, and will never make for good reading.\"\nOther writers have delved more into the specifics of James' general concerns. ESPN writer Rob Neyer stated in a 2003 column that while Ryan was among the 20 best pitchers since World War\u00a0II, he \"often had trouble throwing strikes, [and] he wasn't any good at fielding his position\". In another column, Neyer, while stating that Ryan belonged in the Hall of Fame, pointed to Ryan's record-breaking walks total and noted that his .309 on-base percentage against \"wasn't even close to being in the top 100\".\nRyan and Frank Robinson are the only two major league players to have their number retired by three teams on which they played. The California Angels retired the number 30 on June 16, 1992; the Texas Rangers retired his number 34 on September 15, 1996; and the Houston Astros retired number 34 on September 29, 1996. His number was the first retired by the Rangers.\nRyan was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 in his first year of eligibility with 98.79% of the vote (491 out of 497 possible), six votes short of a unanimous election and the sixth-highest percentage in history, behind Mariano Rivera (100%, 425 out of 425 possible), Derek Jeter (99.75%, 396 out of 397 possible), Ichiro Suzuki (99.75%, 393 out of 394 possible), Ken Griffey Jr. (99.32%, 437 out of 440 possible), and Tom Seaver (98.84%, 425 out of 430 possible). He chose to wear a Rangers cap for his HOF plaque to reflect his Texas heritage, as well as the fact that his 300th win, 5000th strikeout, and last two no-hitters came as a Ranger. He was the first Hall of Famer inducted as a Ranger. However, the Hall of Fame recognizes the Los Angeles Angels as his primary team.\nIn 1999, he ranked 41st on \"The Sporting News\" list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. He was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame in 2003, and named the Rangers', and Astros' Hometown Hero in 2006\u2014the only player to be so named by two franchises. In 2020, \"The Athletic\" ranked Ryan at number 50 on its \"Baseball 100\" list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.\nIn 2011, he was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.\nIn 1992, the United States Mint produced a $1 commemorative coin honoring Olympic baseball depicting a pitcher in a USA Baseball uniform in a pose nearly identical to Ryan's photo on his 1991 Fleer baseball card. The numismatic community subsequently referred to the coin as the \"Nolan Ryan dollar.\"\nIn 1995 the Texas State Legislature declared State Highway 288, which passes near Alvin, as the Nolan Ryan Expressway.\nThe Alvin Independent School District opened Nolan Ryan Junior High School, located at 11500 Shadow Creek Parkway (FM 2234) in Pearland, Texas, just a few hundred yards away from the Nolan Ryan Expressway.\nThe Nolan Ryan Foundation is a Texas nonprofit organization that supports youth, education, and community development and is headquartered in Round Rock, Texas.\nThe Texas Trail of Fame inducted Ryan in 2009. The Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame inducted Ryan in 2010.\nA documentary, \"Facing Nolan\", was released in 2022.\nPersonal life.\nRyan married his high school sweetheart, Ruth Holdorff, on June 26, 1967. Nolan and Ruth attended Alvin High School together. Ruth was a high school state tennis champion. They have three children: Reid, Reese, and Wendy. Reid and Reese were both pitchers for the TCU Horned Frogs. Reid also pitched briefly in the minor leagues. On May 17, 2013, Reid was announced as president of the Houston Astros.\nNolan frequently pitched in the off-seasons, with Ruth often donning catching gear and serving as his catcher. Ruth Ryan also coached their sons' little league teams for a few summers.\nNolan Ryan resides in the Cimarron Hills community in Georgetown, Texas.\nPolitical activity.\nRyan wrote in his 1992 autobiography \"Miracle Man\" that he voted for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford in 1976, but since then has generally identified as a Republican, though he does not automatically vote this way and looks at individual candidates, mentioning disgust at one particular election in which the two major parties were forcing a choice between \"the racist or the criminal.\" He also crossed party lines in 2002 to headline a group of Republicans and Independents supporting a Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Texas. He has maintained a decades-long friendship with the Bush family, partially due to George W. Bush being a part-owner of the Rangers while Ryan played there. However, in his 1992 book Ryan expressed some criticisms of the elder Bush's (George H.W. Bush) management of domestic issues and said he wasn't \"locked in\" to voting for Bush that fall. In 1996 Ryan campaigned on behalf of Ron Paul in the election for Texas's 14th congressional district; his hometown of Alvin was located in the district.\nOn April 7, 2011, Todd Staples announced that Nolan Ryan would be his statewide chairman for his exploratory committee for lieutenant governor. Ryan is quoted as saying, \"Todd Staples is the top prospect for the Texas Republican Party in 2014.\" Staples, however, lost that race to current Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick of Houston.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a native of Dacia Aureliana near historic Thrace. He is sometimes surnamed with the epithet the Great (; ), probably to distinguish him from his young grandson and co-\"augustus\" Leo II ().\nDuring his 17-year rule, he oversaw a number of ambitious political and military plans, aimed mostly at aiding the faltering Western Roman Empire and recovering its former territories. He is notable for being the first Eastern Emperor to legislate in Koine Greek rather than Late Latin. He is commemorated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with his feast day on 20 January.\nReign.\nHe was born in Thracia or in Dacia Aureliana province in the year 401 to a Thraco-Roman family. His Dacian origin is mentioned by Candidus Isaurus, while John Malalas believes that he was of Bessian Thracian stock. According to the \"Patria of Constantinople\" he had one sister, Euphemia, who never married; Leo is said to have visited her in Constantinople on a weekly basis, and she later erected a statue in his honor. The late and not particularly reliable source for Euphemia leaves her existence open to doubt. Leo served in the Roman army, rising to the rank of \"comes rei militaris\". He was the last of a series of emperors placed on the throne by Aspar, the Alan serving as commander-in-chief of the army, who thought Leo would be an easy puppet ruler. Instead, Leo became more and more independent from Aspar, causing tension that would culminate in Aspar's assassination.\nLeo's coronation as emperor on 7 February 457, was the first to add a Christian element to the traditional Roman procedure. Though he was already crowned by the \"campidoctor\" in the official coronation ceremony at Hebdomon, he went to Hagia Sophia and deposited his crown at the altar. As he left the church, Patriarch of Constantinople placed the crown back on his head, a fact which symbolized the transformation of Roman imperial traditions into Medieval Roman and Christian ones. This Christian coronation ritual was later imitated by courts all over Europe.\nHis coronation \"adventus\" gave a key role to Aspar, who rode with Leo in his chariot during the procession in Constantinople and offered him a golden crown when they arrived at the Forum of Constantine.\nLeo I made an alliance with the Isaurians and was thus able to eliminate Aspar. The price of the alliance was the marriage of Leo's daughter to Tarasicodissa, leader of the Isaurians, who, as Zeno, became emperor in 474. In 469, Aspar attempted to assassinate Zeno and very nearly succeeded. Finally, in 471, Aspar's son Ardabur was implicated in a plot against Leo but was killed by palace eunuchs acting on Leo's orders.\nLeo sometimes overestimated his abilities and made mistakes that threatened the internal order of the Empire. The Balkans were ravaged by the Ostrogoths, after a disagreement between the Emperor and the young chief Theodoric the Great, who had been raised at Leo's court in Constantinople, where he was steeped in Roman government and military tactics. There were also some raids by the Huns. However, none of these attackers had the siege engines necessary to capture Constantinople, whose walls had been rebuilt and reinforced in the reign of Theodosius II.\nLeo's reign was also noteworthy for his influence in the Western Roman Empire, marked by his appointment of Anthemius as Western Roman emperor in 467. He attempted to build on this political achievement with an expedition against the Vandals in 468. 1,113 ships carrying 100,000 men participated in the expedition, which ended in defeat because of bad leadership from Leo's brother-in-law Basiliscus. This disaster drained the Empire of men and money. Procopius estimated the costs of the expedition to be 130,000 pounds of gold; John the Lydian estimated the costs to be 65,000 pounds of gold and 750,000 pounds of silver.\nIn 472, Leo issued an edict which stipulated that high-ranking officers who permitted pagan sacrifices on their land were to be demoted and have their possessions confiscated. Lower-ranking offenders were to be tortured and condemned to labour in the mines.\nLeo died of dysentery at the age of 73 on 18 January 474.\nMarriage and children.\nLeo and Verina had three children. Their eldest daughter Ariadne was born prior to the death of Marcian (reigned 450 \u2013 457). Ariadne had a younger sister, Leontia. Leontia was first betrothed to Patricius, a son of Aspar, but their engagement was probably annulled when Aspar and another of his sons, Ardabur, were assassinated in 471. Leontia then married Marcian, a son of Emperor Anthemius and Marcia Euphemia. The couple led a failed revolt against Zeno in 478\u2013479. They were exiled to Isauria following their defeat.\nAn unknown son was born in 463. He died five months following his birth. The only sources about him are a horoscope by Rhetorius and a hagiography of Daniel the Stylite.\n The \"Georgian Chronicle\", a 13th-century compilation drawing from earlier sources, reports a marriage of Vakhtang I of Iberia to Princess Helena of Byzantium, identifying her as a daughter of the predecessor of Zeno. This predecessor was probably Leo I, the tale attributing a third daughter to Leo. Cyril Toumanoff identified two children of this marriage: Mithridates of Iberia; and Leo of Iberia. This younger Leo was father of Guaram I of Iberia. The accuracy of the descent is unknown.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The executive decisions of government ministers are implemented by the Civil Service. Civil servants are employees of the Crown and not of the British parliament. Civil servants also have some traditional and statutory responsibilities which to some extent protect them from being used for the political advantage of the party in power. Senior civil servants may be called to account to Parliament.\nIn general use, the term \"civil servant\" in the United Kingdom does not include all public sector employees. Although there is no fixed legal definition, the term is usually defined as a \"servant of the Crown working in a civil capacity who is not the holder of a political (or judicial) office; the holder of certain other offices in respect of whose tenure of office special provision has been made; [or] a servant of the Crown in a personal capacity paid from the Civil List\". As such, the civil service does not include government ministers (who are politically appointed); members of the British Armed Forces; police officers; officers of local government authorities; employees of some non-departmental public bodies; officers or staff of either of the Houses of Parliament; employees of the National Health Service (NHS); or staff of the Royal Household. As of the end of March 2021 there were 484,880 civil servants in the Civil Service, an increase of 6.23 per cent on the previous year.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nThe Offices of State grew in England, and later the United Kingdom centred around the street Whitehall, hence the metonym. Initially, they were little more than secretariats for their leaders, who held positions at court. They were chosen by the king on the advice of a patron, and typically replaced when their patron lost influence. In the 18th century, in response to the growth of the British Empire and economic changes, institutions such as the Office of Works and the Navy Board grew large. Each had its own system and staff were appointed by purchase or patronage. By the 19th century, it became increasingly clear that these arrangements were not working.\nUnder Charles Grant, the East India Company established the East India Company College at Haileybury near London, to train administrators, in 1806. The college was established on recommendation of officials in China who had seen the imperial examination system. In government, a civil service, replacing patronage with examination, similar to the Chinese system, was advocated a number of times over the next several decades.\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, in 1850, an opposition member, sought a more efficient system based on expertise rather than favouritism. The East India Company provided a model for Stafford Northcote, private Secretary to Gladstone who, with Charles Trevelyan, drafted the key report in 1854. The Northcote\u2013Trevelyan Report recommended a permanent, unified, politically neutral civil service, with appointments made on merit, and a clear division between staff responsible for routine (\"mechanical\") and those engaged in policy formulation and implementation (\"administrative\") work. The report was not implemented, but it came as the bureaucratic chaos in the Crimean War demonstrated that the military was as backward as the civil service. A Civil Service Commission was set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage as Parliament passed an Act \"to relieve the East India Company from the obligation to maintain the College at Haileybury\". Prime Minister Gladstone took the decisive step in 1870 with his Order in Council to implement the Northcote-Trevelyan proposals. This system was broadly endorsed by commissions chaired by Playfair (1874), Ridley (1886), MacDonnell (1914), Tomlin (1931) and Priestley (1955).\nThe Northcote\u2013Trevelyan model remained essentially stable for a hundred years. This was attributed to its success in removing corruption, delivering public services, even under stress of war, and responding effectively to political change. Patrick Diamond argues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Northcote-Trevelyan model was characterised by a hierarchical mode of Weberian bureaucracy; neutral, permanent and anonymous officials motivated by the public interest; and a willingness to administer policies ultimately determined by ministers. This bequeathed a set of theories, institutions and practices to subsequent generations of administrators in the central state.\nThe Irish Civil Service was separate from the British Civil Service. Whilst the Acts of Union 1800 abolished the Parliament of Ireland, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was retained in formal charge of the Irish executive based at Dublin Castle. The Irish Office in Whitehall liaised with Dublin Castle. Some British departments' area of operation extended to Ireland, while in other fields the Dublin department was separate from the Whitehall equivalent.\nLord Fulton's committee report.\nFollowing the Second World War demands for change grew again. There was a concern (illustrated in C. P. Snow's \"Strangers and Brothers\" series of novels) that technical and scientific expertise was mushrooming, to a point at which the \"good all-rounder\" culture of the administrative civil servant with a classics or other arts degree could no longer properly engage with it: as late as 1963, for example, the Treasury had just 19 trained economists. The times were, moreover, ones of keen respect for technocracy, with the mass mobilisation of war having worked effectively, and the French National Plan apparently delivering economic success. And there was also a feeling which would not go away, following the war and the radical social reforms of the 1945 Labour government, that the so-called \"mandarins\" of the higher civil service were too remote from the people. Indeed, between 1948 and 1963 only three per cent of the recruits to the administrative class came from the working classes, and in 1966 more than half of the administrators at undersecretary level and above had been privately educated.\nLord Fulton's committee reported in 1968. He found that administrators were not professional enough, and in particular lacked management skills; that the position of technical and scientific experts needed to be rationalised and enhanced; and that the service was indeed too remote. His 158 recommendations included the introduction of a unified grading system for all categories of staff, a Civil Service College and a central policy planning unit. He also said that control of the service should be taken from the Treasury, and given to a new department, and that the \"fast stream\" recruitment process for accessing the upper echelons should be made more flexible, to encourage candidates from less privileged backgrounds. The new department was set up by Prime Minister Harold Wilson's Labour Government in 1968 and named the Civil Service Department, known as CSD. Wilson himself took on the role of Minister for the Civil Service (which has continued to be a portfolio of the Prime Minister), while the first Minister in Charge of the Civil Service Department was Cabinet Minister Lord Shackleton, also Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal. The first Permanent Secretary was Sir William Armstrong, who moved over from his post as Permanent Secretary at the Treasury. After the 1970 General Election, new Conservative Prime Minister Ted Heath appointed Lord Jellicoe in Lord Shackleton's place.\nInto Heath's Downing Street came the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS), and they were in particular given charge of a series of Programme Analysis and Review (PAR) studies of policy efficiency and effectiveness.\nBut, whether through lack of political will, or through passive resistance by a mandarinate which the report had suggested were \"amateurs\", Fulton failed. The Civil Service College equipped generalists with additional skills, but did not turn them into qualified professionals as ENA did in France. Recruits to the fast stream self-selected, with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge still producing a large majority of successful English candidates, since the system continued to favour the tutorial system at Oxbridge while to an extent the Scottish Ancient universities educated a good proportion of recruits from north of the border. The younger mandarins found excuses to avoid managerial jobs in favour of the more prestigious postings. The generalists remained on top, and the specialists on tap.\nMargaret Thatcher's government.\nMargaret Thatcher came to office in 1979 believing in free markets as a better social system in many areas than the state: government should be small but active. Many of her ministers were suspicious of the civil service, in light of public choice research that suggested public servants (as well as elected officials themselves) tend to act in ways that seek to increase their own power and budgets.\nShe immediately set about reducing the size of the civil service, cutting numbers from 732,000 to 594,000 over her first seven years in office. Derek Rayner, the former chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, was appointed as an efficiency expert with the Prime Minister's personal backing; he identified numerous problems with the Civil Service, arguing that only three billion of the eight billion pounds a year spent at that time by the Civil Service consisted of essential services, and that the \"mandarins\" (senior civil servants) needed to focus on efficiency and management rather than on policy advice. In late 1981 the Prime Minister announced the abolition of the Civil Service Department, transferring power over the Civil Service to the Prime Minister's Office and Cabinet Office. The Priestley Commission principle of pay comparability with the private sector was abandoned in February 1982.\nMeanwhile, Michael Heseltine was introducing a comprehensive system of corporate and business planning (known as MINIS) first in the Department of the Environment and then in the Ministry of Defence. This led to the \"Financial Management Initiative\", launched in September 1982 (\"Efficiency and Effectiveness in the Civil Service\" (Cmnd 8616)) as an umbrella for the efficiency scrutiny programme and with a wider focus on corporate planning, efficiency and objective-setting. Progress initially was sluggish, but in due course MINIS-style business planning became standard, and delegated budgets were introduced, so that individual managers were held much more accountable for meeting objectives, and for the first time for the resources they used to do so. Performance-related pay began in December 1984, was built on thereafter, and continues to this day, though the sums involved have always been small compared to the private sector, and the effectiveness of PRP as a genuine motivator has often been questioned.\nIn February 1988 Robin Ibbs, who had been recruited from ICI in July 1983 to run the Efficiency Unit (now in No. 10), published his report \"Improving Management in Government: The Next Steps\". This envisaged a new approach to delivery featuring clear targets and personal responsibility. Without any statutory change, the managerial functions of Ministries would be hived off into Executive Agencies, with clear Framework Documents setting out their objectives, and whose chief executives would be made accountable directly (in some cases to Parliament) for performance. Agencies were to, as far as possible, take a commercial approach to their tasks. However, the Government conceded that agency staff would remain civil servants, which diluted the radicalism of the reform. The approach seems somewhat similar to the Swedish model, though no influence from Sweden has ever been acknowledged.\nThe Next Steps Initiative took some years to get off the ground, and progress was patchy. Significant change was achieved, although agencies never really achieved the level of autonomy envisaged at the start. By 5 April 1993, 89 agencies had been established, and contained over 260,000 civil servants, some 49 per cent of the total.\nThe focus on smaller, more accountable, units revived the keenness of Ministerial interest in the perceived efficiencies of the private sector. Already in the late 1980s, some common services once set up to capture economies of scale, such as the Property Services Agency and the Crown Suppliers, were being dismantled or sold off. Next, shortly after Thatcher left office, in July 1991, a new programme of market-testing of central government services began, with the White Paper \"Competing for Quality\" (Cm 1730). Five-yearly or three-yearly policy and finance reviews of all agencies and other public bodies were instituted, where the first question to be answered (the \"prior options exercise\") was why the function should not be abolished or privatised. In November 1991 the private finance initiative was launched, and by November 1994 the chancellor of the exchequer had referred to it as 'the funding mechanism of choice for most public sector projects'. In 1995 the decision was taken to privatise the Chessington Computer Centre, HMSO, the Occupational Health &amp; Safety Agency and Recruitment &amp; Assessment Services.\nThe Citizen's Charter.\nIt was believed with the Thatcher reforms that efficiency was improving. But there was still a perception of carelessness and lack of responsiveness in the quality of public services. The government of John Major sought to tackle this with a Citizen's Charter programme. This sought to empower the service user, by setting out rights to standards in each service area, and arrangements for compensation when these were not met. An Office of Public Service and Science was set up in 1992, to see that the Charter policy was implemented across government.\nBy 1998, 42 Charters had been published, and they included services provided by public service industries such as the health service and the railways, as well as by the civil service. The programme was also expanded to apply to other organisations such as local government or housing associations, through a scheme of \"Chartermark\" awards. The programme was greeted with some derision, and it is true that the compensation sometimes hardly seemed worth the effort of claiming, and that the service standards were rarely set with much consumer input. But the initiative did have a significant effect in changing cultures, and paradoxically the spin-off Chartermark initiative may have had more impact on local organisations uncertain about what standards to aim for, than the parent Citizen's Charter programme itself.\nGovernance.\nMinister for the Civil Service.\nThe position of Minister for the Civil Service is not part of the Civil Service as it is a political position which has always been held by the prime minister of the United Kingdom.\nHead of the Civil Service.\nThe highest ranking civil servant is the Cabinet Secretary. A subsidiary title that was also held by the incumbent is \"Head of the Civil Service\" (previously \"Head of the Home Civil Service\"), who until recently was also the Permanent Secretary of the Cabinet Office. However, following the Coalition Government of David Cameron the three posts were split from the single holder. The last person to hold all three positions together was Gus O'Donnell, Cabinet Secretary, Head of the Home Civil Service and Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary, August 2005 \u2013 December 2011. The postholder is responsible for ensuring that the Civil Service is equipped with the skills and capability to meet the everyday challenges it faces and that civil servants work in a fair and decent environment. The postholder also chairs the Permanent Secretary Management Group and the Civil Service Steering Board which are the main governing bodies of the Civil Service.\nIt was announced on 11 October 2011 that, following O'Donnell's retirement at the end of 2011, the role of Head of the Home Civil Service would be split from the post of Cabinet Secretary; there would additionally be a new, separate, Permanent Secretary to lead the Cabinet Office. After O'Donnell's retirement, Jeremy Heywood replaced him as Cabinet Secretary \u2013 serving until 24 October 2018 when he retired on health grounds; Ian Watmore as Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary; and lastly, Bob Kerslake as Head of the Civil Service. In July 2014 it was announced that Kerslake would step down and Heywood would take the title of Head of the HCS while John Manzoni would be Chief Executive of the Civil Service. From 24 October 2018 to 4 November 2018, the office of Head of the Civil Service was vacant, as Heywood resigned on health grounds. Following Heywood's death, Mark Sedwill was given the additional Civil Service portfolio. Simon Case succeeded Mark Sedwill as Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Home Civil Service in 2020 until resigning in December 2024 on health grounds. Sir Chris Wormald took over the roles on 16 December 2024.\nPermanent Secretaries Management Group (PSMG).\nThe PSMG considers issues of strategic importance to the Civil Service as a whole, as well as providing corporate leadership where a single position is required across all government departments. It is chaired by the Head of the Civil Service and consists of all first permanent secretaries and other selected permanent secretaries and directors general. This includes the Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and the Head of the Diplomatic Service.\nCivil Service Steering Board (CSSB).\nThe CSSB was established in 2007 and meets monthly. Its role is to enhance the performance and reputation of the Civil Service by focusing on specific areas delegated to it by PSMG. The CSSB is chaired by the Head of the Civil Service.\nCivil Service Commissioners.\nThe Civil Service Commissioners are not civil servants and are independent of Ministers, they are appointed directly by the Crown under Royal Prerogative and they report annually to the King.\nTheir main role is regarding the recruitment of civil servants. They have the responsibility to ensure that all civil servants are recruited on the \"principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition.\" They maintain a recruitment code on the interpretation and application of that principle, and approve any exceptions to it. They audit recruitment policies and practices within the Civil Service and approve all appointments to the most senior levels of the Civil Service.\nThe Commissioners also hear and determine appeals in cases of concern about propriety and conscience raised by civil servants under the Civil Service Code which cannot be resolved through internal procedures.\nNorthern Ireland has a separate Commission called the \"Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland\" which has the same role.\nPolitical neutrality.\nThe Civil Service is meant to be a politically neutral body, with the function of impartially implementing the policy programme of the elected government.\nLike all servants of the Crown, civil servants are legally barred from standing for election as Members of Parliament as they must uphold the duty of being politically neutral. Under regulations first adopted in 1954 and revised in 1984, members of the Senior Civil Service (the top management grades) are barred from holding office in a political party or publicly expressing controversial political viewpoints, while less senior civil servants at an intermediate (managerial) level must generally seek permission to participate in political activities. The most junior civil servants are permitted to participate in political activities, but must be politically neutral in the exercise of their duties. In periods prior to General Elections, the Civil Service undergoes purdah which further restricts their activities.\nAll civil servants are subject to the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989, meaning that they may not disclose sensitive government information. Since 1998, there have also been restrictions on contact between civil servants and lobbyists; this followed an incident known as Lobbygate, where an undercover reporter for \"The Observer\", posing as a business leader, was introduced by a lobbyist to a senior Downing Street official who promised privileged access to government ministers. The Committee on Standards in Public Life, also created in 1998, is responsible for regulation of contacts between public officials and lobbyists.\nThe increasing influence of politically appointed special advisers in government departments can reduce the political neutrality of public administration. In Thatcher's government, Alan Walters was an official adviser from 1981 to 1984, and again in 1989. Walters' criticisms \"of many aspects of Treasury policy, particularly in relation to exchange rate policy\" and Thatcher's refusal to dismiss him led to Nigel Lawson's resignation as chancellor in 1989. Thatcher also claimed that the 1981 budget, which increased taxes during the recession and was criticised by 364 economists, had been devised by Walters.\nIn 2000, then-Prime Minister Tony Blair was criticised for appointing 20 special advisers (compared to eight under his predecessor John Major) and for the fact that the total salary cost of special advisers across all government departments had reached \u00a34 million. In 2001, Stephen Byers, then Secretary of State for Transport, was forced to resign because of the actions of his special adviser Jo Moore, who instructed a departmental civil servant, Martin Sixsmith, that September 11, 2001, would be \"a good day to bury bad news\"; this was seen as inappropriate political manipulation of the Civil Service. In particular, under the administration of Tony Blair, the influence of two Downing Street special advisers, Jonathan Powell and Alastair Campbell, both of whom were given formal power over Downing Street civil servants, provoked widespread criticism.\nThe Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government of 2010\u20132015 had proposed introducing a more American style system where senior civil servants, such as permanent secretaries, became political appointees. However, this was dropped after it was considered that the existing permanent civil service style was better-suited to the government of the United Kingdom.\nThe political neutrality of the civil service was called into question during the 2016\u20132019 Brexit negotiations, with political figures such as Brexit Party Leader Nigel Farage accusing the civil service of having a \"pro-Remain bias\". In response Sir Mark Sedwill, Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service, issued a letter to all Department Chiefs warning that Brexit was having an \"unsettling\" effect on civil servants.\nIn March 2023, Home Secretary Suella Braverman, in an email sent to Conservative Party supporters, criticised civil servants as being part of an \"activist blob of left-wing lawyers, civil servants and the Labour Party\" which blocked government efforts to stop small boat crossings. Dave Penman, general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants, accused Braverman of breaching the ministerial code. In response, a Conservative Party spokesperson said that the Home Secretary had not seen the wording of the email prior to its sending.\nCodes.\nCivil Service Code.\nA version of the civil service code was introduced in 2006 to outline the core values and standards expected of civil servants. The core values are defined as \"integrity\", \"honesty\", \"objectivity\", and \"impartiality\". A key change from previous values is the removal of \"anonymity\" within the core values. The Code includes an independent line of appeal to the Civil Service Commissioners on alleged breaches of the Code.\nAs of \u00a02020[ [update]] a version updated in March 2015, with the same core values, was current. In addition to civil servants, special advisers are also covered by the code, except, due to the nature of the role, for the requirements for objectivity and impartiality.\nCivil Service Management Code.\nThe Civil Service Management Code (CSMC) sets out the regulations and instructions to departments and agencies regarding the terms and conditions of service of civil servants. It is the guiding document which gives delegation to civil service organisations, from the Minister for the Civil Service, in order for them to make internal personnel policies.\nCivil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code.\nThe Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code is maintained by the Civil Service Commissioners and is based on the \"principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition.\"\nOsmotherly Rules.\nThe Osmotherly Rules set out guidance on how civil servants should respond to Parliamentary select committees.\nDirectory of Civil Service Guidance.\nA two-volume 125-page \"Directory of Civil Service Guidance\" was published in 2000 to replace the previous \"Guidance on Guidance\", providing short summaries of guidance on a wide range of issues and pointing to more detailed sources.\nStructure.\nThe structure of the Civil Service is divided into organisations, grades and professions. Each Secretary of State has a Department which has executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies subordinate to it.\nGrading schemes.\nThe grading system used in the civil service has changed many times, and the current structure is made up of two schemes. All senior grades (Deputy Director / Grade 5 level and above) are part of the senior civil service, which is overseen by the Cabinet Office on behalf of the civil service as a whole. Below the senior civil service, each individual department/executive agency can put in place its own grading and pay arrangements, provided they still comply with the central civil service pay and review guidance.\nFor other grades many departments overlay their own grading structure; however, all these structures must map across to the central government structure as shown below.\nAll current grades are marked in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0 bold \u00a0 and historical grade names are shown \"italics\".\nNB \u2013 XXX is standing in for\nProfessions.\nThe \"lingua franca\" is to describe civil servants, and in particular their grades, predominantly through a lens of administrative activity (as in the current structure of the table above), but in practice the civil service has, and always had, a number of subdivisions, with the Historic Grades having an additional designator (usually omitted for senior managers, but included from middle and junior managers) as shown as \"xxx\", with the major groupings being:\nThe Current Structure identifies a number of distinct professional groupings:\nRecruitment data from the 2018 Civil Service Fast Stream process showed that white applicants were 15 times more likely to be recruited than black candidates.\nPrivilege days.\nA privilege day is a day of annual leave granted to employees of the civil service. These are in addition to bank holidays.\nBefore 2013, there were 2.5 privilege days each year:\nSince reforms by the Cabinet Office in 2013, the Maundy Thursday (Easter) and Christmas privilege days are no longer available for new civil servants. For civil servants who were in their positions when the changes came into force, these 1.5 days have been converted into additional annual leave, but lost upon promotion. Because the Queen's Birthday privilege day was granted by Queen Elizabeth II after her coronation, it would have been difficult for the Cabinet Office to abolish it by an administrative measure, so the Cabinet Office decided to retain this as a privilege day. Privilege days still count as \"working days\" for the purpose of freedom of information requests.\nIn popular culture.\nThe BBC television series \"Yes Minister\" and \"Yes, Prime Minister\" are a satire on the British civil service and its relationship with government ministers. The portrayal is a caricature of the civil service predominantly characterised through Nigel Hawthorne's Sir Humphrey Appleby.\n\"The Thick of It\", first broadcast in 2005, is a similar BBC television series that has been called \"the 21st century's answer to \"Yes Minister\"\". The series portrays a modernised version of the interactions between the Civil Service and the Government (chiefly in the form of special advisers), as well as the media's involvement in the process.\nThere is a long history of civil servants who are also literary authors, who often comment on their own institutions, including such writers as Geoffrey Chaucer, John Milton, John Dryden, Andrew Marvell, Robert Burns, William Wordsworth and Anthony Trollope, and diarist Samuel Pepys.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65462", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65462", "title": "Randomization", "text": "Process of making something random\nRandomization is a statistical process in which a random mechanism is employed to select a sample from a population or assign subjects to different groups. The process is crucial in ensuring the random allocation of experimental units or treatment protocols, thereby minimizing selection bias and enhancing the statistical validity. It facilitates the objective comparison of treatment effects in experimental design, as it equates groups statistically by balancing both known and unknown factors at the outset of the study. In statistical terms, it underpins the principle of probabilistic equivalence among groups, allowing for the unbiased estimation of treatment effects and the generalizability of conclusions drawn from sample data to the broader population.\nRandomization is not haphazard; instead, a random process is a sequence of random variables describing a process whose outcomes do not follow a deterministic pattern but follow an evolution described by probability distributions. For example, a random sample of individuals from a population refers to a sample where every individual has a known probability of being sampled. This would be contrasted with nonprobability sampling, where arbitrary individuals are selected. A runs test can be used to determine whether the occurrence of a set of measured values is random. Randomization is widely applied in various fields, especially in scientific research, statistical analysis, and resource allocation, to ensure fairness and validity in the outcomes.\nIn various contexts, randomization may involve\nRandomization has many uses in gambling, political use, statistical analysis, art, cryptography, gaming and other fields. \nIn gambling.\nIn the world of gambling, the integrity and fairness of games hinge significantly on effective randomization. This principle serves as a cornerstone in gambling, ensuring that each game outcome is unpredictable and not manipulable. The necessity for advanced randomization methods stems from the potential for skilled gamblers to exploit weaknesses in poorly randomized systems. High-quality randomization thwarts attempts at prediction or manipulation, maintaining the fairness of games. A quintessential example of randomization in gambling is the shuffling of playing cards. This process must be thoroughly random to prevent any predictability in the order of cards. Casinos often employ automatic shuffling machines, which enhance randomness beyond what manual shuffling can achieve.\nWith the rise of online casinos, digital random number generators (RNGs) have become crucial. These RNGs use complex algorithms to produce outcomes that are as unpredictable as their real-world counterparts. The gambling industry invests heavily in research to develop more effective randomization techniques. To ensure that gambling games are fair and random, regulatory bodies rigorously test and certify shuffling and random number generation methods. This oversight is vital in maintaining trust in the gambling industry, ensuring that players have equal chances of winning.\nThe unpredictability inherent in randomization is also a key factor in the psychological appeal of gambling. The thrill and suspense created by the uncertainty of outcomes contribute significantly to the allure and excitement of gambling games.\nIn summary, randomization in gambling is not just a technical necessity; it is a fundamental principle that upholds the fairness, integrity, and thrill of the games. As technology advances, so too do the methods to ensure that this randomization remains effective and beyond reproach\nIn politics.\nThe concept of randomization in political systems, specifically through the method of allotment or sortition, has ancient roots and contemporary relevance, significantly impacting the evolution and practice of democracy.\nIn the fifth century BC, Athenian democracy was pioneering in its approach to ensuring political equality, or isonomia. Central to this system was the principle of random selection, seen as a cornerstone for fair representation. The unique structure of Greek democracy, which translates to \"rule by the people,\" was exemplified by administrative roles being rotated among citizens, selected randomly through lot. This method was perceived as more democratic than elections, which the Athenians argued could lead to inequalities. They believed that elections, which often favored candidates based on merit or popularity, contradicted the principle of equal rights for all citizens. Furthermore, the random allotment of positions like magistrates or jury members served as a deterrent to vote-buying and corruption, as it was impossible to predict who would be chosen for these roles.\nIn modern times, the concept of allotment, also known as sortition, is primarily seen in the selection of jurors within Anglo-Saxon legal systems, such as those in the UK and the United States. However, its political implications extend further. There have been various proposals to integrate sortition into government structures. The idea is that sortition could introduce a new dimension of representation and fairness in political systems, countering issues associated with electoral politics. This concept has garnered academic interest, with scholars exploring the potential of random selection in enhancing the democratic process, both in political frameworks and organizational structures. The ongoing study and debate surrounding the use of sortition reflect its enduring relevance and potential as a tool for political innovation and integrity.\nRandomization in statistical analysis.\nRandomization is a core principle in statistical theory, whose importance was emphasized by Charles S. Peirce in \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" (1877\u20131878) and \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (1883). Its application in statistical methodologies is multifaceted and includes critical processes such as randomized controlled experiments, survey sampling and simulations.\nRandomized controlled experiment.\nIn the realm of scientific research, particularly within clinical study designs, constraints such as limited manpower, material resources, financial backing, and time necessitate a selective approach to participant inclusion. Despite the broad spectrum of potential participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria, it is impractical to incorporate every eligible individual in the target population due to these constraints. Therefore, a representative subset of treatment groups is chosen based on the specific requirements of the research. A randomized sampling method is employed to ensure the integrity and representativeness of the study. This method ensures that all qualified subjects within the target population have an equal opportunity to be selected. Such a strategy is pivotal in mirroring the overall characteristics of the target population and in mitigating the risk of selection bias.\nThe selected samples (or continuous non-randomly sampled samples) are grouped using randomization methods so that all research subjects in the sample have an equal chance of entering the experimental group or the control group and receiving corresponding treatment. In particular, the random grouping after the research subjects are stratified can make the known or unknown influencing factors between the groups basically consistent, thereby enhancing the comparability between the groups.\nSurvey sampling.\nSurvey sampling uses randomization, following the criticisms of previous \"representative methods\" by Jerzy Neyman in his 1922 report to the International Statistical Institute. It randomly displays the answer options to survey participants, which prevents order bias caused by the tendency of respondents to choose the first option when the same order is presented to different respondents. To overcome this, researchers can give the answer options in a random order so that the respondents allocate some time to read all the options and choose an honest answer. For example, consider an automobile dealer who wants to conduct a feedback survey and ask the respondents to select their preferred automobile brand. The user can create a study with randomized answers to display the different automobile brands so that the respondents do not see them in the same order.\nResampling.\nSome important methods of statistical inference use resampling from the observed data. Multiple alternative versions of the data-set that \"might have been observed\" are created by randomization of the original data-set, the only one observed. The variation of statistics calculated for these alternative data-sets is a guide to the uncertainty of statistics estimated from the original data.\nSimulation.\nIn many scientific and engineering fields, computer simulations of real phenomena are commonly used. When the real phenomena are affected by unpredictable processes, such as radio noise or day-to-day weather, these processes can be simulated using random or pseudo-random numbers. One of the most prominent uses of randomization in simulations is in Monte Carlo methods. These methods rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, typically to model probability distributions or to estimate uncertain quantities in a system.\nRandomization also allows for the testing of models or algorithms against unexpected inputs or scenarios. This is essential in fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence, where algorithms must be robust against a variety of inputs and conditions.\nIn art.\nRandomization plays a fascinating and often underappreciated role in literature, music, and art, where it introduces elements of unpredictability and spontaneity. Here is how it manifests in each of these creative fields:\nLiterature.\nPioneered by surrealists and later popularized by writers like William S. Burroughs, automatic writing and cut-up techniques involve randomly rearranging text to create new literary forms. It disrupts linear narratives, fostering unexpected connections and meanings.\nMusic.\nIn aleatoric music, elements of the composition are left to chance or the performer's discretion. Composers like John Cage used randomization to create music where certain elements are unforeseeable, resulting in each performance being uniquely different. Modern musicians sometimes employ computer algorithms that generate music based on random inputs. These compositions can range from electronic music to more classical forms, where randomness plays a key role in creating harmony, melody, or rhythm.\nArt.\nSome artists in abstract expressionism movement, like Jackson Pollock, used random methods (like dripping or splattering paint) to create their artworks. This approach emphasizes the physical act of painting and the role of chance in the artistic process.Also, contemporary artists often use algorithms and computer-generated randomness to create visual art. This can result in intricate patterns and designs that would be difficult or impossible to predict or replicate manually.\nTechniques.\nAlthough historically \"manual\" randomization techniques (such as shuffling cards, drawing pieces of paper from a bag, spinning a roulette wheel) were common, nowadays automated techniques are mostly used. As both selecting random samples and random permutations can be reduced to simply selecting random numbers, random number generation methods are now most commonly used, both hardware random number generators and pseudo-random number generators.\nOptimization.\nRandomization is used in optimization to alleviate the computational burden associated to robust control techniques: a sample of values of the uncertainty parameters is randomly drawn and robustness is enforced for these values only. This approach has gained popularity by the introduction of rigorous theories that permit one to have control on the probabilistic level of robustness, see scenario optimization. \nCommon randomization methods including"}

He was shortlisted for the Nobel Prize in Literature several times. Through 67 years of writing, which included over 25 novels, he explored the conflicting moral and political issues of the modern world. \"The Power and the Glory\" won the 1941 Hawthornden Prize and \"The Heart of the Matter\" won the 1948 James Tait Black Memorial Prize and was shortlisted for the Best of the James Tait Black. Greene was awarded the 1968 Shakespeare Prize and the 1981 Jerusalem Prize. Several of his stories have been filmed, some more than once, and he collaborated with filmmaker Carol Reed on \"The Fallen Idol\" (1948) and \"The Third Man\" (1949).\nHe converted to Catholicism in 1926 after meeting his future wife, Vivien Dayrell-Browning. Later in life he took to calling himself a \"Catholic agnostic\".\nHe died in 1991, aged 86, of leukemia, and was buried in Corseaux cemetery in Switzerland. William Golding called Greene \"the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man's consciousness and anxiety\". V. S. Pritchett called him \"The most ingenious, inventive and exciting of our novelists, rich in exactly etched and moving portraits of real human beings and who understands the tragic and comic ironies of love, loyalty and belief.\"\nEarly years (1904\u20131922).\nHenry Graham Greene was born in 1904 in St John's House, a boarding house of Berkhamsted School, Hertfordshire, where his father was house master. He was the fourth of six children; his younger brother, Hugh, became Director-General of the BBC, and his elder brother, Raymond, an eminent physician and mountaineer.\nHis parents, Charles Henry Greene and Marion Raymond Greene, were first cousins, both members of a large, influential family that included the owners of Greene King Brewery, bankers, and statesmen; his grandmother Jane Wilson was first cousin to Robert Louis Stevenson.\nCharles Greene was second master at Berkhamsted School, where the headmaster was Dr Thomas Fry, who was married to Charles' cousin. Another cousin was the right-wing pacifist Ben Greene, whose politics led to his internment during World War II.\nIn his childhood, Greene spent his summers at Harston House, the Cambridgeshire home of his uncle, Sir Graham Greene. In Greene's description of his childhood, he describes his learning to read there: \"It was at Harston I quite suddenly found that I could read\u2014the book was \"Dixon Brett, Detective\". I didn't want anyone to know of my discovery, so I read only in secret, in a remote attic, but my mother must have spotted what I was at all the same, for she gave me Ballantyne's \"Coral Island\" for the train journey home\u2014always an interminable journey with the long wait between trains at Bletchley...\"\nIn 1910, Charles Greene succeeded Dr Fry as headmaster of Berkhamsted. Graham also attended the school as a boarder. Bullied and profoundly depressed, he made several suicide attempts, including, as he wrote in his autobiography, by Russian roulette and by taking aspirin before going swimming in the school pool. In 1920, aged 16, in what was a radical step for the time, he was sent for psychoanalysis for six months in London, afterwards returning to school as a day student. School friends included the journalist Claud Cockburn and the historian Peter Quennell.\nGreene contributed several stories to the school magazine, one of which was published by a London evening newspaper in January 1921.\nOxford University.\nHe attended Balliol College, Oxford, to study history. During 1922 Greene was for a short time a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and sought an invitation to the new Soviet Union, of which nothing came. In 1925, while he was an undergraduate at Balliol, his first work, a poorly received volume of poetry titled \"Babbling April\", was published.\nGreene had periodic bouts of depression while at Oxford, and largely kept to himself. Of Greene's time at Oxford, his contemporary Evelyn Waugh noted that: \"Graham Greene looked down on us (and perhaps all undergraduates) as childish and ostentatious. He certainly shared in none of our revelry.\" He graduated in 1925 with a second-class degree.\nWriting career.\nAfter leaving Oxford, Greene worked as a private tutor and then turned to journalism; first on the \"Nottingham Journal\", and then as a sub-editor on \"The Times\". While he was still at Oxford, he had started corresponding with Vivien Dayrell-Browning, who had written to him to correct him on a point of Catholic doctrine. Greene was an agnostic, but when he later began to think about marrying Vivien, it occurred to him that, as he puts it in his autobiography \"A Sort of Life\", he \"ought at least to learn the nature and limits of the beliefs she held\". Greene was baptised on 28 February 1926 and they married on 15 October 1927 at St Mary's Church, Hampstead, London.\n\"The Man Within\" (1929) was Greene's first published novel; after its favourable reception he left his job at \"The Times\" to work full-time as a novelist. The next two books, \"The Name of Action\" (1930) and \"Rumour at Nightfall\" (1932), were unsuccessful, however, and he later disowned them. His first true success was \"Stamboul Train\" (1932) which was taken on by the Book Society and adapted as the film \"Orient Express\", in 1934.\nAlthough Greene objected to being described as a Roman Catholic novelist, rather than as a novelist who happened to be Catholic, Catholic religious themes are at the root of much of his writing, especially \"Brighton Rock\", \"The Power and the Glory\", \"The Heart of the Matter\", and \"The End of the Affair\", which have been named \"the gold standard\" of the Catholic novel. Several works, such as \"The Confidential Agent\", \"The Quiet American\", \"Our Man in Havana\", \"The Human Factor\", and his screenplay for \"The Third Man\", also show Greene's avid interest in the workings and intrigues of international politics and espionage. In the early 1930s Greene moved to the left politically. He read left-wing writers like G.D.H. Cole and John Strachey; in 1933 he joined the Independent Labour Party. This move to the left is reflected in the characters and plot of his fifth novel \"It's A Battlefield\". His later political affiliations and convictions were more ambiguous.\nHe supplemented his novelist's income with freelance journalism, book and film reviews for \"The Spectator\", and co-editing the magazine \"Night and Day\". His collected film reviews were later published as \"The Pleasure Dome\" (1972). Greene's 1937 film review of \"Wee Willie Winkie\", for \"Night and Day\"\u2014which said that the nine-year-old star, Shirley Temple, displayed \"a dubious coquetry\" which appealed to \"middle-aged men and clergymen\"\u2014provoked Twentieth Century Fox successfully to sue for \u00a33,500 plus costs, and Greene left the UK to live in Mexico until after the trial was over. While in Mexico, Greene developed the ideas for the novel often considered his masterpiece, \"The Power and the Glory\".\nBy the 1950s, Greene had become known as one of the finest writers of his generation.\nGreene also wrote short stories and plays, which were well received, although he was always first and foremost a novelist. His first successful play, \"The Living Room\", debuted in 1952.\nMichael Korda, a lifelong friend and later his editor at Simon &amp; Schuster, observed Greene at work: Greene wrote in a small black leather notebook with a black fountain pen and would write approximately 500 words. Korda described this as Graham's daily penance\u2014once he finished he put the notebook away for the rest of the day.\nHis writing influences included Henry James, Robert Louis Stevenson, H. Rider Haggard, Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, Marcel Proust, Charles P\u00e9guy and John Buchan.\nTravel and espionage.\nPart of Greene's reputation as a novelist is for weaving the characters he met and the places where he lived into the fabric of his novels. Greene himself responded to commentators who called the world of his fiction an imaginary place: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Some critics have referred to a strange violent 'seedy' region of the mind (why did I ever popularize that last adjective?) which they call Greeneland, and I have sometimes wondered whether they go around the world blinkered. 'This is Indo-China,' I want to exclaim, 'this is Mexico, this is Sierra Leone carefully and accurately described. I have been a newspaper correspondent as well as a novelist. I assure you that the dead child lay in the ditch in just that attitude. In the canal of Phat Diem the bodies stuck out of the water...'\nThroughout his life, Greene travelled to what he called the world's wild and remote places. In 1941, the travels led to his being recruited into MI6 by his sister, Elisabeth, who worked for the agency. Accordingly, he was posted to Sierra Leone during the Second World War. Kim Philby, who would later be revealed as a Soviet agent, was Greene's supervisor and friend at MI6. Greene resigned from MI6 in 1944. He later wrote an introduction to Philby's 1968 memoir, \"My Silent War\".\nGreene also corresponded with intelligence officer and spy, John Cairncross, for forty years and that correspondence is held by the John J. Burns Library, at Boston College.\nGreene first left Europe at 30 years of age in 1935 on a trip to Liberia that produced the travel book \"Journey Without Maps\". His 1938 trip to Mexico to see the effects of the government's campaign of forced anti-Catholic secularisation was paid for by the publishing company Longman, thanks to his friendship with Tom Burns. That voyage produced two books, the nonfiction \"The Lawless Roads\" (published as \"Another Mexico\" in the US) and the novel \"The Power and the Glory\". In 1953, the Holy Office informed Greene that \"The Power and the Glory\" was damaging to the reputation of the priesthood; but later, in a private audience with Greene, Pope Paul VI told him that, although parts of his novels would offend some Catholics, he should ignore the criticism.\nIn 1950 his brother, Hugh Carleton Greene who was head of UK Information Services in Malaya, brought Greene to Malaya during the early phase of the Malayan Emergency.Greene returned to England via Indo-China in 1951 to visit his friend, Trevor Wilson, British consul in Hanoi. There he met General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, French high commissioner and commander-in-chief of the French Expeditionary Corps. Greene returned several times and wrote newspaper articles\n and developed the book, \"The Quiet American\".\nIn 1954, Greene travelled to Haiti, where \"The Comedians\" (1966) is set, and which was then under the rule of dictator Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, known as \"Papa Doc\", frequently staying at the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince. He visited Haiti again in the late 1950s. As inspiration for his novel \"A Burnt-Out Case\" (1960), Greene spent time travelling around Africa visiting a number of leper colonies in the Congo Basin and in what were then the British Cameroons. During this trip in late February and early March 1959, Greene met several times with Andr\u00e9e de Jongh, a leader in the Belgian resistance during WWII, who famously established an escape route to Gibraltar through the Pyrenees for downed allied airmen.\nIn 1957, just months after Fidel Castro began his final revolutionary assault on the Batista regime in Cuba, Greene played a small role in helping the revolutionaries, as a secret courier transporting warm clothing for Castro's rebels hiding in the hills during the Cuban winter. Castro, like Daniel Ortega and Omar Torrijos, was one of several Latin American leaders Greene's friendship with whom has led some commentators to question his commitment to democracy. After one visit Castro gave Greene a painting he had done, which hung in the living room of the French house where the author spent the last years of his life. Greene did later voice doubts about Castro, telling a French interviewer in 1983, \"I admire him for his courage and his efficiency, but I question his authoritarianism,\" adding: \"All successful revolutions, however idealistic, probably betray themselves in time.\"\nPublishing career.\nBetween 1944 and 1948, Greene was director at Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode under chairman Douglas Jerrold, in charge of developing its fiction list. Greene created \"The Century Library\" series, which was discontinued after he left following a conflict with Jerrold regarding Anthony Powell's contract. In 1958, Greene was offered the position of chairman by Oliver Crosthwaite-Eyre, but declined.\nHe was a director at The Bodley Head from 1957 to 1968 under Max Reinhardt. He used his influence to stop the firm putting his own novels forward for the Booker Prize, which he felt should go to younger writers, and to champion Richard Power, whose \"The Hungry Grass\" he persuaded Bodley to nominate for a posthumous Booker.\nPersonal life.\nGreene was an agnostic, but was baptised into the Catholic faith in 1926 after meeting his future wife Vivien Dayrell-Browning. They were married on 15 October 1927 at St Mary's Church, Hampstead, north London. The Greenes had two children, Lucy Caroline Bourget Greene (born 1933) and Francis Greene (born 1936), who was his father's literary executor.\nIn his discussions with Father George Trollope, the priest to whom he went for instruction in Catholicism, Greene argued with the cleric \"on the ground of dogmatic atheism\", as Greene's primary difficulty with religion was what he termed the \"if\" surrounding God's existence. He found, however, that \"after a few weeks of serious argument the 'if' was becoming less and less improbable\", and Greene converted and was baptised after vigorous arguments initially with the priest in which he defended atheism, or at least the \"if\" of agnosticism. Late in life, Greene called himself a \"Catholic agnostic\".\nBeginning in 1946, Greene had an affair with Catherine Walston, the wife of Henry Walston, a wealthy farmer and future life peer. That relationship is generally thought to have informed the writing of \"The End of the Affair\", published in 1951, when the relationship came to an end. \nGreene left his family in 1947, but Vivien refused to grant him a divorce, in accordance with Catholic teaching, and they remained married until Greene's death in 1991.\nGreene lived with manic depression (bipolar disorder). He had a history of depression, which had a profound effect on his writing and personal life. In a letter to his wife, he told her that he had \"a character profoundly antagonistic to ordinary domestic life\", and that \"unfortunately, the disease is also one's material\".\nFinal years.\nGreene left Britain in 1966, moving to Antibes, to be close to Yvonne Cloetta, whom he had known since 1959, a relationship that endured until his death. In 1973, he had an uncredited cameo appearance as an insurance company representative in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's film \"Day for Night\". In 1981, Greene was awarded the Jerusalem Prize, awarded to writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.\nHe lived the last years of his life in Corseaux, on Lake Geneva in Switzerland, near Vevey where Charlie Chaplin was living in at this time. He visited Chaplin often, and the two were good friends. \nHis book \"Doctor Fischer of Geneva or the Bomb Party\" (1980) deals with \"the deadly sins of greed, pride, and despair.\"\nHe ceased going to mass and confession in the 1950s, but in his final years began to receive the sacraments again from Father Leopoldo Dur\u00e1n, a Spanish priest, who became a friend.\nIn one of his final works, a pamphlet titled \"J'Accuse: The Dark Side of Nice\" (1982), Greene wrote of a legal matter that embroiled him and his extended family in Nice, and declared that organised crime flourished in Nice because the city's upper levels of civic government protected judicial and police corruption. The accusation provoked a libel lawsuit that Greene lost, but he was ultimately vindicated in the 1990s when the former mayor of Nice, Jacques M\u00e9decin, was imprisoned for corruption and associated crimes.\nIn 1984, in celebration of his 80th birthday, the brewery which Greene's great-grandfather founded in 1799 made a special edition of its St. Edmund's Ale for him, with a special label in his honour. Commenting on turning 80, Greene said, \"The big advantage ... is that at 80 you are more likely these days to beat out encountering your end in a nuclear war,\" adding, \"the other side of the problem is that I really don't want to survive myself [which] has nothing to do with nukes, but with the body hanging around while the mind departs.\"\nIn 1986, Greene was awarded Britain's Order of Merit. He died of leukaemia in 1991 at the age of 86, and was buried in Corseaux cemetery.\nWriting style and themes.\nBeginning with \"Stamboul Train\" in 1932, Greene divided his fiction into two genres: thrillers (mystery and suspense books), which he described as entertainments; and literary works, which he described as novels. As his career lengthened, both Greene and his readers found the distinction between \"entertainments\" and \"novels\" to be less evident. When the broadly comic \"Travels with My Aunt\" (1969) was published, the \"New York Times\" reviewer felt that it blurred the boundaries between the two: \"\"Travels With My Aunt\", the title page tells us, belongs to the 'novel' category, but reading the book very soon establishes that it is also extremely entertaining and often very funny.\" When Heinemann and Bodley Head reissued Greene's \"entertainment\" \"The Confidential Agent\" and his \"novel\" \"The Power and the Glory\" together in 1971 as part of their \"Collected Edition\" of Greene's works, Julian Symons noted the \"close relationship\" between the genres; as the edition progressed, Eric Ambler pointed out that Greene was redesignating all his \"entertainments\" as novels, adding \"His reputation as a major twentieth-century novelist is likely to remain unimpaired.\"\nGreene was one of the more \"cinematic\" of twentieth-century writers; most of his novels and many of his plays and short stories have been . The 2014 edition of Quentin Falk's \"Travels in Greeneland: The Cinema of Graham Greene\" lists 62 titles between 1933 and 2013 based on Greene material. Some novels were filmed more than once, such as \"Brighton Rock\" in 1947 and 2011, \"The End of the Affair\" in 1955 and 1999, and \"The Quiet American\" in 1958 and 2002. The 1936 thriller \"A Gun for Sale\" was filmed three times in English alone, notably as \"This Gun for Hire\" in 1942. Greene received an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay for Carol Reed's \"The Fallen Idol\" (1948), adapted from his own short story \"The Basement Room\". He also wrote several original screenplays. In 1949, after writing the novella as \"raw material\", he wrote the screenplay for a classic film noir, \"The Third Man\", also directed by Reed and featuring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. In 1983, \"The Honorary Consul\", published ten years earlier, was released as a film (under the title \"Beyond the Limit\" in some territories), starring Michael Caine and Richard Gere. Author and screenwriter Michael Korda contributed a foreword and introduction to this novel in a commemorative edition.\nGreene's literary style was described by Evelyn Waugh in \"Commonweal\" as \"not a specifically literary style at all. The words are functional, devoid of sensuous attraction, of ancestry and of independent life\". Commenting on the lean prose and its readability, Richard Jones wrote in the \"Virginia Quarterly Review\" that \"nothing deflects Greene from the main business of holding the reader's attention\". Greene's novels often have religious themes at their centre. In his literary criticism he attacked the modernist writers Virginia Woolf and E. M. Forster for having lost the religious sense which, he argued, resulted in dull, superficial characters, who \"wandered about like cardboard symbols through a world that is paper-thin\". Only in recovering the religious element, the awareness of the drama of the struggle in the soul that carries the permanent consequence of salvation or damnation, and of the ultimate metaphysical realities of good and evil, sin and divine grace, could the novel recover its dramatic power. Suffering and unhappiness are omnipresent in the world Greene depicts; and Catholicism is presented against a background of unvarying human evil, sin, and doubt. V. S. Pritchett praised Greene as the first English novelist since Henry James to present, and grapple with, the reality of evil. Greene concentrated on portraying the characters' internal lives\u2014their mental, emotional, and spiritual depths. His stories are often set in poor, hot and dusty tropical places such as Mexico, West Africa, Vietnam, Cuba, Haiti, and Argentina, which led to the coining of the expression \"Greeneland\" to describe such settings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA stranger with no shortage of calling cards: devout Catholic, lifelong adulterer, pulpy hack, canonical novelist; self-destructive, meticulously disciplined, deliriously romantic, bitterly cynical; moral relativist, strict theologian, salon communist, closet monarchist; civilized to a stuffy fault and louche to drugged-out distraction, anti-imperialist crusader and postcolonial parasite, self-excoriating and self-aggrandizing, to name just a few.\n \"The Nation\", describing the many facets of Graham Greene\nThe novels often portray the dramatic struggles of the individual soul from a Catholic perspective. Greene was criticised for certain tendencies in an unorthodox direction\u2014for example, the implication that Scobie in \"The Heart of the Matter\", by deliberately causing his own damnation, sacrifices himself for others and thereby sanctifies his sins. His friend and fellow Catholic Evelyn Waugh attacked that as a revival of the Quietist heresy. This aspect of his work also was criticised by the theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, as giving sin a mystique. Greene responded that constructing a vision of pure faith and goodness in the novel was beyond his talents. Praise of Greene from an orthodox Catholic point of view by Edward Short is in \"Crisis Magazine\", and a mainstream Catholic critique is presented by Joseph Pearce.\nCatholicism's prominence decreased in his later writings. The supernatural preoccupations of the earlier work declined and were replaced by a humanistic perspective, a change reflected in his public criticism of orthodox Catholic teaching.\nIn his later years, Greene was a strong critic of American imperialism and sympathised with the Cuban leader Fidel Castro, whom he had met. Years before the Vietnam War, he prophetically attacked the idealistic but arrogant beliefs of \"The Quiet American\", whose certainty in his own virtue kept him from seeing the disaster he inflicted on the Vietnamese. In \"Ways of Escape\", reflecting on a Mexican trip, he criticised Mexico's government for \"making a hypocritical pretence of supporting Cuba\" while simultaneously feeding intelligence on visitors to the American authorities. In the 1930s he was already praising Ignazio Silone for his attempt to reconcile the social messages of Catholicism and Marxism; in Greene's opinion, \"Conservatism and Catholicism should be ... impossible bedfellows\".\nIn May 1949, the \"New Statesman\" held a contest for parodies of Greene's writing style: he himself submitted an entry under the name \"N. Wilkinson\", and took second place. Greene's entry comprised the first two paragraphs of a novel, apparently set in Italy, \"The Stranger's Hand: An Entertainment\". Greene's friend, the film director Mario Soldati, believed it had the makings of a suspense film about Yugoslav spies in postwar Venice. Upon Soldati's prompting, Greene continued writing the story as the basis for a film script. Apparently he lost interest in the project, leaving it as a substantial fragment that was published posthumously in \"The Graham Greene Film Reader\" (1993) and \"No Man's Land\" (2005). A script for \"The Stranger's Hand\" was written by Guy Elmes on the basis of Greene's unfinished story, and filmed by Soldati. In 1965, Greene again entered a similar \"New Statesman\" competition pseudonymously, and won an honourable mention.\nNobel Prize in Literature candidate.\nAcclaimed during his lifetime, Greene was for many years a perennial\ncontender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and he was shortlisted for the prize several times by the Nobel committee. In 1961 he was among the final three candidates for the prize. Anders \u00d6sterling, chair of the Nobel committee, stated that Greene \"is fully worthy of the prize, not just in regard of his most recent work \"A Burnt-Out Case\"], but for his vigorous work as a whole\", but the prize that year was awarded to the Yugoslavian writer Ivo Andri\u0107.\nIn 1966 and 1967, Greene was again among the final three choices, according to Nobel records unsealed on the 50th anniversary. For the 1967 prize the committee also considered Jorge Luis Borges and Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias. Committee chairman Anders \u00d6sterling again pushed for a prize to Greene describing him as \"an accomplished observer whose experience encompasses a global diversity of external environments, and above all the mysterious aspects of the inner world, human conscience, anxiety and nightmares\", but ultimately Asturias was the chosen winner. \nIn 1969, when Samuel Beckett and Andr\u00e9 Malraux were the main contenders for the prize, Greene's candidacy was however dismissed by the Nobel committee. Committee member Karl Ragnar Gierow stated: \"Despite my admiration for several of his earlier works, I would not even then have placed him in the class where a Nobel laureate belongs\". The following year Gierow further elaborated that Greene's best work was too far back in time, and that his most recent novel \"Travels With My Aunt\" was not of Nobel prize class, stating \"If the committee excludes him from its proposal this year, it seems to mean that it considers him out of the discussion, in case he does not return to the level that once made his name relevant.\"\nFollowing the publication of his novel \"The Honorary Consul\", Greene was shortlisted again in 1974, but this time the Nobel committee was hesitant to award an English language novelist for a second year in succession following the prize awarded to Patrick White the previous year, and Greene was passed over.\nGreene remained a favourite to win the Nobel prize in the 1980s, but it was known that two influential members of the Swedish Academy, Artur Lundkvist and Lars Gyllensten, opposed the prize for Greene and he was never awarded.\nLegacy.\nGreene is regarded as a major 20th-century novelist, and was praised by John Irving, before Greene's death, as \"the most accomplished living novelist in the English language\". Novelist Frederick Buechner called Greene's novel \"The Power and the Glory\" a \"tremendous influence\". By 1943, Greene had acquired the reputation of being the \"leading English male novelist of his generation\", and at the time of his death in 1991 had a reputation as a writer of both deeply serious novels on the theme of Catholicism, and of \"suspense-filled stories of detection\".\nGreene collected several literary awards for his novels, including the 1941 Hawthornden Prize for \"The Power and the Glory\" and the 1948 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for \"The Heart of the Matter\". As an author, he received the 1968 Shakespeare Prize and the 1981 Jerusalem Prize, a biennial literary award given to writers whose works have dealt with themes of human freedom in society. In 1986, he was awarded Britain's Order of Merit.\nThe Graham Greene International Festival is an annual four-day event of conference papers, informal talks, question and answer sessions, films, dramatised readings, music, creative writing workshops and social events. It is organised by the Graham Greene Birthplace Trust, and takes place in the writer's home town of Berkhamsted (about 35 miles north-west of London), on dates as close as possible to the anniversary of his birth (2 October). Its purpose is to promote interest in and study of the works of Graham Greene.\nHe is the subject of the 2013 documentary film, \"\". His 1987 trip to Moscow to visit Kim Philby is the subject of Ben Brown's play \"A Splinter of Ice\" (first staged 2021 and filmed that year); Oliver Ford Davies originally played Greene. Greene also features as a character in the film \"The Honourable Rebel\" (2015) about Elizabeth Montagu who worked with him on the script of \"The Third Man\". In the 2001 film \"Donnie Darko\", the protagonist is inspired by a classroom discussion of Greene's short story \"The Destructors\" and its line \"destruction after all is a form of creation\".\nSelected works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65465", "revid": "20468248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65465", "title": "Petroleum engineering", "text": "Extracting crude oil and natural gas\nPetroleum engineering is a field of engineering concerned with the activities related to the production of hydrocarbons, which can be either crude oil or natural gas or both. Exploration and production are deemed to fall within the \"upstream\" sector of the oil and gas industry. Exploration, by earth scientists, and petroleum engineering are the oil and gas industry's two main subsurface disciplines, which focus on maximizing economic recovery of hydrocarbons from subsurface reservoirs. Petroleum geology and geophysics focus on provision of a static description of the hydrocarbon reservoir rock, while petroleum engineering focuses on estimation of the recoverable volume of this resource using a detailed understanding of the physical behavior of oil, water and gas within porous rock at very high pressure.\nThe combined efforts of geologists and petroleum engineers throughout the life of a hydrocarbon accumulation determine the way in which a reservoir is developed and depleted, and usually they have the highest impact on field economics. Petroleum engineering requires a good knowledge of many other related disciplines, such as geophysics, petroleum geology, formation evaluation (well logging), drilling, economics, reservoir simulation, reservoir engineering, well engineering, artificial lift systems, completions and petroleum production engineering.\nRecruitment to the industry has historically been from the disciplines of physics, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and mining engineering. Subsequent development training has usually been done within oil companies.\nOverview.\nThe profession got its start in 1914 within the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers (AIME). The first Petroleum Engineering degree was conferred in 1915 by the University of Pittsburgh. Since then, the profession has evolved to solve increasingly difficult situations. Improvements in computer modeling, materials and the application of statistics, probability analysis, and new technologies like horizontal drilling and enhanced oil recovery, have drastically improved the toolbox of the petroleum engineer in recent decades. Automation, sensors, and robots are being used to propel the industry to more efficiency and safety.\nDeep-water, arctic and desert conditions are usually contended with. High temperature and high pressure (HTHP) environments have become increasingly commonplace in operations and require the petroleum engineer to be savvy in topics as wide-ranging as thermo-hydraulics, geomechanics, and intelligent systems.\nThe Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) is the largest professional society for petroleum engineers and publishes much technical information and other resources to support the oil and gas industry. It provides free online education (webinars), mentoring, and access to SPE Connect, an exclusive platform for members to discuss technical issues, best practices, and other topics. SPE members also are able to access the SPE Competency Management Tool to find knowledge and skill strengths and opportunities for growth. SPE publishes peer-reviewed journals, books, and magazines. SPE members receive a complimentary subscription to the \"Journal of Petroleum Technology\" and discounts on SPE's other publications. SPE members also receive discounts on registration fees for SPE organized events and training courses. SPE provides scholarships and fellowships to undergraduate and graduate students.\nAccording to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, petroleum engineers are required to have a bachelor's degree in engineering, generally a degree focused on petroleum engineering is preferred, but degrees in mechanical, chemical, and civil engineering are satisfactory as well. Petroleum engineering education is available at many universities in the United States and throughout the world - primarily in oil producing regions. \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" maintains a list of the Best Undergraduate Petroleum Engineering Programs. SPE and some private companies offer training courses. Some oil companies have considerable in-house petroleum engineering training classes.\nPetroleum engineering salaries.\nPetroleum engineering has historically been one of the highest-paid engineering disciplines, although there is a tendency for mass layoffs when oil prices decline and waves of hiring as prices rise. In 2020, the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the median pay for petroleum engineers was US$137,330, or roughly $66.02 per hour. The same summary projects there will be 3% job growth in this field from 2019 to 2029.\nSPE annually conducts a salary survey. In 2017, SPE reported that the average SPE professional member reported earning US$194,649 (including salary and bonus). The average base pay reported in 2016 was $143,006. Base pay and other compensation was on average was highest in the United States where the base pay was US$174,283. Drilling and production engineers tended to make the best base pay, US$160,026 for drilling engineers and US$158,964 for production engineers. Average base pay ranged from US$96,382-174,283. There are still significant gender pay gaps, plus or minus 5% of the US average pay gap which was 18% difference in 2017.\nAlso in 2016, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" named petroleum engineering the top college major in terms of highest median annual wages of college-educated workers (age 25\u201359). The 2010 National Association of Colleges and Employers survey showed petroleum engineers as the highest paid 2010 graduates, at an average annual salary of $125,220. For individuals with experience, salaries can range from $170,000 to $260,000. They make an average of $112,000 a year and about $53.75 per hour. In a 2007 article, Forbes.com reported that petroleum engineering was the 24th best paying job in the United States.\nSub-disciplines.\nPetroleum engineers divide themselves into several types:\nEducation.\nPetroleum Engineering, like most forms of engineering, requires a strong foundation in physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Other fields pertinent to petroleum engineering include geology, formation evaluation, fluid flow in porous media, well drilling technology, economics, geostatistics, etc.\nPetroleum Geostatistics.\nGeostatistics as applied to petroleum engineering uses statistical analysis to characterize reservoirs and create flow simulations that quantify uncertainties of the location of oil and gas.\nPetroleum Geology.\nPetroleum geology is an interdisciplinary field composed of geophysics, geochemistry, and paleontology. The main focus of petroleum geology is the exploration and appraisal of reservoirs containing hydrocarbons via technical forms of analysis.\nWell Drilling Technology.\nWell drilling technology is primarily the focus for drilling engineers. The two forms of well drilling are percussion and rotary drilling, rotary being the most common of the two. An important aspect of drilling is the drill bit, which creates a borehole of approximately three and a half to thirty inches in diameter. The three classes of drill bits, roller cone, fixed cutter, and hybrid, each use teeth to break up the rock. To optimize drilling efficiency and cost, drilling engineers make use of drilling simulators that allow them to identify drilling conditions. Drilling technologies including horizontal drilling and directional drilling have been developed to obtain hydrocarbons profitably from impermeable and coal-bed methane accumulations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh books and their adaptations. An anthropomorphic toy tiger, he was originally introduced in the 1928-story collection \"The House at Pooh Corner\", the sequel to the 1926 book \"Winnie-the-Pooh\". Like other Pooh characters, Tigger is based on one of Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed toy animals. He appears in the Disney animated versions of \"Winnie the Pooh\" and has also appeared in his own film, \"The Tigger Movie\" (2000).\nHe is known for his distinctive orange colour with black stripes, large eyes, a long chin, a springy tail, and his love of bouncing. As he says himself, \"Bouncing is what Tiggers do best.\" Tigger never refers to himself as a tiger, but as a \"Tigger\". Although he often refers to himself in the third person plural (e.g. \"Tiggers don't like honey!\"), he maintains that he is \"the only one\".\nIn literature.\n Tigger is introduced in Chapter II of \"House at Pooh Corner\", when he arrives at Winnie-the-Pooh's doorstep in the middle of the night, announcing himself with a stylised roar. Most of the rest of that chapter is taken up with the characters' search for a food that Tigger can eat for breakfast \u2014 despite Tigger's claims to like \"everything\", it is quickly proven that he does not like honey, acorns, thistles, or most of the contents of Kanga's larder. In a happy coincidence, however, he discovers that Tiggers like an extract of malt, which Kanga has on hand because she gives it to her baby, Roo, as \"strengthening medicine\".\nSubsequently, Tigger resides with Kanga and Roo in their house in the part of the Hundred Acre Wood near the Sandy Pit. He becomes great friends with Roo (to whom he becomes a sort of older sibling figure), and Kanga treats him in much the same way she does her own son. Tigger also interacts enthusiastically with all the other characters \u2014 sometimes too enthusiastically for the likes of Rabbit, who is sometimes exasperated by Tigger's constant bouncing, Eeyore, who is once bounced into the river by Tigger, and Piglet, who always seems a little nervous about the new, large, bouncy animal in the Forest. Nonetheless, the animals are all shown to be friends.\nIn addition to chapter II, Tigger also appears in Chapters IV, VI, VII, IX, and X of \"The House at Pooh Corner\", and is mentioned and seen in Chapter V. He is the only new major character to be introduced in \"The House at Pooh Corner\"; all of the others had been established in the earlier book, \"Winnie-the-Pooh\".\nDepiction and personality traits.\nIn Ernest H. Shepard's illustrations, Tigger appears to bounce and he is capable of holding a pen with one of his front paws. Though Tigger is described by Rabbit and Piglet as \"large\", he does not seem particularly big in the illustrations. Pooh states once \"He always seems bigger because of his bounces\", implying that the other animals think of Tigger as being larger than he truly is. That assessment fits very well with Tigger's personality and his assessment of his own abilities, which he always overestimates. He is cheerful, outgoing, competitive in a friendly way, and has complete confidence in himself. Some of the things which he claims Tiggers can do in the chapter \"In which it is shown That Tiggers don't climb trees\" include flying, jumping farther than a kangaroo, swimming, and climbing trees. He never actually attempts any of the first three things in the course of the story, but he does try to climb a tree. He only succeeds half-way, being able to climb up but not to climb down again. Tigger also says Tiggers \"never get lost\"; unlike most of his other claims, this one seems to be true - he is able to find his way through the Forest even in a thick mist, despite Rabbit's attempts to lose him.\nLike most of the characters in Winnie-the-Pooh, Tigger was based on one of Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed animals, in this case a stuffed-toy tiger. However, the word \"tiger\" is never actually used in the book. The term \"Tigger\" is used instead, both as the character's name and as a description of his type of animal. No other \"Tiggers\" appear in the story, and at one point Tigger (who has just seen his reflection in a mirror and mistaken it for another individual) comments he thought he was the only one. Despite that belief, he constantly uses the term in the plural, as in \"Tiggers don't like honey.\" and \"So \"that's\" what Tiggers like!\", etc. The term is always capitalized.\nAdaptations.\nIn 1960, His Master's Voice recorded a dramatised version with songs (music by Harold Fraser-Simson) of two episodes from \"The House at Pooh Corner\" (Chapters 2 and 8), with Hugh Lloyd as Tigger, which was released on a 45\u00a0rpm EP.\nDisney adaptations.\nTigger appears in the Disney cartoon versions of the Winnie the Pooh stories, beginning with \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\" in 1968. He starred in his own film, \"The Tigger Movie\" (Disney, 2000), along with his friends from the Hundred Acre Wood.\nFrom 1968 to 1999, Tigger was voiced by Paul Winchell. However, Walt Disney initially planned to have the character voiced by Wally Boag, but the role was turned over to Winchell after Disney's death, since Boag's performance of the character was considered to be \"too zany for a children's film\". Sam Edwards voiced Tigger in a couple of albums for Disneyland Records before \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\" was released. Will Ryan voiced Tigger only in the Disney Channel program \"Welcome to Pooh Corner\", which ran from 1983 to 1986. Later, Jim Cummings (who is also the new voice of Pooh) provided Tigger's voice, starting with later seasons of \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\". For a while, Cummings shared the role with Winchell, with the latter providing Tigger's speaking voice while the former sang as the character, until he took the role full-time starting with the 2000 film \"The Tigger Movie\".\nSince 1989, Tigger has been voiced by Jim Cummings (also the voice of Winnie the Pooh), with the exceptions of \"What's the Score, Pooh?\" (1990), \"Eeyi Eeyi Eeyore\" (1990), ' (1997), \"A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving\" (1998), ' (1999), archive footage of \"Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving\" (1999), and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh attraction at Walt Disney World, in which Winchell reprised the role of Tigger (Cummings voiced Tigger in the Disneyland version). On some albums and read-along cassettes in the early '90s, Ed Gilbert voiced Tigger.\nIn the movies, Tigger sings his own theme song, \"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\", written by the Sherman Brothers and first sung in Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day. The song is repeated in Disney's 1974 release \"Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!\", The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride and then again in the 1977 release \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\". In 1974, Paul Winchell earned a Grammy for his rendition of the song. The music was composed by Richard M. Sherman, with the lyrics and idea by Robert B. Sherman. Performed by Sam Edwards on record albums and Paul Winchell in \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" and later Jim Cummings in \"The Tigger Movie\", \"Piglet's Big Movie\", the 2011 film \"Winnie the Pooh\", and the 2018 live-action film \"Christopher Robin\". According to the song, Tigger is \"the only one\", which leads to his search for his family in \"The Tigger Movie\". The song opens up that film's first release.\nIn \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" and subsequent cartoons, Tigger lives in a large treehouse. A tire swing hangs prominently from a branch of the tree. In \"The Tigger Movie\", Tigger builds a makeshift addition (gluing the shingles on with bubble gum, using honey as brick mortar) in anticipation of a hoped-for visit by members of his family. This \"family room\" is eventually relocated to serve as a replacement for Eeyore's collapse-prone house of sticks.\nThe Disney version of Tigger appeared in both the TV special \"Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue\" and the TV series \"House of Mouse\". Tigger also made recurring appearances in the live-action wrap-around skits television series \"The Mouse Factory\", alongside the other costumed characters and celebrity guests.\nPersonality traits.\nTigger's personality in the cartoons is much like his personality in the book. He is always filled with great energy and optimism, and though always well-meaning, he can also be mischievous, and his actions have sometimes led to chaos and trouble for himself and his friends. He is very confident and possesses high self-esteem to the point of egotism. Also, he often undertakes tasks with gusto, only to later realize they were not as easy as he had originally imagined. As in the books, Tigger never refers to himself as a tiger, but as a \"Tigger\". When Tigger introduces himself, he often says the proper way to spell his name and that is \"T-I-double-Guh-Er\", which spells \"Tigger\".\nTigger's language is full of malapropisms, mispronunciations, or unnecessary/incorrect emphasis on syllables. Examples of this include him pronouncing \"villain\" as \"villian\"; \"terrible\" as \"terribibble\"; \"regulations\" as \"regularations\"; \"ridiculous\" as \"ridickerous\" (or \"ricky-diculus\" in \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\"); \"allergic\" as \"allergical\"; \"recognize\" as \"recoganize\"; \"suspicious\" as \"suspicerous\"; \"Eureka\" as \"Topeka\".\nA declaration often made, is that \"Tiggers are wonderful things. Their tops are made out of rubber, their bottoms are made out of springs.\" In cartoon, he's often depicted bouncing around in ways which would make such a statement appear to be valid.\nIn \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\", Tigger is often well-meaning but usually does more harm than good. In the episode \"Tigger is the Mother of Invention\", he invented a bulldozer-like contraption intended to provide convenience for Pooh, Piglet, and Rabbit, but the invention proved to have disastrous results, and Rabbit insisted that Tigger shut it down; however, in the winter, a depressed Tigger accidentally started the machine up, and it proved to be useful by plowing snow around Piglet's house before malfunctioning. On another occasion, Tigger attempted to mimic a superhero, \"The Masked Offender\", bringing mayhem to the Hundred-Acre Wood. In response, Pooh, Rabbit, Gopher, and Owl (unaware that the Masked Offender was actually Tigger) staged a hoax in which they made an inanimate monster from a sticky glue-like material. The plan worked, revealing Tigger as the Masked Offender, but the fake monster (which was on wheels) turned on its makers, ultimately resulting in Pooh, Rabbit, Gopher, and Owl hanging by the glue from a rickety bridge. Subsequently, Tigger resumed his role as the Masked Offender, and saved his friends.\nIt's also shown that Tigger will jump in to help without thinking about the danger to himself. On at least three occasions, he has nearly fallen off a cliff, and \"has\" fallen two of those times, to retrieve something important (Half of the map in \"\", his locket in \"The Tigger Movie\", and a page of Piglet's scrapbook in \"Piglet's Big Movie\").\nTigger's birthday is believed to be in October 1928, the year \"The House at Pooh Corner\" was first published. However, on Tigger-related merchandise, Disney often indicates Tigger's birthyear is in December 1968, a reference to the first appearance of Tigger in a Disney production, \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\".\nDisney's Tigger is also remembered for his song \"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\" when he made his first appearance. However, he wasn't included in the \"Winnie the Pooh\" theme song until the 2011 film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the Mary V. Sunseri Professor of Statistics and Mathematics at Stanford University.\nHe is particularly known for tackling mathematical problems involving randomness and randomization, such as coin flipping and shuffling playing cards.\nBiography.\nDiaconis left home at 14 to travel with sleight-of-hand legend Dai Vernon, and was awarded a high school diploma based on grades given to him by his teachers after dropping out of George Washington High School. He returned to school at age 24 to learn math, motivated to read William Feller's famous two-volume treatise on probability theory, \"An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications\". He attended the City College of New York for his undergraduate work, graduating in 1971, and then obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematical Statistics from Harvard University in 1974, learned to read Feller, and became a mathematical probabilist.\nAccording to Martin Gardner, at school, Diaconis supported himself by playing poker on ships between New York and South America. Gardner recalls that Diaconis had \"fantastic second deal and bottom deal\".\nDiaconis is married to Stanford statistics professor Susan Holmes.\nCareer.\nDiaconis received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1982. In 1990, he published (with Dave Bayer) a paper entitled \"Trailing the Dovetail Shuffle to Its Lair\" (a term coined by magician Charles Jordan in the early 1900s) which established rigorous results on how many times a deck of playing cards must be riffle shuffled before it can be considered random according to the mathematical measure total variation distance. Diaconis is often cited for the simplified proposition that it takes seven shuffles to randomize a deck. More precisely, Diaconis showed that, in the Gilbert\u2013Shannon\u2013Reeds model of how likely it is that a riffle results in a particular riffle shuffle permutation, it takes 5 riffles before the total variation distance of a 52-card deck begins to drop significantly from the maximum value of 1.0, and 7 riffles before it drops below 0.5 very quickly (a threshold phenomenon), after which it is reduced by a factor of 2 every shuffle. When entropy is viewed as the probabilistic distance, riffle shuffling seems to take less time to mix, and the threshold phenomenon goes away (because the entropy function is subadditive).\nDiaconis has coauthored several more recent papers expanding on his 1992 results and relating the problem of shuffling cards to other problems in mathematics. Among other things, they showed that the separation distance of an ordered blackjack deck (that is, aces on top, followed by 2's, followed by 3's, etc.) drops below .5 after 7 shuffles. Separation distance is an upper bound for variation distance.\nDiaconis has been hired by casino executives to search for subtle flaws in their automatic card shuffling machines. Diaconis soon found some and the horrified executives responded, \"We are not pleased with your conclusions but we believe them and that's what we hired you for.\"\nHe served on the Mathematical Sciences jury of the Infosys Prize in 2011 and 2012.\nWorks.\nThe books written or coauthored by Diaconis include:\nHis other publications include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is one of five players in MLB history to accumulate 3,000 hits, 300 home runs, and a career .300 batting average (the others being Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Miguel Cabrera, and Stan Musial). He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 in his first year of eligibility, and is the only player in MLB history to win a batting title in three different decades. He was also a member of the Royals' 1985 World Series victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.\nBrett was named the Royals' interim hitting coach in 2013 on May 30, but he stepped down from the position on July 25 in order to resume his position of vice president of baseball operations. In 2015, he won his second World Series ring when the Royals won the series in 5 games over the New York Mets.\nEarly life.\nBrett was born in Glen Dale, West Virginia, the youngest of four sons of a sports-minded family. Ken, the second oldest, became a major league pitcher who pitched in the 1967 World Series at age 19. Brothers John (eldest) and Bobby had brief careers in the minor leagues. All of George\u2019s brothers were born in Brooklyn.\nJack and Ethel Brett then moved the family from the northern panhandle of West Virginia to the Midwest, and three years later to El Segundo, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, just south of Los Angeles International Airport. George grew up hoping to follow in the footsteps of his older brothers. He graduated from El Segundo High School in 1971 and was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the second round (29th overall) of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft. He was high school teammates with pitcher Scott McGregor.\nPlaying career.\nMinor leagues.\nBrett began his professional baseball career as a shortstop, but had trouble going to his right defensively and was soon shifted to third base. As a third baseman, his powerful arm remained an asset, and he remained at that spot for more than 15 years. Brett's minor league stops were with the Billings Mustangs for the Rookie-level Pioneer League in 1971, the San Jose Bees of the Class A California League in 1972, and the Omaha Royals of the Class AAA American Association in 1973, batting .291, .274, and .284, respectively.\nKansas City Royals (1973\u20131993).\n1973.\nThe Royals promoted Brett to the major leagues on August 2, 1973. He made his major league debut that day against the Chicago White Sox, going 1-for-4 as the starting third baseman. He played in 13 games, and hit .125 (5-for-40).\n1974.\nBrett won the starting third base job in 1974 (replacing Paul Schaal), but struggled at the plate until he asked for help from Charley Lau, the Royals' batting coach. Spending the All-Star break working together, Lau taught Brett how to protect the entire plate and cover up some holes in his swing that experienced big-league pitchers were exploiting. Armed with this knowledge, Brett developed rapidly as a hitter, and finished the year with a .282 batting average, two home runs and 47 RBI in 113 games.\n1975\u20131979.\nBrett topped the .300 mark for the first time in 1975, hitting .308 with 11 home runs and 90 RBI in 159 games. He finished the season leading the league in hits (195) and triples (13). He then won his first batting title in 1976 with a .333 average, seven home runs and 67 RBI in 159 games. The four contenders for the batting title that year were Brett and Royals teammate Hal McRae, and Minnesota Twins teammates Rod Carew and Lyman Bostock. In dramatic fashion, Brett went 2-for-4 in the final game of the season against the Twins, beating out his three rivals, all playing in the same game. His lead over second-place McRae was less than .001. Brett won the title when a fly ball dropped in front of Twins left fielder Steve Brye, bounced on the Royals Stadium AstroTurf and over Brye's head to the wall; Brett circled the bases for an inside-the-park home run. McRae, batting just behind Brett in the line up, grounded out and Brett won his first batting title.\nFrom May 8 through May 13, 1976, Brett had three or more hits in six consecutive games, a major league record. A month later, he was on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" for a feature article, and made his first of 13 All-Star teams. The Royals won the first of three straight American League West Division titles, beginning a great rivalry with the New York Yankees\u2014whom they faced in the American League Championship Series each of those three years. In the fifth and final game of the 1976 ALCS, Brett hit a three-run homer in the top of the eighth inning to tie the score at six\u2014only to see the Yankees' Chris Chambliss launch a solo shot in the bottom of the ninth to give the Yankees a 7\u20136 win. Brett finished second in American League MVP voting to Thurman Munson.\nA year later, Brett emerged as a power hitter, batting .312 while clubbing 22 home runs and recording 88 RBI in 139 games, as the Royals headed to another ALCS. In Game 5 of the 1977 ALCS, following an RBI triple, Brett slid into third and was called safe then was kicked in the head by Graig Nettles, after which Brett stood and threw a punch at Nettles, igniting a bench-clearing brawl.\nIn 1978, Brett batted .294 (the only time between 1976 and 1983 in which he did not bat at least .300) with nine home runs and 62 RBI in 128 games, helping the Royals win a third consecutive AL West title. However, Kansas City once again lost to the Yankees in the ALCS, but not before Brett hit three home runs off Catfish Hunter in Game 3, becoming the second player to hit three home runs in an LCS game (Bob Robertson was the first, having done so in Game 2 of the 1971 NLCS).\nBrett followed with a successful 1979 season, in which he finished third in AL MVP voting. He became the sixth player in league history to have at least 20 doubles, triples and homers all in one season (42\u201320\u201323) and led the league in hits (212) and triples (20) while batting .329, with an on-base percentage of .376 and a slugging percentage of .563.\n1980.\nAll these impressive statistics were just a prelude to 1980, when Brett won the American League MVP and batted .390, a modern record for a third baseman. He was also named \"The Sporting News\" Sportsman of the Year. Brett's batting average was at or above .400 as late in the season as September 19, and the country closely followed his quest to bat .400 for an entire season, a feat which has not been accomplished since Ted Williams in 1941.\nBrett's 1980 batting average of .390 is second only to Tony Gwynn's 1994 average of .394 (Gwynn played in 110 games and had 419 at-bats in the strike-shortened season, compared to Brett's 449 at bats in 1980) for the highest single season batting average since 1941. Brett also recorded 118 runs batted in, while appearing in just 117 games; it was the first instance of a player averaging one RBI per game (in more than 100 games) since Walt Dropo thirty seasons prior. He led the American League in both slugging and on-base percentage.\nBrett started out slowly, hitting only .259 in April. In May, he hit .329 to get his season average to .301. In June, the 27-year-old third baseman hit .472 (17-for-36) to raise his season average to .337, but played his last game for a month on June 10, not returning to the lineup until after the All-Star Break on July 10 due to him tearing a ligament in his foot while trying to steal second.\nIn July, after being off for a month, he played in 21 games and hit .494 (42-for-85), raising his season average to .390. Brett started a 30-game hitting streak on July 18, which lasted until he went 0-for-3 on August 19 (the following night he went 3-for-3). During those 30 games, Brett hit .467 (57-for-122). His high mark for the season came a week later, when Brett's batting average was at .407 on August 26, after he went 5-for-5 on a Tuesday night in Milwaukee. He batted .430 for the month of August (30 games), and his season average was at .403 with five weeks to go. For the three hot months of June, July, and August 1980, Brett played in 60 American League games and hit .459 (111-for-242), most of it after a return from a monthlong injury. For these 60 games, he had 14 home runs and 69 RBI.\nBrett missed another 10 days in early September and hit just .290 for the month. His average was at .400 as late as September 19, but he then had a 4-for-27 slump, and the average dipped to .384 on September 27, with a week to play. For the final week, Brett went 10-for-19, which included going 2-for-4 in the final regular season game on October 4. His season average ended up at .390 (175 hits in 449 at-bats = .389755), and he averaged more than one RBI per game. Brett led the league in both on-base percentage (.454) and slugging percentage (.664) on his way to capturing 17 of 28 possible first-place votes in the MVP race. Since Al Simmons also batted .390 in 1931 for the Philadelphia Athletics, the only higher averages subsequent to 1931 were by Ted Williams of the Red Sox (.406 in 1941) and Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres (.394 in the strike-shortened 1994 season).\nMore importantly, the Royals won the American League West, and would face the AL East champion New York Yankees in the ALCS.\n1980 postseason.\nDuring the 1980 post-season, Brett led the Royals to their first American League pennant, sweeping the playoffs in three games from the rival Yankees who had beaten K.C. in the 1976, 1977 and 1978 playoffs. During Game 2 of the 1980 ALCS, Willie Randolph was on first base in the top of the eighth with two outs and the Royals up by just one run. Bob Watson hit a ball to the left field corner of Royals Stadium. The ball bounced right to Willie Wilson, but Wilson was not known for having a great arm, and third base coach Mike Ferraro waved Randolph home. Wilson overthrew U L Washington, the cut-off man, but Brett was in position behind him to catch the ball, then throw to Darrell Porter, who tagged out Randolph in a slide. TV cameras captured a furious George Steinbrenner fuming immediately after the play. The Royals won 3\u20132. Brett claimed after the game that he had deliberately positioned himself to cut off the throw in case Washington missed it, but Tommy John of the Yankees disagreed, thinking that if Brett had been backing up Washington, he would have been between shortstop and home plate, not over behind third base. Either way, he was in the perfect position to throw out Randolph. In Game 3, Brett hit a ball well into the third deck of Yankee Stadium off Yankees closer Goose Gossage. Gossage's previous pitch had been timed at 97\u00a0mph, leading ABC broadcaster Jim Palmer to say, \"I doubt if he threw that ball 97 miles an hour.\" A moment later Palmer was given the actual reading of 98. \"Well, I said it wasn't 97\", Palmer replied. Brett then hit .375 in the 1980 World Series, but the Royals lost in six games to the Philadelphia Phillies. During the Series, Brett made headlines after leaving Game 2 in the sixth inning due to hemorrhoid pain. Brett had minor surgery the next day, and in Game 3 returned to hit a home run as the Royals won in 10 innings 4\u20133. After the game, Brett was famously quoted \"...my problems are all behind me\". In 1981, he missed two weeks of spring training to have his hemorrhoids removed.\n1981.\nOn May 14, 1981, Brett hit UPI photographer Tom Gralish in the head with a crutch while Gralish was photographing him after a loss at Royals Stadium. Brett apologized the following day. Roughly two weeks later, in a fit of anger, he destroyed two toilets and a sink at Metropolitan Stadium as reported by sportswriter Mike Fish. On September 15 at a hotel in Anaheim, Brett confronted Fish about his reporting. Brett pushed reporter Janis Carr and had to be restrained by teammates Willie Wilson and Greg Keatley. Police were called but no arrests were made.\nPine Tar Incident.\nOn July 24, 1983, in a game against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium, Brett hit a two-run homer off Goose Gossage in the top of the ninth inning with two out to put the Royals up 5\u20134. After the home run, Yankees manager Billy Martin cited to the umpires a rule stating that any foreign substance on a bat could extend no further than 18\u00a0inches from the knob. The umpires measured the amount of pine tar, a legal substance used by hitters to improve their grip, on Brett's bat. The pine tar extended about 24\u00a0inches, leading home plate umpire Tim McClelland to signal Brett out and end the game as a Yankees win. An enraged Brett charged out of the dugout directly toward McClelland, forcing the two umpires and Royals manager Dick Howser to physically restrain him.\nThe Royals quickly issued a challenge to the outcome. It was upheld by American League president Lee MacPhail, who ruled that while the bat should have been excluded from future use, the home run should not have been nullified. Amid much controversy, the game was resumed on August 18, 1983, from the point of Brett's home run and ended with a Royals win.\n1985.\nIn 1985, Brett had another brilliant season in which he helped propel the Royals to their second American League Championship. He batted .335 with 30 home runs and 112 RBI in 155 games, finishing in the top 10 of the league in 10 different offensive categories. Defensively, he won his only Gold Glove, which broke Buddy Bell's six-year run of the award, and finished second in American League MVP voting to Don Mattingly. In the final week of the regular season, he went 9-for-20 at the plate with seven runs, five homers, and 9 RBI in six crucial games, five of them victories, as the Royals closed the gap and won the division title at the end. He was MVP of the 1985 playoffs against the Toronto Blue Jays, with an incredible Game 3. With KC down in the series two games to none, Brett went 4-for-4, homering in his first two at bats against Doyle Alexander, and doubled to the same spot in right field in his third at bat, leading the Royals' comeback. Brett then batted .370 in the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, including a four-hit performance in Game 7. The Royals again rallied from a 3\u20131 deficit to become World Series champions for the first time in their history.\n1986\u20131993.\nIn 1988, Brett moved across the diamond to first base in an effort to reduce his chances of injury and had another top-notch season with a .306 average, 24 home runs and 103 RBI in 157 games. But after batting just .282 with 12 homers and 80 RBI in 124 games the next year, it looked like his career might be slowing down. He got off to a terrible start in 1990 and at one point even considered retirement. But his manager, former teammate John Wathan, encouraged him to stick it out. Finally, in July, the slump ended and Brett batted .386 for the rest of the season. In September, he caught Rickey Henderson for the league lead, and in a battle down to the last day of the season, captured his third batting title with a .329 mark. This feat made Brett the only major league player to win batting titles in three different decades.\nBrett played three more seasons for the Royals, mostly as their designated hitter, but occasionally filling in for injured teammates at first base. He passed the 3,000-hit mark in 1992, though he was picked off by Angels first baseman Gary Gaetti after stepping off the base to start enjoying the moment. Brett retired after the 1993 season; in his final at-bat, he hit a single up the middle against Rangers closer Tom Henke and scored on a home run by now teammate Gaetti. His last game was also notable as being the final game ever played at Arlington Stadium.\nHall of Fame.\nBrett was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1999, with what was then the fourth-highest voting percentage in baseball history (98.2%), trailing only Tom Seaver, Nolan Ryan, and Ty Cobb. His voting percentage was higher than all-time greats Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Stan Musial, Ted Williams, and Joe DiMaggio. In 2007, Cal Ripken Jr. passed Brett with 98.5% of the vote.\nBrett's No. 5 was retired by the Royals on May 14, 1994, only the second in Royals history, after former Royals manager, Dick Howser\u2019s No. 10 in 1987.\nBrett was selected the Hometown Hero for the Royals in a two-month fan vote revealed in an hour-long telecast on ESPN on September 27, 2006. He was one of the few players to receive more than 400,000 votes.\nLegacy.\nBrett's 3,154 career hits are the second most by a third baseman in major league history, surpassed only by Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 (3,166 hits), and 18th among all players. Baseball historian Bill James regards him as the second-best third baseman of all time, trailing only his contemporary, Mike Schmidt. In 1999, he ranked Number 55 on \"The Sporting News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Brett is one of only five players in MLB history\u2014the other four being Stan Musial, Willie Mays, Miguel Cabrera, and Hank Aaron\u2014to accumulate 3,000 hits, 300 home runs, and a career .300 batting average. Most indicative of his hitting style, Brett is seventh on the career doubles list with 665, trailing only Tris Speaker, Pete Rose, Stan Musial, Ty Cobb, Albert Pujols and Craig Biggio).\nBrett was a highly effective hitter in the postseason. In 43 postseason games, including 2 World Series (1980, 1985), he batted .337 (56-for-166) with 10 home runs and 23 RBI.\nA photo in the July 1976 edition of \"National Geographic\" showing Brett signing baseballs for fans with his team's name emblazoned across his shirt was the inspiration for New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde's 2013 song \"Royals,\" which won the 2014 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. Brett was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. Brett was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2017.\nThe Mendoza Line.\nBrett is credited with popularizing the phrase the Mendoza Line, which is used to represent a sub-.200 batting average, historically regarded as unacceptable at the Major League level. It derives from shortstop Mario Mendoza, a career .215 hitter who finished below .200 five times in his nine seasons in the big leagues\u2014including .198 the year the term is claimed to have been coined by a pair of his teammates in Tom Paciorek and Bruce Bochte in 1979.\nBrett referred to the Mendoza Line in an interview, which was picked up by ESPN baseball anchor Chris Berman and then expanded into the world of \"SportsCenter\".\nPost-baseball activities.\nFollowing his playing career Brett became a vice president of the Royals, and has worked as a part-time coach, as a special instructor in spring training, as an interim batting coach, and as a roving instructor helping minor league prospects develop. He also runs a baseball equipment and glove company named Brett Bros. with brothers Bobby, and, until his death in 2003, Ken. He has also lent his name to a restaurant on the Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri.\nIn 1998, Brett worked as a color analyst on regional \"Fox Saturday Baseball\" telecasts.\nBrett has continued to raise money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Brett started to raise money for the Keith Worthington Chapter during his playing career in the mid-1980s.\nBrett and his dog Charlie appeared in a PETA ad campaign, encouraging people not to leave their canine companions in the car during hot weather. He also threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Mike Napoli at the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\nOn May 30, 2013, the Royals announced that Brett and Pedro Grifol would serve as batting coaches for the organization. On July 25, 2013 (the day following the 30th anniversary of the pine tar incident), the Royals announced that Brett would serve as vice president of baseball operations.\nIn 2015, Brett was the National Baseball Hall of Fame recipient of the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award for his support of current and former service members of the United States Military.\nBrett appeared as himself in the ABC sitcom \"Modern Family\" on March 28, 2018, alongside main cast member Eric Stonestreet, a Kansas City native and Royals fan, whose character on the show is also an avid fan.\nBrett appeared as himself in the \"Brockmire\" episode \"Player to Be Named Later\", in which he is dating Jules (Amanda Peet), much to Brockmire's despair; in the episode \"Low and Away\", Jules informs Brockmire that she and her now-husband Brett are getting a divorce. Series creator Joel Church-Cooper said in a statement, \"When I created a show about a fake Kansas City legend, Jim Brockmire, I thought it only appropriate to have him worship the biggest Kansas City legend of them all\u2014George Brett.\"\nHe was a recurring guest on the podcast \"Pardon My Take\" which is presented by Barstool Sports and hosted by Dan \"Big Cat\" Katz and PFT Commenter.\nTeam ownership.\nIn 1998, an investor group headed by Brett and his older brother, Bobby, made an unsuccessful bid to purchase the Kansas City Royals. Brett is the principal owner of the Tri-City Dust Devils, the Single-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels. He and his brother Bobby also co-own the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, a Los Angeles Dodgers Single-A partner, and lead ownership groups that control the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League, and the West Coast League's Bellingham Bells.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1992, Brett married the former Leslie Davenport, and they reside in the Kansas City suburb of Mission Hills, Kansas. The couple has three sons: Jackson, Dylan, and Robin.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the flagship station of the ABC television network, owned and operated through its ABC Owned Television Stations division. WABC-TV maintains studio facilities in the Hudson Square neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, co-located with ABC's corporate headquarters. The station transmits from atop the Empire State Building.\nWABC-TV is best known in broadcasting circles for its version of the \"Eyewitness News\" format and for its morning show, syndicated nationally by corporate cousin Disney Media &amp; Entertainment Distribution.\nHistory.\nAs WJZ-TV (1948\u20131953).\nThe station signed on August 10, 1948, as WJZ-TV, the first of three television stations signed on by ABC during that same year, with WENR-TV in Chicago and WXYZ-TV in Detroit being the other two. Channel 7's call letters came from its then-sister radio station, WJZ. In its early years, WJZ-TV was programmed much like an independent station, as the ABC television network was still, for the most part, in its very early stages of development; the ABC-owned stations did air some common programming during this period, especially after the 1949 fall season when the network's prime time schedule began to expand. The station's original transmitter site was located at The Pierre Hotel at 2 East 61st Street, before moving to the Empire State Building a few years later. The station's original studios were located at 77 West 66th Street, with additional studios at 7 West 66th Street. A tunnel linked ABC studios at 7 West 66th Street to the lobby of the Hotel des Artistes, a block north on West 67th Street. Another studio inside the Hotel des Artistes was used for \"Eyewitness News Conference\".\nAs WABC-TV (1953\u2013present).\nThe station's call letters were changed to WABC-TV on March 1, 1953, after ABC merged its operations with United Paramount Theatres, a firm which was broken off from former parent company Paramount Pictures by decree of the U.S. government. The WJZ-TV callsign was later reassigned to Westinghouse Broadcasting (the original owners of WJZ radio in New York) as an historical nod in 1957 for their newly acquired television station in Baltimore \u2013 a station that was, by coincidence, an ABC affiliate until 1995.\nAs part of ABC's expansion program, initiated in 1977, ABC built 7 Lincoln Square on the southeast corner of West 67th Street and Columbus Avenue, on the site of an abandoned moving and storage warehouse. At about the same time, construction was started at 30 West 67th Street on the site of a former parking lot. Both buildings were completed in June 1979 and WABC-TV moved its offices from 77 West 66th Street to 7 Lincoln Square.\nOn September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of WABC-TV, as well as eight other local television stations and several radio stations, were destroyed when two hijacked airplanes crashed into and destroyed the north and south towers of the World Trade Center. WABC-TV's transmitter maintenance engineer Donald DiFranco died in the attack. In the immediate aftermath, the station fed its signal to WNYE-TV, WHSE-TV, WHSI-TV, and the New Jersey Network before establishing temporary facilities at the Armstrong Tower in Alpine, New Jersey. The station eventually re-established transmission facilities at the Empire State Building, its original home when it signed on the air in 1948.\nABC News Now was launched in 2004 on digital subchannels of the ABC O&amp;O stations. On January 31, 2005, ABC removed ABC News Now from O&amp;O and affiliated stations' subchannels as the channel ended its experimental phase originally. The group changed its programming on secondary channels to ABC Plus, a local news and public affairs format. ABC teamed up with AccuWeather to launch a multicast service on WABC's third subchannel between December 9, 2005, and March 31, 2006.\nOn May 27, 2007, WABC-TV's studios suffered major damage as the result of a fire that knocked the station off the air shortly before the start of the 11\u00a0p.m. newscast. According to preliminary reports, the fire may have been ignited by a spotlight coming into contact with a curtain inside the news studio; the station's website later reported the cause as an \"electrical malfunction\". The station's building was evacuated and the fire was brought under control, though the studio was said to be \"badly damaged\", having suffered smoke and water damage. WABC-TV resumed broadcasting at around 1\u00a0a.m. on May 28, 2007 (initially carrying the network's 10\u00a0pm. West Coast feed of \"Brothers &amp; Sisters\", followed by the full broadcast of \"World News Now\"). Due to the fire, the station broadcast \"Eyewitness News\" from the newsroom, while \"Live! with Regis and Kelly\", whose set was also affected, moved to the set of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\". Starting with the 5\u00a0p.m. newscast on June 20, 2007, the station resumed the \"Eyewitness News\" and \"Live!\" broadcasts from its main studios at Columbus Avenue and 66th Street.\nThe Live Well Network (LWN) was launched on April 27, 2009, in high definition by ABC's O&amp;O stations on the stations' .2 subchannels.\nWABC-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, VHF channel 7, at 12:30\u00a0p.m. on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 45 to VHF channel 7. WABC's digital signal was initially difficult to receive over-the-air in New York City. The station was requested by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at a lower power; WABC was among many stations which have found it necessary to increase power to restore coverage to the same level as its former analog signal. On June 29, 2009, WABC filed an application with the FCC to increase power from 11.69\u00a0kW to 27\u00a0kW. On January 31, 2010, the FCC granted a special temporary authority (STA) for the station to increase power to 26.9\u00a0kW.\nIn May 2013, WABC-TV and Philadelphia sister station WPVI-TV became the first two ABC-owned stations to offer live, web-based streaming of programming to authenticated subscribers of participating cable and satellite television providers as provided through the relaunched \"Watch ABC\" mobile apps.\nABCOTS indicated in January 2015 that its stations' third subchannel would affiliate with Laff network upon launch on April 15, 2015; until then, LWN would run on both subchannels. ABC Stations rebranded Live Well Network on .2 as Localish on February 17, 2020, to add an outlet for the Localish lifestyle content.\nProgramming.\nWABC has long presented events such as the Columbus Day Parade and Puerto Rican Day Parade and beginning in 2017, they became the first television station to air the New York City LGBT Pride March. In addition, the station is also producing local programs such as \"Here and Now\", a program covering the latest issues, trends and news stories impacting the local black community, \"Tiempo\", a weekly program that focus on the issues affecting local Hispanic citizens, and \"Up Close\", a public affairs program on the latest issues with the newsmakers. The station also formerly produced \"Viewpoint\", a weekly program that highlighted the cultural and community efforts in New York, Long Island and New Jersey (each of these regions rotated weekly).\nAs of 2023[ [update]], aside from \"Live with Kelly and Mark\", WABC's first-run syndicated programs include \"Tamron Hall\", \"Jeopardy!\", and \"Wheel of Fortune\".\n\"Live with Kelly and Mark\".\nWABC-TV produces the nationally syndicated talk show \"Live with Kelly and Mark\". Until the station's newscasts were moved to a separate studio in 2011, the program originated in the same ground-floor studio at 7 Lincoln Square as \"Eyewitness News\", thus creating a situation which forced local news updates broadcast during \"Good Morning America\" and \"Live\" to be produced from the WABC-TV newsroom and the morning show's presence also limited the size of the \"Eyewitness News\" set.\nThe program's roots originated with \"A.M. New York\", which debuted in 1970 as a local version of NBC's \"Today\" show; its first host was John Bartholomew Tucker, who remained with the program until 1972. After Tucker's departure, a succession of hosts came and went, the most successful of whom was Stanley Siegel, who hosted from 1975 to 1978 (for a year beginning in 1977, the series was called \"The Stanley Siegel Show\"). After 1980, the show was retitled \"Good Morning New York\", whose co-hosts in the last years of its run in that form included Spencer Christian, Andrea Kirby, Judy Licht, Dick Wolfsie and longtime \"Eyewitness News\" reporter and anchor Doug Johnson. After years of a losing ratings battle against \"Donahue\" on WNBC-TV, WABC-TV canceled \"Good Morning New York\" in early 1983.\nThe current show began as the station's second attempt at a local morning show a month later, aptly titled \"The Morning Show\" (using the \"Circle 7\" logo in the actual text for one of the \"o\"s) and was originally hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey. After Garvey's departure a year later, she was replaced by Ann Abernathy, who in turn, left in 1985 to return to Los Angeles. That year, Kathie Lee Johnson (who would marry Frank Gifford a year later) became Philbin's new co-host.\nIn 1988, Buena Vista Television began syndicating the show nationally as \"Live with Regis and Kathie Lee\". Gifford left the show in 2000 and was eventually replaced by Kelly Ripa. Philbin left the show in November 2011 and the show aired for nearly a year as \"Live! with Kelly\" until former New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan became Ripa's permanent co-host in September 2012. In May 2016, Strahan left the show to become a full-time anchor at \"Good Morning America\", thus leaving Ripa as the solo host again. On May 1, 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would become the new host of the show; to accommodate his syndicated radio show \"On Air with Ryan Seacrest\" (which normally originates from Los Angeles), an additional studio was built within WABC's facilities. Seacrest departed \"Live\" on April 14, 2023, and three days later Ripa's husband, Mark Consuelos, became the new co-host of the show.\nSports programming.\nWABC-TV serves as the local over-the-air broadcaster of \"Monday Night Football\" games, airing simulcasts of the ESPN-televised games carried nationally on ABC. However, ESPN-only \"MNF\" telecasts involving the Giants or Jets air locally on WPIX. Previously, the station carried coverage of the Giants' victory in Super Bowl XXV.\nSince 2013, WABC-TV serves as the exclusive local English-language carrier of the annual New York City Marathon. The station preempts a weekend edition of \"Good Morning America\" and delays \"This Week\" to schedule time for the live broadcast. The marathon is also simulcast on ESPN2 nationally (although viewers in the Tri-State area cannot see it via ESPN2 because the simulcast is blacked out locally).\nWABC-TV currently airs any New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets games televised via the \"NBA on ABC\". The station has aired the Knicks' appearances in the 1970, 1972 and 1973 NBA Finals (where the Knicks won in 1970 and 1973), as well as the then-New Jersey Nets' appearance in the 2003 NBA Finals.\nWABC-TV aired New York Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils games carried through the \"NHL on ABC\"; this included the Devils' victories in the 2000 and 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, as well as their appearance in the 2001 Stanley Cup Finals. Beginning in 2021, it officially reassumed this duty, this time as the OTA simulcast partner of the \"NHL on ESPN\".\nThrough the ABC portion of the \"MLS on ESPN\" package, WABC-TV aired New York City FC's victory in the 2021 MLS Cup and the New York Red Bulls' appearance in the 2008 MLS Cup.\nWABC-TV also previously aired any New York Yankees and New York Mets games through ABC's baseball contract; this included the Yankees' victory in the 1977 World Series and appearance in the 1981 World Series.\nNews operation.\nWABC-TV presently broadcasts 48 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5+1\u20442 hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station partners with Philadelphia sister station, WPVI-TV\u2014which popularized the \"Action News\" format\u2014in the production and broadcast of statewide New Jersey political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as for Governor or U.S. Senate, they pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations share coverage of news from New Jersey where their markets overlap, pooling reporters, live trucks, and helicopters.\nNews department history.\nBeginning to 1968.\nWABC-TV launched \"Report to New York\", its first regular news program, on October 26, 1959, featuring Scott Vincent with news, Howard Cosell with sports, and Lynn Dollar with the weather. \"Report to New York\" aired Monday through Friday at 11\u00a0pm. By January 1961, channel 7 expanded \"Report to New York\" with a 15-minute early edition at 6:15\u00a0p.m. on weeknights, and on Saturday and Sunday evenings.\nOn October 22, 1962, WABC-TV expanded its weeknight news to 45 minutes, and retitled it \"The Big News\". Newcomers Bill Beutel and Jim Burnes were the anchors, with Cosell continuing on sports and Rosemary Haley as \"weather girl\". However, this effort failed to draw viewers from the ratings leader WCBS-TV and second-place WNBC-TV.\nThe \"Eyewitness News\" era.\nIn early 1968, Beutel left the station to become the London bureau chief for ABC News and was replaced by Roger Grimsby, who was transferred by ABC from San Francisco sister station KGO-TV. In a complete revamp, Grimsby was joined by Tex Antoine doing weather, celebrity gossip columnist Rona Barrett, \"New York Daily News\" columnist Jimmy Breslin with political commentary and reviews by Martin Bookspan and Allan Jeffries, while Cosell continued doing sports. Known as \"Roger Grimsby and the Noisemakers\", this format didn't help the ratings, which plunged to an all-time low.\nLater that year, newly hired news director Al Primo brought to WABC-TV the \"Eyewitness News\" format and branding, in which reporters present their stories directly to the viewers. Having experienced great success introducing the format during his time at KYW-TV in Philadelphia, Primo this time added a twist \u2013 a degree of conversational chatter among the anchors, known as \"happy talk\". The \"Tar Sequence\" cue from the musical score of the 1967 film \"Cool Hand Luke\", composed by Lalo Schifrin, was introduced as the theme music. The score included a telegraphic-style melody appropriate for a newscast. The \"Eyewitness News\" format and theme music were quickly adopted by ABC's other four owned-and-operated stations at the time: KGO-TV, WLS-TV in Chicago, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and KABC-TV in Los Angeles (though KGO-TV and WXYZ-TV did not use the \"Eyewitness News\" title for their programs). The format quickly rejuvenated a station that had long been an also-ran to WCBS-TV and WNBC-TV. Within a year, Channel 7 had shot to first place in the ratings for the first time in its history, displacing longtime leader WCBS-TV. It spent most of the decade going back and forth with WCBS-TV for first place. For a time in the 1980s, it fell into last place among the network-owned stations, but still fought with WNBC-TV for second place.\nRetaining only Grimsby, Cosell, and Antoine from the earlier \"Noisemakers\" format, Primo also hired Tom Dunn away from WCBS-TV to serve as Grimsby's co-anchor. After Dunn departed for WOR-TV in 1970, Bill Beutel returned to the station as his replacement and for the next 16 years, Grimsby and Beutel were the faces of \"Eyewitness News\".\nThe Grimsby-Beutel team were split up for several months in 1975 after ABC had reassigned Beutel to its new morning show, \"AM America\" that January. The station brought in WXYZ-TV's Bill Bonds and veteran Boston anchor Tom Ellis to help replace Beutel, with Grimsby teaming with Ellis at 6\u00a0p.m. and Bonds at 11\u00a0pm. When \"AM America\" was canceled and replaced with \"Good Morning America\" in November 1975, Beutel was re-teamed with Grimsby at 6\u00a0p.m, with Ellis joining Bonds at 11\u00a0pm. Bonds returned to Detroit in June 1976 and was replaced by Larry Kane, who lasted only one year as the sole 11\u00a0p.m. anchor before returning to his home market of Philadelphia. Ellis remained until May 1977 and Kane's successor, Ernie Anastos, began his New York career at the station; he co-anchored at 11\u00a0p.m. with Rose Ann Scamardella and later Kaity Tong for most of his tenure there.\nOn November 30, 1981, the station became the second in the city to expand its late afternoon/evening newscasts by adding of a 5\u00a0p.m. edition. The broadcast was initially anchored by weather forecaster Storm Field along with Scamardella; Anastos, and later Tong, would replace them. Tom Snyder, who joined WABC after his late night talk show, \"Tomorrow\", was canceled, would take Anastos' place in 1982 and would remain at the station until 1984; WABC attempted an early afternoon, feature-driven newscast shortly thereafter with Anastos and Beutel anchoring \"Eyewitness Extra\", but the program was short lived and was canceled in early 1983.\nIn 1985, the station lured WLS-TV's news director, Bill Applegate, from Chicago to New York City. Applegate claimed credit for taking WLS-TV from last to first in only two years and ABC hoped he could work the same magic at the flagship station. In the wake of declining ratings, Grimsby was fired on April 16, 1986, a move for which Applegate drew considerable ire and Grimsby was quickly hired by rival WNBC-TV. In 1987, Channel 7 surged back into first place. It has been the ratings leader in New York City since then, and has grown to become the most-watched broadcast television station in the United States. Beutel stepped down from the anchor desk in 2001, which concluded the longest tenure for a main anchor in New York City television history at that time. His record has since been surpassed by WNBC's Chuck Scarborough and WXTV's Rafael Pineda. Scarborough's uninterrupted run behind the desk is the longest in New York television (since 1974). Pineda is second, having started with WXTV in 1972, retiring in 2013 after 41 years.\n2000\u2013present.\nWABC-TV's news department is respected for its straightforward presentation (especially during breaking news). For the last decade, it has waged a spirited battle for first place, but for most of the time has held onto the lead, helped in part by lead-ins from the highly rated talk and entertainment shows. For over 24 years (December 1986 to May 2011), the lead-in for the 5\u00a0p.m. \"Eyewitness News\" broadcast had been \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" at 4\u00a0p.m. and its strong ratings brought viewers along to the 5\u00a0p.m. newscast.\nThe newscasts were replayed on one of channel 7's digital subchannels, another which also carried local weather and news channel. WABC-TV's website had a link for live streaming video of \"Channel 7 Eyewitness News NOW\", which offered live local and national weather updated from AccuWeather alongside local news. The format of \"Eyewitness News NOW\" is similar to the defunct NBC Weather Plus. On February 24, 2011, AccuWeather and ABC both replaced ENN as well as similar news channels on WABC-TV's sister stations, KABC-TV in Los Angeles and WLS-TV in Chicago, replacing them in all three cities with a standard definition, letterboxed simulcast of the Live Well Network, and then on April 15, 2015, these stations were replaced by Laff.\nOn December 2, 2006, WABC-TV became the second station in the New York City market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On September 7, 2010, WABC-TV expanded its weekday morning newscast, moving its start time to 4:30\u00a0am. Three days earlier on September 4, 2010, WABC added an hour-long extension of its Saturday morning newscast from 9\u00a0a.m. to 10\u00a0am. On May 26, 2011, WABC-TV added another hour of local news at 4\u00a0p.m. to replace \"Oprah\", which aired its last original episode the previous day.\nOn September 24, 2011, the station began broadcasting its newscasts and public affairs programs from a new street-level window studio at a former Disney Store location in the ABC building on 66th Street and Columbus Avenue. The space previously used for news broadcasts was used to expand the \"Live with Kelly\" studio. In January 2012, the station also expanded its weekend 11\u00a0p.m. newscasts to an hour. On September 8, 2014, the station expanded its Noon newscast to one full hour from the previous half-hour.\nOn January 31, 2022, WABC announced they would be launching a streaming channel titled \"ABC 7 New York 24/7 Stream\". As part of the launch of the service, WABC announced a new 6:30\u00a0p.m. newscast, available only through the stream.\nOn September 11, 2023, WABC-TV, along with sister stations WPVI-TV and WTVD in Durham, North Carolina, launched an additional hour-long newscast at 10 a.m. which took over the time slot previously occupied by \"Tamron Hall\". The broadcast delivers news in a traditional format, and also allows more focus to be placed on local newsmakers, and further discussion on topics addressed on \"Good Morning America\" and \"Live with Kelly and Mark\". WABC delayed its launch by one day, due to coverage of events in the city, marking the anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001.\nWABC-TV left its longtime home of Lincoln Square for a new Disney campus, located at Hudson Square in Lower Manhattan, on February 22, 2025.\nNotable former on-air staff.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSubchannels.\nThe station's signal is multiplexed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Broadcast on behalf of another station\nCarriage disputes.\nCablevision (2010).\nOn March 7, 2010, at 12:02\u00a0am. WABC-TV's signal was removed from Cablevision's New York area systems (including iO Digital Cable) after the two sides failed to reach terms on a new retransmission consent agreement; the station was replaced by either a blank screen or a looping video containing a message from Cablevision about the removal. To avoid interruption of programming, the station urged Cablevision subscribers in the station's viewing area (totaling up to three million subscribers) to switch to other services, such as Verizon FiOS and DirecTV or simply view the station over the air through an over-the-air digital antenna and if necessary, a digital converter box, for older television sets. WABC's sister station, WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, was also pulled from Cablevision's New Jersey systems in Mercer, Ocean and Monmouth counties.\nLater that same day at approximately 8:50\u00a0p.m. 20 minutes into ABC's broadcast of the 82nd Academy Awards, Cablevision and ABC reached a deal, restoring WABC and WPVI's signals for Cablevision subscribers after a nearly 21-hour blackout.\nTime Warner Cable (2010).\nIn July 2010, ABC's parent company Disney announced that it was involved in a carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum), its first with that provider in 10 years. This dispute involved four ABC owned-and-operated stations (WABC-TV and sister stations KABC-TV, WTVD and WTVG in Toledo, Ohio [the latter station would be sold by ABC the next year]), Disney Channel and the ESPN networks. If a deal was not in place, the affected stations and cable channels would have been removed from Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems across the country. On September 2, 2010, Disney and Time Warner Cable reached a long-term agreement to keep the channels on Time Warner Cable systems.\nCharter Spectrum (2023).\nOn August 31, 2023, Disney removed all of its channels, including WABC-TV, two other ABC-owned stations, and the ESPN networks, from Spectrum cable systems due to a carriage dispute, its first with the provider since 2010 when its predecessor, Time Warner Cable, was involved in a dispute with Disney. On September 11, 2023, the stations and their sister cable channels were restored by Charter Communications (the parent company of Spectrum) after the company and Disney reached an agreement.\nDirecTV (2024).\nOn September 1, 2024, Disney pulled its networks from DirecTV after the two sides failed to reach a distribution deal. The removal, which included WABC-TV and ESPN, would ultimately impact the New York Jets' season-opening game on \"Monday Night Football\" against the San Francisco 49ers (ABC simulcast ESPN's coverage of the game). Disney and DirecTV ended their standoff on September 14, restoring WABC and ESPN to the satellite provider.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "65486", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65486", "title": "SOKO", "text": "Yugoslav aircraft manufacturer\nSoko () was a Yugoslav aircraft manufacturer based in Mostar, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. The company was responsible for the production of many military aircraft for the Yugoslav Air Force.\nSOKO was created in 1950 by the relocation of the aircraft factory section of Ikarus company from Zemun, SR Serbia. Officially founded as \"Preduze\u0107e Soko\" (Soko Corporation, \"soko\" meaning \"falcon\" in Serbian), soon after it was renamed \"Soko Vazduhoplovna Industrija, RO Vazduhoplovstvo\" (Soko Aeronautical Industry, WO (Work Organization) Aeronautics). Its first director was Yugoslav People's Army colonel Ivan Sert. The following directors of the company were engineers Miljenko Pje\u0161\u010di\u0107 and Tomislav Miri\u0107. The serial manufacture of numerous types of aircraft was projected by the Aeronautical Technical Institute in Belgrade. Besides aircraft, SOKO also produced helicopters under licence. Located in the vicinity of Mostar, it mostly used the Mostar Airport for test flights.\nBy the 1980s, SOKO was working on the Novi Avion project, intended to develop an indigenous fourth-generation, supersonic multi-role fighter that would enabled the Yugoslav Air Force to be supplied with domestically-built modern fighters. The production was planned to begin around 1991; however, the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the enactment of an international arms embargo caused the project to be cancelled. During the early 1990s, the factory ceased aircraft production altogether. The facilities were partially dismantled and relocated to Serbia, where they were aligned with the Utva Aviation Industry in Pan\u010devo which had already been working closely with SOKO in the manufacturing of Orao and Super Galeb.\nHistory.\nDuring the late 1940s, as a result of the Yugoslav government's policy to relocate Serbian industry, a large portion of both the infrastructure and personal from the aeronautical section of the Ikarus company from Zemun, SR Serbia was uprooted and transferred to Mostar, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. During 1950, these assets were integrated into the newly formed aircraft manufacturer SOKO, which immediately begin working on various aeronautical technologies. During these early years, the company produced the Soko 522 trainer aircraft, as well as providing maintenance support for the Yugoslav Air Force, particularly its fleet of American-built F-84 Thunderjet fighters.\nDuring 1957, Yugoslavia's VTI (Aeronautical Technical Institute) commenced design work on what would subsequently become the Soko G-2 Galeb. The principal purpose for its development was to produce a domestic replacement for the American-built Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, which at the time was the most commonly used jet trainer aircraft in use by the Yugoslav Air Force; thus, the Galeb was to be capable of meeting the varied qualities and requirements involved in performing \"ab initio\", intermediate, and advanced instructional training missions. The Galeb was developed as a collaborative effort between Yugoslavia and the United Kingdom, and reportedly contributed significantly to the export value of the latter; a significant proportion of components and ancillary equipment, such as the powerplant, ejector seats, and navigational fittings amongst others, that were installed upon the aircraft had been sourced from or were directly produced by a range of British aerospace manufacturers. Sponsorship for the aircraft's development was provided by the British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Limited, whose Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engine was selected to power the type.\nDuring 1964, production of the Galeb commenced, making it the first indigenously-developed jet aircraft to enter mass production in Yugoslavia (the first jet-powered plane built by Yugoslavia was the Ikarus 451M in 1952, which did not enter production). A ground attack-orientated derivative of the Galeb, named the J-21 Jastreb, was also developed shortly thereafter; aside from the strengthening of the airframe, one distinct difference between the two aircraft was the deletion of the rear cockpit on the J-21 Jastreb, this location has instead been covered by a fairing and the internal space used to contain avionics and other aircraft equipment. Beyond domestic adoption with the Yugoslav Air force, the Galeb achieved export sales as well; the Libyan Air Force was a prolific operator of the type; by 2002, it reportedly possessed a total of 80 aircraft remaining in its inventory.\nDuring 1970, the neighbouring nations of Romania and Yugoslavia began discussions on the subject of jointly developing a new ground-attack orientated fighter aircraft. On 20 May 1971, the Romanian and Yugoslavian governments signed an agreement for the formation of \"YuRom\", a joint research and development venture between the two nations. According to aviation author John C. Fredriksen, the announcement was a logical extension of political policy, as the two nations' heads of state, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, had both historically sought to avoid overreliance upon the Soviet Union, preferring to build ties and cooperative projects with other friendly or neutral nations. Due to political sensitivities and a strong desire to avoid one nation upstaging the other, the aircraft featured two separate names; in Romania, it was known as the IAR-93 Vultur while in Yugoslavia it was referred to as the Soko J-22 Orao. Serial production of the J-22 was performed at SOKO's Mostar facility, production was brought to a halt in 1992, and the factory itself heavily damaged, by the series of events commonly referred to as the Yugoslav Wars. Various upgrade programmes for the J-22 were proposed during the 1990s; reportedly, such efforts would have been focused upon its avionics. However, such ambitions were heavily undermined by the dismantling of the Mostar factory during the Yugoslav Wars and the collapse of Romania's communist government.\nAnother programme begun during the 1970s would result in the development of the G-4 Super Galeb; it was designed as a replacement for Yugoslav Air Force's existing inventory of G-2 Galebs. According to aviation periodical Flight International, the Super Galeb showed unmistakable lineage from the earlier G-2, sharing the same British-sourced Rolls-Royce Viper turbojet engine, albeit uprated for greater performance. However, aviation historian Christopher Chant notes that: \"the Super Galeb bares no more relation to the G-2 Galeb than an identity of role, being an altogether more advanced aircraft. Beyond the domestic market, it also competed internationally against jet trainers such as the Italian Aermacchi MB-339, the Czechoslovakian Aero L-39 Albatros, and the Spanish CASA C-101; Flight International observes that, while the Super Galeb offered less performance that the Franco-German Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet, it was substantially cheaper to procure.\nDuring the mid-1980s, the Novi Avion programme was initiated with the aim of increasing Yugoslavia's political independence by becoming self-sufficient in the manufacture of military equipment; at that point, air superiority fighter jets were the only major element in which Yugoslavia was still reliant upon imports, having obtained the capability to manufacture all other military equipment. Thus, the Avion was intended to be used as a replacement for the Yugoslavian Air Force's fleet of around 120 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s. Development was a recognised priority programme for the Yugoslavian People's Army and was partly funded by the national government out of general research and development and modernisation funds, as well as being partly provided by industry. The Novi Avion was to be Yugoslavia's first supersonic aircraft, accordingly, the national industry lacked experience in the design and testing of such fighters and sought out external partners to provide assistance. Both France and French company Dassault Aviation's upcoming Rafale fighter bore a heavy influence on the design of the Avion.\nDuring the 1990s, Yugoslavia disintegrated into several different nations, which quickly resulted in the Avion programme being abandoned due to the financial resources necessary to start production of the fighter having become unavailable following the break-up of the country. Reportedly, work had been initially halted due to the lack of funding while further efforts were made to acquire foreign partnership arrangements. If the development had not been terminated, the first aircraft was scheduled to have conduct its maiden flight during 1992; the Avion was reportedly expected to enter squadron service at some point during the mid-2000s.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, SOKO was involved in various partnerships. In addition to working with Avioane Craiova to co-develop the J-22 Orao/IAR-93, Soko also cooperated with Sikorsky, Westland and A\u00e9rospatiale in producing various helicopters under license. Throughout the company's existence, its aircraft production activities were mainly destined to fulfill the needs of the Yugoslav Air Force, but exporting aircraft was also an option. J-1 Jastreb were exported to Libya and Zambia. G-2 Galeb was exported to Libya, Zaire and Zambia. Six Super Galebs were exported to Burma, while the start of the Yugoslav wars and the international sanctions halted the production and blocked outstanding orders for the G-4 Super Galeb to Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was Deputy National Security Advisor and National Security Advisor during the Reagan administration. He was convicted in April 1990 of multiple felonies as a result of his actions in the Iran\u2013Contra affair, but his convictions were reversed on appeal in 1991. During the George W. Bush administration, he served a brief stint as the director of the DARPA Information Awareness Office. He is the father of NASA astronaut and U.S. Navy Captain Alan G. Poindexter.\nEarly life and career.\nPoindexter was born in Odon, Indiana, the son of Marlan G. and Ellen (Sommers) Poindexter. He received his undergraduate degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1958, where he graduated first in a class of 899. His fellow graduates included astronaut Bruce McCandless II (who graduated second) and Senator John McCain; previous National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane was a contemporary, graduating the following year.\nPoindexter received an MS (1961) and PhD (1964) in nuclear physics from the California Institute of Technology. For his dissertation, he conducted laboratory research to further develop a model for understanding the M\u00f6ssbauer effect with Nobel Laureate Rudolf M\u00f6ssbauer.\nSenior naval career.\nWhile commander of Destroyer Squadron 31, Poindexter was surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare commander of battle groups in the Western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, and he developed new tactics and battle management procedures under the Composite Warfare Commander concept. As the commanding officer of , he pioneered the shipboard use of computers to manage the ship's force portion of yard overhauls. He was also an executive officer and a chief engineer of destroyers.\nAs deputy commander of the Naval Education and Training Command, he led the United States Navy's extensive education and training programs. He launched the development of a distributed data management system to better manage training pipelines.\nHis staff assignments included: executive assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations, administrative assistant to the Secretary of the Navy and special assistant for Systems Analysis to the Secretary of Defense. He reached the rank of vice admiral while serving as National Security Advisor, but was reverted to the rank of rear admiral in 1986 for his role in the Iran\u2013Contra affair. He retired at that rank in 1987.\nU.S. executive branch service.\nPoindexter served in the Reagan administration as military assistant to the National Security Advisor from 1981 to 1983. From 1983 to 1985, he served as Deputy National Security Advisor, leading the National Security Council's Crisis Pre-planning Group. From 1985 to 1986, he was National Security Advisor, providing recommendations to the President on national security, foreign policy and defense policy.\nHe played a significant role in the Strategic Defense Initiative, Operation Urgent Fury, the Achille Lauro hijacking incident, Operation El Dorado Canyon (in response to Libyan terrorist attacks), and the Reykjav\u00edk Summit with the Soviets.\nIran\u2013Contra affair.\nIn the Iran\u2013Contra affair, Poindexter and Oliver North sent aid to the Contras and money and weapons to Iran to secure the release of American hostages from Lebanon. This violated the Boland Amendment, which forbade the United States from directly or indirectly being involved with the Contras. Evidence revealed that Poindexter was a leader in the organization of the transfer of the weapons to Iran and oversaw other people involved in the affair, such as Oliver North.\nPoindexter and North communicated through a channel known as the \"Private Blank Check\" which Poindexter set up on a National Security Council (NSC) computer. Through this system, Poindexter and North were able to send messages called PROFS notes back and forth without being intercepted by other NSC staff members. This system was not successful. Even though both Poindexter and North attempted to delete the messages, the White House Communications Agency was able to recover some of them, later used in trying Poindexter and North in court. On November 25, 1986, after the public disclosure of the Iran\u2013Contra affair, Poindexter was forced to resign from his position as National Security Advisor.\nPoindexter was convicted on April 7, 1990, of five counts of lying to Congress and obstructing the Congressional committees investigating the Iran\u2013Contra affair, which were investigating the Reagan Administration's covert arms sales to Iran and the diversion of proceeds to insurgents fighting to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The convictions were reversed in 1991 on appeal on the grounds that several witnesses against him had been influenced by his testimony before Congress, even though Congress had given him immunity for that testimony.\nTo protest his involvement in the Iran-Contra Affair, Bill Breeden, a local minister and political activist, stole a street sign bearing Poindexter's name in his home town of Odon, Indiana. The sign was eventually returned but not before making national headlines and resulting in Breeden's arrest.\nDefense contractor work.\nFrom 1988 to 1989, Poindexter was senior scientist at Presearch, Inc., which had primarily been involved with defense studies and analysis. Faced with anticipated defense budget reductions, Poindexter joined the firm to develop new commercial enterprises. He designed and developed hardware and software for the prototype of a digital real-time imaging system to be used for physical security of high-value facilities. It was used to obtain a contract for a nuclear power plant security system.\nFrom 1990 to 1996, Poindexter was the chief designer and programmer for TP Systems, Inc., a software development firm that he co-founded to specialize in commercial software for the IBM PCs and compatibles. Development included a symbolic debugger for multi-tasking environments, a BBS communications program, and numerous utility programs.\nFrom 1993 to 1996, Poindexter served as a consultant to Elkins Group, a business alliance with Electronic Data Systems (EDS), that developed the Elkins Interactive Training Network (EITN), a satellite-based training delivery system. Poindexter was the chairman of the Maritime Advisory Committee and a member of Elkins' board of directors. He also provided advice on strategic planning.\nFrom 1996 to 2002, Poindexter served as senior vice president for SYNTEK Technologies, a small high-technology firm with contracts in domestic and international defense and commercial business. Poindexter gave high-level advice on management and directed information systems projects (for example, Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's Project Genoa).\nIn 2000, he joined the board of Saffron Technology, where he played a role building a tool to run entity analysis on Iraqi insurgent networks that planted IEDs.\nIn 2007, he joined the board of Bright Planet Corporation.\nAfter 2007, Poindexter worked to promote fraud-detecting Associative Memory Base technology to civilian government agencies such as the IRS.\nRecall to public service.\nLate in 2001, upon the recommendation of Science Applications International Corporation executive Brian Hicks, then-Vice President Dick Cheney recommended Admiral Poindexter to head a separate anti-terrorist office and serve under US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.\nInformation Awareness Office.\nFrom January 2002 to August 2003, Poindexter served as the Director of the DARPA Information Awareness Office (IAO). The mission of the IAO was to imagine, develop, apply, integrate, demonstrate and move information technologies, components, and prototype closed-loop information systems. This aimed to counter asymmetric threats (most notably, terrorist threats) by achieving total information awareness and thus aiding preemption, national security warning, and national security decision making.\nPolicy Analysis Market.\nPoindexter faced criticism from the media and some politicians about the Policy Analysis Market project, a theoretical prediction market that would have rewarded participants for accurately predicting geopolitical trends in the Middle East and elsewhere. This was portrayed in the media as allowing participants to profit from the assassination of heads of state and acts of terrorism due to such events being mentioned on illustrative sample screens showing the interface. The controversy over the proposed futures market led to a Congressional audit of the IAO in general. Funding for the IAO was subsequently cut and Poindexter retired from DARPA on August 12, 2003.\nFamily.\nHis wife, Linda Poindexter, was an Episcopal priest for 13 years, but retired from the clergy when she converted to Catholicism. They have five sons, including the late Alan G. Poindexter, a NASA astronaut, Space Shuttle pilot on the STS-122 mission to the International Space Station, and the commander of STS-131, Mark Alan (* 1963), Joseph Chester (* 1971) and Daniel John.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The phrase is used both for the impression device itself, which is kept by the United States secretary of state, and more generally for the impression it produces. The obverse of the Great Seal depicts the national coat of arms of the United States while the reverse features a truncated pyramid topped by an Eye of Providence. The year of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, 1776, is noted in Roman numerals at the base of the pyramid. The seal contains three Latin phrases: \"E Pluribus Unum\" (\"Out of many, one\"), \"Annuit c\u0153ptis\" (\"He has favored our undertakings\"), and \"Novus ordo seclorum\" (\"A new order of the ages\").\nLargely designed by Charles Thomson, then secretary of the Continental Congress, and William Barton, and first used in 1782, the seal is used to authenticate certain documents issued by the federal government of the United States. Since 1935, both sides of the Great Seal have appeared on the reverse of the one-dollar bill. The coat of arms is used on official documents\u2014including United States passports\u2014military insignia, embassy placards, and various flags. The seal of the president of the United States is directly based on the Great Seal, and its elements are used in numerous government agency and state seals.\nToday's official versions from the Department of State are largely unchanged from the 1885 designs. The current rendering of the reverse was made by Teagle &amp; Little of Norfolk, Virginia, in 1972. It is nearly identical to previous versions, which in turn were based on Lossing's 1856 version.\nObverse.\nThe obverse (or front) of the seal depicts the full achievement of the national coat of arms.\nBlazon.\nThe 1782 resolution of Congress adopting the arms, still in force, legally blazoned the shield as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Paleways of 13 pieces, argent and gules; a chief, azure.\nAs the designers recognized, this is a technically incorrect blazon under traditional English heraldic rules, since in English practice a vertically striped shield would be described as \"paly\", not \"paleways\", and it would not have had an odd number of stripes. A more technically proper blazon would have been \"argent, six pallets gules ...\" (six red stripes on a white field), but the phrase used was chosen to preserve the reference to the 13 original states.\nThe escutcheon (shield) bears resemblance to the United States flag, with two exceptions in particular:\nThe supporter of the shield is a bald eagle with its wings outstretched (or \"displayed\", in heraldic terms). From the eagle's perspective, it holds a bundle of 13 arrows in its left talon, and an olive branch in its right talon. Although not specified by law, the olive branch is usually depicted with 13 leaves and 13 olives. In its beak, the eagle clutches a scroll with the motto \"E pluribus unum\" (\"Out of Many, One\"). Over its head there appears a glory with 13 mullets (stars) on a blue field.\nStated symbolism.\nThe recurring number 13 refers to the 13 original states. The arrows and olive branch together symbolize that the United States has \"a strong desire for peace, but will always be ready for war\" (see Olive Branch Petition). E Pluribus Unum contains 13 letters.\nThe eagle has its head turned towards the olive branch, on its right side, to symbolize a preference for peace.\nThe primary official explanation of the symbolism of the great seal was given by Charles Thomson upon presenting the final design for adoption by Congress. He wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThomson took the symbolism for the colors from \"Elements of Heraldry\", by Antoine Pyron du Martre, which William Barton had lent him. That book said that argent (white) \"signifies Purity, Innocence, Beauty, and Genteelness\", gules (red) \"denotes martial Prowess, Boldness, and Hardiness\", and azure (blue) \"signifies Justice, Perseverance, and Vigilance\".\nA brief and official explanation of the symbolism was much later published in the form of a historical sketch, or pamphlet, entitled: \"The Seal of the United States: How it was Developed and Adopted\". It was written by Gaillard Hunt in 1892 under the direction of then Secretary of State James G. Blaine. When the copyright on the pamphlet expired, Hunt expounded upon its information in more detail in a 1909 book entitled\" The History of the Seal of the United States.\" This work was largely based on a two-volume work written in 1897 by Charles A. L. Totten titled \"Our Inheritance in the Great Seal of Manasseh, the United States of America: Its History and Heraldry; and Its Signification unto the 'Great People' thus Sealed.\" Hunt's 1909 account details: how the seal was chosen; sketches of other suggestions which were made but not chosen, such as Franklin's suggested motto (\"Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God\"); iterations and changes made to the seal; information on the illegal seal; and the symbology of the seal (such as that provided by Charles Thomson).\nDepictions.\nThe colors (\"tinctures\") of the coat of arms are either reproduced directly, or represented monochromatically by means of heraldic hatching. The latter applies when the seal is affixed to paper.\nOfficial die designs.\nIn the Department of State, the term \"Great Seal\" refers to a physical mechanism which is used by the department to affix the seal to official government documents. This mechanism includes not only the die (metal engraved with a raised inverse image of the seal), but also the counterdie (also known as a counter-seal), the press, and cabinet in which it is housed. There have been several presses used since the seal was introduced, but none of the mechanisms used from 1782 through 1904 have survived. The seal and its press were saved when Washington, D.C. was burned in 1814, though no one knows who rescued the pieces.\nThe press in use today was made in 1903 by R. Hoe &amp; Co's chief cabinetmaker Frederick S. Betchley in conjunction with the 1904 die, with the cabinet being made of mahogany. It is marked with the contracted completion date of June 15, 1903, but delays and reworking pushed final delivery into early 1904. From 1945 to 1955, the Great Seal changed quarters almost once a year. In 1955, the seal was put on public display for the first time in a central location in the department's main building. In 1961 the Seal became the focus of the new Department Exhibit Hall, where it resides today in a glass enclosure. The enclosure remains locked at all times, even during the sealing of a document.\nThe seal can only be affixed by an officer of the Department of State, under the authority of the secretary of state. To seal a document, first a blank paper wafer is glued onto its front in a space provided for it. The document is then placed between the die and counterdie, with the wafer lined up between them. Holding the document with one hand, the weighted arm of the press is pulled with the other, driving the die down onto the wafer, impressing the seal in relief. When envelopes containing letters need to be sealed, the wafer is imprinted first and then glued to the sealed envelope. It is used approximately 2,000 to 3,000 times a year.\nDocuments which require the seal include treaty ratifications, international agreements, appointments of ambassadors and civil officers, and communications from the President to heads of foreign governments. The seal was once required on presidential proclamations, and on some now-obsolete documents such as exequaturs and Mediterranean passports.\nThe metallic die of the obverse side of the Great Seal is what actually embosses the design onto documents. These dies eventually wear down, requiring replacements to be made. The current die is the seventh engraving of the seal, and the actual design on the dies has evolved over time.\nReverse.\nThe 1782 resolution adopting the seal blazons the image on the reverse as \"A pyramid unfinished. In the zenith an eye in a triangle, surrounded by a glory, proper.\" The pyramid is conventionally shown as consisting of 13 courses to refer to the thirteen original states. The adopting resolution provides that it is inscribed on its base with the date (1776, the year of the United States Declaration of Independence) in Roman numerals. Where the top of the pyramid should be, the Eye of Providence watches over it. Two mottos appear: \"Annuit c\u0153ptis\" signifies that Providence has \"approved of (our) undertakings.\" \"Novus ordo seclorum\", freely taken from Virgil, is Latin for \"a new order of the ages.\" The reverse has never been cut (as a seal) but appears, for example, on the back of the one-dollar bill.\nThe primary official explanation of the symbolism of the great seal was given by Charles Thomson upon presenting the final design for adoption by Congress. About the elements on the seal's reverse, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nConspiracy theories.\nSome conspiracy theories state that the Great Seal shows a sinister influence by Freemasonry in the founding of the United States. Such theories usually claim that the Eye of Providence (found, in the Seal, above the pyramid) is a common Masonic emblem, and that the Great Seal was created by Freemasons. These claims, however, misstate the facts.\nWhile the Eye of Providence is today a common Masonic motif, this was not the case during the 1770s and 1780s, when the Great Seal was designed and approved. According to David Barrett, a Masonic researcher, the Eye seems to have been used only sporadically by the Masons in those decades, and was not adopted as a common Masonic symbol until 1797, several years after the Great Seal of the United States had already been designed. The Eye of Providence was, on the other hand, a fairly common Christian motif throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and was commonly used as such in Europe as well as America throughout the 18th century. It is still found in Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant churches, and it symbolizes the Holy Trinity (the triangle) and God's omniscience (the eye) surrounded by rays of glory, denoting God's divinity.\nFurthermore, contrary to the claims of these conspiracy theories, the Great Seal was not created by Freemasons. While Benjamin Franklin was a Mason, he was the only member of any of the various Great Seal committees definitively known to be so, and his ideas were not adopted. Of the four men whose ideas were adopted, neither Charles Thomson, Pierre du Simiti\u00e8re nor William Barton was a Mason and, while Francis Hopkinson has been alleged to have had Masonic connections, there is no firm evidence to support the claim.\nOrigin.\nOn July 4, 1776, the same day that independence from Great Britain was declared by the thirteen colonies, the Continental Congress named the first committee to design a Great Seal, or national emblem, for the country. Similar to other nations, the United States needed an official symbol of sovereignty to formalize and seal (or sign) international treaties and transactions. It took six years, three committees, and the contributions of fourteen men before the Congress finally accepted a design (which included elements proposed by each of the three committees) in 1782.\nFirst committee.\nThe first committee consisted of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams. While they were three of the five primary authors of the Declaration of Independence, they had little experience in heraldry and sought the help of Pierre Eugene du Simitiere, an artist living in Philadelphia who would later also design the state seals of Delaware and New Jersey and start a museum of the Revolutionary War. Each of these men proposed a design for the seal.\nFranklin chose an allegorical scene from Exodus, described in his notes as \"Moses standing on the Shore, and extending his Hand over the Sea, thereby causing the same to overwhelm Pharaoh who is sitting in an open Chariot, a Crown on his Head and a Sword in his Hand. Rays from a Pillar of Fire in the Clouds reaching to Moses, to express that he acts by Command of the Deity.\" Motto, \"Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.\"\nJefferson suggested a depiction of the Children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night for the front of the seal; and Hengest and Horsa, the two brothers who were the legendary leaders of the first Anglo-Saxon settlers in Britain, for the reverse side of the seal. Adams chose a painting known as the \"Judgment of Hercules\" where the young Hercules must choose to travel either on the flowery path of self-indulgence or the rugged, more difficult, uphill path of duty to others and honor to himself.\nIn August 1776, du Simiti\u00e8re showed his design, which was more along conventional heraldic lines. The shield had six sections, each representing \"the Countries from which these States have been peopled\" (using the symbols for England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, and Holland), surrounded by the initials of all thirteen states. The supporters were a female figure representing Liberty holding an anchor of hope and a spear with a cap, and on the other side an American soldier holding a rifle and tomahawk. The crest was the \"Eye of Providence in a radiant Triangle whose Glory extends over the Shield and beyond the Figures\", and the motto \"E Pluribus Unum\" (Out of Many, One) in a scroll at the bottom.\nOn August 20, 1776, the committee presented their report to Congress. The committee members chose du Simiti\u00e8re's design, though it was changed to remove the anchor of hope and replace the soldier with Lady Justice holding a sword and a balance. Surrounding the main elements was the inscription \"Seal of the United States of America MDCCLXXVI\". For the reverse, Franklin's design of Moses parting the Red Sea was used. Congress was however not impressed, and on the same day ordered that the report \"lie on the table\", ending the work of the committee.\nWhile the designs in their entirety were not used, the \"E Pluribus Unum\" motto was chosen for the final seal, and the reverse used the Roman numeral for 1776 and the Eye of Providence. Jefferson also liked Franklin's motto so much, he ended up using it on his personal seal.\nThe motto was almost certainly taken from the title page of \"Gentleman's Magazine\", a monthly magazine published in London which had used it from its first edition in 1731, and was well known in the colonies. The motto alluded to the magazine being a collection of articles obtained from other newspapers, and was used in most of its editions until 1833. The motto was taken in turn from \"Gentleman's Journal\", a similar magazine which ran briefly from 1692 to 1694. While variants turn up in other places (for example a poem often ascribed to Virgil called \"Moretum\" contains the phrase \"E Pluribus Unus\"), this is the oldest known use of the exact phrase. Another source was some of the Continental currency issued earlier in 1776; these were designed by Franklin and featured the motto \"We Are One\" surrounded by thirteen rings, each with the name of a colony. This design is echoed in the seal submitted by the first committee, and the motto was quite possibly a Latin version of this concept.\nThe Eye of Providence had been a well-known classical symbol of the deity since at least the Renaissance, which du Simitiere was familiar with.\nSecond committee.\nFor three and a half years no further action was taken, during which time the Continental Congress was forced out of Philadelphia before returning in 1778. On March 25, 1780, a second committee to design a great seal was formed, which consisted of James Lovell, John Morin Scott, and William Churchill Houston. Like the first committee, they sought the help of someone more experienced in heraldry, this time Francis Hopkinson, who did most of the work.\nHopkinson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, designed the American flag, and also helped design state and other government seals. He made two similar proposals, each having an obverse and reverse side, with themes of war and peace.\nHopkinson's first design had a shield with thirteen diagonal red and white stripes, supported on one side by a figure bearing an olive branch and representing peace, and on the other an Indian warrior holding a bow and arrow, and holding a quiver. The crest was a radiant constellation of thirteen stars. The motto was \"Bello vel pace paratus\", meaning \"prepared in war or in peace\". The reverse, in Hopkinson's words, was \"Liberty is seated in a chair holding an olive branch and her staff is topped by a Liberty cap. The motto 'Virtute perennis' means 'Everlasting because of virtue.' The date in Roman numerals is 1776.\"\nIn his second proposal, the Indian warrior was replaced by a soldier holding a sword, and the motto was shortened to \"Bello vel paci\", meaning \"For war or for peace\".\nThe committee chose the second version, and reported back to Congress on May 10, 1780, six weeks after being formed. Their final blazon, printed in Congress journals on May 17, was: \"The Shield charged on the Field Azure with 13 diagonal stripes alternate rouge and argent. Supporters; dexter, a Warriour holding a Sword; sinister, a Figure representing Peace bearing an Olive Branch. The Crest; a radiant Constellation of 13 Stars. The motto, Bella vel Paci.\" Once again, Congress did not find the result acceptable. They referred the matter back to the committee, which did no further work on the matter.\nAs with the first design, several elements were eventually used in the final seal; the thirteen stripes on the shield with their colors, the constellation of stars surrounded by clouds, the olive branch, and the arrows (from Hopkinson's first proposal). Hopkinson had previously used the constellation and clouds on a $40 Continental currency note he designed in 1778. The same note also used an Eye of Providence, taken from the first committee's design.\nThe shield of the Great Seal has seven white stripes and six red ones\u2014essentially, a white background with six red stripes. Hopkinson incorporated this stripe arrangement into the Great Seal from the Flag of the United States that he had designed. Hopkinson also designed a seal for the Admiralty (Navy), which incorporated a chevron consisting of seven red stripes and six white ones. The seven red stripes in his Admiralty seal reflected the number of red stripes in his Naval flag. When Hopkinson designed these flags, he was running the Navy as chairman of the Continental Navy Board.\nThird committee.\nAfter two more years, Congress formed a third committee on May 4, 1782, this time consisting of John Rutledge, Arthur Middleton, and Elias Boudinot. Arthur Lee replaced Rutledge, although he was not officially appointed. As with the previous two committees, most of the work was delegated to a heraldic expert, this time 28-year-old William Barton.\nBarton drew a design very quickly, using a rooster on the crest, but it was much too complex. No drawing of this design seems to have survived.\nBarton then came up with another design, which the committee submitted back to Congress on May 9, 1782, just five days after being formed. This time, the figures on each side of the shield were the \"Genius of the American Confederated Republic\" represented by a maiden, and on the other side an American warrior. At the top is an eagle and on the pillar in the shield is a \"Phoenix in Flames\". The mottos were \"In Vindiciam Libertatis\" (In Defense of Liberty) and \"Virtus sola invicta\" (Only virtue unconquered).\nFor the reverse, Barton used a pyramid of thirteen steps, with the radiant Eye of Providence overhead, and used the mottos \"Deo Favente\" (\"With God favoring\") and \"Perennis\" (Everlasting). The pyramid had come from another Continental currency note designed in 1778 by Hopkinson, this time the $50 note, which had a nearly identical pyramid and the motto \"Perennis\". Barton had at first specified \"on the Summit of it a Palm Tree, proper\", with the explanation that \"The Palm Tree, when burnt down to the very Root, naturally rises fairer than ever,\" but later crossed it out and replaced it with the Eye of Providence, taken from the first committee's design.\nCongress again took no action on the submitted design.\nFinal design.\nOn June 13, 1782, the Congress turned to its Secretary Charles Thomson, and provided all material submitted by the first three committees. Thomson was 53 years old, and had been a Latin master at a Philadelphia academy. Thomson took elements from all three previous committees, coming up with a new design which provided the basis for the final seal.\nThomson used the eagle\u2014this time specifying an American bald eagle\u2014as the sole supporter on the shield. The shield had thirteen stripes, this time in a chevron pattern, and the eagle's claws held an olive branch and a bundle of thirteen arrows. For the crest, he used Hopkinson's constellation of thirteen stars. The motto was \"E Pluribus Unum\", taken from the first committee, and was on a scroll held in the eagle's beak.\nAn eagle holding symbols of war and peace has a long history, and also echoed the second committee's themes. Franklin owned a 1702 emblem book, which included an eagle with olive branch and arrows near its talons, which may have been a source for Thomson. The arrows also mirror those in the arms of the Dutch Republic, the only country in Europe with a representative government at the time, which depicted a lion holding seven arrows representing their seven provinces. State currency may have provided further inspiration; a 1775 South Carolina bill showed a bundle of 13 arrows and a 1775 Maryland note depicted a hand with an olive branch of 13 leaves. Finally, it has been suggested that the bundle of arrows is a reference to the symbol of the bundle of five arrows in the Iroquois Great Law of Peace, which represents strength in unity, as one arrow can be broken easily while a bundle of them cannot.\nFor the reverse, Thomson essentially kept Barton's design, but re-added the triangle around the Eye of Providence and changed the mottos to \"Annuit C\u0153ptis\" and \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\". Thomson sent his designs back to Barton, who made some final alterations. The stripes on the shield were changed again, this time to \"palewise\" (vertical), and the eagle's wing position was changed to \"displayed\" (wingtips up) instead of \"rising\". Barton also wrote a more properly heraldic blazon.\nThe design was submitted to Congress on June 20, 1782, and was accepted the same day. Thomson included a page of explanatory notes, but no drawing was submitted. This remains the official definition of the Great Seal today.\nThe first brass die was cut sometime between June and September, and placed in the State House in Philadelphia. It was first used by Thomson on September 16, 1782, to verify signatures on a document which authorized George Washington to negotiate an exchange of prisoners.\nCharles Thomson, as the secretary of Congress, remained the keeper of the seal until the federal government was formed in 1789. On July 24, 1789, President Washington asked Thomson to deliver the seal to the Department of Foreign Affairs in the person of Roger Alden, who kept it until the Department of State was created. All subsequent secretaries of state have been responsible for applying the seal to diplomatic documents.\nOn September 15, 1789, the United States Congress ordered \"that the seal heretofore used by the United States in Congress assembled, shall be, and hereby is declared to be, the seal of the United States.\"\nNotable depictions.\nThe Great Seal very quickly became a popular symbol of the country. It inspired both the flag of North Dakota and that of the US Virgin Islands (adopted in 1911 and 1921, respectively). Combined with the heraldic tradition of artistic freedom so long as the particulars of the blazon are followed, a wide variety of official and unofficial emblazonments appeared, especially in the first hundred years. This is evident even in the different versions of the seal die. The quality of the 1885 design, coupled with a spirit of bureaucratic standardization that characterized that era, has driven most of these out of official use. \nThe Great Seal symbol (or a close variant) has been used by former presidents after leaving office. In February 2021, the Seal continued to feature in the logo of the Office of Barack and Michelle Obama, and the logo of the Office of George W. Bush.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65509", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65509", "title": "Neve Shalom", "text": "Village in Israel\nNeve Shalom (), also known as Wahat as-Salam () is a cooperative village in Israel, jointly founded by Israeli Jews and Arabs in an attempt to show that the two peoples can live side by side peacefully, as well as to conduct educational work for peace, equality and understanding between the two peoples. The village is located on one of the two Latrun hilltops overlooking the Ayalon Valley, and lies midway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Falling under the jurisdiction of Mateh Yehuda Regional Council, in 2023 it had a population of 313.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Neve Shalom\" is taken from a passage in the Isaiah 32:18: \"My people shall dwell in an oasis of peace\".\nThe village was the brainchild of Father Bruno Hussar. Born in Egypt the son of non-practicing Jews, he converted to Christianity while studying engineering in France. Witnessing at first hand the vitriolic antisemitism of wartime France sharpened his awareness of his Jewish roots. He joined the Dominican Order, was ordained into the priesthood in 1950, and sent to Jerusalem to establish a centre for Jewish studies in 1953, where he obtained Israeli citizenship in 1966. In 1970, in order to promote ecumenical interfaith dialogue, he obtained forty hectares (120 acres) of terrain classified as no man's land in the Latrun salient, at a 'peppercorn rent' of 3 pence a year on a 100-year lease from the local Trappist abbey. The area was desolate, treeless, unwatered and covered with brambles, and had not been under cultivation since the Byzantine period. At the outset foreigners came to share the experience with him, but few remained beyond one or two months, save for Anne LeMeignon who settled in a hut and stayed on.\nHussar's project envisaged the creation of a sociocultural framework that would enable residents to live on terms of equality and mutual respect while conserving the distinct cultural heritage, language and sense of identity each individual brought to the community from the complex mosaic of Palestine's historic communities. At the same time, it would be designed to function as a school of peace where people from all over the country could learn to listen to each other.\nIn Hussar's own words:\n\"We had in mind a small village composed of inhabitants from different communities in the country. Jews, Christians and Muslims would live there in peace, each one faithful to his own faith and traditions, while respecting those of others. Each would find in this diversity a source of personal enrichment.\".\nConditions were harsh, and at first Hussar lived in a bus on the site. Even basic facilities like a bathroom were lacking, and showers could be taken only by driving once a week the to kibbutz Nachshon. The first five families, four Jewish and one Palestinian settled there in 1978, dwelling in tents. Among the early members (from November 1980) was Major Wellesley Aron, grandfather of the Israeli singer David Broza. Says David Broza: \"The group of people that my grandfather joined saw the place as an opportunity to expand on the idea of finding peace within yourself as a prelude to bringing peace to the community and the region\". The School for Peace was established in 1978. The founding families came mainly from a secular background. The Neve Shalom-Wahat as-Salam model earned both the 1989 Beyond War Award, and a Giraffe Heroes Award, and inspired the 1992 birth of the sustained Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue Group in the United States.\nFor years it survived as an orphan community devoid of official assistance. In 1994, after lobbying by foreign supporters and the American diplomat Samuel W. Lewis, the Israeli government had a change of heart and began to provide subsidies, and extended legal status to the village as a municipality. As a result, it earned autonomous zoning rights. The \"School of Peace\" closed down in a month-long strike, in protest and mourning, at the outbreak of the Al Aqsa Intifada in 2000, and made efforts to provide welfare for Palestinians as the violence spread.\nWhile assimilation is not promoted, intermarriage is not disapproved of, though instances are rare. The preference is for each community to maintain its distinct identity. The forging of a convivial bicultural identity has not erased difficulties. Even in schooling, Grace Feuerverger's account documents, achingly painful tensions do arise in relationships as children, teachers and families interact. One resident stated the issue in the following terms:\nThe Neve Shalom/Wahat Al-Salam experience \"humanizes\" the conflict. It is called an oasis, but only as compared to other areas in the country. The village has many difficulties but at least we are not being broken. We do have personal squabbles as in any village, but we are living the conflict instead of fighting it.\nTo mark the advent of the new millennium, towards the end of the 1990s the Trappist monastery decided to hand over half the land, some , to Neve Shalom/Wahat as-Salam as an outright gift to its residents.\nIn May 2010, a sign was posted outside the village decrying the deaths of human rights activists during the Gaza flotilla raid. The wording of the sign originally described the deaths as \"murder\" but was subsequently changed to \"killing\" to better reflect the village consensus. The following month \"Arutz Sheva\" reported that a rift had broken out between Jews and Arabs over this issue and threats had been made to expel the Jewish residents. On its website, the community wrote that the initiative was undertaken and authorized democratically by both Jewish and Palestinian members of the village. In July of the same year, the community organized a joint Jewish-Palestinian conference on human rights which was attended by speakers ranging from Gideon Levy to Neve Gordon and Ziv Hadas, Executive Director for Physicians for Human Rights.\nIn a price tag attack in 2012, the tires of 14 vehicles were punctured and some of the vehicles were painted with anti-Palestinian graffiti.\u201d \nCommunity cohesion in the village has struggled after the October 7th attacks by Hamas and Israel's subsequent war against Gaza. Historically, about half of Neve Shalom's Jewish residents have served in the Israel Defense Forces, while another half have resisted the draft. To the community's knowledge, no Palestinian resident of the village has served in the IDF. Palestinian citizens of Israel are not obligated to serve, though they may if they volunteer. There are rumors that more of Neve Shalom's Jews have signed up to serve additional periods in the IDF after October 7th, and according to Jewish and Palestinian residents alike, the village is mostly silent on the topic of the war.\nDemographics.\nThe village is home (as of 2010) to some sixty families. By principle, half of the inhabitants are Jews, the rest are Muslim and Christian Israeli Arabs. Another 300 Jewish and Arab families remain on the waiting list for settlement in the community. A recently approved expansion plan will permit the village to grow in coming years by another 92 housing lots. Since its founding, the village has had a regular rotation of international volunteers brought in to provide basic support functions at its various facilities.\nAdministrative structure.\nThe community is run by a steering committee or secretariat which, like its subcommittees, is elected by an annual democratic vote. The head of the secretariat effectively serves as the mayor of the village. In addition there are several internal committees to run the various activities of the village. A numerical balance is consistently observed between Jewish and Arab representatives. Rotation however is not observed, and since 1995 the village administrator has always been an Arab. Jewish classes in the village school each have both a Jewish and an Arab teacher, but this does not extend to the curriculum, where maths, for example, is taught to children in their respective native languages. When matters of principle are on the agenda, a plenum, made up of all full members of the village, is constituted to deliberate, and its final decisions are binding on everyone. Since the adult Jewish residents are not equally fluent in Arabic, the minutes of official deliberations are taken down in Hebrew and workshops are conducted in Hebrew to account for what Rabah Halabi describes as a large gap between \"proclaimed policy and the actual situation,\" and Feuerverger, using the theories of Paolo Freire, illustrates that language issues refract problems of power.\nEducation.\nAccording to Grace Feuerverger, Neve Shalom/Wahat as-Salam's emancipatory education 'has become a global role model of intercultural harmony, of teaching and learning to live together in peace.'\nThere are three educational institutions in the village;\nEconomy and culture.\nThe village also has a small guest house, offering programs aimed at acquainting local or foreign groups with the village and its cultural context. On June 22, 2006, Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters played a live concert at the village, attracting over 50,000 fans.\nThe Neve Shalom project has drawn a wide range of evaluations: some hail its exemplary function as a regional model for co-existence, while others dismiss the experiment. In the Middle East Quarterly in 1998, Joseph Montville took it as 'encouraging evidence of a genuine, grass-roots peace process.' Documenting its extensive work in networking to teach and train students from schools and universities on both sides of the border, he cited it as an effective part of two-track diplomacy, while noting that both religious and secular extremists from both sides prefer no contact with the \"other\", and other Israelis, while not dismissive, regard it as a na\u00efve, impractical fantasy. Edward Alexander, in reply, dismissed Montville's positive assessment. Building bridges between Jews and Arabs for mutual understanding ignores the fact, he argues, that both are fully cognizant of each other, with Arabs denying Jewish sovereignty while Jews refuse to renounce it. Neve Shalom can only exist if Jews suppress their Zionism in an act of self-abasement similar to that of the 'trembling ghetto Jew', while Arabs observe the deference gleefully. Montville's evidence shows a case where a Jewish boy absorbed guilt in an act of 'prodigious sympathy' while his Palestinian counterpart exuded rage. What is forgotten, he concluded, is that 'it was not the Israeli occupation that led to Arab hatred, but Arab hatred and aggression that led to that occupation.' Ahmad Yusuf, director of a U.S.-based Islamist think tank, emphasizes the limits of dialogue concerning reciprocal negative stereotypes. One weeps at Neve Shalom, he notes. Addressing security concerns through techniques of crisis resolution and social psychology, however, is not sufficient. Real success, in Palestinian terms, would consist of problem-solving focused not only on security, but also justice and equality. Optimally this requires a federal binational state. Yusuf concluded with the citation of an Arab proverb. In it a boy notices a butcher weeping as he slaughters a lamb. His father tells him to focus not on the tears, but the knife in his hand.\nH. Svi Shapiro assesses Neve Shalom's aspirations to provide a civic achievement of citizens enjoying equal status and rights, and concludes that \"Neve Shalom/Wahat Al-Salam provides no definitive solution to this conundrum. It does allow us, however, to see how one group of courageous, idealistic, and thoughtful individuals is struggling to mediate the tensions inherent in this situation.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its member teams were not associated with any Major League Baseball teams. It operated from 1995 to 2002.\nThe league was founded in 1994 by Portland, Oregon businessman Bruce L. Engel. He had promoted an independent league with a team in Portland since at least 1989. He had also tried to buy the Seattle Mariners in 1987. \nThe league began play in 1995, with the following teams:\nNorthern Division:\nSouthern Division:\nLong Beach won the inaugural league championship, defeating Tri-City, 3 games to 1. However, the team had to drop its \"Barracuda\" nickname, re-named \"The Franchise\" after the team's former president stripped the team of its name.\nIn 1996, Surrey folded, then the Reno Chukars were added. Long Beach, re-named the Riptide, won its second consecutive title, again 3 games to 1 over Tri-City.\nIn 1997, the league added the Chico Heat, while Palm Springs took the year off and Long Beach became the Mission Viejo Vigilantes. Chico won the league championship in its first season in the league, defeating Reno, 3\u20132.\nIn 1998, Salinas disbanded, while dormant Palm Springs moved to Oxnard, California and became the Pacific Suns. Grays Harbor suspended operations halfway through the season, and the league took over management of the team, which continued as the Western Warriors and went on an extended 68-game road trip with no home stadium. Despite the lack of a home stadium, the Warriors made it to the league championship series before being swept by Sonoma County, 3\u20130.\nIn 1999, the league disbanded the Western Warriors, while Mission Viejo, Bend, and Pacific also folded. The Sacramento Steelheads and Zion Pioneerzz were added, making the WBL a six-team league. Tri-City won the league championship for the year, 3 games to 1 over Chico.\nFor the 2000 season, Reno called it quits after four years in the league, while Sacramento moved to Vacaville, California and became the Solano Steelheads. The WBL was back at eight teams, however, as the Yuma (AZ) Bullfrogs, Feather River (Marysville, CA) Mudcats and Valley (Scottsdale, AZ) Vipers were added. The Zion Pioneerzz won the league championship, defeating Chico 3 games to 1.\nFor the 2001 season, Valley and Feather River folded, while league stalwart Tri-City defected to the Northwest League. The league returned to a market it previously served, adding the Long Beach Breakers to bring the loop back to six teams. The Zion Pioneerzz were renamed the St. George Pioneerzz. The expansion Breakers won the league championship, defeating Chico 3 games to 2.\nIn its final year of 2002, the Western Baseball League again operated with six teams. St. George folded, while Marysville, Calif., re-entered the league to take the Pioneerzz' place, playing the season as the Yuba-Sutter Gold Sox. The Chico Heat won the league championship in the league's final season, defeating Long Beach 3 games to 1.\nAfter the league folded, the western United States were without independent baseball until 2005, when former WBL cities Chico, Long Beach, and Yuma were awarded franchises in the upstart Golden Baseball League. Three of the 8 current GBL cities are former Western League markets, as Reno was added to the circuit in 2006, while St. George became a member of the league in 2007.\nOn September 9, 2014, it was reported that former WBL team, the Grays Harbor Gulls, would be reborn as a member of the new Mount Rainier Professional Baseball League in 2015 and would play their home games at Olympic Stadium once again. It is also mentioned that the \"new\" Gulls will have no ties to the original team. The Gulls and the MRPBL folded halfway through the inaugural season in 2015 due to financial problems.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first was a professional independent team operating in the Western Baseball League from 1997 to 2002, and the second team was an independent team operating as part of the summer collegiate wood bat league known as the Great West League, which began operations in 2014 and ceased operations in 2018. The team's title sponsor was Golden Valley Bank. Both teams were majority owned by Steve and Kathy Nettleton.\nHistory.\nThe original Chico Heat (1997\u20132002).\nThe team started as a professional independent baseball team operating in Chico, California, in the Western Baseball League. They had no operating agreement with any Major League Baseball team. They were founded on July 29, 1996, by Chico Heat Professional Baseball LLC, with former supermarket entrepreneur Steve Nettleton and his wife Kathy serving as principal owners. General managers included Bob Linscheid (who would go on to become president of the WBL) and Jeff Kragel (now at Chico State University) and their mascot was the \"Heater The Dragon\" (not to be confused with the Bakersfield Blaze or Dayton Dragons mascots of the same name). The team began operations in 1997. The team immediately won the league championship in their inaugural season and, although they did not win a championship in the four subsequent years, they won the most regular season games in each of the following seasons. They appeared in the championship series in five out of their six seasons in the league. In 2002, Chico won its second league championship in the league's and the team's final season. After leaving the financially troubled league and after efforts to join Minor League Baseball's Class A-Advanced California League by trying to lure the Visalia Oaks to Chico failed, the Heat ceased operations effective immediately. \nThe team played at Nettleton Stadium, which is located on the campus of California State University, Chico. They were preceded by the Oroville/Chico Red Sox of the minor league's Class-C Far West League from 1948 to 1949 and were succeeded by the Chico Outlaws of the independent Golden Baseball League, taking their place in 2005. The Heat has been the most successful professional baseball franchise in the city's history.\nOn August 11, 2007, former Heat majority owner Steve Nettleton and former Heat players were honored as part of a celebration called \"Remember The Heat Night\" hosted by the Chico Outlaws as they faced the St. George RoadRunners. The original Heat mascot \"Heater\" even made an appearance. The Outlaws won the ball game in front of over 3,500 fans at Nettleton Stadium.\nThe Chico Heat of the GWL (2014\u20132018).\nOn November 25, 2014, the franchise announced its return to the field in the summer of 2016, but this time as a member of the summer collegiate wood bat league known as the Great West League. Steve Nettleton will return as a principal owner along with former Major League Baseball executive and Chico native Pat Gillick. The Heat's beloved mascot \"Heater The Dragon\" returned to the team after a 20-year absence. They began play on the road in a loss to the rival Marysville Gold Sox. The Heat defeated the Medford Rogues 2 games to 1 to capture the inaugural GWL Championship. It is the second time in franchise history that they won a championship in their first season.\nOn July 24, the Heat hosted the second annual GWL All-Star Game. This year, the entire Heat team faced the best of the Great West League, a departure from the normal format. The home run derby will also take place the same day. The Heat faced the Rogues for the second straight season in the GWL Championship, this time falling to their rivals 2 games to 0. In 2018, the Heat would return to the GWL Championship, this time against the Lincoln Potters. They downed the Potters 2 games to 0 to win their second and final championship.\nOn October 4, 2018, the Heat GWL team announced that they were suspending operations as a result of the Great West League itself suspending operations. \nBroadcasting.\nThe original Chico Heat were broadcast on KPAY NewsTalk 1290 AM throughout their entire run with longtime area broadcaster Rory Miller on the call. The current Heat welcomed Miller back to the air waves on The Edge 101.7 FM sharing broadcast duties with KPAY's Mike Baca, with broadcast engineers Mike Vislosky and Ryan Mouser.\nThe death of Steve Nettleton.\nOn January 11, 2019, Heat founder and majority owner Steve Nettleton died at age 79 following a long battle with Parkinson's Disease.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were a member of the independent Western Baseball League, and were not affiliated with any Major League Baseball team.\nThe team was one of the founding members of the league, beginning play in 1995. They won the WBL championship in 1998. The team folded with the league after the 2002 season; they were the only team to participate in all eight seasons of the WBL. At one point, former San Francisco Giants outfielder Kevin Mitchell managed the Crushers.\nThe team played in Rohnert Park Stadium, which was built in 1981 for the California League's now-defunct Redwood Pioneers. The stadium was demolished in 2005, three years after the Crushers' final season. \nThe Crushers embraced the local wine industry in multiple ways. The stadium's home run fence included a wall in left field, covered in local wine advertisements, which was called the \"Wine Sign\" or the \"Grape Monster\" (a play on Fenway Park's Green Monster). The team also sold wine bottles at the stadium, autographed by the players. The team mascot was Crusher, the \"Abominable Sonoman\", with large purple feet for stomping grapes, in reference to the surrounding Wine Country region.\nLike many independent minor league teams, the Crushers relied on a mix of young players hoping to get recognized by pro teams and older players sticking around after playing in higher leagues. Cuban defectors joined the Crushers to showcase their skills. The most notable professional baseball player to develop with the Crushers is Chad Zerbe, who pitched for the San Francisco Giants from 2000\u20132003, including three appearances and a win in the 2002 World Series against the Anaheim Angels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They played their home games at Bryant Field, adjacent to Ellis Lake, in Marysville from 2002 to 2022. The team name was changed to the Marysville Gold Sox in 2010 to more particularly identify the city in which the team was located, but had since reverted to \"Yuba-Sutter\".\nThe Gold Sox name was chosen in honor of Yuba-Sutter (two adjoining counties separated by a river with the towns of Marysville and Yuba City on each side), having been called the \"Gateway to the Gold Fields\" during the California gold rush of the mid-1800s. The Gold Sox mascot is Mr. G, a gecko-like creature that is a favorite with children.\nThe Gold Sox ceased operations and were replaced by the Marysville Drakes of the Pecos League.\nTeam history.\nProfessional team.\nWestern Baseball League (2002).\nThe franchise began as a professional team in the Western Baseball League in 1995 as the Surrey Glaciers and only played one season at Stetson Bowl in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. In 1996 they relocated to Reno, Nevada, becoming known as the Reno Chukars and played their home games at Moana Stadium. They changed their name to the Reno Blackjacks in 1999 and played their final season in Reno before relocating to Marysville, where they were renamed the Feather River Mudcats for their inaugural 2000 season in Marysville.\nBecause of the team's infringement on the previously trademarked name of Mudcats by the Carolina Mudcats of the Southern League, the Feather River Mudcats changed their name to the Feather River Fury in preparation for the 2001 season, though never took the field under that name since the team filed for bankruptcy prior to the season start. There was no baseball in Marysville for the 2001 season.\nThe City of Marysville stepped in to operate the team for the 2002 season in order to keep baseball alive in the area and the city-owned ballpark in use. The City changed the name to Yuba-Sutter Gold Sox and played the season in the Western Baseball League. Upon conclusion of that 2002 season the Western Baseball League disbanded, thus ending the Gold Sox as a professional team.\nCollegiate Summer Baseball.\nThe team was purchased from the City in 2003 by Bob Bavasi of Bavasi Sports Partners and local auto dealer Don McCullough (1936\u20132005) and began 2003 season play as a summer collegiate wood-bat team as it remains to this day.\nThe ball club played the 2003 and 2004 seasons in the California Collegiate League.\nIn 2005, the Gold Sox became the host team for the Horizon Air Summer Series, a collegiate wood bat league created by Bob Bavasi.\nPrior to the 2005 season, Don McCullough died. Upon McCullough's death, Peter Bavasi, former General Manager of the San Diego Padres, President of the Toronto Blue Jays and Cleveland Indians, came out of retirement to help administer the club for the 2005 and 2006 seasons.\nOn January 1, 2007, Bob Bavasi invited Fair Oaks attorney Tom Lininger and his wife Karyn to join in the ownership of the club as majority shareholders. The team was renamed the Marysville Gold Sox in 2010. Tom Lininger became the team's managing partner and sold the team after the 2014 season.\nGreat West League (2016-2018).\nIn 2015, the organization was sold to CSH Holdings, Pat Gillick, Kevin Knight and Jake Knight. In 2016, the team moved to the Great West League which played a balanced schedule home and away. The League and team conduct operations like a class A short season minor league baseball team (examples: New York-Penn League and Northwest League). The ownership group hired veteran general manager Michael Mink to handle the operation in November 2016.\nOn November 6, 2017, the Gold Sox management announced that they were reverting the team name back to the Yuba-Sutter Gold Sox after the originally-named professional team.\nOn October 4, 2018, the Gold Sox announced that they are considering options for 2019 and beyond as a result of the Great West League suspending operations. On November 15, 2018, the Gold Sox announced that they would cease operations if new ownership was not found.\nGolden State Collegiate Baseball League (2019).\nIn 2019, a new local group, YCM Baseball Group, LLC, led by local agricultural entrepreneur Al Montna, purchased the Gold Sox and became members of the Golden State Collegiate Baseball League joining former GWL rivals the Medford Rogues.\nMontna Farms Summer Series (2020-2022).\nIn 2020, the Gold Sox season in the GSCBL was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, they helped create a smaller short-season league known as the Sierra Central-Montna Farms Summer Series. The Gold Sox were the inaugural champions defeating the Lincoln Potters (Note: The Potters are members of the CCL and did not know or agree to be a part of the Montna Farms Summer Series). The Series launched its second season in 2021, which they named themselves champions once again. In 2022, the series name was shortened to the Montna Farms Summer Series. Also in 2022, the Gold Sox joined the Bay Area Collegiate League.\nPost-Gold Sox baseball in Marysville.\nOn September 7, 2022, the Gold Sox announced that they will not be taking to the field in 2023 and will reevaluate their position in summer collegiate baseball in the region. They are officially considering themselves \"on hiatus\", though they have effectively ceased operations. They were replaced by the new Marysville Drakes of the Pecos League in 2023. However, they, too, would fold after two seasons when the Pecos League left them off of the schedule. \"They\" would be replaced in 2025 by the Yuba-Sutter High Wheelers of the Pioneer League, an independent minor league partnered with Major League Baseball and defending league champions relocated from Davis, California.\nBryant Field.\nSince their inception, the Gold Sox have played their home games at what was originally known as Bryant Field, located along Highway 70 in the east part of Marysville. It has experienced several name changes since then, including Appeal-Democrat Park, All Seasons RV Stadium, Colusa Casino Stadium and Hard Rock Park. The stadium is once again known as Bryant Field. The Gold Sox shared their field with the Yuba City Bears, who joined the GWL in 2017, then later folded their GWL operations.\nRadio broadcasts.\nThe Yuba-Sutter Gold Sox official flagship radio station was KUBA-AM 1600. Todd Kuhnen provides play-by-play. Games are currently broadcast on the team's Facebook Live page.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They played in the independent Western Baseball League and were not affiliated with any Major League Baseball team, although four of the players in the 2002 season were mayoral candidates in the Golden One Bank Capital Election.\nThe Steelheads were founded in 1999 as the Sacramento Steelheads by a businessman, Bruce Portner. They played their inaugural season at Sacramento City College. Portner sought to attract attention to the new franchise by hiring the notorious MLB star Pete Rose as \"the hitting instructor\" of the team. \nThe Steelheads were relatively successful in the WBL standings in 1999. Sacramento's sports fans largely chose to ignore the home venue, which was located on the college grounds, and hence, prevented from serving alcohol. Many area baseball fans were content to wait for the relocation of the Pacific Coast League Vancouver Canadians to Raley Field.\nRather than contend directly with AAA-level baseball, Portner moved his team west to Vacaville, where he built Travis Credit Union Park on the grounds of the historic Nut Tree. Marketing efforts portrayed the team as a Rockwellian slice of Americana, and Solano County fans responded positively to a professional team of their own. The 2000 and 2001 seasons were successful, in terms of both attendance and profit. 2001 saw a renovation of Travis Credit Union Park that included replacing benches with bucket seating. The ballpark was further improved by the start of the 2002 season with a new permanent concession facility and picnic area.\nDue to the City of Vacaville's failure to honor the promised removal of a significant financial condition imposed on Portner when he built the stadium with his own money, Portner was forced to sell the stadium at a fire sale price and ultimately had to place the team in bankruptcy to reorganize its debts. \nLegal issues and financial obligations became overwhelming and coupled with the decline of the Sonoma County Crushers, another of the WBL flagship organizations, the Western Baseball League was dealt a critical blow, and folded shortly after the 2002 season. \nThe Solano Thunderbirds, a college league team succeeded the Steelheads as Travis Credit Union Park's primary tenant but has never shared in the excitement or crowds enjoyed by Portner's Steelheads drawing fewer than 100 people to most of its games.\nDue to the poor management of the Solano Thunderbirds owned by Curtis, Susan and Byrant Stocking, they ran up a debt of millions of dollars and were forced to close down the Thunderbirds leaving Vacaville with no baseball team."}

After achieving fame in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), he served as the 38th governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003. He was elected governor with the Reform Party and is the party's only candidate to win a major government office.\nVentura was a member of the United States Navy Underwater Demolition Team during the Vietnam War. After leaving the military, he embarked on a professional wrestling career as a heel from 1975 to 1986, taking the ring name \"Jesse 'the Body' Ventura.\" He had a lengthy tenure in the WWF/WWE as a performer and color commentator and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004. In addition to wrestling, Ventura pursued an acting career, appearing in films such as \"Predator\" and \"The Running Man\".\nVentura entered politics in 1991 when he was elected mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, a position he held until 1995. He was the Reform Party candidate in the 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election, running a low-budget campaign centered on grassroots events and unusual advertising that urged citizens not to \"vote for politics as usual\". Initially ignored as a novelty candidate, Ventura defeated both the Democratic and the Republican nominee, a major upset. Amid internal fights for control over the party, Ventura left the Reform Party a year after taking office and served the remainder of his term as a member of the Independence Party of Minnesota. Since holding public office, Ventura has referred to himself as a \"statesman\" instead of a politician.\nAs governor, Ventura oversaw reforms of Minnesota's property tax as well as the state's first sales tax rebate. Other initiatives he took included construction of the METRO Blue Line light rail in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area and income tax cuts. Ventura did not run for reelection. After leaving office in 2003, he became a visiting fellow at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He has since hosted a number of political television shows on RT America and Ora TV, and written several books. Ventura has been a prominent figure in third-party politics, having repeatedly floated the idea of running for President of the United States as an independent candidate.\nIn late April 2020, Ventura endorsed the Green Party in the 2020 presidential election and showed interest in running for its nomination. He officially joined the Green Party of Minnesota on May 2. On May 7, he confirmed he would not run. The Green Party of Alaska nominated Ventura, without his involvement, causing the national Green Party to disassociate itself from the Alaska party for abandoning the national party's nominee, Howie Hawkins. In the 2024 presidential election, Ventura endorsed the Democratic ticket of Kamala Harris for president and fellow Minnesota governor Tim Walz for vice president.\nEarly life.\nVentura was born James George Janos on July 15, 1951, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of George William Janos and his wife, Bernice Martha (n\u00e9e Lenz). Both his parents were World War II veterans. His mother was the chief nurse anesthetist at North Memorial Hospital and his father worked for the Minneapolis Street Department.\nVentura has an older brother, Jan, who similarly served in the Vietnam War as a UDT. Jan and Jesse graduated as members of BUD/S classes 49 and 58, respectively. Ventura has described himself as Slovak since his father's parents were from Slovakia; his mother was of German descent. Ventura was raised as a Lutheran. Born in South Minneapolis \"by the Lake Street bridge\", he attended Cooper Elementary School, Sanford Junior High School, and graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1969. Roosevelt High School inducted Ventura into its first hall of fame in September 2014.\nVentura served in the United States Navy from December 1, 1969, to September 10, 1975. He graduated in BUD/S class 58 in December 1970, was part of Underwater Demolition Team 12 while on active duty, and was assigned to SEAL Team 1 from 1973 through 1975 as a reservist.While on active duty, he served as part of an amphibious ready group in the South China Sea and was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Navy Expeditionary Medal. \nVentura has frequently referred to his military career in public statements and debates. He was criticized by hunters and conservationists for saying in a 2001 interview with the Minneapolis \"Star Tribune\", \"Until you have hunted men, you haven't hunted yet.\"\nPost-Navy.\nNear the end of his Navy service, Ventura began to spend time with the \"South Bay\" chapter of the Mongols Motorcycle Club in San Diego. He would ride onto Naval Base Coronado on his Harley-Davidson wearing his Mongol \"colors\". According to Ventura, he was a \"full-patch\" member of the club and third-in-command of his chapter, but never had any problems with the authorities. His biker nickname was \"Superman\". In the fall of 1974, Ventura left the bike club to return to the Twin Cities. Shortly after that, the Mongols entered into open warfare with their biker rivals, the Hells Angels. In November 2018, Ventura testified as an expert witness on behalf of the Mongols in a federal racketeering trial in Santa Ana, California, defending the club against the government's allegations characterizing the Mongols as a criminal enterprise. He testified that he remained an inactive member of the Mongols and called his time as an active member of the club's San Diego chapter \"a stepping stone I needed to make the transition from military life back to civilian life. I owe them for being there for me when the rest of the world wasn't\".\nVentura attended North Hennepin Community College in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, during the mid-1970s on the G.I. Bill. He was a bodyguard for The Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead for a time before entering professional wrestling and adopting the wrestling name Jesse Ventura.\nProfessional wrestling career.\nEarly career (1975\u20131981).\nVentura created the stage name Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura to go with the persona of a bully-ish beach bodybuilder, picking the name \"Ventura\" from a map as part of his \"bleach blond from California\" gimmick. As a wrestler, Ventura performed as a heel. He resurrected Gorgeous George's old motto of \"Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat!\", which he emblazoned on his t-shirts. Much of this flamboyant persona was adapted from \"Superstar\" Billy Graham, a charismatic and popular performer during the 1970s.\nIn 1975, Ventura made his debut in the Central States territory, before moving to the Pacific Northwest, where he wrestled for promoter Don Owen as Jesse \"The Great\" Ventura. During his stay in Portland, Oregon, he had notable feuds with Dutch Savage and Jimmy Snuka and won the Pacific Northwest Wrestling title twice (once from each wrestler) and the tag team title five times (twice each with Bull Ramos and \"Playboy\" Buddy Rose, and once with Jerry Oates). He later moved to his hometown promotion, the American Wrestling Association in Minnesota and began teaming with Adrian Adonis as the \"East-West Connection\" in 1979. In his RF Video shoot in 2012, he revealed that shortly after he arrived in the AWA he was given the nickname \"the Body\" by Verne Gagne. The duo won the AWA World Tag Team Championship on July 20, 1980, on a forfeit when Gagne, one-half of the tag team champions along with Mad Dog Vachon, failed to show up for a title defense in Denver, Colorado. The duo held the belts for nearly a year, losing to \"The High Flyers\" (Greg Gagne and Jim Brunzell).\nMove to the WWF, retirement, and commentary (1981\u20131991).\nShortly after losing the belts, the duo moved on to the World Wrestling Federation, where they were managed by Freddie Blassie. Although the duo was unable to capture the World Tag Team Championship, both Adonis and Ventura became singles title contenders, each earning several title shots at WWF Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund.\nVentura continued to wrestle until September 1984 after three back-to-back losses to world champion Hulk Hogan, when blood clots in his lungs effectively ended his in-ring career. He claimed that the clots were a result of his exposure to Agent Orange during his time in Vietnam. Ventura returned to the ring in 1985, forming a tag-team with Randy Savage and Savage's manager (and real-life wife) Miss Elizabeth. Often after their televised matches Ventura taunted and challenged fellow commentator Bruno Sammartino, but nothing ever came of this.\nVentura participated in a six-man tag-team match in December 1985 when he, Roddy Piper, and Bob Orton defeated Hillbilly Jim, Uncle Elmer, and Cousin Luke in a match broadcast on \"Saturday Night's Main Event IV\". The tag match against the Hillbillies came about after Piper and Orton interrupted Elmer's wedding ceremony on the previous edition of the show; Ventura, who later claimed that he was under instruction from fellow commentator and WWF owner Vince McMahon to \"bury them\", insulted Elmer and his wife during commentary of a real wedding ceremony at the Meadowlands Arena, by proclaiming when they kissed: \"It looks like two carp in the middle of the Mississippi River going after the same piece of corn.\" According to Ventura, the wedding was real, for at that time the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board would not allow the WWF to stage a fake wedding in the state of New Jersey, so Stan Frazier (Uncle Elmer) and his fiancee had agreed to have a real in-ring wedding.\nVentura retired from wrestling in March 1986. His final match was a tag with Roddy Piper, defeating The Orient Express at a house show in Los Angeles on March 25, 1990.\nAfter a failed comeback bid, Ventura hosted his own talk segment on the WWF's \"All Star Wrestling\" TV program called \"The Body Shop\", in much the same heel style as \"Piper's Pit\", though the setting was a mock gym (when Ventura was unavailable, \"The Body Shop\" was often hosted by Don Muraco). He began to do color commentary on television for \"All-Star Wrestling\", replacing Angelo Mosca, and later \"Superstars of Wrestling\", initially alongside Vince McMahon and the semi-retired Sammartino, and then just with McMahon after Sammartino's departure from the WWF in early 1988. Ventura most notably co-hosted \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" with McMahon, the first six WrestleManias (five of which were alongside Gorilla Monsoon), and most of the WWF's pay-per-views at the time with Monsoon, with the lone exception for Ventura being the first SummerSlam, in which he served as the guest referee during the main event.\nVentura's entertaining commentary style was an extension of his wrestling persona, i.e., a \"heel\", as he was partial to the villains, something new and different at the time. McMahon, who was always looking for ways of jazzing things up, came up with the idea of Ventura doing heel commentary at a time when most commentators, including McMahon himself, openly favored the fan favorites.\nBut Ventura still occasionally gave credit where it was due, praising the athleticism of fan favorites such as Ricky Steamboat and Randy Savage, who was championed by Ventura for years, even when he was a face, a point Ventura regularly made on-air to McMahon and Monsoon. Occasionally he would even acknowledge mistakes made by the heels, including those made by his personal favorites such as Savage or wrestlers managed by heels Bobby Heenan and Jimmy Hart.\nOne notable exception to this rule was the WrestleMania VI Ultimate Challenge title for title match between WWF Champion Hulk Hogan and the WWF Intercontinental Champion, The Ultimate Warrior. Since they were both fan favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary, even praising Hogan's display of sportsmanship at the end of the match when he handed over the WWF Championship belt to the Warrior after he lost the title, stating that Hogan was going out like a true champion. During the match, however, which was also the last match at WrestleMania he called, Ventura did voice his pleasure when both broke the rules, at one point claiming, \"This is what I like. Let the two goody two-shoes throw the rule book out and get nasty.\" Ventura's praise of Hogan's action was unusual for him, because he regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches, usually telling fellow commentator Monsoon after Hogan had won a championship match at a WrestleMania that he might \"come out of retirement and take this dude out\".\nHogan and Ventura were at one point close friends, but Ventura abruptly ended the friendship in 1994 after he discovered, during his lawsuit against McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told McMahon about Ventura's attempt to form a labor union in 1986 before WrestleMania 2. After a dispute with McMahon over the use of his image for promoting a Sega product, Ventura left the WWF in August 1990.\nVentura later served as a radio announcer for a few National Football League teams, among them the Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nWorld Championship Wrestling (1992\u20131994).\nIn February 1992 at SuperBrawl II, Ventura joined World Championship Wrestling as a commentator. WCW President Eric Bischoff ultimately released him for allegedly falling asleep during a \"WCW Worldwide\" TV taping at Disney MGM Studios in July 1994, but it has been speculated that the move may have had more to do with Hogan's arrival shortly before.\nLitigation.\nIn 1987, while negotiating his contract as a WWF commentator, Ventura waived his rights to royalties on videotape sales when he was falsely told that only feature performers received such royalties. In November 1991, having discovered that other non-feature performers received royalties, Ventura brought an action for fraud, misappropriation of publicity rights, and quantum meruit in Minnesota state court against Titan Sports, asking for $2\u00a0million (~$ in 2024) in royalties based on a fair market value share. Titan moved the case to federal court, and Ventura won an $801,333 jury verdict on the last claim. In addition, the judge awarded him $8,625 in back pay for all non-video WWF merchandising featuring Ventura. The judgment was affirmed on appeal, and the case,\" \"65 F.3d 725 (8th Cir.1995), is an important result in the law of restitution. As a result, Ventura's commentary is removed on most releases from WWE Home Video.\nReturn to the WWF/WWE (1999\u2013present).\nIn mid-1999, Ventura reappeared on WWF television during his term as governor of Minnesota, acting as the special guest referee for the main event of SummerSlam, held in Minneapolis. He continued his relationship with the WWF by doing commentary for Vince McMahon's short-lived XFL.\nOn the June 4, 2001, episode of \"Raw\", which aired live from Minnesota, Ventura appeared to overrule McMahon's authority and approve a WWF championship match between then-champion Stone Cold Steve Austin and Chris Jericho.\nOn the March 20, 2003, episode of \"SmackDown!,\" Ventura appeared in a taped interview to talk about the match between McMahon and Hogan at WrestleMania XIX.\nOn March 13, 2004, Ventura was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. The next night, at WrestleMania XX, he approached the ring to interview Donald Trump, who had a front-row seat. Trump affirmed that Ventura would receive his moral and financial support were he to reenter politics. Alluding to the 2008 election, Ventura announced, \"I think we oughta put a wrestler in the White House in 2008!\"\nVentura was guest host on the November 23, 2009, episode of \"Raw,\" during which he retained his heel persona by siding with the number one contender Sheamus over WWE Champion John Cena. This happened while he confronted Cena about how it was unfair that Cena always got a title shot in the WWE while Ventura never did during his WWE career. After that, Sheamus attacked Cena and put him through a table. Ventura then made the match a Table match at . During the show, for the first time in nearly 20 years, McMahon joined Ventura ringside to provide match commentary.\nOn December 14, 2024, Ventura returned to \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". He dual broadcast the show with Joe Tessitore and called the main event match for the Undisputed WWE Championship between Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes and Kevin Owens with Michael Cole and Pat McAfee.\nOn January 25, 2025, Ventura returned to Saturday Night's Main Event XXXVIII, again dual broadcasting the show with Joe Tessitore. He called the WWE Intercontinental Championship match between Intercontinental Champion Bron Breakker and Sheamus alongside Michael Cole and Pat McAfee. On May 24, he returned for Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIX, calling the steel cage match between Drew McIntyre and Damian Priest.\nActing career.\nNear the end of his wrestling career, Ventura began an acting career. He appeared in the movie \"Predator\" (1987), whose cast included future California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and future Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Sonny Landham. Ventura became close friends with Schwarzenegger during the production of \"Predator\". He appeared in two episodes of \"Zorro\" filmed in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. He had a starring role in the 1990 sci-fi movie \"Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe\". He had supporting roles in \"The Running Man\" (again with Schwarzenegger), \"No Holds Barred\", \"Thunderground\", \"Demolition Man\", \"Repossessed\", \"Ricochet\", \"The Master of Disguise\" (in which he steals the Liberty Bell), \"Ready to Rumble\", and \"Batman &amp; Robin\"\u2014the first and last of these also starring Schwarzenegger. Ventura made a cameo appearance in \"Major League II\" as \"White Lightning\". He appeared as a self-help guru (voice only) in \"The Ringer\", trying to turn Johnny Knoxville into a more confident worker. Ventura had a cameo in \"The X-Files\" episode \"Jose Chung's \"From Outer Space\"\" as a Man in Black alongside fellow 'MiB' Alex Trebek. In 2008, Ventura was in the independent comedy \"Woodshop\", starring as high school shop teacher Mr. Madson. The film was released September 7, 2010.\nOther media.\nVentura was a bodyguard for The Rolling Stones in the late 1970s and 1980s. Its lead singer, Mick Jagger, said of him, \"He's done us proud, hasn't he? He's been fantastic.\"\nIn the late 1980s, Ventura appeared in a series of Miller Lite commercials.\nIn 1989, Ventura co-hosted the four episodes of the DiC Entertainment children's program \"\" along with Gary Apple. In 1991, the pilot episode for \"Tag Team\", a television program about two ex-professional wrestlers turned police officers, starred Ventura and Roddy Piper.\nVentura also co-hosted the short-lived syndicated game show \"The Grudge Match\" alongside sportscaster Steve Albert.\nBetween 1995 and 1998, Ventura had radio call-in shows on KFAN 1130 and KSTP 1500 in Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul. He also had a brief role on the television soap opera \"The Young and the Restless\" in 1999.\nOn April 12, 1996, Ventura starred in \"The X-Files\" Season 3 episode as a mysterious Man in Black.\nVentura has been criticized by the press for profiting from his heightened popularity. He was hired as a television analyst for the failed XFL football league in 2001, served as a referee at a WWF SummerSlam match in 1999, and published several books during his tenure as governor. On his weekly radio show, he often criticized the media for focusing on these deals rather than his policy proposals.\nFrom 2009 to 2012, TruTV aired three seasons of the television series \"Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura\".\nVentura had a guest spot on an episode of the 2012 rebooted \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" animated series on Nickelodeon.\nIn 2013, Ventura announced a new show, \"Jesse Ventura: Uncensored\", which launched on January 27, 2014, and later renamed \"Off the Grid\", and aired until 2016 on Ora TV, an online video on demand network founded by Larry King.\nIn 2017, Ventura became the host of the show \"The World According to Jesse\" on RT America; the series ended in March 2022 when RT programming produced by its production partner Ora TV was suspended after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. RT America ceased operations on March 3, 2022.\nPolitical career.\nMayor of Brooklyn Park.\nAfter his departure from the WWF, Ventura took a former high school teacher's advice and ran for mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, in 1990. He defeated the city's 18-year incumbent mayor and served from 1991 to 1995. Many professional wrestling personalities have entered politics, but Ventura is among the few, including Jim Barnett and Antonio Inoki, to have remained active in wrestling while serving in a government role: he was simultaneously mayor and WCW's color commentator through much of his mayoral tenure.\nGovernor of Minnesota.\nVentura ran for governor of Minnesota in 1998 as the Reform Party of Minnesota nominee (he later joined the Independence Party of Minnesota when the Reform Party broke from its association with the Reform Party of the United States of America). His campaign consisted of a combination of aggressive grassroots events organized in part by his campaign manager Doug Friedline and original television spots, designed by quirky adman Bill Hillsman, using the phrase \"Don't vote for politics as usual.\" He spent considerably less than his opponents (about $300,000) and was a pioneer in his using the Internet as a medium of reaching out to voters in a political campaign.\nHe won the election in November 1998, narrowly and unexpectedly defeating the major-party candidates, Republican St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman and Democratic-Farmer-Labor Attorney General Hubert H. \"Skip\" Humphrey III. During his victory speech, Ventura famously declared, \"We shocked the world!\" After his election, bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing the slogan \"My governor can beat up your governor\" appeared in Minnesota. The nickname \"Jesse 'The Mind'\" (from a last-minute Hillsman ad featuring Ventura posing as Rodin's \"Thinker\") began to resurface sarcastically in reference to his often controversial remarks. Ventura's old stage name \"Jesse 'The Body'\" (sometimes adapted to \"Jesse 'The Governing Body'\") also continued to appear with some regularity.\nAfter a trade mission to China in 2002, Ventura announced that he would not run for a second term, saying that he no longer felt dedicated enough to his job and accusing the media of hounding him and his family for personal behavior and beliefs while neglecting coverage of important policy issues. He later told a \"Boston Globe\" reporter that he would have run for a second term if he had been single, citing the media's effect on his family life.\nVentura sparked media criticism when, nearing the end of his term, he suggested that he might resign from office early to allow his lieutenant governor, Mae Schunk, an opportunity to serve as governor. He further said that he wanted her to be the state's first female governor and have her portrait painted and hung in the Capitol along with the other governors'. Ventura quickly retreated from the comments, saying he was just floating an idea.\nPolitical positions as governor.\nIn political debates, Ventura often admitted that he had not formed an opinion on certain policy questions. He often called himself \"fiscally conservative and socially liberal.\" He selected teacher Mae Schunk as his running mate.\nLacking a party base in the Minnesota House of Representatives and Senate, Ventura's policy ambitions had little chance of being introduced as bills. He vetoed 45 bills in his first year, only three of which were overridden. The reputation for having his vetoes overridden comes from his fourth and final year, when six of his nine vetoes were overridden. Nevertheless, Ventura succeeded with some of his initiatives. One of the most notable was the rebate on sales tax; each year of his administration, Minnesotans received a tax-free check in the late summer. The state was running a budget surplus at the time, and Ventura believed the money should be returned.\nLater, Ventura came to support a unicameral (one-house) legislature, property tax reform, gay rights, recreational marijuana, and abortion rights. While funding public school education generously, he opposed the teachers' union, and did not have a high regard for public funding of higher education institutions.\nIn an interview on \"The Howard Stern Show\", he reaffirmed his support of gay rights, including marriage and military service, humorously stating he would have gladly served alongside homosexuals when he was in the Navy as they would have provided less competition for women. Later, on the subject of a 2012 referendum on amending the Minnesota Constitution to limit marriage to male-female couples, Ventura said, \"I certainly hope that people don't amend our constitution to stop gay marriage because, number one, the constitution is there to protect people, not oppress them\", and related a story from his wrestling days of a friend who was denied hospital visitation to his same-sex partner.\nDuring the first part of his administration, Ventura strongly advocated for land-use reform and substantial mass transit improvements, such as light rail.\nDuring another trade mission to Cuba in the summer of 2002, he denounced the United States embargo against Cuba, saying the embargo affected the Cuban public more than it did its government.\nVentura greatly disapproved of some of the events at the 2002 memorial for Senator Paul Wellstone, his family, and others who died in a plane crash on October 25, 2002. Ventura said, \"I feel used. I feel violated and duped over the fact that the memorial ceremony turned into a political rally\". He left halfway through the controversial speech made by Wellstone's best friend, Rick Kahn. Ventura had initially planned to appoint a Democrat to Wellstone's seat, but instead appointed Dean Barkley to represent Minnesota in the Senate until Wellstone's term expired in January 2003. Barkley was succeeded by Norm Coleman, who won the seat against Walter Mondale, who replaced Wellstone as the Democratic nominee after Wellstone died a few days before the election.\nVentura, who ran on a Reform Party ticket and advocated for a greater role for third parties in American politics, is highly critical of both Democrats and Republicans. He has called both parties \"monsters that are out of control\", concerned only with \"their own agendas and their pork.\"\nIn his book \"Independent Nation\", political analyst John Avlon calls Ventura a radical centrist thinker and activist.\nCriticisms of tenure as governor.\nAfter the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in Maple Grove.\nIn 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that \"the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain.\" The proposed petition was dismissed by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Under Minnesota law, the Chief Justice must review recall petitions for legal sufficiency, and, upon such review, the Chief Justice determined that it did not allege the commission of any act that violated Minnesota law. Ventura sought attorney's fees as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous petition for recall, but that request was denied on the ground that there was no statutory authority for such an award.\nVentura was also criticized for mishandling the Minnesota state budget, with Minnesota state economist Tom Stinson noting that the statewide capital gain fell from $9 billion to $4 billion between 2000 and 2001. Ventura had vetoed this budget, but the state legislature overrode him. This deficit received national attention, for instance making a 10-question interview by \"Time\" journalist Matthew Cooper with Ventura. When Ventura left office in 2003, Minnesota had a $4.2\u00a0billion budget deficit, compared to the $3\u00a0billion budget surplus when Ventura took office in 1999.\nDuring his tenure as governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the Twin Cities press. He called reporters \"media jackals,\" with the label \"Official Jackal\" even appearing on the press passes required to enter his press area. Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and humorist Garrison Keillor wrote a satirical book about him, \"Me: Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente\", depicting a self-aggrandizing former \"Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)\" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Ventura initially responded angrily to the satire, but later said Keillor \"makes Minnesota proud\". During his term, Ventura appeared on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", in which he responded controversially to the following question: \"So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?\". Ventura responded, \"Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen\". He later apologized for the remark, saying it was not intended to be taken seriously.\nVentura's approval rating peaked at 73% in July 1999. By the end of his term it had fallen to 40%.\nConsideration of bids for other political offices.\nWhile Ventura has not held public office since the end of his term as governor in 2003, he has remained politically active and occasionally hinted at running again for political office. In an April 7, 2008, interview on CNN's \"The Situation Room\", Ventura said he was considering entering the race for the United States Senate seat then held by Norm Coleman, his Republican opponent in the 1998 gubernatorial race. A Twin Cities station Fox 9 poll put him at 24%, behind Democratic candidate Al Franken at 32% and Coleman at 39% in a hypothetical three-way race. On \"Larry King Live\" on July 14, 2008, Ventura said he would not run, partly out of concern for his family's privacy. Franken won the election by a very narrow margin.\nIn his 1999 autobiography \"I Ain't Got Time to Bleed\", Ventura suggested that he did not plan to run for president of the United States but did not rule it out. In 2003, he expressed interest in running for president while accepting an award from the International Wrestling Institute and Museum in Newton, Iowa. He spoke at Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul's \"Rally for the Republic\", organized by the Campaign for Liberty, on September 2, 2008, and implied a possible future run for president. At the end of his speech, Ventura announced if he saw that the public was willing to see a change in the direction of the country, then \"in 2012 we'll give them a race they'll never forget!\" In 2011, Ventura expressed interest in running with Ron Paul in the 2012 presidential election if Paul would run as an independent. On November 4, 2011, Ventura said at a press conference about the dismissal of his court case against the Transportation Security Administration for what he claimed were illegal searches of air travelers that he was \"thinking about\" running for president. Ventura was reportedly in talks with the Libertarian Party to run for president on its ticket, but party chairman Mark Hinkle said, \"Jesse is more interested in 2016 than he is in 2012. But I think he's serious. If Ron Paul ran as a Libertarian, I think he definitely would be interested in running as a vice presidential candidate. He's thinking, 'If I run as the vice presidential candidate under Ron Paul in 2012, I could run as a presidential candidate in 2016'.\"\nDavid Gewirtz of ZDNet wrote in a November 2011 article that he thought Ventura could win if he declared his intention to run at that point and ran a serious campaign, but that it would be a long shot.\nIn late 2015, Ventura publicly flirted with the idea of running for president in 2016 as a Libertarian but allowed his self-imposed deadline of May 1 to pass. He also expressed an openness to be either Donald Trump's or Bernie Sanders's running mate in 2016. Ventura tried to officially endorse Sanders but his endorsement was rejected. Ventura then endorsed former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee, saying, \"Johnson is a very viable alternative\" and \"This is the year for a third-party candidate to rise if there ever was one.\" Despite this, he later claimed that he ultimately voted for Green Party nominee Jill Stein.\nUnauthorized 2020 presidential campaign.\nVentura expressed interest in running for president again in 2020, but said he would do so only under the Green Party banner. \"The [Green Party] has shown some interest. I haven't made a decision yet because it's a long time off. If I do do it, Trump will not have a chance. For one, Trump knows wrestling. He participated in two WrestleManias. He knows he can never out-talk a wrestler, and he knows I'm the greatest talker wrestling's ever had.\"\nOn April 27, 2020, Ventura submitted a letter of interest to the Green Party Presidential Support Committee, the first step to seeking the Green Party's presidential nomination. In May, he announced that he would not run for health reasons, explaining that he would lose his employer-provided health insurance.\nVentura said he would write in his own name in the presidential election, but would support Green candidates in down-ballot races. He said he \"refuse[s] to vote for 'the lesser of two evils' because in the end, that's still choosing evil.\" Ventura received seven presidential delegate votes at the 2020 Green National Convention, having been awarded them through write-in votes in the 2020 Green primaries. Despite the national Green Party nominating Howie Hawkins for president and Angela Nicole Walker for vice president, the Green Party of Alaska nominated Ventura and former representative Cynthia McKinney without Ventura's consent. Ventura and McKinney received 0.7% of the Alaska popular vote.\nPolitical views.\nBush administration and torture.\nIn a May 11, 2009, interview with Larry King, Ventura twice said that George W. Bush was the worst president of his lifetime, adding \"President Obama inherited something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. You know? Two wars, an economy that's borderline depression.\" On the issue of waterboarding, Ventura added:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I will criticize President Obama on this level: it's a good thing I'm not president because I would prosecute every person that was involved in that torture. I would prosecute the people that did it. I would prosecute the people that ordered it. Because torture is against the law. [King: And you were a Navy SEAL.] That's right, and I was waterboarded... at SERE school, Survival Escape Resistance Evasion [\"sic\"]. It was a required school you had to go to prior to going into the combat zone, which in my era was Vietnam. All of us had to go there. We were all in essence, every one of us was waterboarded. It is torture. [King: What was it like?] It's drowning. It gives you the complete sensation that you are drowning. It's no good, because you\u2014I'll put it to you this way, you give me a water board, Dick Cheney, and one hour, and I'll have him confess to the Sharon Tate murders... If it's done wrong, you certainly could drown. You could swallow your tongue. [It] could do a whole bunch of stuff to you. If it's done wrong or\u2014it's torture, Larry. It's torture.\nQuestions about 9/11.\nIn April and May 2008, in several radio interviews for his new book \"Don't Start the Revolution Without Me\", Ventura expressed concern about what he called unanswered questions about 9/11. His remarks about the possibility that the World Trade Center was demolished with explosives were repeated in newspaper and television stories after some of the interviews.\nOn May 18, 2009, when asked by Sean Hannity of Fox News how George W. Bush could have avoided the September 11 attacks, Ventura answered, \"And there it is again\u2014you pay attention to memos on August 6th that tell you exactly what bin Laden's gonna do.\"\nOn April 9, 2011, when Piers Morgan of CNN asked Ventura for his official view of the events of 9/11, Ventura said, \"My theory of 9/11 is that we certainly\u2014at the best we knew it was going to happen. They allowed it to happen to further their agenda in the Middle East and go to these wars.\"\nOther endeavors.\nPost-gubernatorial life.\nVentura was succeeded in office on January 6, 2003, by Republican Tim Pawlenty.\nIn October 2003 he began a weekly MSNBC show, \"Jesse Ventura's America\"; the show was canceled after a couple of months. Ventura has alleged it was canceled because he opposed the Iraq War. MSNBC honored the balance of his three-year contract, legally preventing him from doing any other TV or news shows.\nOn October 22, 2004, with Ventura by his side, former Maine Governor Angus King endorsed John Kerry for president at the Minnesota state capitol building. Ventura did not speak at the press conference. When prodded for a statement, King responded, \"He plans to vote for John Kerry, but he doesn't want to make a statement and subject himself to the tender mercies of the Minnesota press\". In the 2012 Senate elections, Ventura endorsed King in his campaign for the open Senate seat in Maine, which King won.\nIn November 2004, an advertisement began airing in California featuring Ventura, in which he voiced his opposition to then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's policies regarding Native American casinos. Ventura served as an advisory board member for a group called Operation Truth, a nonprofit organization set up \"to give voice to troops who served in Iraq.\" \"The current use of the National Guard is wrong...These are men who did not sign up to go occupy foreign nations\".\nIn August 2005, Ventura became the spokesperson for BetUS, an online sportsbook.\nOn December 29, 2011, Ventura announced his support for Ron Paul on \"The Alex Jones Show\" in the 2012 presidential election as \"the only anti-war candidate.\" Like Paul, Ventura is known for supporting a less interventionist foreign policy. But after Mitt Romney became the presumptive Republican nominee in May 2012, Ventura gave his support to Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson on June 12, 2012, who Ventura argued was the choice for voters who \"really want to rebel.\"\nIn September 2012, Ventura and his wife appeared in an advertisement calling for voters to reject a referendum to be held in Minnesota during the November elections that amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. The referendum was defeated.\nIn October 2022, Ventura endorsed incumbent governor Tim Walz for reelection in an advertisement, praising Walz's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, protection of women's rights, and protection of democracy.\nIn March 2024, after Ventura publicly endorsed his independent presidential bid, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shortlisted him as a candidate for vice president on his campaign ticket; many states require one to meet ballot access deadlines.\nAfter Kennedy withdrew from the race and Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate, Ventura endorsed Harris. He strongly defended Walz against attacks by Republicans questioning his military service, pointing out that Walz served well after he reached retirement age. He accused Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance of hypocrisy for attacking Walz while standing behind Donald Trump, who avoided being drafted in the Vietnam War. Ventura also criticized Hulk Hogan, who was a featured speaker at the Republican National Convention, saying: \"When I was in wrestling in the '80s, I tried to unionize wrestling, and it was Hulk Hogan who cut my legs out from under me... So it doesn't surprise me to see Hogan with the Republicans, because Hogan is as anti-union as it gets.\"\nBooks.\nVentura wrote several other books after leaving office. On April 1, 2008, his \"Don't Start the Revolution Without Me\" was released. In it, Ventura describes a hypothetical campaign in which he is an independent candidate for president of the United States in 2008. In an interview with the Associated Press at the time of the book's release, Ventura denied any plans for a presidential bid, saying that the scenario was only imaginary and not indicative of a \"secret plan to run\". On MinnPost.com, Ventura's agent, Steve Schwartz, said of the book, \"[Ventura is revealing] why he left politics and discussing the disastrous war in Iraq, why he sees our two-party system as corrupt, and what Fidel Castro told him about who was really behind the assassination of President Kennedy.\"\nVentura also wrote \"DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODlicans: No More Gangs in Government\", which was released on June 11, 2012. The book expresses Ventura's opposition to the two-party system and calls for political parties to be abolished.\nOn September 6, 2016, \"Jesse Ventura's Marijuana Manifesto\" was released, making the case for the legalization of cannabis and detailing the various special interests that benefit from keeping it illegal.\n\"Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura\".\nIn December 2009, Ventura hosted TruTV's new show \"Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura\". \"Ventura will hunt down answers, plunging viewers into a world of secret meetings, midnight surveillance, shifty characters and dark forces,\" truTV said in a statement. On the program, Ventura traveled the country, investigating cases and getting input from believers and skeptics before passing judgment on a theory's validity. According to TruTV, the first episode drew 1.6 million viewers, a record for a new series on the network.\nThe first season was followed by a second in 2010 and a third in 2012. After three seasons, the show was discontinued in 2013, but as of 2017 it is still shown worldwide on satellite TV.\n\"We The People\" podcast.\nOn July 31, 2014, Ventura launched a weekly podcast, \"We The People,\" distributed by Adam Carolla's \"Carolla Digital\", which ran until March 4, 2015. Guests included Larry King, Bill Goldberg, Chris Jericho, Roddy Piper, Donald Trump, Mark Dice, and leading members of the 9/11 Truth movement.\nDisputes.\nNavy SEAL background.\nBill Salisbury, an attorney in San Diego and a former Navy SEAL officer, has accused Ventura of \"pretending\" to be a SEAL. He wrote that Ventura blurred an important distinction by claiming to be a SEAL when he was actually a frogman with the UDT. Compared to SEAL teams, UDTs saw less combat and took fewer casualties.\nSalisbury described Ventura's Navy training thus:[Ventura] took a screening test at boot camp to qualify for...Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training...Those who completed BUD/S, when [Ventura] was in training, were sent to either a SEAL or an underwater demolition team. Graduation did not, however, authorize the trainee to call himself a SEAL or a UDT frogman. He had to first successfully complete a six-month probationary period in the Teams.Responding to the controversy, Ventura's office confirmed that he was a member of the UDT. His spokesman said that Ventura had never tried to convince people otherwise. Ventura said, \"Today we refer to all of us as SEALs. That's all it is.\" He dismissed the accusations of lying about being a SEAL as \"much ado about nothing\". In addition to his time with UDT-12, Ventura spent two years attached to SEAL Team One before the end of his enlistment. By 1975, the last year Ventura was with SEAL Team One, the UDT Underwater Demolition Badge had been declared obsolete, with UDT members able to apply for the the Special Warfare Badge (\"SEAL Trident\"). Underwater Demolition Teams were converted to SEAL Teams by 1983.\nFormer Navy SEAL Brandon Webb, the editor of the website SOFREP.com, wrote in a column on the site, \"Jesse Ventura graduated with Basic Underwater Demolition Class 58 and, like it or not, he earned his status.\" He disagreed with the argument that Ventura was a UDT and not a SEAL, saying \"try telling that to a WWII UDT veteran who swam ashore before the landing craft on D-Day.\" \"The UDTs and SEALs are essentially one and the same. It's why the UDT is still part of the training acronym BUD/S\", Webb wrote.\nLawsuit against the TSA.\nIn January 2011, Ventura filed a lawsuit against the Transportation Security Administration, seeking a declaration that the agency's new controversial pat-down policy violated citizens' Fourth Amendment rights and an injunction to bar the TSA from subjecting him to the pat-down procedures. Ventura received a titanium hip replacement in 2008 that sets off metal detectors at airport security checkpoints.\nThe U.S. district court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction in November 2011, ruling that \"challenges to TSA orders, policies and procedures\" must be brought only in the U.S. courts of appeals. After the court's ruling, Ventura held a press conference in which he called the federal judges cowards; said he no longer felt patriotic and would henceforth refer to the U.S. as the \"Fascist States of America\"; said he would never take commercial flights again; said he would seek dual citizenship in Mexico; and said he would \"never stand for a national anthem again\" and would instead raise a fist.\nChris Kyle dispute.\nDuring a January 2012 interview on \"Opie and Anthony\" to promote his autobiography \"American Sniper\", former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle said he had punched Ventura in 2006 at a bar in Coronado, California, during a wake for Michael A. Monsoor, a fellow SEAL who had been killed in Iraq. According to Kyle, Ventura was vocally expressing opposition to the War in Iraq. Kyle, who wrote about the alleged incident in his book but did not mention Ventura by name, said he approached Ventura and asked him to tone down his voice because the families of SEAL personnel were present, but that Ventura responded that the SEALs \"deserved to lose a few guys.\" Kyle said he then punched Ventura. Ventura denied the event occurred.\nLawsuit.\nIn January 2012, after Kyle declined to retract his statement, Ventura sued Kyle for defamation in federal court. In a motion filed by Kyle's attorney in August 2012 to dismiss two of the suit's three counts, declarations by five former SEALs and the mothers of two others supported Kyle's account. But in a motion filed by Ventura, Bill DeWitt, a close friend of Ventura and former SEAL who was present with him at the bar, suggested that Ventura interacted with a few SEALs but was involved in no confrontation with Kyle and that Kyle's claims were false. DeWitt's wife also said she witnessed no fight between Kyle and Ventura.\nIn 2013, while the lawsuit was ongoing, Kyle was murdered in an unrelated incident, and Ventura substituted Taya Kyle, Chris Kyle's widow and the executor of his estate, as the defendant. After a three-week trial in federal court in St. Paul in July 2014, the jury reached an 8\u20132 divided verdict in Ventura's favor, and awarded him $1.85 million, $500,000 for defamation and $1,345,477.25 for unjust enrichment. Ventura testified at the trial. In August 2014, U.S. District Judge Richard H. Kyle (no relation to Chris Kyle) upheld the jury's award, finding it \"reasonable and supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\" Attorneys for Kyle's estate said that the defamation damages would be covered by HarperCollins's libel insurance. The unjust enrichment award was not covered by insurance. After the verdict, HarperCollins announced that it would remove the sub-chapter \"Punching out Scruff Face\" from all future editions of Kyle's book. Kyle's estate moved for either judgment as a matter of law or a new trial. In November 2014, the district court denied the motions.\nKyle's estate appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Oral argument was held in October 2015, and on June 13, 2016, the appeals court vacated and reversed the unjust-enrichment judgment, and vacated and remanded the defamation judgment for a new trial, holding that \"We cannot accept Ventura's unjust-enrichment theory, because it enjoys no legal support under Minnesota law. Ventura's unjust-enrichment claim fails as a matter of law.\" Ventura sought to appeal the circuit court's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in January 2017, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.\nIn December 2014, Ventura sued publisher HarperCollins over the same statement in \"American Sniper\". In December 2017, Ventura and HarperCollins settled the dispute on undisclosed terms, and Ventura dropped his lawsuit against both the publisher and Kyle's estate.\nPersonal life.\nFamily.\nOn July 18, 1975, three days after his 24th birthday, Ventura married his wife, Terry. The couple have two children: a son, Tyrel, who is a film and television director and producer, and a daughter, Jade. With the exception of the first two WrestleManias, Ventura always said hello to \"Terry, Tyrel and Jade back in Minneapolis\" during his commentary at the annual event. Tyrel also had the honor of inducting his father into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004, and worked on \"Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura\", including as an investigator in the show's third season.\nVentura and his wife split their time between White Bear Lake, Minnesota, and Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Regarding his life in Mexico, Ventura has said: {\nHealth.\nDuring his wrestling days, Ventura used anabolic steroids. He admitted this after retiring from competition, and went on to make public service announcements and appear in printed ads and on posters warning young people about the potential dangers and potential health risks of abusing steroids.\nIn 2002, Ventura was hospitalized for a severe blood clot in his lungs, the same kind of injury that ended his wrestling career.\nReligious beliefs.\nIn 1999, Ventura said during an NBC News interview that he was baptized a Lutheran; later, he said on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" that he was an atheist. In a \"Playboy\" interview, Ventura said, \"Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people's business. I live by the golden rule: Treat others as you'd want them to treat you. The religious right wants to tell people how to live.\" In his 1999 bestselling memoir \"I Ain't Got Time to Bleed\", Ventura responded to the controversy sparked by these remarks by elaborating on his views on religion:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I'd like to clarify my comments published in \"Playboy\" about religious people being weak-minded. I didn't mean all religious people. I don't have any problem with the vast majority of religious folks. I count myself among them, more or less. But I believe because it makes sense to me, not because I think it can be proven. There are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about God and religion, but does anybody really know for sure? That's why the Founding Fathers built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation, so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves. But I do have a problem with the people who think they have some right to try to impose their beliefs on others. I hate what the fundamentalist fanatics are doing to our country. It seems as though, if everybody doesn't accept their version of reality, that somehow invalidates it for them. Everybody must believe the same things they do. That's what I find weak and destructive.\nIn April 2011, Ventura said on \"The Howard Stern Show\" that he is an atheist and that his beliefs could disqualify him for office in the future: \"I don't believe you can be an atheist and admit it and get elected in our country.\" In an October 2010 CNN interview, Ventura called religion the \"root of all evil\", adding, \"you notice every war is fought over religion.\"\nAs governor, Ventura endorsed equal rights for religious minorities, as well as people who do not believe in God, by declaring July 4, 2002, \"Indivisible Day\". He inadvertently proclaimed October 13\u201319, 2002, \"Christian Heritage Week\" in Minnesota."}
{"id": "65523", "revid": "48535054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65523", "title": "World Football League", "text": "Former American football league (1974\u20131975)\nThe World Football League (WFL) was an American football league that played one full season in 1974 and most of its second in 1975. Although the league's proclaimed ambition was to bring American football onto a worldwide stage, only one team \u2013 the Hawaiians in Honolulu, Hawaii \u2013 was headquartered outside of continental North America. The league folded in 1975 midway through its second season. \nHistory.\nGary Davidson, a California lawyer and businessman, was the driving force behind the World Football League. He had helped start the moderately successful American Basketball Association and World Hockey Association, some of whose teams survived long enough to enter the more established National Basketball Association and National Hockey League, respectively. Unlike his two previous efforts, the World Football League did not bring any surviving teams into the National Football League.\nTo get the league off the ground, Davidson knew that he needed investors. At a press conference held in Chicago on October 2, 1973, Davidson announced his core of investors, a group of men he called the \"founding fathers\". These men were Robert Schmertz, who owned the WHA's New England Whalers and NBA's Boston Celtics; a former hockey prospect named Howard Baldwin (future owner of the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins), who ran the Boston Bulls charter; Ben Hatskin, who owned the WHA's Winnipeg Jets; and R. Steve Arnold, another WHA associate.\nPerhaps one of the biggest of the \"founding fathers\" was a Canadian movie producer, John F. Bassett. A former tennis prodigy and owner of the WHA's Toronto Toros, Bassett came from a wealthy Canadian family. The family owned (among other entities) the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, two Toronto newspapers and interests in television stations. The younger Bassett had been mulling over starting his own professional football league when he happened to meet Davidson and he was given a franchise for Toronto. Bassett went on to own a team in another alternative football league, the USFL's Tampa Bay Bandits in the mid-1980s.\nAlong with the original founding fathers, the rest of the owners soon fell into place, including a man whose own dreams of playing football were ended by a heart ailment, Thomas Origer, who later ran the Chicago Fire.\nSeveral prospective owners were forced to drop out. Davidson was willing to sell his Philadelphia team to investor Harry Jay Katz, before learning that Katz didn't have the strong resources that he claimed, and was in fact the target of several lawsuits, and rescinded his offer to sell the rights to Philadelphia. He nearly sold the Detroit franchise to Bud Huchul, but it was later discovered Huchul had been arrested 30 times and faced 27 lawsuits related to his previous business dealings.\nDavidson had initially planned for his league to commence play in 1975. However, the league came under pressure to accelerate its timetable, largely on account of strained labor relations affecting both established professional leagues. In the spring of 1974, players were threatening to go on strike in both the NFL and CFL, which could have delayed the start of their seasons and/or caused the quality of their product to deteriorate if owners attempted to bring in replacement players.\nThe possibility of being the only major professional football league in operation (or, at least, the possibility that the quality of WFL football might be compared favorably with that of established league rosters filled with \"scab\" players) appeared to be too good an opportunity to pass up \u2013 combined with rumors of another upstart league, it persuaded Davidson to advance the new league's planned debut to 1974.\nOne team went through several identities. The team slated to play in Maryland was to be called the Washington Capitals, but the expansion NHL team had already trademarked the rights to the nickname. A contest held to name the team came up with the name Ambassadors. The team then became the Baltimore-Washington Ambassadors, and then the Baltimore name was dropped, and the team simply became known as the Washington Ambassadors. In order to boost ticket sales, Washington owner Joe Wheeler offered former Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas a contract as head coach and general manager of the team, but Unitas declined as he was already under contract with the San Diego Chargers; he retired at the end of the 1973 season. Wheeler then made the same offer to Redskins linebacker Jack Pardee, who quickly signed with the new league.\nIn the meantime, Wheeler had engaged in a war for territory with Pardee's old boss, Redskins owner Edward Bennett Williams. Wheeler wanted the Ambassadors to play at RFK Stadium, but Williams refused to allow it, and the Ambassadors were on the move. Without ever stepping on the field, the team went through their third relocation, starting off as the Baltimore-Washington Ambassadors, then becoming the Washington Ambassadors, and finally the Virginia Ambassadors.\nCompeting for NFL players.\nThe fledgling WFL did succeed in raising stagnant salaries in the NFL. Average salaries in professional football were among the lowest in the four major North American sports, and the National Football League Players Association and the Canadian Football League Players Association had both gone on strike prior to their leagues' respective 1974 seasons in an effort to lift many of the rules suppressing free agency and player salaries. In addition, the NFL did not have a free agency system in place then (and one was not established until 1993).\nWith the uncertain labor situation, the WFL had the opportunity to provide players with a better deal than the established leagues would give them, along with the promise of employment. Davidson's league garnered major publicity when the Toronto Northmen, led by John F. Bassett, signed three Miami Dolphins players, fullback Larry Csonka, halfback Jim Kiick, and wide receiver Paul Warfield to what was then the richest three-player deal in sports, an astounding US$3.5\u00a0million to start in 1975. The pact was a guaranteed, personal-services contract, so the trio would be paid even if the WFL did not survive its first season.\nThe NFL took notice, as did their players when they were approached to jump leagues. The Oakland Raiders nearly lost both their quarterbacks. Ken Stabler signed with the Birmingham Americans, and Daryle Lamonica penned a contract to play for the Southern California Sun starting in 1975. John Wilbur left the Over-the-Hill Gang as a Washington Redskin to invest, coach special teams, and play for the Hawaiians. The Dallas Cowboys also took roster hits when WFL teams in Hawaii and Houston signed running back Calvin Hill and quarterback Craig Morton respectively. The Hawaiians also signed Minnesota Vikings Pro Bowl WR John Gilliam and San Francisco 49ers All-Pro TE Ted Kwalick; however, Gilliam ended up with the Chicago Winds and Kwalick signed with the Philadelphia Bell prior to the 1975 season.\nBy early June 1974, the WFL claimed they had some 60 NFL players under contract. Many of these defections came in the form of futures contracts. The players would play out their existing deals with the NFL, then jump to the WFL when those deals expired. Thus, Stabler planned to stay with the Raiders through 1975, then would have joined Birmingham in 1976 had the team and league survived that long.\n1974 season.\nPlaying a 20-game regular season schedule in 1974 \u2013 six games longer than the NFL's then 14-game slate \u2013 the WFL staged no exhibition games (although their teams did participate in preseason scrimmages).\nThe season was scheduled to begin on Wednesday, July 10 and end on Wednesday, November 13. This was a 20-game season in 19 weeks \u2013 a schedule accomplished by having double games (primarily Monday and Friday) on Labor Day weekend.\nSome complained that the schedule was poorly drafted: although most teams played on Wednesday nights with a national TV game slated for Thursday nights, the Hawaiians played their home games on Sunday afternoons, meaning when the Hawaiians had a home game, they played an opponent who flew to Honolulu after having played just four days earlier. In addition, back-to-back meetings between two teams were common.\nThe WFL held a college draft. The first six rounds were held on January 22, 1974, with the remaining 30 rounds held on February 5. David Jaynes, quarterback from Kansas, was the first player selected in the draft by the original Memphis franchise that became the Houston Texans by the time the season started.\nAs was common with many upstart leagues, the WFL's intended lineup of teams changed several times before they even played a down. Most notably, Bassett's Toronto Northmen were forced to find a new home after the Canadian government threatened to ban any American football team from competing with the CFL. Though the Canadian Football Act never passed, the mere threat of it prompted Bassett to move the team to Memphis, where it became the Memphis Southmen. It was generally referred to by fans, local media, and even some official team materials as the Grizzlies, which they officially renamed themselves to the following season (not to be confused with the current NBA team of the same name). The WFL suffered an even more serious blow when the CFL and NFL reached agreements with their striking players that ensured that the upstart league would be forced to compete with both of their established rivals.\nThe original schedule called for a four-team playoff, with semifinal games held on Wednesday\u2013Thursday November 20\u2013November 21, and the World Bowl on Friday, November 29 (the night after Thanksgiving) at the Gator Bowl Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. League officials also boldly discussed plans for expansion teams in Europe and Asia.\nIn the first few weeks, the WFL looked to be a resounding success. Attendance outpaced the first week of the American Football League in 1960, averaging just under 43,000 a game. The box office numbers proved to be the beginning of the WFL's undoing when two teams admitted to inflating their gates on a scale virtually unprecedented in major league sports. The Philadelphia Bell's first two home games totaled 120,253 fans. However, when they paid city taxes on those gates, they admitted that 100,198 of the tickets had been given away for free or sold at significantly reduced prices. WFL officials subsequently admitted they not only knew the Bell were inflating their attendance, but that Davidson himself had approved the scheme.The Jacksonville Sharks admitted that out of the 105,892 fans who attended their first two games, 30,000 had gotten in for free. The giveaways were intended in part to pique the public's curiosity and interest, and in the Bell's case were done to keep their crowds from being swallowed up in the cavernous environment of 100,000-seat John F. Kennedy Stadium. However, they ended up seriously eroding the credibility of both the teams and the league.\nSix games into the first season, a number of WFL franchises were in serious trouble. The Detroit Wheels were looking to move to Charlotte, and the Florida Blazers made overtures of bringing the first place club to Atlanta. In September, two franchises relocated in mid-season. The Houston Texans moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, as the Shreveport Steamer, and they were followed a week later by the New York Stars, who relocated to Charlotte and became the Charlotte Hornets (also not to be confused with the present-day NBA franchise of the same name; they played one road game after the official move still under the \"Stars\" name). On top of this, the Wheels moved one game to London, Ontario due to poor ticket sales, this time without any complaints from Canadian officials.\nIt was discovered that in the rush to commence play in 1974, several WFL teams had paid less than the original $120,000 franchise fee in order to meet Davidson's target of 12 teams. Additionally, league officials had conducted little to no due diligence. As a result, most of the league's teams were badly undercapitalized. By most accounts, the only reasonably well-financed teams were Memphis, Philadelphia, the Hawaiians and Southern California.\nIn many cases, WFL teams were unable to meet the most basic team expenses. For instance, the Portland Storm's players were reportedly being fed by sympathetic local fans. The Hornets had their uniforms impounded for not paying a laundry bill from the time the team was located in New York and were not paid regularly after the third week in October. The Birmingham Americans were not paid for the last two months of the season, the Florida Blazers went three months without pay (and reportedly survived on McDonald's meal vouchers), and the Sharks were not paid for what turned out to be their last six games. The other teams' finances were not much better, as the Southmen, Bell and Hawaiians were the only teams who met payroll for every week of the season.\nThe most dire situation, however, was that of the Detroit Wheels. The team's original 33 owners appeared to pay for team expenses out of pocket as they arose, resulting in what amounted to a club football team playing at the professional level. On several occasions, the team was left without uniforms when they did not pay the cleaning bill, forcing them to cancel practices. After several hotels and airlines went unpaid, the Wheels were also unable to fly to games or get a place for the players to stay without paying in advance. One player was forced to pay a hospital bill for his son out of pocket after being informed the team's insurance policy had been cancelled for non-payment of premiums. The owners refused to provide filming equipment for the coaches.\nThe Wheels seemingly bottomed out when they arrived in Philadelphia to face the Bell. The players discovered that there were no medical supplies or tape available, and initially refused to take the field. When it looked like the Wheels would have to forfeit, a salesman at the game donated enough tape to allow them to play. The league was forced to take over the team after complaints from the players.\nPerhaps one of the most bizarre incidents for the WFL in 1974 involved defensive end John Matuszak, who had jumped from the NFL's Houston Oilers to play for the WFL's Houston Texans. While Matuszak worked out on the field prior to a game against the New York Stars, attorneys for the Oilers and federal marshals arrived at the stadium: five minutes into the first quarter, shortly after sacking Stars quarterback Tom Sherman for a 13-yard loss, Matuszak was benched\u2014the Texans had been served with a restraining order that barred Matuszak from playing another down for the Texans until his Oilers contract expired at the end of the 1977 NFL season. Afterwards, Matuszak waved the document to show the stunned home crowd why he was sitting on the bench, while the Oilers, who were angered at this debacle, subsequently traded Matuszak to the Kansas City Chiefs.\nThe league seemingly bottomed out in October when it shut down the Wheels and the Sharks after 14 games. The collapse of the Sharks meant that the Gator Bowl did not host World Bowl I; coincidentally, Jacksonville was also slated to be the host of the 1986 USFL Championship Game, but the USFL folded before that season began. It was not until February 2005 that the city hosted its first championship pro football game, Super Bowl XXXIX.\nDavidson was forced to resign in October 1974, and Hawaiians owner Christopher Hemmeter was named the new commissioner a month later.\nLate in the year, the league announced that it would award its Most Valuable Player a prize of $10,000 at the World Bowl. Rather than endure the embarrassment of media sneers about whether a WFL check would clear, the league neatly stacked $10,000 in cash high upon a table in the middle of the field. The MVP award was a three-way split, and the players involved split the cash.\nThe playoff format itself was also chaotic: numerous playoff formats were tossed around, including brackets ranging from three to eight teams, with one owner proposing the World Bowl be canceled and the championship handed to the regular-season champion Memphis Southmen.\nEventually, six teams were chosen for the postseason. The two teams with the best regular-season records, Memphis and Birmingham, were awarded first-round byes. The other two division winners would play in first-round games against the runners-up in their division. Originally, Florida was to host Charlotte, while Southern California was to host the Hawaiians.\nHowever, after being informed only 1,000 advance tickets had been sold for the Hornets' matchup against the Blazers, league officials feared attendance would have been too small for the financially strapped Hornets to meet their travel expenses. The Hornet players would have been lucky to get $100 for the game, nowhere near enough to justify the trip to Orlando. The Hornets were forced to pull out of the playoffs and allow the Bell to advance in their place. Despite the fallout from \"Papergate,\" the Bell were slightly more robustly funded and could cover their travel costs.\nDespite the various disasters, many thought the WFL performed fairly well, though below NFL standards. Many games were tight, decided by seven points or less, and the Action Point, the one-point conversion run or pass attempt after a touchdown, was favored among WFL coaches and critics. The league championship\u2014the World Bowl, or \"World Bowl I\"\u2014was staged in Birmingham between the hometown Birmingham Americans and the Florida Blazers.\nNot even the World Bowl could go off without a hitch. For a time, it appeared that the game would not take place because the Americans owed $237,000 in back federal taxes. However, the Internal Revenue Service agreed to let the game go ahead in return for a portion of the gate. Both teams were owed several weeks' back pay; the Americans only agreed to play when their owner promised them championship rings if they won.\nAside from the money woes the league was having, the players did not hold back in complaining about the officiating during the game. Blazers running back Tommy Reamon scored what he thought was a touchdown, but the officials on the field ruled that he fumbled the ball out of the end zone before he hit the ground, resulting in a touchback that gave the ball to Birmingham. Replays clearly showed that the ball had broken the plane of the end zone before slipping out of Reamon's hands. While the phantom turnover did not account for any Birmingham points, it did serve to break the spirits of the Blazers. Birmingham led 15\u20130, with Birmingham quarterback Matthew Reed scoring an action point. Birmingham led 22\u20130, and thought they had the game wrapped up. However, Florida managed a small comeback, trailing 22\u201321 as the gun went off in the fourth quarter. After the game, the Americans' jerseys were seized to satisfy team debts, and \"Sports Illustrated\" prophetically referred to the game as \"The first, and possibly \"only\" World Bowl\".\nAs if losing a championship game in a squeaker was not bad enough, things got much worse. Florida head coach Jack Pardee bolted back to the NFL to take over the Chicago Bears, and the Blazers' franchise was sold off at a court-ordered auction after it was discovered that Blazers part-owner Rommie Loudd had financed the team through selling cocaine and a tax evasion scheme, for which he was arrested shortly after the season (and later convicted).\nThe champions did not fare much \u200conly days after the World Bowl, the Americans' office furniture was repossessed by sheriff's deputies.\nThe financial losses were tremendous: the Hawaiians had lost $3.2million, while the New York Stars/&lt;wbr /&gt;Charlotte Hornets had over $2million of debt against just $94,000 in assets, and the Jacksonville Sharks and Detroit Wheels were liquidated owing nearly \u200cDetroit had 122creditors looking to recoup losses.\nMany NFL stars who had been attracted to the league quickly sought to get out of their contracts. Quarterback Ken Stabler (Raiders), defensive end L. C. Greenwood (Steelers), and quarterback Craig Morton (Giants) all were able to get courts to nullify their contracts with WFL teams, while former NFL veterans like George Sauer Jr., Charley Harraway, Leroy Kelly, and Don Maynard all retired.\nHome-grown talent, like quarterbacks Tony Adams, Danny White, and wideout Alfred Jenkins quickly bolted for the NFL, with Adams landing with the Kansas City Chiefs, White with the Dallas Cowboys, and Jenkins with the Atlanta Falcons; Florida head coach Jack Pardee also got star Blazers' tight end Greg Latta to jump ship with him to the NFL's Bears.\n1975 season.\nThough many predicted the WFL was dead, the league returned for the 1975 season. During the offseason, Hemmeter developed a plan to restore a measure of financial sanity to the league by paying players and coaches based on a percentage of revenues, while imposing strict capitalization requirements on the teams. Several markets from 1974 returned under new team names and new ownership. The deceased Sharks of Jacksonville came back as the 'Express.' The Portland Storm became the Portland Thunder, the Birmingham Americans were replaced by the Vulcans, and the Chicago Fire became the Winds. The World Bowl runner-up Florida Blazers folded, and their franchise rights were relocated to San Antonio, Texas, as the San Antonio Wings. Akron, Ohio was briefly mentioned as a location for the twelfth WFL team (the replacement for the Wheels), but this never materialized, and only 11 teams played in the 1975 season. Only two teams, Memphis and Philadelphia, returned with the same ownership from the prior season. \"Sports Illustrated\", in its postmortem, noted that the change between 1974 and 1975 was so drastic that for all intents and purposes, the WFL of 1975 was a nearly completely different entity than its predecessor. The WFL of 1974 was described as a bombastic credit risk, while the WFL of 1975 was a safer but much quieter entity that failed because it was ignored.\nAn idea produced by the league was to have players wear different colors of pants based on their position. Offensive linemen were to wear purple pants, running backs green pants, receivers blue pants, linebackers red, and defensive backs yellow. Quarterbacks and kickers were to wear white pants. In addition to the colors, the pants were also adorned with items such as pinstripes (for the offensive linemen) or large stars (for quarterbacks) for those not watching on color television. After a test run in preseason games, this idea was scrapped.\nThe league changed the scheduling format from 20 games without exhibitions to 18 games (played in 20 weeks due to the odd number of teams) with exhibitions. Gone were weeknight games; the new schedule had games on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. But there were still problems, as although the original plan called for a July 5 preseason opener and August 2 regular season openers, the regular season had to open a week earlier, with a single game on Saturday, July 26, due to a stadium conflict. This meant that a single regular season game was played in the midst of the last weekend of preseason play (with some preseason games being played the next night).\nSeveral more NFL free agents, including Calvin Hill and Ted Kwalick, signed on with the struggling WFL. Memphis had secured three top-line, but fading Dolphins stars in Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick, and Paul Warfield. The Southern California Sun secured the services of former AFL and NFL quarterback Daryle Lamonica.\nThe Chicago Winds made an offer to aging Super Bowl III MVP Joe Namath, who seriously considered the offer, before refusing and re-signing with the New York Jets. The Winds invested considerable money and time in the effort to sign Namath (the team even designed its uniform to emulate the Jets'), and all but promised he was coming to Chicago. The embarrassing rejection by Namath crippled the Winds, who were shut down five weeks into the season. It also resulted in the loss of the WFL's national television deal (see below), rendering the league all but invisible.\nDespite Hemmeter's efforts, several teams soon ran into financial difficulties, in part due to alarmingly low attendance figures. (The WFL averaged 21,423 fans per game in 1974, but only 13,931 per contest in '75.) The Winds were shut down five games into the season after dropping below league capitalization requirements, leaving the league with ten teams (which itself was a convenience, because it eliminated the mandatory bye week). It was not enough to stem the tide; by late October rumors abounded that four of the remaining teams were on the verge of folding.\nOn Wednesday, October 22, a few days before the start of week 13, the WFL ceased operations. Hemmeter said that the league would have needed to spend as much as $40 million over two years to be successful, a bill that the league's directors, seven of whom sat on the boards of banks, did not feel could be justified. The\u00a0Birmingham Vulcans, by virtue of their league-best record of 9\u20133 at the time of the shutdown, were proclaimed league champions.\nWith the relative financial stability of the Birmingham and Memphis clubs, both attempted to join the NFL but were refused. In 1979, the Memphis club owners filed an anti-trust suit against the NFL. Their case was ultimately dismissed on May 30, 1984, by which time the owners had already established the Tampa Bay Bandits in the next professional league, the United States Football League (then in the midst of its second season; that league incidentally filed their own, more famous antitrust suit against the NFL in 1986). Although the NFL expanded by two teams in 1976, that expansion had been planned before the WFL's first season, and neither city (Tampa and Seattle) had hosted a WFL franchise.\nOne of the issues facing the WFL going into 1975 was how to hold a draft. The owners of the WFL teams collectively agreed they did not have the money to seek out the top college prospects. Instead, the league came up with a different plan. Instead of drafting a certain player, a WFL team would draft an entire NFL or CFL team. This gave that team the rights to negotiate with players under contract for that team. For example, only the Charlotte Hornets had the right to offer contracts to players from the Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Colts, and Detroit Lions, and only the Chicago Winds could offer contracts to players from the Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Jets, and Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League.\nLegacy.\nThe league's struggles led to endless sarcastic comments (starting with the league's own abbreviation, which was often pronounced \"Wiffle\"). Chicago Fire offensive lineman Steve Wright quipped that he had been offered a million dollar contract: \"A dollar a year for a million years!\"\nIn the 1976 season, Memphis Southmen coach John McVay joined the staff of the New York Giants and brought with him nine players from the Southmen. In what has been described as \"the closest approximation to a meeting between the champions of the WFL and the NFL\" (even though the Southmen never won a WFL title), the Southmen-reinforced Giants upset the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers, 17\u20130, in a preseason match that year.\nThe WFL, for all its embarrassing miscues, produced a number of coaches who found success in the NFL, notably Jack Pardee, Lindy Infante, and Marty Schottenheimer. Jim Fassel, a quarterback for the Hawaiians, became a head coach in the NFL and UFL, taking the New York Giants to Super Bowl XXXV in 2001 and the Las Vegas Locomotives to a win in the 2009 UFL Championship Game. McVay worked his way up the Giants organization and eventually became the team's head coach; he had even more success as general manager of the San Francisco 49ers during the 1980s dynasty years. Several players, most notably Pat Haden, Danny White, Alfred Jenkins, Greg Latta, and Vince Papale, later found success in the NFL as well.\nFour WFL alumni made it to the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Larry Csonka, Paul Warfield, Leroy Kelly and Don Maynard; all four were already established stars in the NFL before joining the WFL.\nThe league's most severe impact was on the Miami Dolphins, who had just won consecutive Super Bowls before the WFL's snagging of three of their star players. This changed the course of NFL history, by opening the door to dominance by two other AFC teams, the Steelers and the Raiders, during the second half of the 1970s.\nWhile by no means the pioneer of \"singular\" team nicknames, which had been used by some college and professional sports teams since the 19th century, the high quantity of them in a single league (\"Fire\", \"Sun\", \"Bell\", \"Storm\", \"Steamer\", \"Thunder\", \"Express\") was rare in professional sports at the time, and was a distinguishing mark of the league.\nThe WFL also arguably affected locations of other professional football teams: from the NFL, Hawaii hosted the Pro Bowl from 1980 through 2009 and again from 2011 to 2016, Jacksonville got the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1995, Charlotte received the Carolina Panthers in the same year, and Houston's expansion franchise, the Texans, revived the name of the WFL team in 2002. Though the WFL's Toronto establishment failed due to Canadian resistance, the Buffalo Bills (with Canadian backing and special conditions) played one home game in Toronto a season from 2008 to 2013, and the league's original intent to expand the game globally is being partially fulfilled by the NFL International Series. Other cities became regular stops for franchises in other leagues:\nThe NFL's Houston Texans revived the name of the WFL's franchise for that city when it began play in 2002. (\"Texans\" had been used by an NFL Dallas team in 1952\u2014after it folded, the remnants were taken over by the expansion Baltimore Colts\u2014and by an AFL Dallas team in the early 1960s, which became the Kansas City Chiefs.) The moniker was also used by an arena football team in Dallas in the early 1990s, and by a CFL San Antonio team for one year in the 1990s.\nThere is also a Major League Soccer team called the Chicago Fire, and there are/were also NBA teams called the Memphis Grizzlies (2001\u2013present) and Charlotte Hornets (1988\u20132002, 2014\u2013present) (the nickname \"Hornets\" was used for minor league baseball teams in Charlotte long before the WFL entry; also, the \"Grizzlies\" name for the Memphis NBA team was in use when the franchise was still in Vancouver). The Jacksonville Sharks and Portland Thunder names were later revived for teams in the 2010 revival of the Arena Football League, with the indoor Sharks (outlasting its namesake by several years) having since moved to the National Arena League.\nThe American Football Association was conceived as a successor to the WFL, and in some newspapers was even referred to as the \"New WFL\". Many of the AFA teams revived, with slight alterations, the names of WFL teams that had resided in its respective cities, and several of the AFA's key personnel had previously served in similar capacities with WFL teams; the league operated from 1977 to 1983.\nThe league also caused significant problems for the lower levels of professional football. Its arrival resulted in the end of the ACFL and SFL, effectively killing minor-league professional football in the United States until the AFA's formation in 1979.\nNFL jumpers.\nSeveral NFL players signed contracts, or in some cases, future contracts with teams in the World Football League. In the case of a future contract, this was when a player entering the final years of a contract with an NFL team would sign a contract with a WFL team that goes into effect the moment the player's obligation with his NFL club is finished. Each signing is broken down by team, said players previous NFL club, and year player signed a contract. Just because a player signed does not mean he ever played for that team. L. C. Greenwood, for instance, never played a down of football for Birmingham. No one shown with a date after 1975 ever actually played for the WFL team listed due to the league's insolvency as of that year.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMany other players jumped as well. Dallas running back Duane Thomas signed with the Hawaiians in 1975 after being released by the Washington Redskins. Longtime Cleveland Browns running back Leroy Kelly signed with Chicago. Other players joined the WFL despite being drafted by NFL squads, such as quarterback Danny White, who signed with Memphis before eventually joining the NFL's Dallas Cowboys.\nTelevision and radio coverage.\nThe league's only national television contract was with the TVS Television Network, a syndicator of American sports programming. Merle Harmon and Alex Hawkins announced TVS' Thursday Night Game. Guest announcers were often brought into the booth including Paul Hornung, George Plimpton, Alex Karras, and McLean Stevenson.\nAccording to TVS president Eddie Einhorn, the games actually got decent ratings at first. However, affiliates started bailing out after the Philadelphia and Jacksonville gate-inflation scandals. The trickle became a flood after two teams moved in the middle of the season and two more folded altogether. New York's midseason relocation came in part because the lights at Downing Stadium were nowhere near bright enough to illuminate the entire field, leading TVS to deem them inadequate for broadcast. This limited the Stars' national television exposure to away games. By the time of the World Bowl, the games were struggling to achieve Nielsen ratings above 2.0, and TVS found it nearly impossible to sell advertising. Despite the losses, Einhorn was actually willing to stick it out until Hemmeter announced the Winds were going to try to sign Namath. Einhorn told Hemmeter that the league had effectively bet its whole credibility on Namath coming to Chicago, and none of TVS' affiliates would commit to broadcasting the 1975 season unless Namath signed with the Winds. When he didn't, the WFL was left without a national television contract. The loss of such a critical revenue stream was a factor in the league's collapse midway through the season.\nRecordings from a few WFL telecasts survive, including two games involving the Jacksonville Sharks: one includes approximately one hour of footage from the July 10, 1974 match between the Sharks and the New York Stars, and the second includes ten minutes of footage from the Sharks hosting the Chicago Fire on July 17. NFL Films included clips from the Sharks-Stars game, including an animated introduction, in their television documentary series \"Lost Treasures of NFL Films\" in 2001. In it, host Steve Sabol describes the damaged video tape as \"a fourth generation copy of a copy\" and as \"TV history\"; Sabol also noted that much of the WFL footage was lost or destroyed, and that much of what remained was home-recorded kinescopes far below broadcast quality. Lewis Bice, who shot promotional film for Birmingham to be used for highlight reels, preserved some of his work, which NFL Films used in the special along with the surviving telecast footage; NFL Films was pleasantly surprised at the caliber of Bice's surviving footage, which was remarkably close to NFL Films's own work, with Sabol commenting that if he'd known of Bice back then, \"we would've hired him in a second.\" Twenty-one minutes of the TVS broadcast of the 1974 World Bowl - including the pre-game show, player introductions, and opening kick off - was uploaded to YouTube in 2018.\nOne complete game on radio in audio form also survives - the 1974 WFL Playoff Game involving the California Sun and the Hawaiians, recorded from Hawaiians flagship station KGMB. A mostly complete recording of the Chicago Fire's radio broadcast on WJJD-FM of their game against the Philadelphia Bell also survives as do fragments of other WFL radio broadcasts.\nLocal affiliates provided most of the television and radio coverage throughout the WFL existence. Notable local announcers include John Sterling (New York Stars/Charlotte Hornets television), Spencer Ross (New York Stars radio), Bob Sheppard (New York Stars PA), Mike Patrick (Jacksonville Sharks), Larry King (Shreveport Steamer), Larry Matson (Birmingham Americans/Birmingham Vulcans), Fred Sington (Birmingham Americans/Birmingham Vulcans) and Eddie Doucette and Vince Lloyd (Chicago Fire radio and TV respectively).\nWhile the Boston Bulls franchise never made it onto the field; the team's preparations for the 1974 season had gone along far enough for the team to have signed contracts that January, shortly before the plug was pulled, with WLVI to televise the club's away games (as well as agreeing to pick-up the TVS package) and WEEI-AM to carry the team's entire schedule on radio. Although the franchise would be folded into the New York Stars, WLVI nevertheless honored their agreement to be the TVS/WFL outlet for Boston.\nThe league predated the vast expansion of cable television and sports networks spearheaded by the birth of ESPN in 1979, which severely limited the options the WFL had to televise. At the time, the AFL\u2013NFL merger, coupled with the launch of \"Monday Night Football\", had spread the NFL broadcast rights over all three of the Big Three television networks. The NFL, in a 1973 memo, noted that if the NFL had left one of the Big Three networks without NFL rights, it would have left an opening for the WFL. This memo was later used as evidence when the United States Football League (which included Einhorn as one of its team owners) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, hoping to break its television contracts; the lawsuit, although it acknowledged the monopoly, did not succeed in voiding the contracts.\nTeams.\nSame franchises are shown on the same line.\nRules.\nThe WFL had several important rules differences from the National Football League of that era, and many were eventually adopted by the older league:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65524", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65524", "title": "United States Football League", "text": "American football league (1983\u20131986)\nThe United States Football League (USFL) was a professional American football league that played for three seasons, 1983 through 1985. The league played a spring/summer schedule in each of its active seasons. The 1986 season was scheduled to be played in the autumn/winter, directly competing against the long-established National Football League (NFL). However, the USFL ceased operations before that season was scheduled to begin.\nThe ideas behind the USFL were conceived in 1965 by New Orleans businessman David Dixon, who saw a market for a professional football league that would play in the summer, when the National Football League and college football were in their off-season. Dixon had been a key player in the construction of the Louisiana Superdome and the expansion of the NFL into New Orleans in 1967. He developed \"The Dixon Plan\"\u2014a blueprint for the USFL based upon securing NFL-caliber stadiums in top television markets, securing a national television broadcast contract, and controlling spending\u2014and found investors willing to buy in.\nThough the original franchise owners and founders of the USFL had promised to abide by the general guidelines set out by Dixon's plan, problems arose before the teams took the field, with some franchises facing financial problems and instability from the beginning. Due to pressure from the NFL, some franchises had difficulty securing leases in stadiums that were also used by NFL teams, forcing them to scramble to find alternative venues in their chosen city or hurriedly move to a new market. The USFL had no hard salary cap, and because of this, some teams quickly escalated player payrolls to unsustainable levels despite pledges to keep costs under control. While a handful of USFL franchises abided by the Dixon Plan and were relatively stable, others suffered repeated financial crises, and there were many franchise relocations, mergers, and ownership changes during the league's short existence; however, none of its teams actually folded during any given season. These problems were worsened as some owners began engaging in bidding wars for star players against NFL teams and each other, forcing other owners to do the same or face a competitive disadvantage.\nOn the field, the USFL was regarded as a relatively good product. Many coaches and team executives had NFL experience, and many future top NFL players and coaches got their start in the new league, including several who were later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and/or the College Football Hall of Fame. The Michigan Panthers won the first USFL championship in 1983. The Philadelphia Stars won the second USFL championship in 1984, and after relocating to Baltimore, won the final USFL championship in 1985 as the Baltimore Stars in what was effectively a rematch of the first USFL title game.\nIn August 1984, the USFL voted to move from a spring to a fall schedule in 1986 to compete directly with the NFL. This was done at the urging of New Jersey Generals majority owner Donald Trump and a handful of other owners as a way to force a merger between the leagues. As part of this strategy, the USFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the National Football League in 1986, and a jury ruled that the NFL had violated anti-monopoly laws. However, in a victory in name only, the USFL was awarded a judgment of just $1, which under antitrust laws, was tripled to $3. This court decision effectively ended the USFL's existence. The league never played its planned 1986 season, and by the time it folded, it had lost over $163 million (equivalent to $ in 2024 dollars).\nTalent level.\nThree consecutive Heisman Trophy winners signed with USFL teams directly out of college: Georgia running back Herschel Walker and Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie signed with the New Jersey Generals, and Nebraska running back Mike Rozier signed with the Pittsburgh Maulers.\nFuture Pro Football Hall of Fame members defensive end Reggie White of the University of Tennessee, offensive tackle Gary Zimmerman of the University of Oregon, quarterbacks Jim Kelly of the University of Miami and Steve Young of Brigham Young University, and linebacker Sam Mills of Montclair State began their professional careers with the USFL's Memphis Showboats, Los Angeles Express, Houston Gamblers, Los Angeles Express, and Philadelphia Stars, respectively. A number of NFL veterans of all talent levels played in the USFL. Certain NFL backups such as quarterbacks Chuck Fusina and Cliff Stoudt, G Buddy Aydelette, and WR Jim Smith had limited success in the NFL but became major stars in the USFL. But many NFL backups struggled or never made it in the USFL. Additionally, the USFL also lured in NFL starters, including a handful in the prime of their careers including 1980 NFL MVP, Cleveland Browns' quarterback Brian Sipe, Buffalo Bills' three-time Pro Bowl running back Joe Cribbs and Kansas City Chiefs' three-time Pro Bowl safety Gary Barbaro.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nFor many decades after its inception, American football was widely regarded as a second-tier sport behind baseball which was long-regarded as America's national pastime. As a result, even the elite levels of American football generally lacked both the financial wherewithal to build their own facilities and the political clout to secure significant public funds to construct such venues, and as such were compelled to play primarily in ballparks hastily re-purposed for football. However, since gridiron football in particular is responsible for excessive wear and tear on a natural grass playing field, baseball clubs were not keen to see football played in their parks throughout the entire baseball season. Thus, the need to use ballparks played a large part in ensuring that the National Football League and early rivals would delay the start of their seasons until September when the baseball season was winding down, thus affording baseball teams the exclusive use of their facilities in the spring and summer.\nStarting in the 1950s, a number of technological changes and trends eventually caused some to question the traditional timing of the American football season. In particular, football became a much more lucrative sport, the invention of artificial turf and developments in the growth and maintenance of natural grass made it more practical for baseball and football to be played at elite levels in the same facility at the same time of the year, and the increasing influence of television combined with the prevalence of a farm system in which Major League Baseball controlled the rights to baseball levels in all levels of play caused many minor league baseball clubs (some of whom played in large facilities that could be easily re-purposed for major league football) to be much less lucrative in their own right. Finally, the growing popularity of college football (which also played a fall season to coincide with the fall semester) led to the construction and expansion of dozens of large stadiums for collegiate teams, which were mostly football-specific or at least designed primarily for football, and were primarily in cities without professional football franchises.\nIt was in this environment, in 1965, that David Dixon, a New Orleans antiques dealer, who would be instrumental in bringing the New Orleans Saints (and building their current home stadium, the Superdome) to his hometown, began to envision football as a possible spring and summer sport.\nThis was not the first time the United States Football League name was used; there had been a previous, short lived attempt in 1945 to start up a league with that name.\nOrganization.\nOver the next 15 years, Dixon studied the last two challengers to the NFL's dominance of pro football\u2014the successful American Football League and the troubled World Football League. In 1980, he commissioned a study by Frank Magid Associates that found promising results for a spring and summer football league. He had also formed a blueprint for the prospective league's operations, which included early television exposure, heavy promotion in home markets, and owners with the resources and patience to absorb years of losses\u2014which he felt would be inevitable until the league found its feet. He also assembled a list of prospective franchises located in markets attractive to a potential television partner.\nDixon was well aware that many attempts to challenge the NFL had foundered due to financial troubles. The WFL, for instance, was plagued by teams that were so badly underfinanced that they could not meet the most basic expenses. With this in mind, Dixon wanted to ensure that USFL teams had the wherewithal to put a credible product on the field. To that end, the league required potential owners to submit to a detailed due diligence and meet strict capitalization requirements. They were also required to post a $1.5 million letter of credit for emergencies.\nWith respected college and NFL coach John Ralston as the first employee, Dixon signed up 12 cities\u2014nine where there already were NFL teams and three where there were not. The Dixon Plan called for teams in top TV markets to entice the networks into offering the league a TV deal. All but two of the 12 initial teams were located in the top 13 media markets in the US at the time.\nAfter almost two years of preparation, Dixon formally announced the USFL's formation at the 21 Club in New York City on May 11, 1982, to begin play in 1983. ESPN president Chet Simmons was named the league's first commissioner in June 1982.\nAccording to the Dixon Plan, if the league was going to be a success, it needed television revenue and exposure. In 1983, the league signed contracts with both over-the-air broadcaster ABC and a cable TV broadcaster, the four-year old ESPN, to televise games. The deals yielded roughly $13 million in 1983 and $16 million in 1984, including $9 million per year from ABC. ABC had options for the 1985 season at $14 million and 1986 at $18 million. Each week, there would be a nationally televised game, as well as the USFL's own version of Monday Night football.\nStumbles before play begins.\nLike almost all startup pro football leagues, the USFL had some off-the-field factors that prevented the league from starting out with their preferred membership. The problems started when the original owner of the Los Angeles franchise, Alex Spanos, pulled out and instead became a minority owner (and eventually majority owner) of the NFL's San Diego Chargers. Jim Joseph, a real estate developer who had lost out to friend Tad Taube for the USFL's San Francisco Bay Area franchise, had thought he would be content to be a part-owner of the Oakland Invaders. When the potentially more lucrative Los Angeles franchise became available, Joseph snapped up the rights to the area. The owners of the USFL's San Diego franchise, cable television moguls Bill Daniels and Alan Harmon, were denied a lease for Jack Murphy Stadium. While this was in part due to pressure from the Chargers, the main opposition came from Major League Baseball's Padres who held the lease to the stadium at the time and did not want to see football played at the facility throughout the baseball season. Los Angeles was seen as critical to the league's success, and Dixon and Simmons felt that two cable moguls would be better suited to head the league's efforts there. Joseph was forced to move his operation. The team opened play in Tempe, Arizona, where it became the Arizona Wranglers. Daniels and Harmon's team became the Los Angeles Express.\nThe League's Boston franchise, the Breakers, also had stadium problems. The Boston ownership group wanted to play in Harvard Stadium, but were unable to close a deal with the university; Sullivan Stadium was owned by the New England Patriots, who were unwilling to share their venue with a rival, while Fenway Park was being used in the spring by the Boston Red Sox and was also unavailable, and Alumni Stadium on the campus of Boston College, for reasons never made public, also declined. Finally they were able to negotiate a lease to play at Nickerson Field on the campus of Boston University, a facility that seated only 21,000 people.\nThere were plans to establish four franchises in Canada prior to the inaugural season, located in Vancouver, Edmonton, Montreal and the Toronto/Hamilton metroplex (with the last of these to play at Ivor Wynne Stadium). The proposal was pushed by John F. Bassett, the Canadian who would go on to own the Tampa Bay Bandits USFL team. However, Senator Keith Davey warned that the Canadian government would act to protect the Canadian Football League (the league in which all four of the aforementioned Canadian cities had teams in) from competition. The Canadian Football Act had been proposed, but not approved, when Bassett had tried to establish the Toronto Northmen in the World Football League in 1974. Such legislation would have banned US football leagues from playing in Canada. In particular, Montreal's CFL team, the Concordes, was on precarious financial ground, having just been established to replace the recently folded Alouettes. This led Bassett to drop the idea.\nOnce play actually started, the league experienced the same kind of franchise instability, relocation, and closures that almost all pro football leagues, including the NFL, experienced in their early years.\nThe 1983 season.\nOn the whole, the inaugural season was a success for the league. Attendance was in line with league expectations at about 25,000 fans per game, and television ratings slightly exceeded projections (an average Nielsen rating of 6.1, when the league had aimed for 5.0). The brand of play was exciting and entertaining, and the 1983 championship was generally recognized as being a more entertaining game than most of the Super Bowls of the era. Even in cities where the fans were not numerous, the fan base was passionate; the documentary \"Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?\" made note of a regular-season game in which Boston Breakers fans stormed the field following a come-from-behind victory over the Stars at Nickerson Field.\n1986.\nArizona, Baltimore, Birmingham, Jacksonville, Memphis, New Jersey, Orlando and a newly reorganized Tampa Bay team were scheduled to play an ultimately aborted 18-game fall schedule season in 1986. At the time, only New Jersey and Tampa Bay shared markets with an NFL team (in New Jersey's case, they shared with two NFL teams).\n2022.\nIt was announced that the USFL would be returning in March 2022 with at least eight teams and a broadcasting deal with Fox Sports. Despite claims that this was a reactivation of the old league, no figures from the original league were involved in the new league, which was instead backed by the principals of the extant developmental showcase The Spring League, Brian Woods and Fox Sports. On June 3, 2021, the new USFL confirmed a return in the spring of 2022. In December 2023, it was announced that the new USFL had merged with the XFL to form the United Football League.\nCompetition vs. NFL.\nThe Dixon plan vs. building a league of stars.\nAt first the USFL competed with the older, more established National Football League by following the Dixon plan. The plan allowed the league to compete not just by playing its games on a March\u2013June schedule during the NFL off-season, but also by having the following conditions:\nThe Dixon plan laid out a budget to allow all teams to manage losses in the initial lean years. As mentioned earlier, prospective owners had to meet strict capitalization requirements and post a $1.3 million line of credit for emergencies.\nThe league's TV revenue met the requirements of the Dixon plan. The Plan called for first year attendance over 18,000 per game. In 1983, 10 of the 12 teams exceeded that threshold. Player spending was where the league deviated from the plan, in the name of pursuing stars.\nThe league's biggest splash\u2014the signing of Herschel Walker, a three time All-American and the 1982 Heisman Trophy winner\u2014represented a significant breach from the Dixon Plan. Like the NFL, the USFL barred underclassmen from signing. However, league officials were certain that this rule would never stand up in court, so they allowed Walker to sign with the New Jersey Generals. More importantly, Walker signed a three-year contract valued at $4.2 million with a $1 million signing bonus. Due to the USFL's salary cap rules, this was a personal-services contract with Generals owner J. Walter Duncan, and not a standard player contract. Nonetheless, the other owners did not raise any objections, knowing that having the reigning Heisman winner in the fold would lend the league instant credibility.\nOther marquee stars to sign with the league were Craig James, Anthony Carter and Kelvin Bryant as well as some familiar NFL vets like Chuck Fusina and members of the NFL vet laden Chicago Blitz, like Greg Landry, showed that the upstart league was a credible challenger to the NFL. The league also made a serious run at some other stars, such as Eric Dickerson and Dan Marino.\nThe pursuit of top-level talent proved to be a double-edged sword. While the presence of many blue-chip stars proved the league could put a competitive product on the field, many teams wildly exceeded the league's player salary cap in order to put more competitive teams on the field. For instance, the Michigan Panthers reportedly lost $6 million\u2014three times what Dixon suggested a team could afford to lose in the first season\u2014even as they became the league's first champions. The desire to compete with other loaded USFL teams and for the league to be seen as approaching NFL caliber led to almost all of the teams exceeding the Dixon Plan's team salary cap amount within the league's first 6\u201318 months.\nDixon urged the members of the league to reduce spending. Rather than backing off spending, recommitting to a firmer salary cap, and dispersing some of the larger contracts to expansion teams to alleviate the problem, the league sought other options to take on revenue to cover increased costs overruns. These actions magnified the problem.\nThe league added six more teams in 1984 rather than the four initially envisioned by Dixon, to pocket two more expansion fees. This put more pressure on the TV deal, which was not designed to support an 18 team league. A frustrated Dixon sold his stake and got out.\nAdditionally, the league was so determined to appear to put a credible product on the field that on some occasions, it set aside its own vetting procedures\u2013all of which backfired disastrously. When Diethrich sold the Blitz to Hoffman in order to clear the way for his purchase of the Wranglers before the 1984 season, they did not take a close look at Hoffman's financial statements. Realizing he was in over his head, Hoffman was forced to scramble to find minority partners. When there were no takers, he walked away from the team after the second preseason game, forcing the league to take over the team.\nIn San Antonio, the league was so enamored at Manges' apparent oil wealth that it not only did not closely vet his application, but did not require him to make an initial capital investment. Instead, Manges paid team expenses out of pocket as they arose, resulting in an operation that appeared short of professional standards. The Gunslingers' offices were in a double-wide trailer, and they used folding chairs to bring Alamo Stadium up to minimum capacity. Manges' practices caught up with him in 1985, when the oil market collapsed. The result was a litany of bounced checks, culminating in the team going the last four games without pay. It later emerged that Manges had been in financial difficulty as early as 1980.\nThe worst situation of all, however, was in Los Angeles. Original owners Alan Harmon and Bill Daniels sold the Express to mortgage banker J. William Oldenburg before the 1984 season. Swayed by Oldenburg's apparent net worth of $100 million, the USFL took his word as evidence that he would be a solid owner for one of its marquee franchises. However, in June 1984, investigations by the FBI, \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\" revealed that the man who made waves by signing a roster of high-priced young talent did not have even a fraction of the money to buy the team. He abruptly walked away from the team during the playoffs. Gamblers minority owner Jay Roulier took over the team in October, only to be pushed out just months later when it emerged that he too had lied about his net worth. The league was forced to run the team on a shoestring that season.\nWith the new wave of teams, more college stars like Marcus Dupree, Mike Rozier, Reggie White, Jim Kelly, Steve Young and other young stars of the day signed high dollar contracts to play for USFL teams in 1984, as did high-profile NFL stars like Doug Williams, Brian Sipe, Joe Cribbs, and Gary Barbaro.\nSpring schedule vs. fall schedule.\nIn 1984, the league began discussing the possibility of competing head-to-head with the NFL by playing its games in the fall beginning in 1986. The strongest proponents of playing in the fall were Chicago owner Eddie Einhorn and Generals owner Donald Trump. Einhorn and Trump argued that if the USFL moved to the fall, it would eventually force a merger with the NFL in which the older league would have to admit at least some USFL teams. They also argued that if a merger did occur, the surviving teams' original investment would more than double.\nA consulting firm recommended sticking with a spring season. Despite the protests of many of the league's \"old guard\", who wanted to stay with the original plan of playing football in the spring months, on August 22, 1984, the owners voted to move to the fall starting in 1986. On April 29, 1985, the league's owners voted 13\u20132 to reaffirm their decision to begin playing a fall season in 1986. Tampa Bay Bandits owner John F. Bassett, who had registered one of the two \"nay\" votes, declared his intention to pull his team out of the USFL and organize a new spring football league. However, failing health (he died from cancer in May 1986) forced Bassett to abandon his plans and sell the Bandits to minor partner Lee Scarfone, who agreed to keep the franchise in the USFL. The spring advocates had lost, and the fall advocates now set their sights on forcing a merger with the NFL, or at the very least winning a sizable settlement and securing a TV network for fall broadcasts.\nAs a direct result of this decision, the Pittsburgh Maulers folded rather than compete with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the sale of the struggling Washington Federals to Weiser's Miami-based ownership group collapsed, the New Orleans Breakers and 1984 champion Philadelphia Stars had to relocate, and the 1983 champion Michigan Panthers surprised the commissioner with an announcement that they would not be playing in the Detroit area for the 1985 season. Panthers owner A. Alfred Taubman informed the league at the meeting that he had negotiated a conditional merger with Tad Taube's Oakland Invaders depending on the outcome of the vote, with Taubman as majority owner. With an expectation of fall play in 1986, Einhorn decided not to field a team for the final lame duck spring 1985 season. Within a few weeks of the decision, the USFL had been forced to abandon four lucrative markets, abort a move to a fifth and suspend operations in a sixth. In hindsight, this destroyed the USFL's viability, although the Maulers folding likely would've happened anyway due to the team being owned by shopping mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. (who also owned the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins at the time), whose son Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. owned the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers (a team now owned by his sister Denise DeBartolo York), causing a potential conflict of interest for the family between the USFL and the NFL.\nABC offered the USFL a 4-year, $175 million TV deal to play in the spring in 1986. ESPN offered $70 million over 3 years. Following all the mergers and shutdowns, there just were not enough spring football advocates left in the league to accept those contracts. The owners in the league walked away from what averaged out to $67 million per year starting in 1986 to pursue victory over the NFL.\nAfter the 1985 season, more plans were announced to accommodate the fall schedule, pool financial resources and avoid costly head-to-head competition with NFL teams. Two mergers were announced. The Denver Gold merged with the Jacksonville Bulls, with the Bulls as the surviving team. Trump bought the assets of the Houston Gamblers for an undisclosed amount and merged them with the New Jersey Generals. While the Generals were the surviving team, Gamblers coach Jack Pardee was named as the merged team's new coach. Both the Gold and Gamblers had seen their attendance plummet to unsustainable levels, as their fanbases were not willing to abandon the Denver Broncos and Houston Oilers, respectively. In spite of all of these changes, the USFL would never play a fall game.\n\"USFL v. NFL\" lawsuit.\nIn another effort to keep themselves afloat while at the same time attacking the more established National Football League, the USFL filed an antitrust lawsuit against the older league, claiming it had established a monopoly with respect to television broadcasting rights, and in some cases, on access to stadium venues.\nThe case was first heard by United States District Judge Peter K. Leisure in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The USFL claimed that the NFL had bullied ABC, CBS and NBC into not televising USFL games in the fall. It also claimed that the NFL had a specific plan to eliminate the USFL, the \"Porter Presentation\". In particular, the USFL claimed the NFL conspired to ruin the Invaders and Generals. The USFL sought damages of $567 million, which would have been tripled to $1.7 billion under antitrust law. It hoped to void the NFL's contracts with the three major networks. The USFL proposed two remedies: either force the NFL to negotiate new television contracts with only two networks, or force the NFL to split into two competing 14-team leagues, each limited to a contract with one major network.\nThe lawyer for the USFL, Harvey Myerson, had what he felt were three \"smoking guns\".\nAll but one of the league's 28 teams was named as a co-defendant. Al Davis, owner of the then-Los Angeles Raiders, was a major witness for the USFL and his team had been excluded from the lawsuit in exchange for his testimony. ABC Sports' Howard Cosell was also a key witness for the USFL.\nThe case went to trial in the spring of 1986 and lasted 42 days. On July 29, a six-person jury nominally returned a verdict for the USFL. However, the jury's findings were devastating to the upstart league. The jury declared the NFL a \"duly adjudicated illegal monopoly\", and found that the NFL had willfully acquired and maintained monopoly status in professional football through predatory tactics. However, it rejected the USFL's other claims. The jury found that the USFL had changed its strategy to a more risky goal of forcing a merger with the NFL. Furthermore, the switch to a fall schedule caused the loss of six major markets (Philadelphia, Denver, Houston, Pittsburgh, Detroit, the Bay Area) and derailed a move to a seventh (Miami). The jury also made note of a memo Tad Taube wrote about the dispute, which quoted the comic strip \"Pogo\": \"we have met the enemy and he is us\".\nMost importantly, the jury found that the NFL did not attempt to force the USFL off television. (Indeed, ESPN remained willing to carry USFL games in the fall, several of the league's teams also had local broadcast contracts, and 1986 also happened to be the inaugural season of the Fox Broadcasting Company, a network that would establish itself as the nation's fourth major broadcast network.) In essence, the jury felt that while the USFL was harmed by the NFL's de facto monopolization of pro football in the United States, most of its problems were due to its own mismanagement. It awarded the USFL nominal damages of $1, which was tripled under antitrust law to $3.\nWhen NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle and NFL broadcasting chief Val Pinchbeck initially heard the verdict, they were devastated; Pinchbeck later recalled that he thought Rozelle would have a heart attack. While on their way to the league office, however, they heard that the USFL had lost nearly all of its claims, and headed back to the courthouse.\nThe verdict was a classic Pyrrhic victory. The USFL had essentially staked its future on winning the suit, hoping to finance the move to the fall by forcing the NFL to pay a substantial settlement. It considered the television-related claims to be the heart of its case. On August 4\u2014four days after the announcement of the verdict\u2014the USFL owners voted to suspend operations for the 1986 season, with the intent of returning in 1987; the league accurately foresaw the 1987 players' strike and had hoped the strike would give the league access to star players. Players signed to contracts were free to sign with NFL (or other professional teams) immediately. Indeed, the NFL had held a draft in 1984 for teams to acquire the rights to USFL players, in the event of the league (or teams in the league) folding. However, it is unlikely the USFL would have been able to put together a viable product in any case. Many of its players had signed contracts with NFL teams after the 1985 season, and the league was some $160 million in debt.\nFive days after the verdict, the Tampa Bay Bandits were effectively shut down when a judge placed a lien on the franchise to satisfy back pay owed to former player Bret Clark. All of the team's remaining assets were seized to satisfy the debt. In a desperation move, the Arizona Outlaws arranged a meeting in January 1987 with officials with the Canadian Football League hoping to negotiate a merger between the USFL and CFL; the CFL's owners were \"lukewarm\" and ultimately rejected the offer. With nearly all of its players under contract to the NFL and CFL, Usher announced the league would stay shuttered in 1987 as well. (Many of the USFL players who were not under NFL contract would end up playing in fall 1987 as replacement players during the strike.)\nThe USFL unsuccessfully appealed the award to a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which affirmed the district court's judgment in 1988. United States Circuit Judge Ralph K. Winter wrote the panel's opinion. This decision ended any chance of the USFL returning to the field, and the league's six remaining teams (the Outlaws had already decided not to return) voted to formally disband shortly afterward. However, because the USFL was at least nominally the winner of the lawsuit, the NFL was required to cover the USFL's attorney fees and costs of litigation, and the USFL was awarded over $5.5 million in attorney fees and over $62,000 in court costs. That award was appealed by the NFL; it was affirmed on appeal and ultimately allowed to stand by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1990, four years after the USFL had ceased operations.\nThe USFL finally received a check for $3.76 in damages in 1990, the additional 76\u00a2 representing interest earned while litigation had continued. Notably, that check has never been cashed.\nAftermath.\nThe USFL had a significant impact on the NFL both on the field and off. Almost all of the USFL's on-field innovations were eventually adopted by the older league, and a multitude of star players in the USFL would go on to enjoy very successful careers in the National Football League.\nThe NFL would also eventually have franchises in some of the USFL markets which had proved fertile for pro football or showed renewed interest in the game. Jacksonville, in particular, was being courted by the Houston Oilers as a potential relocation destination as early as 1987; that city eventually got the expansion Jaguars in 1995. The Oilers would instead relocate to Tennessee in 1997, playing temporarily for one season in Memphis (to minuscule crowds) before moving to Nashville to become the Tennessee Titans. Although the USFL's stay in Baltimore was brief, the city's acceptance of the Stars, coupled with the success of the Canadian Football League's Baltimore Stallions a decade later, were factors in Art Modell's decision to relocate his Cleveland Browns NFL franchise to Baltimore to become the Baltimore Ravens in 1996. Phoenix was never one of the USFL's strongest markets but still managed to lure the former St. Louis Football Cardinals to take up residence in Arizona in 1988. Oakland saw the return of the Raiders to its city one decade after the demise of the USFL (the team moved again, to Las Vegas, in 2020). Other cities that did not get NFL franchises, such as Birmingham, Memphis, Orlando, and San Antonio, would receive teams in numerous short-lived or international pro football leagues in the years that have followed, such as the WLAF, CFL, the first XFL, UFL, and AAF. The 2022 revival of the USFL began with eight franchises that were in existence during the 1984 USFL season, including the Birmingham Stallions. Also, three decades after the USFL's failure, the NFL played the 2017 Pro Bowl in Orlando.\nOutside the NFL, Tampa's embrace of Bandit Ball and the rapid growth of the Sun Belt prompted the establishment of other major league teams in the Tampa Bay area: the National Hockey League's Lightning and Major League Baseball's Devil Rays (later renamed the Rays).\nThe collapse of the USFL had a particularly positive effect on the NFL's Buffalo Bills. The Bills, as a small-market NFL franchise, were particularly hard-hit by the USFL; as its players from the moderately successful early 1980s era aged, the team was unable to find quality replacements for them on the free agent market, as the USFL was drawing away much of pro football's top talent (including Bills running back Joe Cribbs and the team's planned franchise quarterback of the future, Jim Kelly). With subpar talent, the Bills went 4\u201328 over the course of 1984 and 1985, and average attendance at Rich Stadium plummeted to under 30,000 fans per game, putting the team's long-term viability in jeopardy. When the USFL collapsed, the Bills signed a large number of former USFL players: Kelly, Kent Hull, Ray Bentley, special teams coach Bruce DeHaven, general manager Bill Polian and coach Marv Levy, which, combined with the high draft picks compiled during the USFL years, would allow the Bills to rise to perennial Super Bowl contenders by the early 1990s. In 2014, after founding owner Ralph Wilson died, Trump tried to purchase the Bills, but was largely rebuffed in favor of Terry Pegula, who bid $400 million more for the team. In a 2015 interview with Sports Illustrated, Trump claimed that if he had bought the Bills in 2014, he \"probably would not be\" running for President of the United States the following year.\nThe league also had an indirect impact on the scheduling of televised football games. The USFL had planned to go against the NFL in the fall of 1986 without directly playing its games opposite the larger league by playing its games on Sunday nights, when the NFL did not play yet. One year later, ESPN and the NFL launched \"Sunday Night Football\" in the time slot.\nThe last player of the USFL on an NFL roster was Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars punter Sean Landeta, who was signed in late 1986 by the New York Giants. He officially announced his retirement on March 6, 2008, the 25th anniversary of the first USFL game. (He last played in 2006 but he did not officially retire during the 2007 season.) The last non-kicker to retire was quarterback Doug Flutie, who played in both the CFL and NFL until 2005.\nRule changes.\nThe USFL, compared to other professional leagues of the late 20th and 21st centuries, did not radically change the rules of the game; its rules largely resembled a hybrid of the NFL and college football rulebooks. The league's rule on stopping the clock was one example of this hybrid approach: outside the two-minute warning, the clock ran between plays after a first down like in the NFL, while after the warning, it stopped between the end of the play that earned a first down and the placement of the ball back into play (to allow the chain crew to get into place), as is done in college football. Like college football, it recognized the two-point conversion (that was, at that time, only recognized in the CFL at the professional level) that would not be put into NFL rules until 1994. Unlike other American professional football leagues (but like the NCAA then and the CFL), the USFL allowed the usage of a small, plastic \"tee\" for extra point and field goal attempts.\nFor its final season in 1985, the USFL used a method of challenging officials' rulings on the field via instant replay, using a system that is almost identical to that used by the NFL today; the NFL would adopt its first instant replay system (but in a different form from its current one instituted in 1999) in 1986; it would be used until 1991.\nNotable people and achievements.\nUSFL alumni in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nAs of 2022, there are nine USFL alumni (including five players and two head coaches) who are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame:\nTeams.\nProjected 1986 teams in gray\n3: Philadelphia (83, 84) / Baltimore (85) Stars\n2: Michigan Panthers (83, 84), Oakland Invaders (83, 85), New Jersey Generals (84, 85), Birmingham Stallions (84, 85), Tampa Bay Bandits (84, 85), Houston Gamblers (84, 85)\n1: Chicago Blitz (83), Arizona Wranglers (84), Los Angeles Express (84), Memphis Showboats (85), Denver Gold (85)\n1986 proposal.\nPrior to the jury award in \"USFL v. NFL\", the league had planned to go forward with a 1986 season with eight teams, divided into an \"Independence Division\" and a \"Liberty Division\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1 merged with Denver Gold\n2 merged with Houston Gamblers\nDue to the legal aftermath of the failed lawsuit against the NFL, the USFL folded and this divisional format never came to fruition.\nOut of the 23 USFL teams, only five played for the league's entire three-season duration without relocating or changing team names: Denver Gold, Los Angeles Express, Birmingham Stallions, New Jersey Generals, and Tampa Bay Bandits. Only the latter three teams would have remained on this list if the league had continued in 1986.\nChampionship games.\nThe 1985 game was originally to be played at the Pontiac Silverdome, but after the Panthers merged with Oakland, the game was awarded to Giants Stadium.\nHad there been a 1986 season, the championship game was scheduled to be played at Jacksonville's Gator Bowl Stadium on February 1, 1987.\nThe USFL's championship trophy had a silver USFL-logoed helmet with a gold facemask, mounted on a marble base by a swooping silver armature. On the base were mounted gold plaques with the names and scores of the teams in the USFL Championship Games. Like the NHL's Stanley Cup and the CFL's Grey Cup, but unlike the NFL's Vince Lombardi Trophy for their Super Bowl championship game, it was loaned to the winning team for one year rather than a new trophy being made each year for the winning team to keep. After the Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars won the final USFL championship in 1985, General Manager Carl Peterson kept the trophy, and donated it to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.\nDrafts.\nThe USFL held its 1983, 1985 and 1986 college drafts at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York. The 1984 draft was held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York. The 1983\u201385 drafts were in January while the 1986 draft was held in May.\nThe USFL held an expansion draft in September 1983 for the 6 expansion teams that started play in 1984. In December 1984, they had a dispersal draft for Chicago, Pittsburgh, Oklahoma and Michigan.\nIn addition to the four college drafts, the league also held three USFL Territorial Drafts that allowed teams to select collegiate players from within their geographic area before they entered the general collegiate draft.\nFirst overall pick in college drafts.\nOf the four first overall draft picks in its history, only 1984 top pick Mike Rozier actually played in the USFL. Dan Marino and Jerry Rice chose to play in the NFL, where they were also picked in the first round by the Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers, respectively, and each went on to have Hall of Fame careers. The USFL ceased operations soon after the 1986 draft, so Mike Haight never signed with nor played in the league, instead being drafted by the NFL's New York Jets.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its chief use is in the enlivening of plain surfaces.\nEtymology.\nFor the full etymology, see \"diaper\". The Oxford dictionary gives the Greek \"dia\" for \"cross\" as in \"diamond\" or \"diagonal\"; and \"aspros\", Greek for \"white\". A white diamond or white cloth is used on the diagonal, hence the diagonal lattice or reticulation in patterning.\nIn art.\nIn architecture and other decorative arts, diaper is applied as a decorative treatment of a surface with a repeat pattern of squares (chequers), rectangles, or lozenges. Diaper was particularly used in medieval stained glass to increase the vividness of a coloured pane, for example the field in a shield of arms. A stone wall may be decorated with such a pattern sculpted in relief; in brickwork the effect may be achieved by using bricks of different colours, or by allowing certain bricks to protrude from the wall's surface to create a regular diamond-shaped pattern. In English flushwork, limestone and dark knapped flint are used. Windows may be set in a diamond-shaped lattice. In the manuscripts the diapering was used as an alternative to the gold ground primarily from the late 13th to 15th century, eventually replaced by the landscape background.\nIn Chinese carved lacquer, a convention developed by which the areas of sky, water and floor or ground that would be left largely blank in paintings are filled in with discreet patterns derived from textiles, known as \"diaper backgrounds\" and also \"brocade-grounds\" ( , lit. \u2018embroidery[-like] background\u2019); this convention has continued to modern times. They are also used on porcelains, especially borders.\nTextiles.\nDiaper in textiles refers to richly decorated fabrics with a small geometrical or floral pattern that consists of the constant repetition of one or more simple figures or units of design evenly spaced. The term was initially associated with silk with diamond patterns later applied to linen and cotton fabrics of similar designs.\nHeraldry.\nIn heraldry, diapering is a technique in which those who emblazon, draw, paint, or otherwise depict achievements of arms decorate large areas of flat colour by drawing crosshatches or arabesques. There is no standard, and each artist is allowed individual idiosyncrasies.\nExcluded from blazon.\nWith very rare exceptions, diapering is not a part of the blazon, but is mere decoration, or ornamental accessory. Thus a shield with diapering is considered the same as a shield of the same design but without diapering. For this reason diapering must not be so obtrusive or so heavily drawn that it could be mistaken for a substantive charge or for a variation of the field. This is especially the case with diaper of simple cross-hatching which might be mistaken for a field of lozengy.\nExceptions.\nThere are at least three Scots coats whose blazon includes diaper: \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Surf was most recently a member of the Can-Am League, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The Surf played its home games at Surf Stadium, which was formerly known as \"The Sandcastle\" and \"Bernie Robbins Stadium\"\nFrom 1998 to 2006, the Surf played in the South Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. While in the Atlantic League, the Surf won the first-ever Atlantic League championship in 1998 while also hosting the inaugural Atlantic League All-Star game.\nOn March 30, 2009, the Atlantic City Surf organization ceased operations, leaving the Can-Am League with six teams. Players from the team were made available in an April 3, 2009 dispersal draft.\nOn May 17, 2018, Atlantic City's City Council authorized Frank Boulton, the former owner of the Atlantic City Surf (Independent Professional, Can-Am League/Atlantic League) to find an ownership group willing to bring minor league baseball back to Surf Stadium. The team was to compete in the 2019 season \u2014 however success quickly became \"unlikely\" and there currently are no indications that professional baseball will return to Atlantic City.\nEarlier Atlantic City baseball teams.\nAtlantic City historically has never enjoyed much success as a venue for professional sports teams and baseball has been no exception. The city hosted a few short-lived, unnamed teams in various leagues in the 19th century, then provided a home for the defunct Lancaster Red Roses of the Tri-State League in 1912. The franchise played one more season in Atlantic City in 1913 before disbanding.\nBacharach Giants.\nIn 1916, the Bacharach Giants moved to Atlantic City. Originally known as the Duval Giants of Jacksonville, Florida, its name was changed to the Bacharach Giants in honor of the city's mayor, Harry Bacharach. The team was independent from 1916 to 1922, then became a member of the Eastern Colored League from 1923 until the league's folding during the 1928 season, winning the league in 1926 and 1927 under the leadership of Dick Lundy. Other notable players for the Giants included Oliver Marcelle, Smokey Joe Williams, \"Pop\" Lloyd, and Arthur \"Rats\" Henderson. The team became affiliated with the American Negro League in 1929, and continued in the Negro National League in 1932, when it folded as a professional team.\nAtlantic City Surf.\nIn 1998, the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball placed a team in Atlantic City called the Surf. Opening their new ballpark called The Sandcastle on May 20, the Surf was defeated by the Somerset Patriots by a score of 8-5. Playing host to the first Atlantic League All-Star game on July 15, the Surf defeated the League All-Stars 6-4 and would later win the league's first Championship Series over the Bridgeport Bluefish, three games to one. The Surf made it to the post-season four times in five years (2002 and 2004\u201306) but were eliminated in the first round each time.\nIn 2007, the Surf moved from the Atlantic League to the Can-Am League. In 2007 the Surf made the playoffs in their inaugural season in the Can-Am. The team managed by Chris Carminucci finished with the 2nd best overall record of 51-41. In the playoffs lost to the North Shore Spirit 3 games to 1 in the opening round. The Surf received many awards in 2007. Carminucci received manager of the year. Starting pitcher Brian Rodaway received Pitcher of the Year Award after finishing a league-best 15-3. Relief pitcher Matt Pike received the Reliever of the Year award for his league leading 24 saves. In 2008 the Surf hired Cecil Fielder as the team manager. The Surf continued their success finishing 51-43 (4th overall record) and once again in the playoffs, this time losing to the Quebec Capitales 3 games to 1 in the opening round.\nOn March 30, 2009, the Can-Am League announced the Surf would not be operating in the 2009 season due to the collapse of the proposed sale of the team and lack of ownership to continue for the 2009 season.

It had no members of the Sejm, Senate, or European Parliament.\nIts foundation was publicly announced on 28 February 2005 and formally established on 9 May 2005 as an 'enlargement' of the Freedom Union, which it legally succeeded. At the 2007 election to the Sejm, the party ran as part of the Left and Democrats (LiD) list, and won three of the alliance's 53 seats. These members left the party in 2009 to join the newly revived Democratic Party. The party was dissolved on 12 November 2016 to form Union of European Democrats.\nThe party was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Party.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe Democratic Party was formed on the initiative of Freedom Union chairman W\u0142adys\u0142aw Frasyniuk, together with the social-democratic economist Jerzy Hausner, until recently a member of the governing post-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), and prominent Christian democrat, former UW member Tadeusz Mazowiecki. It was since strongly supported, but thus far not yet officially joined, by then Prime Minister Marek Belka and centrist members of the Democratic Left Alliance. Although it attracted considerable media attention and support from many Polish intellectuals, it received only 2.5% of the vote (and no seats in parliament) in the Polish parliamentary election in October 2005.\nCharacteristics.\nThe core of the Democratic Party is made up by the members of the Freedom Union (\"Unia Wolno\u015bci\", UW), which had so far been the most important Christian democratic group in the Polish political landscape. Since its inception in 1994, the UW had to cope with internal frictions between various factions: liberals (such as Leszek Balcerowicz), those proposing a more liberal economic agenda in a more conservative, bourgeois guise (such as Donald Tusk), more progressive social democrats such as Jacek Kuro\u0144, and intellectual former civil rights activists such as Bronis\u0142aw Geremek or Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who also has a strong background in liberal Catholicism and leans towards Christian democracy.\nIn 2001, these frictions \u2013 combined with the prospect of a devastating defeat in the upcoming election \u2013 led to an exodus of conservative and liberal conservative members around Tusk who joined former members of the UW's senior coalition partner, the conservative Solidarity Electoral Action, to form the new party Civic Platform.\n2001 Election failure.\nIn the 2001 general elections, the Freedom Union received only 3.1% and thus failed to cross the 5% threshold required to gain entry to Parliament. With W\u0142adys\u0142aw Frasyniuk replacing Geremek as chairman, the Freedom Union continued to exist as a centrist party, but lost much of its relevance in Polish politics. It was enjoying the support of approximately 3% of voters, to fall to 1% and below in 2009.\nEuropean election success.\nHowever, probably due to low voter turnout, the party managed to cross the required 5% threshold in the 2004 European Parliament elections, receiving 7% of votes and 4 out of 54 seats reserved for Poland in the European Parliament as part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, of which it is a member.\nAfter 2005.\nOn 29 February 2005, Frasyniuk came out with the initiative to merge the UW into a new social-liberal party to be called \"the Democrats\", which he presented with Mazowiecki and Jerzy Hausner. Mazowiecki had left the UW in November 2002 after it had left the conservative and Christian democratic European People's Party in favour of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, and entered coalitions with the social-democratic Democratic Left Alliance and the far-left populist Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland party on the local level.\nAlliance with postcommunists.\nHausner, on the other hand, is an economist with a post-communist background. As minister of economic affairs and employment in the governments of Leszek Miller and Marek Belka, he conceived the so-called Hausner Plan (\"Plan Hausnera\"), a programme for market-socialist reform concerning state-owned business, public administration, and social security. After his reform met with persistent opposition, he left the SLD in a much debated move on 7 February 2005 and resigned from office on 30 March 2005.\nFrom the beginning, Frasyniuk, Hausner and Mazowiecki appealed to Prime Minister Marek Belka to join the party. Belka, another former SLD member, had left the party in the early 1990s, but joined Leszek Miller's government as a non-party minister of economic affairs in 2001 before resigning the following year. After an interlude as economic director in the interim coalition administration of Iraq in 2003, Belka returned to Poland to become non-party head of an SLD minority government in 2004.\nThe involvement of Hausner and Belka as prominent post-communists marks a first in Polish politics: for the first time, a political party is created by members of the former communist government and former opposition members. Also, while the UW was a somewhat elitist party appealing mostly to educated and affluent urban voters, the PD is trying to establish itself as a populist party with a broad appeal, which caters for centrist social-liberals (Frasyniuk), pragmatic centrists with leanings toward economic liberalism (Hausner) and centrist Christian democrats (Mazowiecki).\nAs of 27 May 2005, the party claimed to have 13,000+ members, out of which 8,000 were members of the Freedom Union. It defined itself as, \"above all, a group of young people not previously involved in politics, which at the same time is drawing on the best traditions of the liberal-democratic milieu around the Freedom Union\" http://. Despite this statement the party is made of several former politicians, who had run Poland before, as well as including ex-members of SLD who left the party when it faced a corruption crisis.\nA manifesto entitled \"Development through Democracy\" issued by the party in February 2005 was signed by a broad range of Polish intellectuals and artists, including Pawe\u0142 Huelle (writer), Marek Edelman (physician, last surviving leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Rising), Agnieszka Holland (director), Marek Kondrat (actor), Kazimierz Kutz (director), Jan Miodek (linguist), Daniel Olbrychski (actor), Jerzy Pilch (writer), Henryk Samsonowicz (historian), Jerzy Szacki (sociologist). Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa's son Jaros\u0142aw Wa\u0142\u0119sa also signed the manifesto.\nAfter 2006.\nIn 2006, the party created the Left and Democrats (LiD) political coalition with the Democratic Left Alliance, Social Democracy of Poland and Labour Union. It continued to join the coalition for the parliamentary elections 2007. It gained 3 parliamentary seats in the lower chamber of Polish Diet. The coalition was ended in March 2008, and 3 democratic members of parliament formed their own parliamentary group.\nThe Democrats gathered only 25,937 votes in the 2009 European elections, reaching similar support as the newly founded Polish green party Greens 2004. This outcome was seen as a defeat. In June 2009 two of the elected parliamentarists left the party. On 10 January, Brygida Ku\u017aniak became a new leader of Democrats, beating former deputy leader Bogdan Lis. Currently, also the third parliamentarist switched to the Democratic Party (\"Stronnictwo Demokratyczne\"), as well as many prominent leaders that do not share the new shift in party's ideology.\nThe party joined the Europa Plus political alliance on 24 June 2013.\nOn 12 November 2016, the party was dissolved and merged with the European Democrats club at the Sejm to form a new party called Union of European Democrats, which is generally less progressive and more moderate conservative than Democratic Party was.\nIdeology.\nThe party was a direct successor of the Freedom Union and attempted to extend the original voter coalition of the Freedom Union by left-leaning voter groups. The party wanted to appeal to the urban, liberal middle class, and its proposals included a creation of a special metropolitan voivodeship for Warsaw. At the same time, it worked with social democratic parties, such as the Democratic Left Alliance and Social Democracy of Poland, although there were few proposals all three parties agreed to, such as the need to bail out indebted hospitals and to build an anti-missile shield in Poland. The Democratic Party however also stressed its distance to centre-left parties, and stressed its ideological centrism.\nKey proposals of the party include:\nPopular support.\nThe Freedom Union's transformation into the Democratic Party has not significantly increased voter support for the centrists, which since autumn 2004 has been oscillating between 3% and 6%. In June 2005, it was at 4% and has since deteriorated; in the parliamentary elections of September 2005, it reached 2.5%, failing to overcome the election threshold of 5%. Because the party received less than 3%, it does not receive refunds of its campaign costs. It also lacks significant presence in the media as a consequence of its poor election result, which has further diminished its appeal. In December 2005, the party merely reached 1% of support in a poll. As a result, some political observers question the party's ability to further continue in its present shape.\nCriticism.\nThe Democratic Party has attracted criticism from other former oppositionists from communist times, who criticise that the party accepts former members of the post-communist SLD, and strongly opposes the large-scale vetting of officials and politicians (see Bronis\u0142aw Wildstein) aimed at eliminating former state agents from political life. Also, the party's formal electoral and later parliamentary coalition with SLD, Left and Democrats, which lasted from 2006 until 2008, has been seen as disloyalty of Solidarity's ideals by many.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They played their home games at The Ballpark at Harbor Yard from 1998 to 2017.\nThe franchise had announced it would relocate to High Point, North Carolina, in 2019, but ceased operations instead. In its place, a new franchise not connected to the Bluefish began play in High Point called the High Point Rockers.\nHistory of Bridgeport baseball.\nThe game of baseball was first played in Bridgeport, Connecticut soon after the Civil War ended. Teams that called the city home included the Victors, Soubrettes, Orators, Crossmen, Mechanics, Hustlers, Bolts, Americans, Bees, and Bears. Bridgeport was the home of Major Leaguer James \"Orator\" O'Rourke, who signed the first African-American to play for a professional baseball team in 1895.\nVisiting Major League and Negro league teams often played exhibition games in the shadow of the Bridgeport's smokestacks. The last affiliated minor league baseball team, the Bridgeport Bees, played in the Interstate League and the Colonial League from 1941 to 1950. Professional baseball was not played in Bridgeport for about another half-century, until the arrival of the Bluefish in 1998.\nBridgeport Bluefish.\nThe first game of the Bridgeport Bluefish was May 21, 1998. The team has been to five Atlantic League Championship Series. It won in 1999 against the Somerset Patriots and lost to Atlantic City in 1998, Newark in 2002, Lancaster in 2006, and York in 2010.\nSome of the former major leaguers who have worn Bluefish jerseys include Endy Ch\u00e1vez, Shea Hillenbrand, Alex Hinshaw, Jos\u00e9 Offerman, Edgardo Alfonzo, Deivi Cruz, Junior Spivey, Quinton McCracken, Antonio Alfonseca, Willy Mo Pena, Joey Gathright, Adam Greenberg, and Mariano Duncan.\nThe Bluefish won their first league championship in 1999, led by their inaugural manager, and long time major leaguer \u2013 Willie Upshaw. The Bluefish have won the most games in Atlantic League history. The land under The Ballpark at Harbor Yard was purchased by the city of Bridgeport from Donald Trump for $1 and with the forgiveness of back taxes owed on the property. The Jenkins Valve plant was demolished to make way for the stadium. The success of the Bluefish led to redevelopment of the South End, including construction of the Arena at Harbor Yard and a multiuse parking garage.\nThe founders of the Bluefish were Mickey Herbert, Jack McGregor, Mary\u2013Jane Foster, and the Bridgeport Waterfront Investors. Herbert anchored the team through a mayoral scandal and difficult financial circumstances. Prior to the 2006 season, the franchise was purchased by Get Hooked, LLC, a group of investors from Fairfield County that included McGregor and Foster. However, Get Hooked dropped the Bluefish prior to the 2008 season in favor of seeking a new ballpark for the city of Yonkers, New York. The Bluefish were purchased by Frank Boulton, who is also the owner of the Long Island Ducks and the founder of the Atlantic League.\nThe Bluefish became the first team in Atlantic League history to record 1,000 victories as a franchise in 2012. On June 27, 2012, the team defeated the York Revolution 2\u20131 at the Ballpark at Harbor Yard to capture the victory.\nFor one day in May 2016, Jennie Finch was a guest manager for the Bluefish, thus becoming the first woman to manage a professional baseball team. The team played and won one game that day.\nIn April 2017, the City of High Point, North Carolina, approved $15\u00a0million from the city budget to begin land acquisition and engineering studies for a new $45\u00a0million, publicly funded stadium to be financed through limited-obligation tax bonds. The stadium was expected to be the new home for the Bluefish in 2019. It had yet to be determined where (or if) the Bluefish would play in 2018.\nOn August 8, 2017, the Bluefish announced that the 2017 season would be the team's last in Bridgeport. On September 17, the Bluefish played the final game in their 20-year history at the Ballpark at Harbor Yard, losing 9\u20132 to the Somerset Patriots. Despite having the best overall record in the Liberty Division, the Bluefish missed the playoffs, as they finished one game back of the Patriots in the first\u2013half standings and two games back of their cross-sound rival Long Island Ducks in the second half.\nThough it had been planned for the Bluefish to relocate to High Point, later the team ceased operations at the end of the 2017 season. High Point got an expansion franchise that is not connected to the Bluefish (the High Point Rockers).\nThe Ballpark at Harbor Yard was converted to a concert venue known as Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater. A groundbreaking ceremony for the replacement amphitheater was held in July 2018. The amphitheater opened July 28, 2021.\nLogos and uniforms.\nThe official colors of the Bridgeport Bluefish were navy blue, teal, and silver. The primary logo consisted of the \"Bluefish\" wordmark in navy blue with white and teal outline superimposed over a depiction of a cartoon bluefish holding a baseball bat.\nThe primary cap was navy blue with a teal brim and button, with the cap logo depicting a bluefish interwoven with a capital \"B\" centered on the front. The home jersey was white with traditional navy blue piping below the collar and around the sleeves. The \"Bluefish\" wordmark is centered across the front in navy blue with white outline and teal drop shadow. The away jersey is grey with navy blue piping, and the \"Bridgeport\" wordmark centered across the front in navy blue with a white and teal outline. The Bluefish also have a teal alternate jersey, with navy piping with the \"fishhook\" wordmark centered across the front.\nFerry Cup.\nThe Bridgeport Bluefish contend with the Long Island Ducks over the Ferry Cup, which is sponsored by the Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Steamboat Company. The two teams border on Long Island Sound, and many fans of both teams regularly cross it to support them. The Ducks currently hold the Ferry Cup by winning the 2011 season series 12\u20136. As of 2011 the Bluefish-Ducks rivalry record is 114\u2013112, in favor of Bridgeport.\nMascots.\nOne of the Bridgeport Bluefish official mascots is an anthropomorphic bluefish named B.B. He wears the team's alternate jersey (number 98) with black sneakers. B.B. was born on May 29, 1997, in Cape Hatteras. He later migrated to the Long Island Sound and joined the Bluefish soon after. The mascot's name alludes to the initials of the team and its nickname.\nCaptain L.I Sounder is another source of entertainment at the Harbor Yard. He wears a uniform of a sailor. L.I Sounder's name referred to the nautical rank of captain and a name for a Long Island Sound resident. Sounder occasionally appears at Bluefish home games.\nGuest managers.\nOn several occasions, the Bluefish had promotional nights in which former baseball players and managers, as well as other celebrities, have been enlisted to serve as guest managers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were a member of the Liberty Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, then unaffiliated with Major League Baseball. The Riversharks played their home games at Campbell's Field, which was situated at the base of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. Due to its location on the Delaware River, the ballpark offered a clear view of the Philadelphia skyline. The \"Riversharks\" name referred to the location of Camden on the Delaware River, and the primary logo incorporated the Benjamin Franklin Bridge that links Camden to Philadelphia.\nOn October 21, 2015, the Camden Riversharks announced they would cease operations immediately due to the inability to reach an agreement on lease terms with the owner of Campbell's Field, the Camden County Improvement Authority (the authority had purchased Campbell's Field from Rutgers University two months prior). \nThe Riversharks were replaced by the New Britain Bees, a separate franchise for the 2016 season.\nHistory of Camden baseball.\nThe Riversharks were not the first baseball team to call Camden home. The Camden Merritt, named for former state senator Albert Merritt, of the Interstate Association played there in 1883, and disbanded the same year. Another team from the Tri-State League played in Camden in 1904, and they too disbanded, during the season. The inception of the Riversharks in 2001 was the first professional baseball team in Camden since the 1904 season.\nLogos and uniforms.\nThe team colors of the Camden Riversharks were navy blue, Columbia blue, and white.

{"id": "65533", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65533", "title": "Business model", "text": "Description of how businesses operate\nA business model describes how a business organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural or other contexts. The model describes the specific way in which the business conducts itself, spends, and earns money in a way that generates profit. The process of business model construction and modification is also called \"business model innovation\" and forms a part of business strategy.\nIn theory and practice, the term \"business model\" is used for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of an organization or business, including purpose, business process, target customers, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, organizational structures, profit structures, sourcing, trading practices, and operational processes and policies including culture.\nContext.\nThe literature has provided very diverse interpretations and definitions of a business model. A systematic review and analysis of manager responses to a survey defines business models as the design of organizational structures to enact a commercial opportunity. Further extensions to this design logic emphasize the use of narrative or coherence in business model descriptions as mechanisms by which entrepreneurs create extraordinarily successful growth firms.\nBusiness models are used to describe and classify businesses, especially in an entrepreneurial setting, but they are also used by managers inside companies to explore possibilities for future development. Well-known business models can operate as \"recipes\" for creative managers. Business models are also referred to in some instances within the context of accounting for purposes of public reporting.\nHistory.\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term \"business model\", a compound of business and model, was first used in 1832 in the sense of \"a plan for the operation of a business\".\nOver the years, business models have become much more sophisticated. The \"bait and hook\" business model (also referred to as the \"razor and blades business model\" or the \"tied products business model\") was introduced in the early 20th century. This involves offering a basic product at a very low cost, often at a loss (the \"bait\"), then charging compensatory recurring amounts for refills or associated products or services (the \"hook\"). Examples include: razor (bait) and blades (hook); cell phones (bait) and air time (hook); computer printers (bait) and ink cartridge refills (hook); and cameras (bait) and prints (hook). A variant of this model was employed by Adobe, a software developer that gave away its document reader free of charge but charged several hundred dollars for its document writer.\nIn the 1950s, new business models came from McDonald's Restaurants and Toyota. In the 1960s, the innovators were Wal-Mart and Hypermarkets. The 1970s saw new business models from FedEx and Toys R Us; the 1980s from Blockbuster, Home Depot, Intel, and Dell Computer; the 1990s from Southwest Airlines, Netflix, eBay, Amazon.com, and Starbucks.\nToday, the type of business models might depend on how technology is used. For example, entrepreneurs on the internet have also created new models that depend entirely on existing or emergent technology. Using technology, businesses can reach a large number of customers with minimal costs. In addition, the rise of outsourcing and globalization has meant that business models must also account for strategic sourcing, complex supply chains and moves to collaborative, relational contracting structures.\nTheoretical and empirical insights.\nDesign logic and narrative coherence.\nDesign logic views the business model as an outcome of creating new organizational structures or changing existing structures to pursue a new opportunity. Gerry George and Adam Bock (2011) conducted a comprehensive literature review and surveyed managers to understand how they perceived the components of a business model. In that analysis these authors show that there is a design logic behind how entrepreneurs and managers perceive and explain their business model. In further extensions to the design logic, George and Bock (2012) use case studies and the IBM survey data on business models in large companies, to describe how CEOs and entrepreneurs create narratives or stories in a coherent manner to move the business from one opportunity to another. They also show that when the narrative is incoherent or the components of the story are misaligned, that these businesses tend to fail. They recommend ways in which the entrepreneur or CEO can create strong narratives for change. The business model concept is not without its critics (e.g., redundancy) and suggestions for further extensions (e.g., to nonmonetary exchange).\nComplementarities between partnering firms.\nBerglund and Sandstr\u00f6m (2013) argued that business models should be understood from an open systems perspective as opposed to being a firm-internal concern. Since innovating firms do not have executive control over their surrounding network, business model innovation tends to require soft power tactics with the goal of aligning heterogeneous interests. In a study of collaborative research and external sourcing of technology, Hummel et al. (2010) similarly found that in deciding on business partners, it is important to make sure that both parties' business models are complementary. For example, they found that it was important to identify the value drivers of potential partners by analyzing their business models, and that it is beneficial to find partner firms that understand key aspects of one's own firm's business model.\nThe University of Tennessee conducted research into highly collaborative business relationships. Researchers codified their research into a sourcing business model known as Vested Outsourcing, a hybrid sourcing business model in which buyers and suppliers in an outsourcing or business relationship focus on shared values and goals to create an arrangement that is highly collaborative and mutually beneficial to each.\nCategorization.\nFrom about 2012, some research and experimentation has theorized about a so-called \"liquid business model\".\nShift from pipes to platforms.\nSangeet Paul Choudary distinguishes between two broad families of business models in an article in \"Wired\" magazine. Choudary contrasts pipes (linear business models) with platforms (networked business models). In the case of pipes, firms create goods and services, push them out and sell them to customers. Value is produced upstream and consumed downstream. There is a linear flow, much like water flowing through a pipe. Unlike pipes, platforms do not just create and push stuff out. They allow users to create and consume value.\nAlex Moazed, founder and CEO of Applico, defines a platform as a business model that creates value by facilitating exchanges between two or more interdependent groups, usually consumers and producers, of a given value. As a result of digital transformation, it is the predominant business model of the 21st century.\nIn an op-ed on MarketWatch, Choudary, Van Alstyne and Parker further explain how business models are moving from pipes to platforms, leading to disruption of entire industries.\nPlatform.\nThere are three elements to a successful platform business model. The \"toolbox\" creates connection by making it easy for others to plug into the platform. This infrastructure enables interactions between participants. The \"magnet\" creates pull that attracts participants to the platform. For transaction platforms, both producers and consumers must be present to achieve critical mass. The \"matchmaker\" fosters the flow of value by making connections between producers and consumers. Data is at the heart of successful matchmaking, and distinguishes platforms from other business models.\nChen (2009) stated that the business model has to take into account the capabilities of Web 2.0, such as collective intelligence, network effects, user-generated content, and the possibility of self-improving systems. He suggested that the service industry such as the airline, traffic, transportation, hotel, restaurant, information and communications technology and online gaming industries will be able to benefit in adopting business models that take into account the characteristics of Web 2.0. He also emphasized that Business Model 2.0 has to take into account not just the technology effect of Web 2.0 but also the networking effect. He gave the example of the success story of Amazon in making huge revenues each year by developing an open platform that supports a community of companies that re-use Amazon's on-demand commerce services.\nImpacts of platform business models.\nJose van Dijck (2013) identifies three main ways that media platforms choose to monetize, which mark a change from traditional business models. One is the subscription model, in which platforms charge users a small monthly fee in exchange for services. She notes that the model was ill-suited for those \"accustomed to free content and services\", leading to a variant, the freemium model. A second method is via advertising. Arguing that traditional advertising is no longer appealing to people used to \"user-generated content and social networking\", she states that companies now turn to strategies of customization and personalization in targeted advertising. Eric K. Clemons (2009) asserts that consumers no longer trust most commercial messages; Van Dijck argues platforms are able to circumvent the issue through personal recommendations from friends or influencers on social media platforms, which can serve as a more subtle form of advertisement. Finally, a third common business model is monetization of data and metadata generated from the use of platforms.\nApplications.\nMalone et al. found that some business models, as defined by them, indeed performed better than others in a dataset consisting of the largest U.S. firms, in the period 1998 through 2002, while they did not prove whether the existence of a business model mattered.\nIn the healthcare space, and in particular in companies that leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence, the design of business models is particularly challenging as there are a multitude of value creation mechanisms and a multitude of possible stakeholders. An emerging categorization has identified seven archetypes.\nThe concept of a business model has been incorporated into certain accounting standards. For example, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) utilizes an \"entity's business model for managing the financial assets\" as a criterion for determining whether such assets should be measured at amortized cost or at fair value in its International Financial Reporting Standard, IFRS 9. In their 2013 proposal for accounting for financial instruments, the Financial Accounting Standards Board also proposed a similar use of business model for classifying financial instruments. The concept of business model has also been introduced into the accounting of deferred taxes under International Financial Reporting Standards with 2010 amendments to IAS 12 addressing deferred taxes related to investment property.\nBoth IASB and FASB have proposed using the concept of business model in the context of reporting a lessor's lease income and lease expense within their joint project on accounting for leases. In its 2016 lease accounting model, IFRS 16, the IASB chose not to include a criterion of \"stand alone utility\" in its lease definition because \"entities might reach different conclusions for contracts that contain the same rights of use, depending on differences between customers' resources or suppliers' business models.\" The concept has also been proposed as an approach for determining the measurement and classification when accounting for insurance contracts. As a result of the increasing prominence the concept of business model has received in the context of financial reporting, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), which advises the European Union on endorsement of financial reporting standards, commenced a project on the \"Role of the Business Model in Financial Reporting\" in 2011.\nDesign.\nBusiness model design generally refers to the activity of designing a company's business model. It is part of the business development and business strategy process and involves design methods. Massa and Tucci (2014) highlighted the difference between crafting a new business model when none is in place, as it is often the case with academic spinoffs and high technology entrepreneurship, and changing an existing business model, such as when the tooling company Hilti shifted from selling its tools to a leasing model. They suggested that the differences are so profound (for example, lack of resource in the former case and inertia and conflicts with existing configurations and organisational structures in the latter) that it could be worthwhile to adopt different terms for the two. They suggest business model design to refer to the process of crafting a business model when none is in place and business model reconfiguration for the process of changing an existing business model, also highlighting that the two processes are not mutually exclusive, meaning reconfiguration may involve steps which parallel those of designing a business model.\nEconomic consideration.\nAl-Debei and Avison (2010) consider value finance as one of the main dimensions of business modelling which depicts information related to costing, pricing methods, and revenue structure. Stewart and Zhao (2000) defined the business model as \"a statement of how a firm will make money and sustain its profit stream over time.\"\nComponent consideration.\nOsterwalder et al. (2005) consider the Business Model as the blueprint of how a company does business. Slywotzky (1996) regards the business model as \"the totality of how a company selects its customers, defines and differentiates it offerings, defines the tasks it will perform itself and those it will outsource, configures its resources, goes to market, creates utility for customers and captures profits.\"\nStrategic outcome.\nMayo and Brown (1999) considered the business model as \"the design of key interdependent systems that create and sustain a competitive business.\" Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart (2011) explain a business model as a set of \"choices (policy, assets and governance)\" and \"consequences (flexible and rigid)\" and underline the importance of considering \"how it interacts with models of other players in the industry\" instead of thinking of it in isolation.\nDefinitions of design or development.\nZott and Amit (2009) consider business model design from the perspectives of design themes and design content. Design themes refer to the system's dominant value creation drivers and design content examines in greater detail the activities to be performed, the linking and sequencing of the activities and who will perform the activities.\nDesign themes emphasis.\nDeveloping a framework for business model development with an emphasis on design themes, Lim (2010) proposed the environment-strategy-structure-operations (ESSO) business model development which takes into consideration the alignment of the organization's strategy with the organization's structure, operations, and the environmental factors in achieving competitive advantage in varying combination of cost, quality, time, flexibility, innovation and affective.\nDesign content emphasis.\nBusiness model design includes the modeling and description of a company's:\nA business model design template can facilitate the process of designing and describing a company's business model. In a paper published in 2017, Johnson demonstrated how matrix methods may usefully be deployed to characterise the architecture of resources, costs, and revenues that a business uses to create and deliver value to customers which defines its business model. Systematisation of this technique (Johnson settles on a business genomic code of seven matrix elements of a business model) would support a taxonomical approach to empirical studies of business models in the same way that Linnaeus' taxonomy revolutionised biology.\nDaas et al. (2012) developed a decision support system (DSS) for business model design. In their study a decision support system (DSS) is developed to help SaaS in this process, based on a design approach consisting of a design process that is guided by various design methods.\nExamples.\nIn the early history of business models it was very typical to define business model types such as bricks-and-mortar or e-broker. However, these types usually describe only one aspect of the business (most often the revenue model). Therefore, more recent literature on business models concentrate on describing a business model as a whole, instead of only the most visible aspects.\nThe following examples provide an overview for various business model types that have been in discussion since the invention of term \"business model\":\nOther examples of business models are:\nFrameworks.\nTechnology centric communities have defined \"frameworks\" for business modeling. These frameworks attempt to define a rigorous approach to defining business value streams. It is not clear, however, to what extent such frameworks are actually important for business planning. Business model frameworks represent the core aspect of any company; they involve \"the totality of how a company selects its customers defines and differentiates its offerings, defines the tasks it will perform itself and those it will outsource, configures its resource, goes to market, creates utility for customers, and captures profits\". A business framework involves internal factors (market analysis; products/services promotion; development of trust; social influence and knowledge sharing) and external factors (competitors and technological aspects).\nBusiness reference model is a reference model, concentrating on the architectural aspects of the core business of an enterprise, service organization or government agency.\nTechnique developed by IBM to model and analyze an enterprise. It is a logical representation or map of business components or \"building blocks\" and can be depicted on a single page. It can be used to analyze the alignment of enterprise strategy with the organization's capabilities and investments, identify redundant or overlapping business capabilities, etc.\nBusiness model used in strategic management and services marketing that treats service provision as an industrial process, subject to industrial optimization procedures\nDeveloped by A. Osterwalder, Yves Pigneur, Alan Smith, and 470 practitioners from 45 countries, the business model canvas is one of the most used frameworks for describing the elements of business models.\nThe OGSM is developed by Marc van Eck and Ellen van Zanten of Business Openers into the 'Business plan on 1 page'. Translated in several languages all over the world. #1 Management book in The Netherlands in 2015. The foundation of Business plan on 1 page is the OGSM. Objectives, Goals, Strategies and Measures (dashboard and actions).\nRelated concepts.\nThe process of business model design is part of business strategy. Business model design and innovation refer to the way a firm (or a network of firms) defines its business logic at the strategic level.\nIn contrast, firms implement their business model at the operational level, through their business operations. This refers to their process-level activities, capabilities, functions and infrastructure (for example, their business processes and business process modeling), their organizational structures (e.g. organograms, workflows, human resources) and systems (e.g. information technology architecture, production lines).\nThe brand is a consequence of the business model and has a symbiotic relationship with it, because the business model determines the brand promise, and the brand equity becomes a feature of the model. Managing this is a task of integrated marketing.\nThe standard terminology and examples of business models do not apply to most nonprofit organizations, since their sources of income are generally not the same as the beneficiaries. The term 'funding model' is generally used instead.\nThe model is defined by the organization's vision, mission, and values, as well as sets of boundaries for the organization\u2014what products or services it will deliver, what customers or markets it will target, and what supply and delivery channels it will use. Mission and vision together make part of the overall business purpose. While the business model includes high-level strategies and tactical direction for how the organization will implement the model, it also includes the annual goals that set the specific steps the organization intends to undertake in the next year and the measures for their expected accomplishment. Each of these is likely to be part of internal documentation that is available to the internal auditor.\nBusiness model innovation.\nWhen an organisation creates a new business model, the process is called business model innovation. There is a range of reviews on the topic, The concept facilitates the analysis and planning of transformations from one business model to another. Frequent and successful business model innovation can increase an organisation's resilience to changes in its environment and if an organisation has the capability to do this, it can become a competitive advantage. Although business model innovation promises financial returns, periods of radical business model innovation can reduce the person-organization fit and thus lead to a greater fluctuation in the workforce.\nBusiness model adaptation.\nAs a specific instance of business model dynamics, a research strand derived from the evolving changes in business models, BMA identifies an update of the current business model to changes derived from the context. BMA can be innovative or not, depending on the degree of novelty of the changes implemented. As a consequence of the new context, several business model elements are promoted to answer those challenges, pivoting the business model towards new models. Companies adapt their business model when someone or something such as COVID-19 has disrupted the market. BMA could fit any organization, but incumbents are more motivated to adapt their current BM than to change it radically or create a new one.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Ducks compete in the North Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB), an independent \"partner league\" of Major League Baseball. The Ducks played their first season in 2000, two years after the ALPB inaugural season. Since their inception, the Ducks' home ballpark has been Fairfield Properties Ballpark, formerly known as Bethpage Ballpark (2010-2020), Suffolk County Sports Park (1999 and 2010), EAB Park (2000\u20132001), and Citibank Park (2002\u20132009). The \"Ducks\" name refers to Long Island's duck-farming heritage (itself represented by the Big Duck ferrocement) and recalls the former Long Island Ducks professional ice hockey team. The team's first manager was Bud Harrelson, a part-owner of the team and a former major league player.\nHistory.\nThe Ducks, the only professional baseball team located on suburban Long Island, in New York State, east of New York City. They began play in 2000, and from 2000 to 2019 won four Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB ) championships. Team owner Frank Boulton expressed his contentment with the Ducks in 2007 to the publication \"Baseball America\", saying, \"The Long Island Ducks are the best thing I've ever done in baseball.\"\nA rivalry developed between the Ducks and the Bridgeport Bluefish, with the two teams contesting the \"Ferry Cup\" from 2009 until Bridgeport folded in 2017. The Ferry Cup name referred to its sponsor, the Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Steamboat Company, (which ran a ferry boat line across the Long Island Sound between Bridgeport, Connecticut and Port Jefferson on Long Island), which was frequently utilized by both of the teams and their fans for traveling to each ballpark in the two adjacent states.\nBaseball Hall of Famer Gary Carter managed the Ducks in 2009. Following Carter's death in 2012, the Ducks dedicated the season to his memory and wore a commemorative patch on their uniforms.\nFormer Major League Baseball players who have played on the Ducks include Dontrelle Willis, Ramon Castro, Ben Broussard, Leo Rosales, Josh Barfield, Bill Hall, Bryant Nelson, Ian Snell, Daniel Murphy, and Lew Ford. Rich Hill played with the Ducks in 2015, prior to his return to the majors in 2016 with the Boston Red Sox. In 2017, pitcher \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 attempted a professional baseball comeback with the Ducks; that same year, Nate Freiman, Henderson Alvarez, Quintin Berry, and Tim Melville played with the Ducks and later joined an MLB organization or foreign professional league.\nOn June 17, 2023, the Ducks became the winningest team in Atlantic League history, clinching their 1,581st win in a victory over the York Revolution of York, Pennsylvania.\nLogos and uniforms.\nThe Ducks' official colors are black, green, orange, and white. The primary logo features the \"Ducks\" wordmark in orange with black outline. The wordmark begins with a stylized, cartoon duck head in the form of a capital cursive \"D.\"\nSince 2015, OC Sports has been the official on-field headwear of the Atlantic League. The home caps are black with the duck head logo centered on the front. The away caps are black with an orange brim and the duck head logo. Batting helmets are black with the webbed-foot logo.\nThe Ducks wear uniforms produced by Rawlings. The home jersey is white with black pinstripes with the \"Ducks\" wordmark centered across the front. The numbering on the jersey is primarily in green with white outline and black drop shadow. The away jerseys are grey with the \"Long Island\" cursive wordmark centered across in green with white and orange outline. The numbering is in green with white outline and orange drop shadow. The alternate is an orange jersey with the \"Ducks\" word mark centered across the chest.\nRadio.\nAll games have been broadcast live on FloSports under the FloBaseball channel, the Atlantic League's media streaming rights partner since 2023. Wednesday and Friday games are also broadcast by Hofstra University students on WRHU/88.7-FM.

Introduced in 1994, it was designed by Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf and departed from the design of traditional office chairs by eschewing upholstery in favor of fabric mesh. It received numerous accolades for its industrial design and is featured in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection. It has been cited as the best-selling individual office chair in the United States with over 8 million sold.\nDevelopment.\nDevelopment of the Aeron chair began in the late 1970s, after Herman Miller hired designers Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf. They sought to design a chair that improved upon the shortcomings of La-Z-Boy recliners that were often used in residential and medical settings for the elderly, and completed a prototype called the Sarah Chair in 1988. Herman Miller cancelled the Sarah Chair after deeming it unlikely to be commercially viable, and tasked them with designing an office chair.\nAccording to Chadwick, they were tasked by Herman Miller to update the company's previous best-selling office chair, not to design the ideal chair for an eight-hour workday. He said, \"We were given a brief and basically told to design the next-generation office chair.\" They carried over some design concepts from the Sarah Chair, such as a semi-reclining mechanism that simultaneously moved the seat and chairback, to benefit professionals who worked long hours on computers. Early prototypes included foam and upholstery which were abandoned in favor of a fabric mesh called \"pellicle\" that they found would be more moldable to the user and more breathable, a concept carried over from the Sarah Chair to prevent bedsores. Herman Miller's marketing department was initially apprehensive about selling a chair without upholstery, but the company approved the design. The Aeron chair was introduced in October 1994 and priced at $1,000. It was reportedly named after the Celtic god Aeron, as well as referring to aeration and aeronautics.\nThe suspended \"pellicle\" mesh seat and backrest are moulded into glass-fiber reinforced plastic frames. The Aeron chair is made out of recycled materials, and 94 percent of the chair itself is recyclable. It was available in three sizes, A (smallest), B and C (largest), and originally included a height-adjustable lumbar support pad. In 2002, an updated ergonomic support system called PostureFit was introduced to improve lower back support. In 2005, the arms switched from a dial to a lever to loosen for height adjustment. Variants produced include a wheelless version with a flat base named the Aeron Side Chair, and a higher version with a footrest named the Aeron Stool.\nIn 2016, Herman Miller released a redesigned version of the chair named the Aeron Remastered, later sold and marketed as simply Aeron. Chadwick contributed to the updated design, Stumpf having died in 2006. It includes an updated suspension system, better spine support, a redesigned denser mesh and a re-engineered tilt. Some components that were previously aluminum were switched to plastic. The original version of the chair was given the retronym \"Aeron Classic\".\nReception.\nAccording to \"Bloomberg\", the Aeron chair \"made a fetish of lumbar support\". Architect Galen Cranz said that while the company is aware that a perching position (facilitated by the chair's rounded front rail) is preferable, it put in the lumbar support to conform to public expectations\u2014\"because that's what people think is required for it to be a scientifically 'good' chair.\" Of the \"pellicle\" mesh she said, \"one of the secrets of the success of that chair was finding that fabric they called \u2018pellicle\u2019. That sheer but resistant fabric hit on the right gestalt for where our culture was at.\"\nSitting expert A. C. Mandal has criticized the Aeron for being \"far too low\" and not offering enough height adjustment and opportunities for the sitter to move.\nThe Aeron chair has been credited with revolutionizing the design of office chairs. According to architecture professor Witold Rybczynski, the Aeron was a \"rejection of the traditional corporate chair hierarchy,\" and led to a decline of larger, high-back executive chairs among executives. According to \"New York\", \"Aerons were hailed as triumphs of industrial design and were a whole different beast from the overstuffed leather power chairs that dominated the Old Economy.\" \"Wired\" described the Aeron's appearance as \"a chair that looked more engineered than designed.\"\nIn 1994, before the Aeron chair's general release, Museum of Modern Art curator Paola Antonelli added it to the museum's permanent collection. An Aeron chair is also displayed in the Brooklyn Museum.\nIn 2025, the Aeron chair was included in \",\" an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art featuring \"widely recognized design icons [...] highlighting pivotal moments in design history.\"\nSales and market.\nThe Aeron chair was a success and its sales far exceeded Herman Miller's expectations. Aeron chairs were popular in the offices of Internet startups in the late 1990s, and became associated with the dot-com bubble. \"Wired\" noted, \"In Silicon Valley, especially, it quickly became a status symbol, visually synonymous with the optimism of the dot-com boom.\" A 2006 article in \"New York\" magazine called the Aeron \"the Dot-Com Throne\", writing that the chairs \"became shorthand for the countless companies that didn't have a clue how to make money on the Internet, but, man, did they have the know-how to set up a cool office\". The Aeron was so popular that after the bubble burst, one commenter described the piles of unused chairs as reminiscent of a \"corporate graveyard\" of office furniture.\nIn 2010, \"Bloomberg\" stated that the Aeron was the best-selling individual office chair in the United States. As of 2023, Herman Miller had sold 8 million chairs, and more than a million chairs are produced every year.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65536", "revid": "44220290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65536", "title": "Nashua Pride", "text": "Minor league baseball team&lt;templatestyles src=\"Infobox/mobileviewfix.css\"/&gt;\nThe Nashua Pride was a professional baseball team based in Nashua, New Hampshire, in the United States, not affiliated with Major League Baseball. They played home games at Holman Stadium from 1998 through 2008, when they were sold and renamed the American Defenders of New Hampshire. In 2010 that team moved to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and became the Pittsfield Colonials. The franchise itself no longer exists, as the Colonials folded after the 2011 baseball season.\nHistory.\nThe Nashua Pride was one of the founding members of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball in 1998. The team name was based on the fact that \"Money\" magazine twice named Nashua the \"best place to live\" in the America. The team's primary home uniform logo was the word \"Pride\" in script, and included the number \"1\" inside the capital \"P.\"\nIn the 2000 season, the team swept the Somerset Patriots in three games to win the Atlantic League Championship Series. However, the Patriots answered that loss by defeating the Pride in the 2003 and 2005 championships. Despite their on-field success, the Pride suffered as a result of having one of the lowest average attendances and being the farthest team from the core of the league.\nIn 2006, the team moved to the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, (Can-Am League). As Nashua is closer in proximity to the teams of the Can-Am League than those of the Atlantic, the Pride was relieved of the expensive travel to away games.\nIn 2007, the Pride won the Can-Am League championship. After that season, long-time manager Butch Hobson left the Pride to take the managerial job with the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the Atlantic League, while former Boston Red Sox outfielder Rick Miller was hired as manager in Nashua. Former Boston Red Sox firstbaseman/outfielder Brian Daubach was hired as the hitting coach midway through the 2008 season.\nAmerican skier Bode Miller played one home game each year for the team in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Former Red Sox reliever Rich \"El Guapo\" Garces appeared in the Pride bullpen in 2007 and 2008.\nSale of the Pride.\nFollowing the 2008 season, when the Pride lost an estimated $500,000, former owner John Stabile sold the team to the American Defenders of New Hampshire, LLC. Stabile, a Nashua resident, had bought the team in January 2006 to prevent it from relocating, and got assurances from the new owners that they would keep the team in Nashua.\nAmerican Defenders of New Hampshire, LLC consisted of Nokona executives Buddy Lewis and Jerry O'Connor, former Boston Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, and Terry Allvord.\nThe new owners changed the club's name from the Nashua Pride to the American Defenders of New Hampshire, placing less of an emphasis on the Nashua market. They kept General Manager Chris Hall and promoted Brian Daubach from Hitting Coach to Manager.\nThe team was evicted from Holman Stadium in Nashua midway through the 2009 season because of nonpayment of rent.\nNashua baseball history.\nThe Pride was one of several professional teams to play in Nashua, and one of five to have played at Holman Stadium:\nWorld Famous Monkey Boy.\nDuring their inaugural season, Chris \"Monkey Boy\" Ames became the secondary mascot performer for the Nashua Pride. Originally intended to only be present for the first home stand, Monkey Boy became a crowd favorite and was made a permanent mascot for the remainder of the season. Monkey Boy remained with the team until Ames suffered a torn ACL in 2002. Known for his high-energy antics, comedic performances, and fan engagement, Ames portrayed Monkey Boy, a beloved character who entertained crowds at Holman Stadium throughout the team's tenure. In 2011, Monkey Boy returned for a one night only playoff appearance with the team (Now Nashua Silver Knights) Ames was tackled by a member of the Martha's Vineyard Sharks, injuring Ames and effectively ending his career with Nashua.\nAfter becoming a cult favorite with baseball fans in Nashua, Barstool Sports produced a comedic documentary around the Monkey Boy character and Ames. Following the history, memories and eventual return of the mascot to Holman Stadium in 2022.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were a member of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball and, later, the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball. The Bears played their home games at Bears &amp; Eagles Riverfront Stadium. The team folded after the 2013 season.\nHistory of Newark baseball.\nNewark was the home of several former minor league baseball teams, from the formation of the Newark Indians in 1902 and the addition of the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League in 1936. A Federal League team, the Newark Peppers, also played in 1915.\nThe original Newark Bears were a team in the International League from 1926 to 1949. They played their home games at the former Ruppert Stadium in what is now known as the Ironbound section of Newark.\nThe Bears of the Atlantic League.\nThe Newark Bears are named for the former Newark Bears team of the International League. The new team was formed in 1998 by former New York Yankees catcher Rick Cerone, a Newark native. However, the Bears played their \"home\" schedule at The Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, Connecticut that season while awaiting the completion of their new home field. In addition, the Bears played several home games during the first half of the 1999 season at Skylands Park in Augusta. The Bears inaugurated their new park, Bears &amp; Eagles Riverfront Stadium, in Newark on July 16, 1999.\nOver the years, the Bears attracted star talent to their club. Ozzie Canseco played for the Bears in 2000 and 2001, and his brother Jos\u00e9 Canseco was with the team for part of 2001 as well. Rickey Henderson played the first half of the 2003 season with the Bears and was named Most Valuable Player in the Atlantic League All-Star Game. He was subsequently signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers but was released at season's end, and he returned to the Bears for 2004. Also in 2003, Jos\u00e9 Lima pitched for the Bears at the beginning of the season; after the Kansas City Royals signed him away from Newark, Lima won his first seven decisions for the Royals.\nOther notable alumni included Edgardo Alfonzo, Billy Ashley, Armando Ben\u00edtez, Wes Chamberlain, Carl Everett, Keith Foulke, Jay Gibbons, Brian Giles, Pete Incaviglia, Lance Johnson, Jacque Jones, Jim Leyritz, Ramiro Mendoza, Hensley Meulens, Jamie Navarro, Alonzo Powell, Scott Spiezio, Daryle Ward, Scott Williamson and Craig Worthington.\nRescue from bankruptcy and possible demise.\nThe Newark Bears, under former owner Marc Berson, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 24, 2008. The team's existence was almost compromised until the Bases Loaded Group, LLC purchased the team, guaranteeing a $1 million line of credit to the Atlantic League. The Bases Loaded Group consisted of executives from Philadelphia and New Jersey, some hailing from Newark. The primary leader of the group was Tom Cetnar, former General Manager of the Bears in 2001. He served as president and was a member of the ownership group.\nMove to the Can-Am League.\nThe Newark Bears joined the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball on October 6, 2010. The Bears were one of three teams to join the league for the 2011 season, with the traveling New York Federals and the expansion Rockland Boulders. Newark was originally to be one of three cities to represent New Jersey in the Can-Am League along with Little Falls, home of the New Jersey Jackals, and Augusta, home of the Sussex Skyhawks. The Skyhawks, however, elected to stop operating after the 2010 season.\nIn 2010, the Newark Bears were purchased by New Jersey radiologist Dr. Douglas Spiel and his partner, Danielle Dronet.\nThe Can-Am League announced on November 28, 2013, the Newark Bears would not operate in 2014, with the remaining four teams now a division in the American Association. An auction for the team's assets was held on April 26, 2014.\nLogos and uniforms.\nThe Newark Bears went through three phases of logos and uniform colors. When the franchise began, it had a purple, black and white color scheme. In the mid-2000s, the team went to red, black, and white. When the club ceased operations, its colors were navy blue and white. The primary logo consisted of a stylized bear holding a baseball bat superimposed over a depiction of the Newark skyline over a baseball diamond. The \"Newark Bears\" wordmark was centered at the base of the logo and included white accents and a black outline.\nThe Bears' uniforms were traditional in design. The home cap was navy blue throughout with a white block \"N\" centered on the front. The home jerseys were white with traditional navy blue pinstripes. A navy blue, block \"N\" was prominently displayed on the left breast. The road jersey was gray with the cursive \"Newark\" wordmark in navy blue, centered diagonally across the front. Both home and away jersey sleeves sported the Bears' primary logo. The Bears wore navy blue belts and socks with all uniforms.\nRivalries.\nShortly after the Newark Bears joined the Can-Am League, they announced a formal rivalry with the New Jersey Jackals. Since both teams played in Essex County, they established the County Executives' Cup to formalize this geographical contest. \nRadio.\nBears games were aired on WSOU-FM 89.5 from 1999 to 2003, and again from 2007 to 2008. Previous announcers for the team include Seton Hall color commentator Dave Popkin, former WNEW-FM disc jockey Jim Monaghan, MLB Network host Victor Rojas, Somerset Patriots announcer Brian Bender, former New York Islanders broadcaster Jim Cerny, Jason Page, Ray Alexander, and Erie Otters broadcaster Paul Roper. In 2009, longtime New York sportscaster Spencer Ross served as both radio broadcaster and team on-field MC.\nMascots.\nThe Newark Bears' official mascots were anthropomorphic bears named Ruppert and Effa. They wore the team's home jersey and cap. Ruppert was named after Jacob Ruppert, who owned the former Newark Bears team in the 1930s. Effa alludes to Effa Manley, the first woman to own and operate a professional baseball team (the Newark Eagles) and the only female member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Inspired by President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address, Meredith decided to exercise his constitutional rights and apply to the University of Mississippi. His goal was to put pressure on the Kennedy administration to enforce civil rights for African Americans. The admission of Meredith ignited the Ole Miss riot of 1962 where Meredith's life was threatened and 31,000 American servicemen were required to quell the violence \u2013 the largest ever invocation of the Insurrection Act of 1807.\nIn 1966, Meredith planned a solo March Against Fear from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi; he wanted to highlight continuing racism in the South and encourage voter registration after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He did not want major civil rights organizations involved. The second day, he was shot by a white gunman and suffered numerous wounds. Leaders of major organizations vowed to complete the march in his name after he was taken to the hospital. While Meredith was recovering, more people from across the country became involved as marchers. He rejoined the march and when Meredith and other leaders entered Jackson on June 26, they were leading an estimated 15,000 marchers, in what was the largest civil rights march in Mississippi. During the march, more than 4,000 African Americans registered to vote, and it was a catalyst to continued community organizing and additional registration.\nIn 2002 and again in 2012, the University of Mississippi led year-long series of events to celebrate the 40th and 50th anniversaries of Meredith's integration of the institution. He was among numerous speakers invited to the campus, where a statue of him commemorates his role. The Lyceum-The Circle Historic District at the center of the campus has been designated as a National Historic Landmark for these events.\nEarly life and education.\nMeredith was born in 1933 in Kosciusko, Mississippi, the son of Roxie (Patterson) and Moses Meredith. He is of African-American, English Canadian, Scots and Choctaw heritage. His family nickname was \"J-Boy\". European traders intermarried with some Choctaw during the colonial period. In the 1830s, thousands of Choctaw chose to stay in Mississippi and become United States citizens when most of the tribe left their traditional homeland for Indian Territory during the federally imposed removal. Those in the state had unions with European Americans and African Americans (some of whom were enslaved), adding to the multi-racial population in the developing territory.\nMeredith completed 11th grade at Attala County Training School (which was segregated as \"white\" and \"colored\" under the state's Jim Crow laws) and completed 12th grade at Gibbs High School in St. Petersburg, Florida. He graduated from high school in 1951. Then, Meredith enlisted in the United States Air Force. He served from 1951 to 1960.\nAfterward Meredith attended Jackson State University for two years, achieving good grades.\nUniversity of Mississippi.\nChallenge to the University.\nIn 1961, inspired the day before by U.S. President John F. Kennedy, Meredith started to apply to the University of Mississippi, intending to insist on his civil rights to attend the state-funded university. It still admitted only white students under the state's culture of racial segregation, although the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, as they are supported by all the taxpayers.\nMeredith wrote in his application that he wanted admission for his country, race, family, and himself. He said,\nNobody handpicked me...I believed, and believe now, that I have a Divine Responsibility... I am familiar with the probable difficulties involved in such a move as I am undertaking and I am fully prepared to pursue it all the way to a degree from the University of Mississippi.\nHe was twice denied admission. During this time, he was advised by Medgar Evers, who was head of the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\nOn May 31, 1961, Meredith, with backing of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, alleging that the university had rejected him only because of his race, as he had a highly successful record of military service and academic courses. The case went through many hearings, after which the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that Meredith had the right to be admitted to the state school. The state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which supported the ruling of the appeals court.\nOn September 13, 1962, the District Court entered an injunction directing the members of the Board of Trustees and the officials of the University to register Meredith. The Democratic Governor of Mississippi, Ross Barnett, declared \"no school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your governor\". The state legislature quickly created a plan. They passed a law that denied admission to any person \"who has a crime of moral turpitude against him\" or who had been convicted of any felony offense or not pardoned. The same day it became law, Meredith was accused and convicted of \"false voter registration,\" in absentia, in Jackson County. The conviction against Meredith was trumped up: Meredith both owned land in northern Mississippi and was registered to vote in Jackson, where he lived. \"Later the clerk testified that Meredith was qualified to register and vote in Jackson [where he was registered].\"\nOn September 20, the federal government obtained an injunction against enforcement of this Act and of the two state court decrees that had barred Meredith's registration. That day Meredith was rebuffed again by Governor Barnett in his efforts to gain admission, though university officials were prepared to admit him. On September 25, Meredith attempted to register again, but Governor Barnett blocked Meredith\u2019s entry to the College Board office. On September 28, the Court of Appeals, \"en banc\" and after a hearing, found the Governor in civil contempt and ordered that he be arrested and pay a fine of $10,000 for each day that he kept up the refusal, unless he complied by October 2. On September 29, Lieutenant Governor Paul B. Johnson Jr. (elected Governor on November 5, 1963) was also found in contempt by a panel of the court, and a similar order was entered against him, with a fine of $5,000 a day.\nAttorney General Robert F. Kennedy had a series of phone calls with Governor Barnett between September 27 to October 1. Barnett reluctantly agreed to let Meredith enroll in the university, but secretly bargained with Kennedy on a plan which would allow him to save face.\nBarnett committed to maintain civil order. Robert Kennedy ordered 127 U.S. Marshals as well as 316 deputized U.S. Border Patrol and 97 Federal Bureau of Prisons officers to accompany Meredith during his arrival and registration. On September 29, President Kennedy issued a proclamation commanding all persons engaged in the obstruction of the laws and the orders of the courts to \"cease and desist therefrom and to disperse and retire peaceably forthwith\", citing his authority under \u00a0https://, https://, and https:// to use the militia or the armed forces to suppress any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy.\nRioting at the University.\nOn September 29, Governor Barnett made a spirited speech at halftime of the Ole Miss-Kentucky football game, firing up the crowd and encouraging people to block Meredith\u2019s entry to the university. He said, in part, \"I love Mississippi! I love her people, our customs ... I love and I respect our heritage.\" The Ole Miss Band waved a large Confederate flag, and the stands were full of students waving Confederate flags. President Kennedy sent federal marshals to Mississippi.\nOn Sunday, September 30, 1962, Governor Barnett called the Attorney General, Robert Kennedy, to try to get him to postpone Meredith\u2019s admission to the University. The Attorney General refused. Meredith, accompanied by Mississippi Highway Patrol and 500 federal marshals, moved into his dorm room. Outside the Lyceum building, where Meredith was due to register for classes the next day, a crowd of hostile students formed near the marshals who were protecting the building. At 7:30 p.m., the crowd broke into a riot. The crowd, which numbered 3000, threw bottles and rocks, and the marshals tear-gassed them. More than 300 people were injured, and two people were killed.\nEnrollment.\nThe day after the riots, on October 1, 1962, after federal and state forces took control, Meredith became the first African-American student to enroll at the University of Mississippi. Meredith's admission is regarded as a pivotal moment in the history of civil rights in the United States.\nMany students harassed Meredith during his two semesters on campus, but others accepted him. According to first-person accounts, students living in Meredith's dorm bounced basketballs on the floor just above his room through all hours of the night. Other students ostracized him: when Meredith walked into the cafeteria for meals, the students eating would turn their backs. If Meredith sat at a table with other students, all of whom were white, the students would immediately get up and go to another table. He persisted through harassment and extreme isolation to graduate on August 18, 1963, with a degree in political science.\nEducation and activism.\nMeredith continued his education, focusing on political science, at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. He returned to the United States in 1965. He attended law school through a scholarship at Columbia University and earned an LL.B (law degree) in 1968\nIn 1966, Meredith organized and led a solo, personal March Against Fear for 220 miles from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi, beginning on June 6, 1966. Inviting only black men to join him, he wanted to highlight continuing racial oppression in the Mississippi Delta, as well as to encourage blacks to register and vote following passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, which authorized federal oversight and enforcement of rights. Governor Paul Johnson promised to allow the march and provide State Highway Police protection. Meredith wanted blacks in Mississippi to overcome fear of violence.\nDespite a police presence, on the second day, Meredith was shot and wounded by Aubrey James Norvell, a white man whose motives were never determined, and who pleaded guilty at trial. Meredith was quickly taken to a hospital. Leaders of major organizations rallied at the news and vowed to complete the march in Meredith's name. They struggled to reconcile differing goals, but succeeded in attracting more than 10,000 marchers from local towns and across the country by the end.\nNorvell pleaded guilty to battery and assault with intent to kill and was sentenced to five years in prison.\nMeredith suffered from superficial wounds to his neck, legs, head, and right side. He recovered from his wounds, and rejoined the march before it reached Jackson on June 26, when 15,000 marchers entered the city in what had become the largest civil rights march in state history. During the march, more than 4,000 black Mississippians registered to vote. Continued community organizing was catalyzed by these events, and African Americans began to enter the political system again.\nPolitical career.\nIn 1967, while living and studying in New York, Meredith decided to run as a Republican against incumbent Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a multi-term Democrat, in a special election for the Congressional seat in Harlem. He withdrew from the race and Powell was re-elected. Meredith said later of his campaign, \"The Republican Party [of New York] made me an offer: full support in every way, everything.\" He had full access to top New York Republicans.\nAfter returning to Mississippi in 1972, Meredith entered the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat of Democrat James Eastland, who had been the incumbent for 29 years in what had operated as a one-party state. Following provisions of a new state constitution in 1890 that made voter registration extremely difficult, African Americans had been effectively disenfranchised and the Republican Party had been crippled. Meredith conceded that he had little chance of winning unless Governor George Wallace of Alabama entered the presidential race and split the white vote. As it happened, many Republicans in Mississippi were not enthusiastic about the prospect of Meredith as their nominee, and Gil Carmichael, a businessman from Meridian, was recruited to run against him. Meredith received only 21% of the primary vote against Carmichael.\nAn active Republican, Meredith served from 1989 to 1991 as a domestic adviser on the staff of United States Senator Jesse Helms. Faced with criticism from the civil rights community for working for the avowed segregationist, Meredith said that he had applied to every member of the Senate and House offering his services, and only Helms' office responded. He also wanted a chance to do research at the Library of Congress.\nIn 2002, officials at the University of Mississippi celebrated the 40th anniversary of Meredith's historic admission and integration of the institution with a year-long series of events. Of the celebration, Meredith said,\nIt was an embarrassment for me to be there, and for somebody to celebrate it, oh my God. I want to go down in history, and have a bunch of things named after me, but believe me that ain't it.\nHe said he had achieved his main goal at the time by getting the federal government to enforce his rights as a citizen. He saw his actions as \"an assault on white supremacy\". In 2003, he was far more proud that his son Joseph Meredith graduated as the top doctoral student at the university's graduate business school.\nCultural depictions.\nIn 2011 miniseries \"The Kennedys\", Meredith was portrayed by Matthew G. Brown in episode five of the series, \"Life Sentences\".\nPolitical viewpoint.\nA highly independent man, Meredith has identified as an individual American citizen who demanded and received the constitutional rights held by any American, not as a participant in the Civil Rights Movement. There have been tensions between him and leaders of major organizations of the movement. When interviewed in 2002, the 40th anniversary of his enrollment at University of Mississippi, Meredith said, \"Nothing could be more insulting to me than the concept of civil rights. It means perpetual second-class citizenship for me and my kind.\"\nMeredith was a supporter of the unsuccessful 1967 gubernatorial bid of ex-Mississippi Governor (and avowed segregationist) Ross Barnett, who had been responsible for Meredith's not being allowed at the University of Mississippi, as well as the 1991 gubernatorial campaign of Louisiana State Representative and ex-Klansman David Duke. On these endorsements, Meredith wrote \u201cI prefer bigotry to be out in the open where I can confront it.\" \nIn a 2002 interview with CNN, Meredith said of his efforts to integrate Ole Miss, \"I was engaged in a war. I considered myself engaged in a war from Day One. And my objective was to force the federal government\u2014the Kennedy administration at that time\u2014into a position where they would have to use the United States military force to enforce my rights as a citizen.\"\nPersonal life.\nOn March 14, 1956, Meredith married Mary June Wiggins. She later worked as a high school English teacher. They had three sons, James, John and Joseph Howard Meredith. Mary June Meredith died of heart failure in December 1979.\nIn 1982, Meredith married Judy Alsobrooks in Gary, Indiana. She had one son, Kip Naylor, from a previous marriage. Jessica Howard Meredith was born to the couple. The couple live in Jackson, Mississippi.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are the Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees. They compete in the Eastern League (EL), known as the Double-A Northeast in 2021, and were previously members of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB) from 1998 to 2020. The Patriots have played their home games at TD Bank Ballpark since 1999.\nFrom 1998 to 2020, the Patriots were the most successful franchise in the Atlantic League. During their twenty-two seasons, they compiled 1,580 regular seasons wins, 47 playoff wins, captured thirteen division titles and six league championship titles in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2009, and 2015, all league records. Their most recent Atlantic League playoff appearance was in 2018 when they lost in the semifinals against the Long Island Ducks.\nTheir success continued with the move to the Eastern League in 2021 winning back-to-back division titles in 2021 and 2022 and the 2022 Eastern League Championship.They won the first-half season division title in 2023 and won the 2024 second-half season division title and the division outright en route to the 2024 Eastern League Championship Series.\nThe \"Patriots\" name refers to the Middlebrook encampment where the first official flag of the United States was unfurled, after a law to adopt a national flag had been passed by Congress on June 14, 1777. By special order of Congress, a 13-star flag is flown 24 hours a day at the Washington Camp Ground, part of the former Middlebrook encampment, in Bridgewater Township.\nHistory.\nThe Somerset Patriots were one of the founding members of the Atlantic League in 1998. However, the team spent its inaugural season as a road team while TD Bank Park was being constructed. In the 1999 season, the Patriots opened their ballpark, where they quickly became one of the most successful franchises of the league in both the win and attendance columns.\nFor spring training in 2009, the Somerset Patriots became the first Atlantic League team to hold its spring training in its own locale, at the Jack Cust Baseball Academy in nearby Flemington, instead of the traditional site in Lakeland, Florida. The Lancaster Barnstormers and the York Revolution followed suit in 2009, primarily because of the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession.\nThe Patriots, and then manager Sparky Lyle, won their 1,000th game on July 24, 2012. The Patriots defeated the Sugar Land Skeeters with a score of 6\u20135, in the day game of a day/night doubleheader.\nOn November 27, 2012, it was announced Somerset's pitching coach and former major league pitcher, Brett Jodie, would become the new manager with Lyle becoming manager emeritus.\nFormer professional football player Donald Jones briefly played for the Patriots during his recovery from a kidney transplant.\nWith the Atlantic League's 2020 season cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, Somerset organized a twelve game series called the SOMERSET Professional Baseball Series, which would feature the Patriots and the New Jersey Blasters, a team created for the series. The rosters were composed mostly of players from the state of New Jersey.\nIn November 2020, the Patriots were announced as the new Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees, replacing the Trenton Thunder. They were organized into the Double-A Northeast. Somerset began competition in the new league as a Yankees affiliate on May 4 with a 6\u20130 victory over the Harrisburg Senators at TD Bank Ballpark. They won the 2021 Northeast Division title with a first-place 72\u201347 record. Despite winning the division, their record was third-best in the league, and only the two teams with the highest winning percentages in the regular season competed for the league championship. Oswaldo Cabrera won the league's Most Valuable Award. In 2022, the Double-A Northeast became known as the Eastern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.\nOn September 28, 2022, the Patriots won their first Eastern League Championship and seventh league championship overall with a 15\u20130 combined no-hitter victory over the Erie SeaWolves at TD Bank Ballpark.\nLogos and uniforms.\nThe Somerset Patriots' official colors are navy blue, maroon, and silver. The primary logo depicts a Continental soldier in navy blue with white stars on his shoulder and maroon stripes flowing to his left, a reference to the U.S. flag. Centered below the soldier is the wordmark in navy blue underlined by a silver baseball bat outlined in navy blue. The word \"Somerset\" is centered above the wordmark in maroon.\nThe Patriots wear caps and uniforms produced by New Era. The caps are navy blue throughout with the cap logo centered on the front. The cap logo consists of the Continental soldier's head outlined in white and maroon. The Patriots also have an alternate cap that has a navy blue crown with a maroon brim and button. The cap logo on the alternate cap consists of a scripted \"S\" in maroon with a white outline and the Patriot-head cap logo superimposed. The home jersey includes pinstripes and the \"Patriots\" wordmark centered across the front in navy blue and maroon. The away jersey resembles the previous New York Yankees' away jersey with the \"Somerset\" wordmark. The belt, socks, and undershirt are navy blue.\nThe Patriots' current alternate jersey is navy blue, it has the \"Patriots\" wordmark centered on the chest in grey with a white outline. The Patriots' previous alternate jersey was also navy blue, it had the \"Patriots\" wordmark centered on the chest in maroon with a white outline and a white star in the underscore.\nThe Patriots have also played as the Jersey Diners for a couple of games during the 2024 season. In this alter-ego, the team wears a coffee mug emblem, and sports a cotton-candy blue uniform with hot pink accents.\nRadio and television.\nAll of the Patriots' games are broadcast on Fox Sports New Jersey, as well as MiLB.TV with the voice of the Patriots, Steven Cusumano.\nMascots.\nOne of the Somerset Patriots' official mascots is an anthropomorphic dog named Sparkee. He wears the team's home uniform with white sneakers. The mascot debuted on July 11, 1998, at the Atlantic League's first All-Star Game at Bernie Robbins Stadium in Atlantic City. Sparkee's name refers to the Patriots' first manager, Sparky Lyle. The team also employs another character, a cat (according to Somerset Patriots staff (sometimes mistaken for a bear)) named Slider. After training with Sparkee for several months, he debuted in the 2007 season. Slider wears the Patriots' navy blue alternate jersey with gray pants. The team had a mascot named \"TD\" (after the stadium's sponsor) debuted in the June 30, 2010, game against the Camden Riversharks. Also, the team had a live mascot known as \"General Admission\" who wore the traditional uniform donned by those fighting for the colonies during the American Revolution complete with the three-cornered hat and musket.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The university's medical center is located in Jackson, Mississippi.\nThe Mississippi Legislature chartered the university on February 24, 1844, and in 1848 admitted its first 80 students. During the Civil War, the university operated as a Confederate hospital and narrowly avoided destruction by Ulysses S. Grant's forces. In 1962, during the civil rights movement, a race riot occurred on campus when segregationists tried to prevent the enrollment of African American student James Meredith. The university has since taken measures to improve its image. The university is closely associated with writer William Faulkner and owns and manages his former Oxford home Rowan Oak, which with other on-campus sites Barnard Observatory and Lyceum\u2013The Circle Historic District, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nOle Miss is classified as \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". It is one of 33 institutions participating in the National Sea Grant Program and also participates in the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program. Its research efforts include the National Center for Physics Acoustics, the National Center for Natural Products Research, and the Mississippi Center for Supercomputing Research. The university operates the country's only federally contracted Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved cannabis facility. It also operates interdisciplinary institutes such as the Center for the Study of Southern Culture. Its athletic teams compete as the Ole Miss Rebels in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I Southeastern Conference.\nThe university's alumni, faculty, and affiliates include 27 Rhodes Scholars, 10 governors, 5 US senators, a head of government, and a Nobel Prize Laureate. Other alumni have received accolades in the arts such as Emmy Awards, Grammy Awards, and Pulitzer Prizes. Its medical center performed the first human lung transplant and animal-to-human heart transplant.\nHistory.\nFounding and early history.\nThe Mississippi Legislature chartered the University of Mississippi on February 24, 1844. Planners selected an isolated, rural site in Oxford as a \"sylvan exile\" that would foster academic studies and focus. In 1845, residents of Lafayette County donated land west of Oxford for the campus and the following year, architect William Nichols oversaw construction of an academic building called the Lyceum, two dormitories, and faculty residences. On November 6, 1848, the university, offering a classical curriculum, opened to its first class of 80 students, most of whom were children of elite slaveholders, all of whom were white, and all but one of whom were from Mississippi. For 23 years, the university was Mississippi's only public institution of higher learning, and for 110 years, its only comprehensive university. In 1854, the University of Mississippi School of Law was established, becoming the fourth state-supported law school in the United States.\nEarly president Frederick A. P. Barnard sought to increase the stature of the university, placing him in conflict with the more conservative board of trustees. His hundred-page 1858 report to the trustees on his proposals resulted in little besides the university head's title being changed to \"chancellor\". Barnard's northern background\u2014he was born in Massachusetts and graduated from Yale\u2014and Union sympathies resulted in heightened tensions: a student assaulted his slave and the state legislature investigated him. Following the presidential election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Mississippi became the second state to secede, with the articles of secession drafted by the university's mathematics professor Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar. Students organized themselves into a military company called the \"University Greys\", which merged with the Confederate States Army. Within a month of the Civil War's outbreak, only 5 students remained at the University of Mississippi, and, by fall 1861, the university closed. In its final action, the board of trustees awarded Barnard a doctorate of divinity.\nWithin six months, Confederates converted the campus into a hospital. It was evacuated in November 1862 as General Ulysses S. Grant's Union forces approached. Although Kansan troops destroyed much of the medical equipment, a lone remaining professor persuaded Grant against burning the campus. After three weeks, Grant and his forces left, and the campus returned to being a Confederate hospital. Throughout the war, over 700 wounded died and were buried on campus.\nPost-Civil War.\nThe University of Mississippi reopened in October 1865. To avoid rejecting veterans, the university lowered admission standards and decreased costs by eliminating tuition and allowing students to live off-campus. The student body remained entirely white: in 1870 the chancellor declared that he and the entire faculty would resign rather than admit \"negro\" students. In 1882, the university began admitting women but they were not permitted to live on campus or attend law school. In 1885, the University of Mississippi hired Sarah McGehee Isom, becoming the first southeastern US college to hire a female faculty member. Nearly 100 years later, in 1981, the Sarah Isom Center for Women and Gender Studies was established in her honor.\nThe university's byname \"Ole Miss\" was first used in 1897, when it won a contest of suggestions for a yearbook title. The term originated as a title domestic slaves used to distinguish the mistress of a plantation from \"young misses\". Fringe origin theories include it coming from a diminutive of \"Old Mississippi\", or from the name of the \"Ole Miss\" train that ran from Memphis to New Orleans. Within two years, students and alumni were using \"Ole Miss\" to refer to the university.\nBetween 1900 and 1930, the Mississippi Legislature introduced bills aiming to relocate, close, or merge the university with Mississippi State University. All such legislation failed. During the 1930s, the governor of Mississippi Theodore G. Bilbo was politically hostile toward the University of Mississippi, firing administrators and faculty, and replacing them with his friends in the \"Bilbo purge\". Bilbo's actions severely damaged the university's reputation, leading to the temporary loss of its accreditation. Consequently, in 1944, the Constitution of Mississippi was amended to protect the university's board of trustees from political pressure. During World War II, the University of Mississippi was one of 131 colleges and universities that participated in the national V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.\nIntegration.\nIn 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Eight years after the \"Brown\" decision, all attempts by African American applicants to enroll at the University of Mississippi had failed. Shortly after the 1961 inauguration of President John F. Kennedy, James Meredith\u2014an African American Air Force veteran and former student at Jackson State University\u2014applied to the University of Mississippi. After months of obstruction by Mississippi officials, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Meredith's enrollment, and the Department of Justice under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy entered the case on Meredith's behalf. On three occasions, either governor Ross R. Barnett or lieutenant governor Paul B. Johnson Jr. physically blocked Meredith's entry to the campus.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held both Barnett and Johnson Jr. in contempt, and issued fines exceeding $10,000 for each day they refused to enroll Meredith. On September 30, 1962, President Kennedy dispatched 127 U.S. Marshals, 316 deputized U.S. Border Patrol agents, and 97 federalized Federal Bureau of Prisons personnel to escort Meredith. After nightfall, far-right former Major General Edwin Walker and outside agitators arrived, and a gathering of segregationist students before the Lyceum became a violent mob. Segregationist rioters threw Molotov cocktails and bottles of acid, and fired guns at federal marshals and reporters. 160 marshals would be injured, with 28 receiving gunshot wounds, and two civilians\u2014French journalist Paul Guihard and Oxford repairman Ray Gunter\u2014were killed by gunfire. Eventually, 13,000 soldiers arrived in Oxford and quashed the riot. One-third of the federal officers\u2014166 men\u2014were injured, as were 40 federal soldiers and National Guardsmen. More than 30,000 personnel were deployed, alerted, and committed in Oxford\u2014the most in American history for a single disturbance. Meredith enrolled and attended a class on October 1. By 1968, Ole Miss had around 100 African American students, and by the 2019\u20132020 academic year, African Americans constituted 12.5 percent of the student body.\nRecent history.\nIn 1972, Ole Miss purchased Rowan Oak, the former home of Nobel Prize\u2013winning writer William Faulkner. The building\u2014a National Historic Landmark\u2014has been preserved as it was at Faulkner's death in 1962. Faulkner was the university's postmaster in the early 1920s and wrote \"As I Lay Dying\" (1930) at the university powerhouse. His Nobel Prize medallion is displayed in the university library. The university hosted the inaugural Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha Conference in 1974. In 1980, Willie Morris became the university's first writer in residence.\nIn 2002, Ole Miss marked the 40th anniversary of integration with a yearlong series of events, including an oral history of the university, symposiums, a memorial, and a reunion of federal marshals who served at the campus. In 2006, the 44th anniversary of integration, a statue of Meredith was dedicated on campus. Two years later, the site of the 1962 riots was designated as a National Historic Landmark. The university also held a yearlong program to mark the 50th anniversary of integration in 2012. The university hosted the \u2014the first presidential debate held in Mississippi\u2014between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama.\nOle Miss retired its mascot Colonel Reb in 2003, citing its Confederate imagery. Although a grass-roots movement to adopt \"Star Wars\" character Admiral Ackbar of the Rebel Alliance gained significant support, Rebel Black Bear, a reference to Faulkner's short story \"The Bear\", was selected in 2010. The Bear was replaced with another mascot, Tony the Landshark, in 2017. Beginning in 2022, football coach Lane Kiffin's dog Juice became the de facto mascot. In 2015, the university removed the Mississippi State Flag, which included the Confederate battle emblem, and in 2020, it relocated a prominent Confederate monument.\nCampus.\nOxford campus.\nThe University of Mississippi's Oxford campus is partially located in Oxford and partially in University, Mississippi, a census-designated place. The main campus is situated at an altitude of around , and has expanded from of land to around . The campus' buildings are largely designed in a Georgian architectural style; some of the newer buildings have a more contemporary architecture.\nAt the campus' center is \"The Circle\", which consists of eight academic buildings organized around an ovaloid common. The buildings include the Lyceum (1848), the \"Y\" Building (1853), and six later buildings constructed in a Neoclassical Revival style. The Lyceum was the first building on the campus and was expanded with two wings in 1903. According to the university, the Lyceum's bell is the oldest academic bell in the United States. Near the Circle is The Grove, a plot of land that was set aside by chancellor Robert Burwell Fulton c.\u20091893, and hosts up to 100,000 tailgaters during home games. Barnard Observatory, which was constructed under Chancellor Barnard in 1859, was designed to house the world's largest telescope. Due to the Civil War's outbreak, however, the telescope was never delivered and was instead acquired by Northwestern University. The observatory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The first major building built after the Civil War was Ventress Hall, which was constructed in a Victorian Romanesque style in 1889.\nFrom 1929 to 1930, architect Frank P. Gates designed 18 buildings on campus, mostly in Georgian Revival architectural style, including (Old) University High School, Barr Hall, Bondurant Hall, Farley Hall (also known as Lamar Hall), Faulkner Hall, and Wesley Knight Field House. During the 1930s, the many building projects at the campus were largely funded by the Public Works Administration and other federal entities. Among the notable buildings built in this period is the dual-domed Kennon Observatory (1939).\nTwo large modern buildings\u2014the Ole Miss Union (1976) and Lamar Hall (1977)\u2014caused controversy by diverging from the university's traditional architecture. In 1998, the Gertrude C. Ford Foundation donated $20 million to establish the Gertrude C. Ford Center for the Performing Arts, which was the first building on campus to be solely dedicated to the performing arts. As of 2020, the university was constructing a STEM facility, the largest single construction project in the campus' history. The university owns and operates the University of Mississippi Museum, which comprises collections of American fine art, Classical antiquities, and Southern folk art, as well as historic properties in Oxford. Ole Miss also owns University-Oxford Airport, which is located north of the main campus.\nNorth Mississippi Japanese Supplementary School, a Japanese weekend school, is operated in conjunction with Ole Miss, with classes held on campus. It opened in 2008 and was jointly established by several Japanese companies and the university. Many children have parents who are employees at Toyota facilities in Blue Springs.\nSatellite campuses.\nIn 1903, the University of Mississippi School of Medicine was established on the Oxford campus. It offered only two years of medical courses; students had to attend an out-of-state medical school to complete their degrees. This form of medical education continued until 1955, when the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) was established on a site in Jackson, Mississippi, and the School of Medicine was relocated there. A nursing school was established in 1956 and since then, other health-related schools have been added. As of 2021[ [update]], UMMC offers medical and graduate degrees. In addition to the medical center, the university has satellite campuses in Booneville, DeSoto, Grenada, Rankin, and Tupelo.\nOrganization and administration.\nDivisions of the university.\nThe University of Mississippi consists of 15 schools. The largest undergraduate school is the College of Liberal Arts. Graduate schools include a law school, a school of business administration, an engineering school, and a medical school.\nAdministration.\nThe University of Mississippi's chief administrative officer is the chancellor, a position Glenn Boyce has held since 2019. The chancellor is supported by vice-chancellors who administer areas such as research and intercollegiate athletics. The provost oversees the university's academic affairs, and a dean oversees each school, as well as general studies and the honors college. A faculty senate advises the administration.\nThe board of trustees of the Mississippi State Institutions of Higher Learning is the constitutional governing body that is responsible for policy and financial oversight of the University of Mississippi and the state's other seven public secondary institutions. the board consists of 12 members, who serve staggered nine-year terms and represent the state's three Supreme Court Districts. The board appoints the commissioner of higher education, who administers its policies.\nFinances.\nAs of April 2021[ [update]], the University of Mississippi's endowment was $775 million. The university's budget for fiscal year 2019 was over $540 million. Less than 13% of operating revenues are funded by the state of Mississippi, and the university relies heavily on private donations. The Ford Foundation has donated nearly $65 million to the Oxford campus and UMMC.\nAcademics.\nThe University of Mississippi is the state's largest university by enrollment and is considered the state's flagship university. In 2015, the student-faculty ratio was 19:1. Of its classes, 47.4 percent have fewer than 20 students. The most popular subjects include marketing, education and teaching, accountancy, finance, pharmaceutical sciences, and administration. To receive a bachelor's degree, students must have at least 120 semester hours with passing grades and a cumulative 2.0 GPA.\nThe university also offers graduate degrees such as PhDs and masters of art, science, and fine arts. The university maintains the Mississippi Teacher Corps, a free graduate program that educates teachers for critical-needs public schools.\nTaylor Medals, which were first awarded in 1905, are presented to exceptional students nominated by the faculty. The medals are named in honor of Marcus Elvis Taylor, who graduated in 1871 and are given to less than one percent of each class.\nResearch.\nOle Miss is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". According to the National Science Foundation, the university spent $137 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 142nd in the nation. It is one of the 33 colleges and universities participating in the National Sea Grant Program and participates in the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program. Since 1948, the university has been a member of the Oak Ridge Associated Universities.\nIn 1963, University of Mississippi Medical Center surgeons, led by James Hardy, performed the world's first human lung transplant, and in 1964 the world's first animal-to-human heart transplant. Because Hardy researched transplantation, consisting of primate studies during the previous nine years, the heart of a chimpanzee was used for the transplant.\nIn 1965, the university established its Medicinal Plant Garden, which the School of Pharmacy uses for drug research. Since 1968, the school has operated the only legal marijuana farm and production facility in the United States. The National Institute on Drug Abuse contracts to the university production of cannabis for use in approved research studies and for distribution to the seven surviving medical marijuana patients grandfathered into the Compassionate Investigational New Drug program. The facility is the only source of marijuana medical researchers can use to conduct Food and Drug Administration-approved tests.\nThe National Center for Physics Acoustics (NCPA), which Congress established in 1986, is located on campus. In addition to conducting research, the NCPA houses the Acoustical Society of America's archives. The university also operates the University of Mississippi Field Station, which includes 223 research ponds and supports long-term ecological research, and hosts the Mississippi Center for Supercomputing Research and the Mississippi Law Research Institute. In 2012, the university completed Insight Park, a research park that \"welcomes companies commercializing University of Mississippi research\".\nSpecial programs.\nHonors education at the University of Mississippi, consisting of lectures by distinguished academics, began in 1953. In 1974, this program became the University Scholars Program, and in 1983, the University Honors Program was created and honors-core courses were offered. In 1997, Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale and wife Sally donated $5.4 million to establish the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College (SMBHC), which provides a capstone project\u2014a senior thesis\u2014and endowed scholarships.\nIn 1977, the university established its Center for the Study of Southern Culture with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, which is housed in the College of Liberal Arts. The center provides for interdisciplinary studies of Southern history and culture. In 2000, the university established the Trent Lott Leadership Institute, which is named after alumnus and then-US Senate majority leader Trent Lott. The institute was funded with large corporate donations from MCI Inc., Lockheed Martin, and other companies. In addition to leadership initiatives, the institute offers a BA degree in Public Policy Leadership.\nThe Center for Intelligence and Security Studies (CISS) delivers academic programming on intelligence analysis and engages in applied research and consortium building with government, private, and academic partners. In 2012, the United States Director of National Intelligence designated CISS as an Intelligence Community Center of Academic Excellence (CAE), becoming one of 29 such college programs in the United States. Other special programs include the Haley Barbour Center for Manufacturing Excellence\u2014established jointly by the university and Toyota in 2008\u2014 as well as the Arabic Language Flagship Program and the Chinese Language Flagship Program (). The Croft Institute for International Studies, which was founded in 1998, provides the only international studies undergraduate program in Mississippi.\nThe University of Mississippi is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium, which has since been renamed SECU. The collaborative initiative was designed to promote research, scholarship, and achievement among the member universities in the Southeastern Conference. In 2013, the university participated in the SEC Symposium on renewable energy in Atlanta, Georgia, which was organized and led by the University of Georgia and the UGA Bioenergy Systems Research Institute.\nIn 2021, actor Morgan Freeman and Professor Linda Keena donated $1 million to the University of Mississippi to create the Center for Evidence-Based Policing and Reform, which will provide law-enforcement training and seek to improve engagement between law enforcement and communities.\nRankings and accolades.\nIn \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s 2023 rankings, the University of Mississippi was tied for 163rd place among national universities and 88th among public universities. In 2023, \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" ranked the professional MBA program at the School of Business Administration #72 nationally, and the online MBA program in the top 25. As of 2018[ [update]], all three degree programs at the Patterson School of Accountancy were among the top 10 accounting programs according to the \"Public Accounting Report\".\nSince 2012, the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" has named the University of Mississippi as one of the \"Great Colleges to Work For\". In the 2018 results, released in the \"Chronicle\"'s annual report on \"The Academic Workplace\", the university was among 84 institutions honored from the 253 colleges and universities surveyed. In 2018, the university's campus was ranked the second-safest in the SEC and one of the safest in the U.S.\nAs of 2019, the university has had 27 Rhodes Scholars. Since 1998, it has 10 Goldwater Scholars, seven Truman Scholars, 18 Fulbright Scholars, one Marshall Scholar, three Udall Scholars, two Gates Cambridge Scholars, one Mitchell Scholar, 19 Boren Scholars, one Boren fellow, and one German Chancellor Fellowship.\nStudent life.\nStudent body.\nAs of the 2023\u20132024 academic year, the student body consists of 18,533 undergraduates and 2,264 in graduate programs. Around 57 percent of the undergraduate student body were female. As of Fall 2023, minorities composed 23.5 percent of the body. The median family income of students is $116,600, and over half of students come from the top 20 percent. According to \"The New York Times\", the University of Mississippi has the seventh-highest share of students from the economic top-one percent among selective public schools. The median starting salary of a graduate is $47,700, according to \"US News\".\nAlthough 54 percent of undergraduates are from Mississippi, the student body is geographically diverse. As of late 2020, the university's undergraduates represented all 82 counties in Mississippi, 49 states, the District of Columbia, and 86 countries. The average freshman retention rate, an indicator of student success and satisfaction, is 85.7 percent. In 2020, the student body included over 1,100 transfer students.\nTraditions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAre You Ready?Hell Yeah! Damn Right!Hotty Toddy, Gosh Almighty,Who The Hell Are We? Hey!Flim Flam, Bim BamOle Miss By Damn!\n\u2014 The Hotty Toddy chant\nA common greeting on campus is \"Hotty Toddy!\", which is also used in the school chant. The phrase has no explicit meaning and its origin is unknown. The chant was first published in 1926, but \"Hotty Toddy\" was spelled \"Heighty Tighty\"; this early spelling has led some to suggest it originated with Virginia Tech's regimental band, The Heighty Tighties. Other proposed origins are \"hoity-toity\", meaning snobbish, and the alcoholic drink hot toddy.\nOn football game days, the Grove, a plot of trees, hosts an elaborate tailgating tradition; according to \"The New York Times\", \"Perhaps there isn't a word for the ritualized pregame revelry\u00a0... 'Tailgating' certainly does not do it justice\". The tradition began in 1991 when cars were banned from the Grove. Prior to each game, over 2,000 red-and-blue trash cans are placed throughout the Grove. This event is known as \"Trash Can Friday\". Each barrel marks a tailgating spot. The spots are claimed by tailgaters, who erect a \"tent city\" of 2,500 shelters. Many of the tents are extravagant, feature chandeliers and fine china, and typically host meals of Southern cuisine. To accommodate the crowds, the university maintains elaborate portable bathrooms on 18-wheeler platforms known as \"Hotty Toddy Potties\".\nStudent organizations.\nThe University of Mississippi's first sanctioned student organizations, literary societies the Hermaean Society and the Phi Sigma Society, were established in 1849. Weekly meetings, of which attendance was mandatory, were held in the Lyceum until 1853 and then in the chapel. With the university's emphasis on rhetoric, student-organized public orations on the first Monday of every month were popular. Studies were sometimes canceled so students could attend speeches of visiting politicians such as Jefferson Davis and William L. Sharkey.\nIn the 1890s, extracurricular and nonintellectual activities proliferated on campus, and interest in oratory and the now-voluntary literary societies diminished. Turn-of-the-20th-century student organizations included Cotillion Club, the elite Stag Club, and German Club. In the 1890s, the local YMCA began publishing a list of the organizations in the \"M-Book\". As of 2021, the handbook was still provided to students.\nThe Associated Student Body (ASB), which was established in 1917, is the university's student government organization. Students are elected to the ASB Senate in the spring semester and leftover seats are voted on in open-seat elections in the fall. Senators can represent registered student organizations such as the Greek councils and sports clubs, or they can run to represent their academic school. The University of Mississippi's marching band The Pride of the South performs in-concert and at athletic events. The band was formally organized in 1928, but it existed before that date as a smaller organization led by a student director. A Phi Beta Kappa chapter was established in 2001.\nAmenities.\nApproximately 5,300 students live on campus in thirteen residence halls, two residential colleges, and two apartment complexes. Students are required to live on-campus during their first year. Within residence halls, students designated as community assistants provide information and resolve issues. In the early 20th century, the university provided cottages for married students. In 1947, Vet Village was constructed to room the surge in World War II veteran applicants.\nThe University of Mississippi provides Oxford University Transit, a shuttle system that is free of charge for students, faculty, and staff. In early 2020, Starship Technologies introduced an automated food delivery consisting of a fleet of 30 robots on campus; it was the first such system of any SEC school.\nOn-campus dining services Catering at UM and the Rebel Market are the only Certified Green restaurants in the state of Mississippi. In 2019, the university opened a recreation center containing a gym, indoor climbing wall, basketball courts, and other services.\nGreek life.\nGreek life at the University of Mississippi comprises 33 organizations and around 8,700 affiliated students. Greek societies at the University of Mississippi are housed along Fraternity Row and Sorority Row, which were constructed in the 1930s with federal funds.\nThe Rainbow Fraternity, which was founded at the University of Mississippi in 1848, was the first fraternity to be founded in the South. Other early fraternities established at the university include Delta Kappa Epsilon (1850), Delta Kappa (1853), Delta Psi (1854), and Epsilon Alpha (1855). By 1900, a majority of University of Mississippi students were members of a fraternity or a sorority. Non-member students felt excluded on campus and tensions between members and non-members escalated. \"The University Magazine\" denounced the Greek societies as \"the most vicious institution that has grown up in any college\". In 1902, Lee Russell, a poor student who was rejected by the fraternities, appeared before the board of trustees to criticize the Greek societies. In response, the board threatened to abolish Greek life if non-member students continued to be ostracized. In 1903, rumors Greek-life members and non-member students were preparing to \"meet in combat\" appeared. Multiple state-legislative investigations were held to address the issue. All Greek life at the university was suspended from 1912 to 1926 due to statewide anti-fraternity legislation.\nMedia.\nThe first student publication at the University of Mississippi was \"The University Magazine\", which was founded in 1856 and published by the literary societies. The rivalry between the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State originated from an 1895 condemnation by \"The University Magazine\" of a Mississippi State publication which had written that the University of Mississippi \"lacked dignity\". The first student newspaper \"The University Record\" began publication in 1898; it and the \"Magazine\" suffered financially and were suspended in 1902.\nIn 1907, the YMCA and student athletic organization revived the university's newspaper as the \"Varsity Voice\". In 1911, this newspaper was superseded by another student-published newspaper, \"The Daily Mississippian\". The paper is editorially independent and is the only daily college newspaper in the state. The paper is also published online as \"TheDMonline.com\", with supplementary content.\n\"NewsWatch\", which was established in 1980, is a student-produced, live newscast and the only local newscast in Lafayette County. The University of Mississippi owns and operates WUMS 92.1 Rebel Radio, which began broadcasting in 1989; it is one of a few university-operated commercial FM radio stations in the United States.\nAthletics.\nThe University of Mississippi's athletic teams participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Southeastern Conference (SEC), Division I as the Ole Miss Rebels. Women's varsity athletic teams at the University of Mississippi include basketball, cross country, golf, rifle, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. Men's varsity teams are baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, tennis, and track and field.\nIn 1893, professor Alexander Bondurant organized the university's football team. As collegiate athletic teams began to receive names, a contest result selected the name \"Mississippi Flood\" in 1929. Due to the lasting harm of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, however, the name was changed to the \"Rebels\" in 1936. The first prime-time telecast of college football was of a 1969 Ole Miss game. The team has won six SEC championships. Major rivals include Louisiana State University and Mississippi State University, which Ole Miss plays against in the Magnolia Bowl and Egg Bowl, respectively. Other rivalries include Tulane and Vanderbilt. Football alumni Archie and Eli Manning, both quarterbacks, are honored on campus with speed limits set to 18 and 10\u00a0mph; their respective jersey numbers.\nOutside football, Ole Miss baseball has won seven overall SEC championships and three SEC Tournaments. They have played in the Men's College World Series six times, and won the 2022 series. The men's tennis team has won five overall SEC championships and has had one NCAA Singles Champion\u2014Devin Britton. The women's basketball team has won one overall SEC championship. Notable former players include Armintie Price, who holds the SEC record for steals in a game and was the third pick in the 2007 WNBA draft, and Jennifer Gillom, 1986 SEC Female Athlete of the Year and 1988 Olympic Gold Medalist. Men's basketball has won two SEC Tournaments. In 2021, Ole Miss women's golf won its first NCAA Division I Women's Golf Championship; the men's team has won two NCAA individual titles in 2017 and 2025.\nNotable people.\nFaculty.\nAs of the 2020\u20132021 academic year, there were\u2014excluding those of UMMC\u20141,092 professors, of whom 424 were tenured. At this time, there were 592 male and 500 female professors.\nWith the early emphasis on classical studies, multiple notable classicists including George Tucker Stainback, Wilson Gaines Richardson, and William Hailey Willis, have held teaching positions at the University of Mississippi. Archeologist David Moore Robinson, who is credited with discovering the ancient city Olynthus, also taught classics at the university. Former Mississippi Governor Ronnie Musgrove was a political science lecturer, and Kyle Duncan was an assistant law professor prior to his appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Landon Garland taught astronomy and philosophy before becoming the first president of Vanderbilt University. Actor James Best, who is best known for his work on \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", was an artist in residence. Robert Q. Marston, director of the National Institutes of Health, served as the dean of the medical school, and Eugene W. Hilgard, considered the father of soil science, taught chemistry at Ole Miss. Other notable scientific faculty include psychologist David H. Barlow and physicist Mack A. Breazeale.\nAlumni.\nIn addition to William Faulkner, notable writers who attended the University of Mississippi include Florence Mars, Patrick D. Smith, Stark Young, and John Grisham. Alumni in film include Emmy Award-winning actor Gerald McRaney and Tate Taylor, director of \"The Help\". Musicians who studied at the university include Mose Allison and Grammy Award-winner Glen Ballard. Athlete graduates include 12-time Grand Slam tennis champion Mahesh Bhupathi, New York Yankees catcher Jake Gibbs, and Michael Oher, NFL offensive lineman and subject of the film \"The Blind Side\". Three Miss Americas and one Miss USA are also among its alumni.\nThe University of Mississippi's alumni include five US senators and ten governors. Other public servant graduates include Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justices Sydney M. Smith and Bill Waller Jr., US Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, White House Press Secretary Larry Speakes, and Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit. Notable academics include Pomona College president E. Wilson Lyon, Pulitzer Prize-winning Harvard professor Thomas K. McCraw, and Mercer University president James Bruton Gambrell. Notable physicians include Arthur Guyton, American Medical Association head Edward Hill, and Thomas F. Frist Sr., co-founder of Hospital Corporation of America. Alumnus William Parsons served as director of NASA's Stennis Space Center and later that of Kennedy Space Center.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The league's only Commissioner was Major League Baseball Hall of Famer and Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame member Ferguson Jenkins. The league featured former major league players such as Francisco Cabrera, Floyd Youmans, Rich Butler, and Steve Sinclair.\nThe CBL was based in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nThe championship trophy was the Jenkins Cup, named after the commissioner of the league, Ferguson Jenkins.\nHistory.\nThe CBL was the brainchild of Tony Riviera, a former major league scout, and the face of the league. It was backed by former Microsoft product developer Charlton Lui, and later by former Yahoo! president, and part owner of the San Francisco Giants, Jeff Mallett. Canadian Baseball Hall of Famer Ferguson Jenkins was brought in to act as the league's Commissioner.\nBig plans.\nThe league was first announced on September 27, 2001, and was initially intended to launch in 2002. A player draft was held in December 2001, with an initial set of eight teams in Abbotsford, Kamloops, Kelowna, Lethbridge, Red Deer, Regina, Nanaimo, and Saskatoon. However, due to difficulties in negotiations between the teams and the cities, and resultant reorganizations within the CBL, the goal of a 2002 season was scrapped.\nIn November 2002, the CBL announced a revised plan to start the league in 2003. There were still eight teams, but locations of the teams changed substantially, creating a cross-country league with a Western and Eastern Conference (the original 2002 teams were all west of Manitoba). Only Kelowna and Saskatoon retained their teams. The eight teams were owned directly by the league, and operated with $60,000 salary caps. A 72-game season was planned.\nDespite the difficulties, Riviera presented a grand vision for the CBL's inaugural season. He stated that the CBL would be \"AAA quality\", and he was rumoured to have approached the Winnipeg Goldeyes about switching leagues. Jenkins said that the league aimed to match AA league quality. Riviera also nominated Pete Rose for the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame shortly before the CBL's inaugural season to raise interest, but Rose's nomination did not succeed.\nThe big plans initially appeared to be possible. The league announced a national television deal with sports channel The Score, while a crowd of 5,100 took in the league's inaugural game in London, Ontario. Owners and executives from the defunct Prairie League, which had minor league teams in the Prairie Provinces until its demise in 1997, raised concerns about the viability of the CBL and its overly optimistic expectations.\nQuick demise.\nThe CBL's expectations were grander than the results. Early promises that the league would average over 2,000 fans per game, failed to manifest. Only two markets averaged over 1,000 fans per game: Victoria at 1,700 and Calgary at 1,000. Four teams averaged fewer than 300 per game: Kelowna (271), Saskatoon (256), Welland (181) and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (163). The national TV deal was cancelled after only six weeks after the CBL was unable to find enough sponsors to cover the production costs.\nThe Montreal franchise never played a game in that city due to a lack of a playing field, as they were denied a lease at Olympic Stadium. Their home games were played at Stade Amedee Roy in Sherbrooke instead. The Abbotsford Saints relocated to Trois Rivieres, Quebec before the season started.\nThe CBL's swan song was the All-Star game, held at Calgary. Unwilling to absorb any more losses, Mallett pulled the plug on the league, suspending operations the day before the game. A crowd of over 5,700 (the largest crowd to come to Burns Park all season) watched the East and West All-Stars play to a 5-5, ten-inning tie. Following the game, a home run derby was held to break the tie, in which Jamie Gann of Kelowna hit the only home run, thus giving the West the victory. Despite losing as much as $4 million on the CBL, and owing $1.2 million to creditors as of October 2003, Mallett initially promised to bring the league back in 2004. However, the remaining assets of the league were quietly auctioned off on December 1, 2003 in Vancouver and the league never returned.\nTeams.\nEight teams played in the CBL, divided into two divisions. Because the season was cut short, teams played different numbers of games. Their records at the time the league was suspended, and their primary home stadiums, are listed below. The Calgary Outlaws were declared the Jenkins Cup champions at the season's end, on the basis of having the league's best record to that point.\nWest Division\nEast Division"}
{"id": "65546", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65546", "title": "Boric acid", "text": "Weak acid with formula B(OH)3\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nBoric acid, more specifically orthoboric acid, is a compound of boron, oxygen, and hydrogen with formula . It may also be called hydrogen orthoborate, trihydroxidoboron or boracic acid. It is usually encountered as colorless crystals or a white powder, that dissolves in water, and occurs in nature as the mineral sassolite. It is a weak acid that yields various borate anions and salts, and can react with alcohols to form borate esters.\nBoric acid is often used as an antiseptic, insecticide, flame retardant, neutron absorber, or precursor to other boron compounds.\nThe term \"boric acid\" is also used generically for any oxyacid of boron, such as metaboric acid and tetraboric acid .\nHistory.\nOrthoboric acid was first prepared by Wilhelm Homberg (1652\u20131715) from borax, by the action of mineral acids, and was given the name (\"sedative salt of Homberg\"). However, boric acid and borates have been used since the time of the ancient Greeks for cleaning, preserving food, and other uses.\nMolecular and crystal structure.\nThe three oxygen atoms form a trigonal planar geometry around the boron. The B-O bond length is 136 pm, and the O-H is 97 pm. The molecular point group is \"C\"3h.\nTwo crystalline forms of orthoboric acid are known: triclinic with space group P1, and trigonal with space group P32. The former is the most common; the second, which is a bit more stable thermodynamically, can be obtained with a special preparation method.\nThe triclinic form of boric acid consists of layers of molecules held together by hydrogen bonds with an O...O separation of 272 pm. The distance between two adjacent layers is 318 pm. While the layers of the triclinic phase are nearly trigonal with \u03b3 = 119.76\u00b0, \"a\" = 701.87 pm, and \"b\" = 703.5 pm (compared to \"a\" = 704.53(4) pm for the trigonal form), the stacking of the layers is somewhat offset in the triclinic phase, with \u03b1 = 92.49\u00b0 and \u03b2 = 101.46\u00b0. The triclinic phase has \"c\" = 634.72 pm and the trigonal one has \"a\" = 956.08(7) pm.\nPreparation.\nBoric acid may be prepared by reacting borax (sodium tetraborate decahydrate) with a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid:\n \u00b710 + 2 HCl \u2192 4 + 2 NaCl + 5 \nIt is also formed as a byproduct of hydrolysis of boron trihalides and diborane:\n + 6 \u2192 2 + 6 \n + 3 \u2192 + 3 HX (X = Cl, Br, I)\nReactions.\nPyrolysis.\nWhen heated, orthoboric acid undergoes a three-step dehydration. The reported transition temperatures vary substantially from source to source.\nWhen heated above 140\u00a0\u00b0C, orthoboric acid yields metaboric acid () with loss of one water molecule:\nHeating metaboric acid above about 180\u00a0\u00b0C eliminates another water molecule forming tetraboric acid, also called pyroboric acid ():\n 4 \u2192 + \nFurther heating (to about 530\u00a0\u00b0C) leads to boron trioxide:\n \u2192 2 + \nAqueous solution.\nWhen orthoboric acid is dissolved in water, it partially dissociates to give metaboric acid:\nThe solution is mildly acidic due to the ionization of the acids:\n + \u21cc + \nHowever, Raman spectroscopy of strongly alkaline solutions has shown the presence of ions, leading some to conclude that the acidity is exclusively due to the abstraction of from water:\nEquivalently,\n + \u21cc + \u200aH+ (\"K\"a = 7.3\u00d710\u221210; p\"K\"a = 9.14)\nOr, more properly,\n + 2 \u21cc + \nThis reaction occurs in two steps, with the neutral complex aquatrihydroxyboron as an intermediate:\n + \u2192 + \nThis reaction may be characterized as Lewis acidity of boron toward , rather than as Br\u00f8nsted acidity. However, some of its behaviour towards some chemical reactions suggest it to be a tribasic acid in the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry sense as well.\nBoric acid, mixed with borax (more properly ) in the weight ratio of 4:5, is highly soluble in water, though they are not so soluble separately.\nSulfuric acid solution.\nBoric acid also dissolves in anhydrous sulfuric acid according to the equation:\n + 6 \u2192 + 2 + 3 \nThe product is an extremely strong acid, even stronger than the original sulfuric acid.\nEsterification.\nBoric acid reacts with alcohols to form borate esters, where R is alkyl or aryl. The reaction is typically driven by a dehydrating agent, such as concentrated sulfuric acid:\n + 3 ROH \u2192 + 3 \nWith vicinal diols.\nThe acidity of boric acid solutions is considerably increased in the presence of cis-vicinal diols (organic compounds containing similarly oriented hydroxyl groups in adjacent carbon atoms, ) such as glycerol and mannitol.\nThe tetrahydroxyborate anion formed in the dissolution spontaneously reacts with these diols to form relatively stable anion esters containing one or two five-member rings. For example, the reaction with mannitol , whose two middle hydroxyls are in \"cis\" orientation, can be written as:\n + \u21cc + 2 \n + \u21cc + 2 \nGiving the overall reaction:\n + 2 \u21cc + 3 + \nThe stability of these mannitoborate ester anions shifts the equilibrium to the right, thereby increasing the solution's acidity by five orders of magnitude compared to that of pure boric oxide. This lowers the p\"K\"a from 9 to below 4 for a sufficient concentration of mannitol. The resulting solution is referred to as mannitoboric acid.\nThe addition of mannitol to an initially neutral solution containing boric acid or simple borates lowers its pH enough for it to be titrated by a strong base such as NaOH, including with an automated potentiometric titrator. This property is used in analytical chemistry to determine the borate content of aqueous solutions, for example to monitor the depletion of boric acid by neutrons in the water of the primary circuit of light-water reactor when the compound is added as a neutron poison during refueling operations.\nToxicology.\nBased on mammalian median lethal dose (LD50) rating of 2,660\u00a0mg/kg body mass, boric acid is only poisonous if taken internally or inhaled in large quantities. The Fourteenth Edition of the \"Merck Index\" indicates that the LD50 of boric acid is 5.14\u00a0g/kg for oral dosages given to rats, and that 5 to 20\u00a0g/kg has produced death in adult humans. For a 70\u00a0kg adult, at the lower 5\u00a0g/kg limit, 350\u00a0g could produce death in humans. For comparison's sake, the LD50 of salt is reported to be 3.75\u00a0g/kg in rats according to the \"Merck Index\". According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, \"The minimal lethal dose of ingested boron (as boric acid) was reported to be 2\u20133\u00a0g in infants, 5\u20136\u00a0g in children, and 15\u201320\u00a0g in adults. [...] However, a review of 784 human poisonings with boric acid (10\u201388\u00a0g) reported no fatalities, with 88% of cases being asymptomatic.\" Human studies in three borate exposure-rich comparison groups (U.S. Borax mine and production facility workers, Chinese boron workers, Turkish residents living near boron-rich regions) produced no indicators of developmental toxicity in blood and semen tests. The highest estimated exposure was 5\u00a0mg B/kg/day, likely due to eating in contaminated workplaces, more than 100 times the average daily exposure.\nLong-term exposure to boric acid may be of more concern, causing kidney damage and eventually kidney failure (see links below). Although it does not appear to be carcinogenic, studies in dogs have reported testicular atrophy after exposure to 32\u00a0mg/(kg\u22c5day) for 90\u00a0days. This level, were it applicable to humans at like dose, would equate to a cumulative dose of 202\u00a0g over 90\u00a0days for a 70\u00a0kg adult, not far lower than the above LD50.\nAccording to the CLH report for boric acid published by the Bureau for Chemical Substances Lodz, Poland, boric acid in high doses shows significant developmental toxicity and teratogenicity in rabbit, rat, and mouse fetuses, as well as cardiovascular defects, skeletal variations, and mild kidney lesions. As a consequence in the 30th ATP to EU directive 67/548/EEC of August 2008, the European Commission decided to amend its classification as reprotoxic category\u00a02 and to apply the risk phrases R60 (may impair fertility) and R61 (may cause harm to the unborn child).\nAt a 2010 European Diagnostics Manufacturing Association (EDMA) Meeting, several new additions to the substance of very high concern (SVHC) candidate list in relation to the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulations 2007 (REACH) were discussed. Following the registration and review completed as part of REACH, the classification of boric acid CAS 10043-35-3 / 11113-50-1 is listed from 1\u00a0December 2010 is \"H360FD (May damage fertility. May damage the unborn child)\".\nPhysics.\nSound absorption in oceans not only depends on water molecules but also on dissolved salts present in low concentration in seawater. Boric acid and borate ([B] \u2248 4 \u00d7 10-4 M in seawater) relaxation contributes to absorbing sounds in the low\u2010frequency region (0.2\u201310 kHz). At higher frequencies, between 10 and 1000\u00a0kHz magnesium sulfate (formed by the second most abundant cation and anion species in seawater) is the main contributor to the absorption of acoustic waves in seawater.\nUses.\nIndustrial.\nThe primary industrial use of boric acid is in the manufacture of monofilament fiberglass, which is usually referred to as textile fiberglass. Textile fiberglass is used to reinforce plastics in applications that range from boats to industrial piping to computer circuit boards.\nIn the jewelry industry, boric acid is often used in combination with denatured alcohol to reduce surface oxidation and formation of firescale on metals during annealing and soldering operations.\nBoric acid is used in the production of glass in LCD flat panel displays.\nIn electroplating, boric acid is used as part of some proprietary formulas. One known formula uses about a 1 to 10 ratio of H3BO3 to NiSO4, a very small portion of sodium lauryl sulfate and a small portion of H2SO4.\nThe solution of orthoboric acid and borax in 4:5 ratio is used as a fire retarding agent of wood by impregnation. Also, it is used in combination with other chemicals for the fire retardancy of wood-based materials.\nIt is also used in the manufacturing of ramming mass, a fine silica-containing powder used for producing induction furnace linings and ceramics.\nBoric acid is added to borax for use as welding flux by blacksmiths.\nBoric acid, in combination with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or silicone oil, is used to manufacture Silly Putty.\nBoric acid is also present in the list of chemical additives used for hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. It is often used in conjunction with guar gum as cross-linking and gelling agent for controlling the viscosity and the rheology of the fracking fluid injected at high pressure in the well. It is important to control the fluid viscosity for keeping in suspension on long transport distances the grains of the propping agents aimed at maintaining the cracks in the shales sufficiently open to facilitate the gas extraction after the hydraulic pressure is relieved. The rheological properties of borate cross-linked guar gum hydrogel mainly depend on the pH value.\nBoric acid is used in some expulsion-type electrical fuses as a de-ionization/extinguishing agent. During an electrical fault in an expulsion-type fuse, a plasma arc is generated by the disintegration and rapid spring-loaded separation of the fusible element, which is typically a specialized metal rod that passes through a compressed mass of boric acid within the fuse assembly. The high-temperature plasma causes the boric acid to rapidly decompose into water vapor and boric anhydride, and in turn, the vaporization products de-ionize the plasma, helping to interrupt the electrical fault.\nMedical.\nBoric acid can be used as an antiseptic for minor burns or cuts and is sometimes used in salves and dressings, such as boracic lint. Boric acid is applied in a very dilute solution as an eye wash. Boric acid vaginal suppositories can be used for recurrent candidiasis due to non-albicans candida as a second line treatment when conventional treatment has failed. It is less effective than conventional treatment overall. Boric acid largely spares lactobacilli within the vagina. As TOL-463, it is under development as an intravaginal medication for the treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis.\nAs an antibacterial compound, boric acid can also be used as an acne treatment. It is also used to prevent athlete's foot, by inserting powder in the socks or stockings. Various preparations can be used to treat some kinds of (ear infection) in both humans and animals. The preservative in urine sample bottles in the UK is boric acid.\nBoric acid solutions used as an eye wash or on abraded skin are known to be toxic, particularly to infants, especially after repeated use; this is because of its slow elimination rate.\nInsecticidal.\nBoric acid was first registered in the US as an insecticide in 1948 for control of cockroaches, termites, fire ants, fleas, silverfish, and many other insects. The product is generally considered safe in household kitchens to control cockroaches and ants. It acts as a stomach poison affecting the insects' metabolism. The dry powder is abrasive to the insects' exoskeletons. It is in non-specific IRAC group 8D. Boric acid is also known as \"the gift that keeps on killing\" because cockroaches cross over lightly dusted areas and do not die immediately. Still, the effect is like shards of glass cutting them apart. This often allows a cockroach to return to the nest, where it soon dies. Cockroaches, being cannibalistic, eat others killed by contact or consumption of boric acid, consuming the powder trapped in the dead roach and killing them, too.\nBoric acid is also widely used in wood treatment to protect against termites. The full complexity of its mechanism is not fully understood. Still, aside from causing dose-dependent mortality, boric acid causes dysbiosis in the Eastern Subterranean termite, leading to the opportunistic rise of insect pathogens that could be contributing to mortality. In Japan the practice of laying newspapers treated with o-boric acid and borax under buildings has been effective in controlling Coptotermes formosanus and Reticulitermes speratus populations. Decaying wood treated with 0.25 to 0.5 percent disodium octaborate (, commonly abbreviated DOT) is also effective for baiting Heterotermes aureus populations. A 1997 paper concluded: \"Borate baits would undoubtedly be helpful in the long-term, but do not appear sufficient as a sole method of structural protection.\"\nPreservation.\nIn combination with its use as an insecticide, boric acid also prevents and destroys existing wet and dry rot in timbers. It can be used in combination with an ethylene glycol carrier to treat external wood against fungal and insect attack. It is possible to buy borate-impregnated rods for insertion into wood via drill holes where dampness and moisture are known to collect and sit. It is available in a gel form and injectable paste form for treating rot-affected wood without replacing the timber. Concentrates of borate-based treatments can be used to prevent slime, mycelium, and algae growth, even in marine environments.\nBoric acid is added to salt in the curing of cattle hides, calfskins, and sheepskins. This helps to control bacterial development and insects.\npH buffer.\nBoric acid in equilibrium with its conjugate base the borate ion is widely used (in the concentration range 50\u2013100\u00a0ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with p\"K\"a (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. But apparent p\"K\"a is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a saltwater pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, as shown in the accompanying figure. The boric acid \u2013 borate system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with p\"K\"a1 = 6.0 and p\"K\"a2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5\u20138.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation. Still, it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.\nLubrication.\nColloidal suspensions of nanoparticles of boric acid dissolved in petroleum or vegetable oil can form a remarkable lubricant on ceramic or metal surfaces with a coefficient of sliding friction that decreases with increasing pressure to a value ranging from 0.10 to 0.02. Self-lubricating films result from a spontaneous chemical reaction between water molecules and coatings in a humid environment. On a bulk scale, an inverse relationship exists between the friction coefficient and the Hertzian contact pressure induced by the applied load.\nBoric acid is used to lubricate carrom and novuss boards, allowing for faster play.\nNuclear power.\nBoric acid is used in some nuclear power plants as a neutron poison. The boron in boric acid reduces the probability of thermal fission by absorbing some thermal neutrons. Fission chain reactions are generally driven by the probability that free neutrons will result in fission and is determined by the material and geometric properties of the reactor. Natural boron consists of approximately 20% boron-10 and 80% boron-11 isotopes. Boron-10 has a high cross-section for absorption of low-energy (thermal) neutrons. By increasing boric acid concentration in the reactor coolant, the probability that a neutron will cause fission is reduced. Changes in boric acid concentration can effectively regulate the rate of fission taking place in the reactor. During normal at power operation, boric acid is used only in pressurized water reactors (PWRs), whereas boiling water reactors (BWRs) employ control rod pattern and coolant flow for power control. However, BWRs can use an aqueous solution of boric acid and borax or sodium pentaborate for an emergency shutdown system if the control rods fail to insert. Boric acid may be dissolved in spent fuel pools used to store spent fuel elements. The concentration is high enough to keep neutron multiplication at a minimum. Boric acid was dumped over Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after its meltdown to prevent another reaction from occurring.\nPyrotechnics.\nBoron is used in pyrotechnics to prevent the amide-forming reaction between aluminium and nitrates. A small amount of boric acid is added to the composition to neutralize alkaline amides that can react with the aluminium.\nBoric acid can be used as a colorant to make fire green. For example, when dissolved in methanol, it is popularly used by fire jugglers and fire spinners to create a deep green flame much stronger than copper sulfate.\nAgriculture.\nBoric acid is used to treat or prevent boron deficiencies in plants. It is also used in the preservation of grains such as rice and wheat."}

Antiseptics are generally distinguished from \"antibiotics\" by the latter's ability to safely destroy bacteria within the body, and from \"disinfectants\", which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects.\nAntibacterials include antiseptics that have the proven ability to act against bacteria. Microbicides which destroy virus particles are called viricides or antivirals. Antifungals, also known as antimycotics, are pharmaceutical fungicides used to treat and prevent mycosis (fungal infection).\nSurgery.\nAntiseptic practices evolved in the 19th century through multiple individuals. Ignaz Semmelweis showed already in 1847-1848 that hand washing prior to delivery reduced puerperal fever. Despite this, many hospitals continued to practice surgery in unsanitary conditions, with some surgeons taking pride in their bloodstained operating gowns.Only a decade later the situation started to change, when some French surgeons started to adopt carbolic acid as an antiseptic, reducing surgical infection rates, followed by their Italian colleagues in the 1860s. In 1867 Joseph Lister published seminal paper \"Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery\", where he explained this reduction in terms of Louis Pasteur's germ theory. Thus he was able to popularize the antiseptic surgical methods in the English-speaking world.\nSome of this work was anticipated by:\nSome common antiseptics.\nAntiseptics can be subdivided into about eight classes of materials. These classes can be subdivided according to their mechanism of action: small molecules that indiscriminately react with organic compounds and kill microorganisms (peroxides, iodine, phenols) and more complex molecules that disrupt the cell walls of the bacteria.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name also refers to esters of such anions, such as trimethyl borate .\nNatural occurrence.\nBorate ions occur, alone or with other anions, in many borate and borosilicate minerals such as borax, boracite, ulexite (boronatrocalcite) and colemanite. Borates also occur in seawater, contributing to the absorption of low-frequency sound in seawater.\nCommon borate salts include sodium metaborate (NaBO2) and borax. Borax is soluble in water, so mineral deposits only occur in places with very low rainfall. Extensive deposits were found in Death Valley and shipped with twenty-mule teams from 1883 to 1889. In 1925, deposits were found at Boron, California on the edge of the Mojave Desert. The Atacama Desert in Chile also contains mineable borate concentrations.\nBorates also occur in plants, including almost all fruits.\nAnions.\nThe main borate anions are:\nPreparation.\nIn 1905, Burgess and Holt observed that fusing mixtures of boric oxide and sodium carbonate yielded on cooling two crystalline compounds with definite compositions, consistent with anhydrous borax (which can be written ) and sodium octaborate (which can be written ).\nStructures.\nBorate anions (and functional groups) consist of trigonal planar and/or tetrahedral structural units, joined together via shared oxygen atoms (corners) or atom pairs (edges) into larger clusters so as to construct various ions such as , , , , , etc. These anions may be cyclic or linear in structure, and can further polymerize into infinite chains, layers, and tridimensional frameworks. The terminal (unshared) oxygen atoms in the borate anions may be capped with hydrogen atoms () or may carry a negative charge ().\nThe planar units may be stacked in the crystal lattice to have \u03c0-conjugated molecular orbitals, which often results in useful optical properties such as strong harmonics generation, birefringence, and UV transmission.\nPolymeric borate anions may have linear chains of 2, 3 or 4 trigonal structural units, each sharing oxygen atoms with adjacent unit(s). as in , contain chains of trigonal structural units. Other anions contain cycles; for instance, and contain the cyclic ion, consisting of a six-membered ring of alternating boron and oxygen atoms with one extra oxygen atom attached to each boron atom.\nThe thermal expansion of crystalline borates is dominated by the fact that and polyhedra and rigid groups consisting of these polyhedra practically do not change their configuration and size upon heating, but sometimes rotate like hinges, which results in greatly anisotropic thermal expansion including linear negative expansion.\nReactions.\nAqueous solution.\nIn aqueous solution, boric acid can act as a weak Br\u00f8nsted acid, that is, a proton donor, with p\"K\"a ~\u00a09. However, it more often acts as a Lewis acid, accepting an electron pair from a hydroxide ion produced by the water autoprotolysis:\n + 2 \u21cc + (p\"K\" = 8.98)\nThis reaction is very fast, with a characteristic time less than 10 \u03bcs. Polymeric boron oxoanions are formed in aqueous solution of boric acid at pH 7\u201310 if the boron concentration is higher than about 0.025\u00a0mol/L. The best known of these is the tetraborate ion , found in the mineral borax:\n 4 + 2 \u200aH+ \u21cc + 7 \nOther anions observed in solution are triborate(1\u2212) and pentaborate(1\u2212), in equilibrium with boric acid and tetrahydroxyborate according to the following overall reactions:\n 2 + \u21cc + 3 (fast, p\"K\" = \u22121.92)\n 4 + \u21cc + 6 (slow, p\"K\" = \u22122.05)\nIn the pH range 6.8 to 8.0, any alkali salts of \"boric oxide\" anions with general formula where 3\"x\" + \"q\" = 2\"y\" + \"z\" will eventually equilibrate in solution to a mixture of , , , and .\nLike the complexed borates mentioned above, these ions are more acidic than boric acid. As a result, the pH of a concentrated polyborate solution will increase more than expected when diluted with water.\nBorate salts.\nSeveral metal borates are known. They can be obtained by treating boric acid or boron oxides with metal oxides.\nMixed anion salts.\nSome chemicals contain another anion in addition to borate. These include borate chlorides, borate carbonates, borate nitrates, borate sulfates, borate phosphates.\nComplex oxyanions containing boron.\nMore complex anions can be formed by condensing borate triangles or tetrahedra with other oxyanions to yield materials such as borosulfates, boroselenates, borotellurates, boroantimonates, borophosphates, or boroselenites.\nBorosilicate glass, also known as pyrex, can be viewed as a silicate in which some [SiO4]4\u2212 units are replaced by [BO4]5\u2212 centers, together with additional cations to compensate for the difference in valence states of Si(IV) and B(III). Because this substitution leads to imperfections, the material is slow to crystallise. It forms a glass with a low coefficient of thermal expansion, thus resistant to cracking when heated, unlike soda glass.\nUses.\nLithium metaborate, lithium tetraborate, or a mixture of both, can be used in borate fusion sample preparation of various samples for analysis by XRF, AAS, ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Borate fusion and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry with polarized excitation have been used to analyse contaminated soils.\nDisodium octaborate tetrahydrate (commonly abbreviated DOT) is used as a wood preservative or fungicide. Zinc borate is used as a flame retardant.\nSome borates with large anions and multiple cations, like and have been considered for applications in nonlinear optics.\nBorate esters.\nBorate esters are organic compounds, which are conveniently prepared by the stoichiometric condensation reaction of boric acid with alcohols (or their chalcogen analogs).\nThin films.\nMetal borate thin films have been grown by a variety of techniques, including liquid-phase epitaxy (e.g. FeBO3, \u03b2-BaB2O4), electron-beam evaporation (e.g. CrBO3, \u03b2-BaB2O4), pulsed laser deposition (e.g. \u03b2-BaB2O4, \u00a0Eu(BO2)3), and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Growth by ALD was achieved using precursors composed of the tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligand and either ozone or water as the oxidant to deposit CaB2O4, SrB2O4, BaB2O4, Mn3(BO3)2, and CoB2O4 films.\nPhysiology.\nBorate anions are found largely as the undissociated acid in aqueous solution at physiological pH. No further metabolism occurs in either animals or plants. In animals, boric acid/borate salts are completely absorbed following oral ingestion. Absorption occurs via inhalation, although quantitative data are unavailable. Limited data indicate that boric acid/salts are not absorbed through intact skin to any significant extent, although absorption occurs through severely abraded skin. It is distributed throughout the body, is not retained in tissues except for bone, and is rapidly excreted in the urine."}

Borax mineral is a crystalline borate mineral that occurs in only a few places worldwide in quantities that enable it to be mined economically.\nBorax can be dehydrated by heating into other forms with less water of hydration. The anhydrous form of borax can also be obtained from the decahydrate or other hydrates by heating and then grinding the resulting glasslike solid into a powder. It is a white crystalline solid that dissolves in water to make a basic solution due to the tetraborate anion.\nBorax is commonly available in powder or granular form and has many industrial and household uses, including as a pesticide, as a metal soldering flux, as a component of glass, enamel, and pottery glazes, for tanning of skins and hides, for artificial aging of wood, as a preservative against wood fungus, as a food additive, and as a pharmaceutic alkalizer. In chemical laboratories it is used as a buffering agent.\nThe terms \"tincal\" and \"tincar\" refer to the naturally occurring borax historically mined from dry lake beds in various parts of Asia.\nHistory.\nBorax was first discovered in dry lake beds in Tibet. Native tincal from Tibet, Persia, and other parts of Asia was traded via the Silk Road to the Arabian Peninsula in the 8th century AD.\nBorax first came into common use in the late 19th century when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company began to market and popularize a large variety of applications under the 20 Mule Team Borax trademark, named for the method by which borax was originally hauled out of the California and Nevada deserts.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"borax\" and its previous Middle form is a Latinate loan from Old French ~ which may have been from Medieval Latin (another English spelling), , along with Spanish (&gt; ) and Italian , in the 9th century, and from Arabic ~ ~ which is attested in Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's \"Kit\u0101b al-\u1e6cab\u012bkh\" among many examples, from Middle Persian bwlk' (b\u014drag), which yielded Persian \"bure\". \nThe words \"tincal\" and \"tincar\" were adopted into English in the 17th century from Malay and from Urdu/Persian/Arabic \u062a\u0646\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u200e ; thus the two forms in English. These all appear to be related to the Sanskrit .\nChemistry.\nFrom a chemical perspective, borax contains the ion. In this structure, there are two four-coordinate boron centers and two three-coordinate boron centers.\nIt is a proton conductor at temperatures above . Conductivity is maximum along the \"b-\"axis.\nBorax is also easily converted to boric acid and other borates, which have many applications. Its reaction with hydrochloric acid to form boric acid is:\nBorax is sufficiently stable to find use as a primary standard for acid-base titrimetry.\nMolten borax dissolves many metal oxides to form glasses. This property is important for its uses in metallurgy and for the borax bead test of qualitative chemical analysis.\nBorax is soluble in a variety of solvents; however, it is notably insoluble in ethanol.\nThe term \"borax\" properly refers to the so-called \"decahydrate\" , but that name is not consistent with its structure. It is actually octahydrate. The anion is not tetraborate but tetrahydroxy tetraborate , so the more correct formula should be . However, the term may be applied also to the related compounds. Borax \"pentahydrate\" has the formula , which is actually a trihydrate . It is a colorless solid with a density of that crystallizes from water solutions above in the rhombohedral crystal system. It occurs naturally as the mineral tinkhanite. It can be obtained by heating the \"decahydrate\" above . Borax \"dihydrate\" has the formula , which is actually anhydrous, with the correct formula . It can be obtained by heating the \"decahydrate\" or \"pentahydrate\" to above . Anhydrous borax is sodium tetraborate proper, with formula . It can be obtained by heating any hydrate to . It has one amorphous (glassy) form and three crystalline forms \u2013 \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, with melting points of , and respectively. is the stable form.\nNatural sources.\nBorax occurs naturally in evaporite deposits produced by the repeated evaporation of seasonal lakes. The most commercially important deposits are found in: Boron, California; and Searles Lake, California. Also, borax has been found at many other locations in the Southwestern United States, the Atacama Desert in Chile, newly discovered deposits in Bolivia, and in Tibet and Romania. Borax can also be produced synthetically from other boron compounds.\nNaturally occurring borax (known by the trade name Rasorite\u201346 in the United States and many other countries) is refined by a process of recrystallization.\nUses.\nBorax is used in pest control solutions because it is toxic to ants and rats. Because it is slow-acting, worker ants will carry the borax to their nests and poison the rest of the colony. Borax is more effective than zinc borate for termite control but a 1997 paper concluded that exposing at least 10% of the total colony population was needed for effective treatment. In Japan the practice of laying newspapers treated with o-boric acid and borax under buildings has been effective in controlling Coptotermes formosanus and Reticulitermes speratus populations. Decaying wood treated with 0.25 to 0.5 percent DOT was also found to be effective for baiting Heterotermes aureus populations. The paper concluded: \"Borate baits would undoubtably be helpful in the long-term, but do not appear sufficient as a sole method of structural protection.\"\nBorax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products, including the 20 Mule Team Borax laundry booster, Boraxo powdered hand soap, and some tooth bleaching formulas.\nBorate ions (commonly supplied as boric acid) are used in biochemical and chemical laboratories to make buffers, e.g. for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of DNA and RNA, such as TBE buffer (borate buffered tris-hydroxymethylaminomethonium) or the newer SB buffer or BBS buffer (borate buffered saline) in coating procedures. Borate buffers (usually at pH 8) are also used as preferential equilibration solutions in dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) based crosslinking reactions.\nBorax as a source of borate has been used to take advantage of the co-complexing ability of borate with other agents in water to form complex ions with various substances. Borate and a suitable polymer bed are used to chromatograph non-glycated hemoglobin differentially from glycated hemoglobin (chiefly HbA1c), which is an indicator of long-term hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus\nBorax alone does not have a high affinity for hardness cations, although it has been used for water softening. A general chemical equation for water softening is (R is the dissolved cation, usually calcium or magnesium):\nThe sodium ions introduced do not make water \"hard\". This method is suitable for removing both temporary and permanent types of hardness.\nA mixture of borax and ammonium chloride is used as a flux when welding iron and steel. It lowers the melting point of the unwanted iron oxide (scale), allowing it to run off. Borax is also mixed with water as a flux when soldering jewelry metals such as gold or silver, where it allows the molten solder to wet the metal and flow evenly into the joint. Borax is also a flux for \"pre-tinning\" tungsten with zinc, making the tungsten soft-solderable. Borax is often used as a flux for forge welding.\nIn artisanal gold mining, borax is sometimes used as part of a process known as the borax method (as a flux) meant to eliminate the need for toxic mercury in the gold extraction process, although it cannot directly replace mercury. Borax was reportedly used by gold miners in parts of the Philippines in the 1900s. There is evidence that, in addition to reducing the environmental impact, this method achieves better gold recovery for suitable ores and is less expensive. This borax method is used in northern Luzon in the Philippines, but miners have been reluctant to adopt it elsewhere for reasons that are not well understood. The method has also been promoted in Bolivia and Tanzania.\nA rubbery polymer sometimes called Slime, Flubber, \"gluep\" or \"glurch\" (or erroneously called Silly Putty, which is based on silicone polymers), can be made by cross-linking polyvinyl alcohol with borax. Making flubber from polyvinyl acetate-based glues, such as Elmer's Glue, and borax is a common elementary science demonstration.\nBorax, given the E number \"E285\", is used as a food additive but this use is banned in some countries, such as Australia, China, Thailand and the United States. As a consequence, certain foods, such as caviar, produced for sale in the United States contain higher levels of salt to assist preservation. In addition to its use as a preservative, borax imparts a firm, rubbery texture to food. In China, borax ( or ) has been found in foods including wheat and rice noodles named \"lamian\" (), \"shahe fen\" (), \"char kway teow\" (), and \"chee cheong fun\" () In Indonesia, it is a common, but forbidden, additive to such foods as noodles, bakso (meatballs), and steamed rice.\nOther.\nOther uses include:\nToxicity.\nAccording to one study, borax is not acutely toxic. Its LD50 (median lethal dose) score is tested at 2.66 g/kg in rats, meaning that a significant dose of the chemical is needed to cause severe symptoms or death.\nThe lethal dose is not necessarily the same for humans; human studies in three borate exposure-rich comparison groups (U.S. Borax mine and production facility workers, Chinese boron workers, Turkish residents living near boron rich regions) produced no indicators of developmental toxicity in blood and semen tests. The highest estimated exposure was 5\u00a0mg B/kg/day, likely due to eating in contaminated workplaces, more than 100 times the average daily exposure.\nBorax is absorbed poorly through intact skin, although fatalities have been recorded in persistent treatment of rashes and open wounds with boric acid-containing ointments and bath solutions. Borax is readily absorbed orally, well above 90%, and mostly excreted through the urine. Fatal cases attributed to ingestion include small children mistakenly drinking pesticides or suicide attempts with large volumes of crystals. No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity has been recorded in studies.\nBorax has been in use as an insecticide in the United States with various restrictions since 1946. All restrictions were removed in February 1986 due to the low toxicity of borax, as reported in two EPA documents relating to boric acid and borax.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlthough it cited inconclusive data, a re-evaluation in 2006 by the EPA still found that \"There were no signs of toxicity observed during the study and no evidence of cytotoxicity to the target organ.\" In the reevaluation, a study of toxicity due to overexposure was checked and the findings were that \"The residential handler inhalation risks due to boric acid and its sodium salts as active ingredients are not a risk concern and do not exceed the level of concern\", but that there could be some risk of irritation to children inhaling it if used as a powder for cleaning rugs.\nOverexposure to borax dust can cause respiratory irritation, while no skin irritation is known to exist due to external borax exposure. Ingestion may cause gastrointestinal distress including nausea, persistent vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Effects on the vascular system and human brain include headaches and lethargy but are less frequent. In severe cases, a \"beefy\" red rash affecting the palms, soles, buttocks and scrotum has occurred.\nBorax was added to the Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) candidate list on December 16, 2010. The SVHC candidate list is part of the EU Regulations on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals 2006 (REACH), and the addition was based on the revised classification of borax as \"toxic for reproduction\" category 1B under the CLP Regulations. Substances and mixtures imported into the EU which contain borax are now required to be labelled with the warnings \"May damage fertility\" and \"May damage the unborn child\". It was proposed for addition to REACH Annex XIV by the ECHA on July 1, 2015. If this recommendation is approved, all imports and uses of borax in the EU will have to be authorized by the ECHA.\nA review of the boron toxicity (as boric acid and borates) published in 2012 in the \"Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health\" concluded: \"It clearly appears that human B [boron] exposures, even in the highest exposed cohorts, are too low to reach the blood (and target tissue) concentrations that would be required to exert adverse effects on reproductive functions.\" A draft risk assessment released by Health Canada in July 2016 has found that overexposure to boric acid has the potential to cause developmental and reproductive health effects. Since people are already exposed to boric acid naturally through their diets and water, Health Canada advised that exposure from other sources should be reduced as much as possible, especially for children and pregnant women.\nThe concern is not with any one product, but rather multiple exposures from a variety of sources. With this in mind, the department also announced that certain pesticides that contain boric acid, which are commonly used in homes, will have their registrations cancelled and be phased out of the marketplace. As well, new, more protective label directions are being introduced for other boric acid pesticides that continue to be registered in Canada (for example, enclosed bait stations and spot treatments using gel formulations).\nExplanatory footnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was co-created by Paul Dooley, Joan Ganz Cooney, and Lloyd Morrisett. The series aired on PBS for 780 episodes over the course of its six seasons from October 25, 1971, to April 15, 1977. The program continued in reruns until October 4, 1985. \"The Electric Company\" later reran on Noggin, a channel co-founded by the CTW, from 1999 to 2003. Noggin also produced a compilation special for the show.\nThe Workshop produced the show at Reeves Teletape Studios in Manhattan. \"The Electric Company\" employed sketch comedy and various other devices to provide an entertaining program to help elementary school children develop their grammar and reading skills. Since it was intended for children who had graduated from CTW's flagship program, \"Sesame Street\", the humor was more mature than what was seen there.\nThe show was directed by Robert Schwarz (1971 and 1977), Henry Behar (1972\u20131975), and John Tracy (1975\u20131976), and written by Dooley, Christopher Cerf (1971\u20131973), Jeremy Stevens (1972\u20131974) and John Boni/Amy Ephron (1972\u20131973).\nIn many areas, a preview special, \"Here Comes The Electric Company\", was seen in syndication through sponsor Johnson Wax on many local commercial stations during the week before its 1971 debut.\nPerformers.\nThe original cast included Morgan Freeman, Rita Moreno, Bill Cosby, Judy Graubart, Lee Chamberlin and Skip Hinnant. Most of the cast had done stage, repertory, and improvisational work, with Cosby and Moreno already well-established performers on film and television. Ken Roberts (1971\u20131973), best known as a soap opera announcer (\"Love of Life\"; \"The Secret Storm\"), was the narrator of some segments during season one, most notably the parody of the genre that had given him prominence, \"Love of Chair\".\nJim Boyd, who was strictly an off-camera voice actor and puppeteer during the first season, began appearing on-camera in the second season, mostly in the role of J. Arthur Crank. Luis \u00c1valos also joined the cast at that time.\nCosby was a regular in the first season, and occasionally appeared in new segments during the second season, but left afterward. Segments that Cosby had taped for the first two years were repeatedly used for the remainder of the series run. Similarly, Chamberlin was a regular for the first two seasons, and her segments were also repeatedly used throughout the show's run. As a result, they were billed as cast members throughout the whole series run.\nAdded to the cast at the beginning of season three (1973\u20131974) was Hattie Winston, actress and singer who later appeared on the sitcom \"Becker.\" Beginning in season four (1974\u20131975), Danny Seagren, a puppeteer who had worked on \"Sesame Street\" and also as a professional dancer, appeared in the role of Spider-Man; Marvel Comics published \"Spidey Super Stories\" that tied into Seagren's appearances as Spider-Man in character, who never spoke aloud or unmasked himself.\nSelected recurring characters.\nThe adult cast also had recurring roles as Spider-Man (Danny Seagren) (seasons 4\u20136 (1974\u20131977)), J.J. (Skip Hinnant), Carmela (Rita Moreno), Brenda (Lee Chamberlin) (seasons 1\u20132 (1971\u20131973)), Mark (Morgan Freeman), Hank (Bill Cosby) (seasons 1\u20132 (1971\u20131973)), Roberto (Luis \u00c1valos) (seasons 2\u20136 (1972\u20131977)), Winnie (Judy Graubart), Andy (Jim Boyd), and Sylvia (Hattie Winston) (seasons 3\u20136 (1973\u20131977)).\nShort Circus.\nAnother regular part of the show was the Short Circus (a pun on \"short circuit\"), a five-member singing band whose songs also facilitated reading comprehension. June Angela was the only Short Circus member to remain with the show during its entire six-year run. Others lasted anywhere from one to four years. Irene Cara appeared during the first season (1971\u20131972) and would go on to become a pop-music star. Cara was replaced in the second season (1972\u20131973) by Denise Nickerson, who previously appeared on the ABC daytime series \"Dark Shadows\" and was best known for her appearance as Violet Beauregarde in the 1971 film \"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory\".\nThe other three original members of the Short Circus were singer and guitarist Melanie Henderson; drummer and singer Stephen Gustafson; and singer, tambourinist, and guitarist Douglas Grant. For seasons three (1973\u20131974) and four (1974\u20131975), Grant and Nickerson were replaced by tap dancer Gregg Burge and Broadway actress Bayn Johnson.\nExcept for June Angela, an entirely new Short Circus was cast for the show's fifth and sixth season (1975\u20131977). The new hires were Todd Graff, singer Rodney Lewis, R\u00e9jane Magloire, and singer Janina Matthews.\nIn the first season (1971\u20131972), a number of unbilled children were also used on-camera with the show's cast, as on \"Sesame Street\", but this concept was quickly dropped.\nBecause of the frequent reuse of segments, a practice derived from \"Sesame Street\", actors continued to appear after their departures from the cast.\nGuest appearances.\n\"The Electric Company\" also featured celebrity guest appearances, including the following:\nMusic.\nWith the exception of Tom Lehrer, all the individuals listed below were Children's Television Workshop in-house composers.\nThe original soundtrack album, released on Warner Bros. Records, won a Grammy Award for the show's cast.\nVisuals.\nThe series was notable for its extensive, innovative use of early computer-generated imagery, especially Scanimate, a then-state-of-the-art analog video-synthesizer system. They were often used for presenting words with particular sounds. Sometimes a cast member would be seen alongside or interacting in another way with a word animation.\nShow numbering.\nComedian, actor and writer Paul Dooley created the series and served as head writer. A total of 780 episodes were produced in the show's six-season run, 130 per season. As with \"Sesame Street\", each episode of \"The Electric Company\" was numbered on-screen instead of using traditional episode titles. Seasons One through Four were numbered 1\u2013520 (1971\u20131975). Season five was numbered 1A\u2013130A (1975\u20131976), while season six was numbered 1B\u2013130B (1976\u20131977). The last two seasons were designated as such because they were designed as year-long curricula for schools.\nStarting with season three, a show's number would be presented in the sketch-of-the-day teaser segment, a parody of soap-opera teasers, which would highlight a particular sketch that would be shown during that episode. The voice of a cast member would say a variant of, \"Today on \"The Electric Company\", the so-and so says, '(bleep)',\" and the action would freeze as the graphic of the word of the day (or a card with the word of the day printed on it) became visible to viewers. The redacted words were replaced by a series of Minimoog sounds that roughly mimicked the modulation of the word or phrase in question so children could guess them. The still action would linger on the screen for several seconds, then fade to black, where the show number would become visible in a Scanimate animation in a random color. The music for this segment was a repetitive, funky instrumental groove featuring a call-and-response between horns and a scratchy wah-wah electric guitar.\nThe next-show teaser, which was introduced in season two without music, worked in the same way, and usually used a different take of the music heard during the sketch-of-the-day teaser, except that the voice said \"Tune in next time, when...,\" and there was no show number shown.\nIn season one, however, after the title sequence, the sound of a striking match would be heard, and a fade-up from black would reveal a hand holding a lit match and \"Show #\"x\"\" handwritten on a piece of paper that was placed in such a way so that it could blend with the surrounding objects in-frame. Instead of the next-show teaser, Ken Roberts's voice could be heard, saying, \"And now, the last word,\" and the trademark light bulb would be shut off by a hand doing whatever the last word was. In season two, after the opening sequence the words \"The Electric Company\" would disappear from the logo, and the show number would appear in its place through the use of a Scanimate animation and an electronic whooshing sound.\nNotably, some episodes in seasons three through five had serious technical errors with either their sketch-of-the-day teaser segments or their next-show teaser segments, which was probably because of the failure of the linear analog video-editing equipment. Episodes that have these errors in their sketch-of-the-day teasers include 297, 390, 1A, 8A, and 15A\u2014sometimes the music started too late, ended too early, or played too long; sometimes the errors are negligible, with the teaser music only playing a fraction of a second longer than usual.\nFor season six, because the teaser music was changed to a shorter, self-contained composition, these errors do not occur, with the exception of the teaser of 33B shown at the end of 32B (available on iTunes), where the teaser was accidentally \"cut\" by a fraction of a second.\nCancellation.\n\"The Electric Company\" was canceled in 1977 at the height of its popularity. Unlike its counterpart \"Sesame Street\", which licensed its Muppet characters for merchandising, \"The Electric Company\" never had a stand-alone brand or character that could have helped generate additional profits. The only significant items the show licensed were comic books and a Milton Bradley board game of the Fargo North, Decoder character. Licensing rights were also granted to Mattel Electronics for two educational-based video games for the Intellivision console in 1979. These games featured both the show's title logo on the game's packaging and label and the first several notes of the theme song played on the title screen of the games.\nAlso, the PBS stations and statewide networks that aired the show often complained of the Children's Television Workshop \"soaking up so much money in public television\", said veteran television producer Samuel Gibbon, who worked on the show. \"The stations demanded that one of the programs\u2014either \"Sesame Street\" or \"The Electric Company\"\u2014be put into reruns to save money. By that time, \"Sesame Street\" was a cash fountain for the Workshop. The show was almost supporting itself by then with all the productions, books, records, and games. There was no way, it was felt, that they could reduce the number of original shows of \"Sesame Street\". But the thought was that if we produce two final seasons of \"The Electric Company\" that were designed to be repeated, that would give the show four more years of life.\" Most PBS programs at the time were produced entirely by local stations, instead of being the work of independent producers like CTW. The final episode of \"The Electric Company\" featured a short musical and dance number featuring the final cast members (with the exception of Bill Cosby and Lee Chamberlin, who had had long since left the show, and Rita Moreno, who did not take part in this episode) including the then-current members of the Short Circus. The lyrics of the song summed up the closure of the series:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We're glad you came to call. We really had a ball. The show is done; we hate to run; we're sorry, but that's all.\nAfter the last original episode on April 15, 1977, \"The Electric Company\" continued on PBS in reruns until early October 1985.\nRevivals.\n1999 rebroadcast.\nThe earlier shows resurfaced on February 2, 1999, when the Noggin network, which was partly owned by Sesame Workshop and PBS at the time, rebroadcast the show as a result of its co-ownership of the network. Noggin created a two-hour compilation special to re-introduce the series to a new generation. The special was aired on TV Land as a way to promote Noggin.\nNoggin ran 65 select episodes until mid-2003, when they were pulled from the program lineup because Sesame Workshop sold its half of the network to Viacom, which already owned the other half. The shows were cut subtly to fit Noggin's shorter running time and free up time for various interstitial segments produced for the network. These deletions included the episode numbers, the Scanimate word animations, the segments of up to 15 seconds, and the teasers of the next episodes (in seasons 2\u20136).\nDuring the same period as the Noggin rebroadcasts, numerous fans of the program produced QuickTime and MP3 clips from the Noggin rebroadcasts, old over-the-air recordings, and, in some cases, from master recordings. These were hosted online at various places and received heavy attention from the blogosphere (e.g., Boing Boing) until a cease-and-desist letter took down the http:// of these sites in 2004.\nDVD releases.\nThe series was not seen since it was pulled from Noggin's schedule until Sesame Workshop, under license to Shout! Factory, released a DVD boxed set on February 7, 2006, called \"The Best of the Electric Company\" that included 20 uncut episodes from throughout the show's run, including the first and last episodes, plus outtakes and introductions and commentary by Rita Moreno and June Angela.\nDue to the overwhelming\u2014and somewhat unexpected\u2014popularity of the initial DVD release, a second boxed set was released on November 14, 2006 (\"The Best of the Electric Company: Volume 2\"). This second volume contained 20 episodes from seasons one through five plus a 30-minute documentary on the effects of in-school viewings of \"The Electric Company\" from 1975. Cast members Luis \u00c1valos, Jim Boyd, Judy Graubart, Skip Hinnant, and Hattie Winston provided commentary and reflected on their years on the show. However, the original content of nine episodes presented in this set were altered. In some cases, material that was originally broadcast in a particular episode was removed completely while material from other episodes was included. For example, 60A originally contained the Spider-Man episode \"Spidey Meets the Prankster\" and used a scene from that sketch as the opening teaser, which was removed completely (due to Marvel Entertainment licensing) after the opening credits, leaving only the episode number. Also removed after the \"Letterman\" sketch in this episode was the clip of the Short Circus singing \"Stop!\" and a Road Runner\u2013Wile E. Coyote cartoon (due to Warner Bros. licensing). These altered episodes also contain special effects used to segue from one sketch to another that were not used in the show's original run. The other altered episodes are 197, 227, 322, 375, 35A, 57A, 77A, and 105A.\nIt is believed that these changes were probably made to avoid repeats of segments that were on the first DVD set, but it is more likely that it was due to ownership rights\u2014the segments that were used to cover up the material not under Sesame Workshop's control (Spider-Man, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, etc.) were longer than the excised segments, so the episodes were cut further to get them down to their required 28-minute length.\nAn hour-long television show called \"The Electric Company's Greatest Hits &amp; Bits\" was broadcast on many PBS stations in late 2006. It included interviews with cast members, voice talent, and creator-producer Joan Ganz Cooney. The special was produced by Authorized Pictures and distributed by American Public Television, and was designed to be seen during pledge drives. It was released on DVD on March 6, 2007.\niTunes.\nIn early 2007, Apple Inc., through its iTunes service, started selling 15 previously unavailable episodes of \"The Electric Company.\" \"Volume 1\" contained Episodes 5, 13, 23, 128, 179, 249, 261, 289, 297, 374, 416, 475, 91A, 8B, and 32B.\nIn late 2007, another collection of 15 episodes dubbed \"Volume 2\" became available from iTunes. The new additions were Episodes 2, 36, 40, 75, 142, 154, 165, 172, 189, 218, 245, 290, 337, and 350. Repeated from \"Volume 1\" was Episode 8B, erroneously labeled as 658, even though it \"is\" correct if the A\u2013B designations were disregarded (1A\u2013130A are 521\u2013650, 1B\u2013130B are 651\u2013780).\nIt is unclear if these episodes were altered from the versions originally shown on television. Shout! Factory representatives indicated that it had no plans for another DVD set, implying that episodes distributed via iTunes would not be available in another format.\nInternational broadcasts.\nIn Australia, \"The Electric Company\" aired on ABC in the mid-1970s and in 1979\u201380 on the Ten Network. It aired on SBS in 1984\u201389.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cockle Bay is just one of the waterways that makes up Darling Harbour, which opens north into the much larger Port Jackson.\nThe precinct and its immediate surroundings are administered independently of the local government area of the City of Sydney, by Property NSW.\nHistory.\nThe original name of the land now known as Darling Harbour is Tambalong, in Dharag language.\nDarling Harbour is named after Lieutenant-General Ralph Darling, who was Governor of New South Wales from 1825 to 1831. The area was originally known as Long Cove, but was generally referred to as Cockle Bay until 1826 when Governor Darling renamed it after himself. The name Cockle Bay has recently been restored in reference to the headwaters of the harbour. It was originally part of the commercial port of Sydney, including the Darling Harbour Railway Goods Yard. During the Great Depression, the eastern part of Darling Harbour (\"Barangaroo\") became known as The Hungry Mile, a reference to the waterside workers searching for jobs along the wharves.\nMuch of the land had been the site of the NSW Railways central marshalling yards and freight consolidation centre. The Enquiry into the NSW industry, including rail/road competition (1978\u201380), under Commissioner Gavan McDonell, found that this centre was inefficient, should be moved, and the land used for other public purposes. These recommendations were acted upon and by the mid-to-late 1980s, when the area had become largely derelict it was redeveloped as a pedestrian and tourist precinct as an initiative of then New South Wales Minister for Public Works, Laurie Brereton. The Sydney Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre at Darling Harbour was a venue of the 2000 Summer Olympic Games and a key meeting venue of APEC Australia 2007.\nOn 26 January 1994, Charles III then Prince of Wales, was giving a speech during the Australia Day celebrations. David Kang ran at the Prince whilst firing two blanks before falling onto the ground and being promptly held and arrested. The Prince was unhurt and was ushered off the podium.\nHeritage listings.\nDarling Harbour has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\nAttractions.\nThe Darling Harbour precinct is home to a number of major public facilities and attractions, including:\nTransport.\nDarling Harbour is accessible via various modes of public transport. The precinct is served by the Inner West Light Rail of Sydney's light rail network, with access via Paddy's Markets, Convention, Exhibition and Pyrmont Bay stations. Ferry wharves including Barangaroo and Pyrmont Bay provide access to the Pyrmont Bay ferry services to Circular Quay and other suburbs while the Barangaroo wharf also provides access to the Parramatta River ferry services. King Street Wharf is accessible by private boat charters. The Goods Line is a park and pedestrian pathway connecting Darling Harbour to Railway Square and Central station. The nearest train station is Town Hall.\nProposed Metro station.\nDarling Harbour will be served by Pyrmont as a future rapid transit station that will be built as part of the Sydney Metro West project.\nRedevelopment.\nEast Darling Harbour has been part of a large urban renewal development. Plans for the site include half business and residential developments, while the other half to be reserved for open public space. The state government of NSW declared plans for \"Globe Street\", a street designed to become Australia's and Asia Pacific's centre for corporate trade (styled on New York's Wall Street district). The urban renewal development was expected to be completed by 2020. East Darling Harbour is now known as a part of the Barangaroo precinct.\nAt the south end of Cockle Bay, the Sydney Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre site was replaced by the new International Convention Centre Sydney (ICC Sydney), opened in December 2016. The new site includes a exhibition facility. Other new facilities within the Darling Harbour region include the ICC Theatre, an 8,000 seat mixed purpose venue for concerts and intimate shows, replacing the Sydney Entertainment Centre, a gallery, and a 25 story multi purpose venue called The Ribbon (replacing the IMAX Theatre, which was closed and demolished in late 2016), opened on 11 October 2023 with an updated theatre.\nThis area was the site of the Sydney Port Authority and featured an Overseas Passenger Terminal (Wharf 8) which was mainly used by the \"Pacific Dawn\" of the P&amp;O Cruises Australia fleet and the \"Sun Princess\", operated by Princess Cruises. The passenger terminal is now in White Bay on the site of a former container terminal.\nOn the west side of Cockle Bay, the Harbourside Shopping Centre, built in 1988, was demolished in 2023, and a new Harbourside Residences project is under construction in 2024/2025.\nIn popular culture.\nDarling Harbour is the location of the season residence on MTV's reality TV show, \"\", which aired in late 2007.

{"id": "65565", "revid": "47970422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65565", "title": "Progressive metal", "text": "Music genre melding heavy metal and progressive rock\nProgressive metal (often shortened to prog metal) is a broad fusion music genre melding heavy metal and progressive rock, combining the loud aggression and amplified distorted guitar-driven sound of the former with the more experimental, cerebral or quasi-classical compositions of the latter.\nThe music typically showcases the extreme technical proficiency of the performers and usually uses unorthodox harmonies as well as complex rhythms with frequent meter changes and intense syncopation. The polyrhythmic aspects are especially emphasized in the djent subgenre. \nAlthough the genre emerged towards the late-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that progressive metal achieved widespread success. Dream Theater, Watchtower, Queensr\u00ffche, Tool, Symphony X, Shadow Gallery, King's X, Fates Warning, and Mastodon are a few examples of progressive metal bands who achieved commercial success.\nHistory.\nProgressive metal, as a distinct musical style, was primarily advanced by members of the American heavy metal scene of the mid-1980s, particularly Queensr\u00ffche, Savatage, Fates Warning, Watchtower and then later on, Dream Theater and Symphony X. It has since developed in a non-linear fashion, with countless groups demonstrating innovations in personal ways.\nThe origins of the genre date back to the very beginning of heavy metal/hard rock and progressive rock when some bands began to merge the two different approaches. 1960s pioneers King Crimson maintained their musical innovation while incorporating a harder approach, using dissonance and experimental tones, yet still maintaining a relationship to the power chords of hard rock, with the main example being \"21st Century Schizoid Man\". Canadian trio Rush is widely recognized as bridging the gap between hard rock, English progressive rock, and pure heavy metal. Initially influenced by Led Zeppelin, they evolved to combine established progressive rock technique with blues-based power chords. Records such as \"2112\" (1976) showcased technical expertise and complex compositional skill while still utilizing a more direct and heavier approach than the well-established English progressive rock sound.\n1984 brought full-length debut albums from American bands Queensr\u00ffche from Washington state, and Fates Warning from Connecticut. Both expanded their music to include more progressive elements (\"The Warning,\" 1984; \"The Spectre Within,\" 1985) \u2013 some through sound experimentation and compositional refinement, others through extremely complex structures and atypical riffs \u2013 up to the two seminal works in 1986: \"Rage for Order\" and \"Awaken the Guardian\". In the following years the two bands, while following different paths \u2013 more basic and simple the first, more articulate and complex the latter \u2014 explore and expand the technical refinement and sonic finesse of their music, continuing to lay the foundations of the genre with important works such as \"\" (1988) by Queensr\u00ffche, and \"Perfect Symmetry\" (1989) by Fates Warning.\nProgressive metal also found a home in the growing U.S. thrash metal movement, and many bands of the genre released albums that drew elements and influences of progressive music, including the \"Big Four\" of thrash metal \u2014 Metallica (\"Ride the Lightning\", 1984; \"Master of Puppets\", 1986; \"...And Justice for All\", 1988), Slayer (\"Hell Awaits\", 1985), Anthrax (\"Persistence of Time\", 1990), and Megadeth (\"Rust in Peace\", 1990). Bands that took a technical and progressive approach similar to the \"Big Four\" were Toxik (\"World Circus\", 1987; \"Think This\", 1989), Overkill (\"The Years of Decay\", 1989), Dark Angel (\"Leave Scars\", 1989; \"Time Does Not Heal\", 1991), and Bay Area thrash metal bands Forbidden (\"Twisted into Form\", 1990), Heathen (\"Victims of Deception\", 1991), and, on some of their late 1980s and 1990s output, Testament. One of the most notable thrash metal bands outside of the U.S. is Canada's Voivod, with their complex and experimental style, full of psychedelic dissonances (\"Dimension Hatr\u00f6ss,\" 1988; \"Nothingface,\" 1989). \"Math-metal\" pioneers Watchtower, from Texas, took the concept of time-changes to a new level, combining thrash metal, syncopation and prog in their albums \"Energetic Disassembly\" (1985) and \"Control and Resistance\" (1989), giving rise to an extremely technical approach based on the rhythmic deconstruction typical in jazz fusion. This same direction in prog metal would be later integrated into death metal by bands such as Atheist (\"Unquestionable Presence,\" 1991), which would become known as technical death metal or progressive death metal. Bands which also explored fusion-inspired prog metal include most notably Death and Cynic.\nThe major US bands that contribute to further delineating and developing the genre are Psychotic Waltz and Dream Theater. The former, with an approach halfway in between Watchtower and Fates Warning, produced \"A Social Grace\" (1990), melding their signature sound with the psychedelic \"Into the Everflow\" (1992), while the latter explored the legacy of the bands that preceded them while advancing their personal style with \"When Dream and Day Unite\" (1989). Both albums focused on keyboards and band members' instrumental skills. As for Dream Theater, their efforts resulted in two fundamental albums, which helped institutionalize classic progressive metal \u2014 \"Images and Words\" (1992) and \"Awake\" (1994). King's X, who emerged from a Christian rock background, incorporated their sound with influences of hard rock, metal, progressive rock, funk, soul and bands from The Beatles to U2 on their early albums \u2014 particularly their first three albums, \"Out of the Silent Planet\" (1988), \"Gretchen Goes to Nebraska\" (1989) and \"Faith Hope Love\" (1990) \u2014 before leaning more towards an alternative and grunge-inspired hard rock sound on their later output, including the highly-successful \"Dogman\" (1994). Other hard rock bands from this era that experimented with influences of progressive music into their sound include Europe, The Cult, Winger, Living Colour, Mr. Big, and Extreme.\nAmong European pioneers of the genre are Germany's Sieges Even, who, starting out of technical thrash stylistically significant to Watchtower, explored the more technical and angular side of progressive metal with \"The Art of Navigating by the Stars\" (2005). Swiss band Coroner, formed by roadies of Celtic Frost, have also been credited as pioneers of the style of technical thrash metal. They released a string of influential albums through the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"Punishment for Decadence\" (1988), \"No More Color\" (1989) and \"Mental Vortex\" (1991), the latter two \"etched Coroner's name onto the walls of the progressive metal hall of fame.\"Among the bands of the late 1990s who brought innovation to the genre are the Dutch Ayreon (a project by Arjen Anthony Lucassen) and Swedes Pain of Salvation. Ayreon focused on theatrical and melodramatic rock operas \"Into the Electric Castle\" (1998) and \"The Human Equation\" (2004), performed by many different members of prominent metal bands. Pain of Salvation was always working towards a more or less unusual style, demonstrated by the eclecticism and anti-conformism found on \"One Hour by the Concrete Lake\" (1998), and \"BE\" (2004). Forerunners of a more experimental and alternative approach include Thought Industry, as seen in their album \"\" (1993).\nPuerto Rican band Puya rose to prominence in the late 1990s with their innovative fusion of jazz, salsa, and progressive metal, evident on their 1999 album \"Fundamental\".\nSome of the first bands to pioneer the combination of progressive rock and extreme metal influences were Dan Swan\u00f6's Edge of Sanity, and Opeth, both bands hailing from Sweden. In particular, Edge of Sanity's \"Crimson\" (1996), a 40-minute concept album consisting of a single track, brought the band critical acclaim and was heralded as one of the first extreme-metal forays into a progressive rock-esque concept album, featuring death-metal vocals and heavily distorted guitars, with guest vocals and lead guitar from Opeth's Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt. Dan Swan\u00f6 produced Opeth's first release, \"Orchid\" (1995), which was unique for its combination of death metal vocals and instrumentation, melodic guitar harmonies, and acoustic passages, but it wasn't until their hallmark record \"Blackwater Park\" (2001) that they received critical acclaim. Steven Wilson, progressive rock icon and frontman of Porcupine Tree, was given a copy of Opeth's prior record \"Still Life\" (1999) from a friend, and, after listening, noted that the experimental music he had been after had drifted into extreme metal. Being mutual fans of each other's work, Steven ended up co-producing \"Blackwater Park\" along with Opeth's frontman Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt, and would go on to co-produce \"Deliverance\" (2002) and \"Damnation\" (2003), together a would-be double album. Their next release, Ghost Reveries, became an \"instant classic,\" followed by \"Watershed\", their last \"heavy\" album, both of which have had significant influence on the progressive metal genre, along with other \"extreme metal\" bands like Meshuggah. This style of progressive metal is often referred to as \"extreme progressive metal,\" or \"extreme prog,\" for short. Later bands who would play in this style are Ne Obliviscaris, Disillusion. Porcupine Tree would later be influenced by this style, and in particular from Opeth, while Opeth would subsequently switch to a more traditional progressive metal/rock band, devoid of extreme metal elements.\nBetween the Buried and Me, who started as a more straightforward metalcore band, also began to incorporate both progressive metal and death metal into their music on their 2003 album \"The Silent Circus\", a landmark album in the progressive metalcore genre. They would later add avant-garde elements as well on releases such as \"The Great Misdirect\" (2009).\nIn the 2010s, due to the rapid growth of djent led by bands such as Periphery and After the Burial, progressive metal saw an increased interest with a large number of newcomers to the genre. Some of the newer progressive metal bands that have gained popularity since the 2010s are Haken, Plini, Vola, and Caligula's Horse, among others.\nStylistic diversity.\nOne of the hallmark musical qualities of progressive metal is eclecticism. In between the riffs, choruses, and solos typical of rock and metal songs, prog metal bands often include sections inspired by jazz, classical and Middle Eastern music, among others. Progressive metal is difficult to define specifically, since most bands labeled under the genre have considerably different musical influences when compared to each other.\nSimilarly, bands such as Dream Theater, Planet X and Puya have a jazz influence, with extended solo sections that often feature \"trading solos\". \nOrphaned Land from Israel debuted as a melodic death-doom/melodic death metal band that fused middle eastern rhythms and melodies into their music with a progressive edge. The band knew they wanted to create a new subgenre of metal from the very beginning, a style they would dub \"oriental metal,\" and were always viewed as progressive due to the nature of the middle eastern elements of their music, which is known for using time signatures that are uncommon in the west, expansive song structures, and microtones. As their career developed, they would later play in a more traditional progressive metal style, comparable to Opeth, Symphony X, and the like, while maintaining their \"oriental\" edge. Steven Wilson, who lived in Israel for some time playing in Blackfield, found Ophaned Land to be \"something special\" after listening to Mabool and, would end up producing and engineering The Never Ending Way of ORWarriOR.\nIn the late 2000s, bands such as Periphery, Tesseract, Animals as Leaders and Vildhjarta popularized the \"djent\" style of progressive metal in a sound originally developed by Meshuggah. It is characterized by high-attack, palm-muted, syncopated riffs (often incorporating polymeters), as well as use of extended-range guitars. Extended-range guitars also feature in other forms of progressive metal; artists including Dream Theater, Devin Townsend, Dir En Grey, and Ne Obliviscaris have used seven-string guitars without being part of the djent movement, Dream Theater having been one of the earliest progressive metal bands to incorporate seven-stringed guitars into their music.\nProyecto Eskhata, a Spanish band, has received much press coverage in Spain for its fusion of progressive rock and rap metal, which journalists have described as \"progressive rap metal\".\nProgressive doom is a fusion genre that combines elements of progressive metal and doom metal. Bands include King Goat, Below the Sun, Sierra, and Oceans of Slumber.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Generally regarded as the only ship of her class, she was built to a modified design. Her aircraft supported the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in mid-1940. She took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Wake Island. During the first few months of the Pacific War, the ship supported the conquest of the Dutch East Indies in January 1942. The following month, her aircraft bombed Darwin, Australia; and continued to assist in the Dutch East Indies campaign. In April, \"Hiry\u016b\"'s aircraft helped sink two British heavy cruisers and several merchant ships during the Indian Ocean Raid.\nAfter a brief refit, \"Hiry\u016b\" and three other fleet carriers of the First Air Fleet (\"Kido Butai\") participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on the atoll, the carriers were attacked by aircraft from Midway and the carriers , , and . Dive bombers from \"Yorktown\" and \"Enterprise\" crippled \"Hiry\u016b\" and set her afire. She was scuttled the following day after it became clear that she could not be salvaged. The loss of \"Hiry\u016b\" and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to the Allies' ultimate victory in the Pacific.\nDesign.\n\"Hiry\u016b\" was one of two large carriers approved for construction under the 1931\u20131932 Supplementary Program. Originally designed as the sister ship of \"S\u014dry\u016b\", her design was enlarged and modified in light of the \"Tomozuru\" and Fourth Fleet Incidents in 1934\u20131935 that revealed many IJN ships were top-heavy, unstable and structurally weak. Her forecastle was raised and her hull strengthened. Other changes involved increasing her beam, displacement, and armor protection.\nThe ship had a length of overall, a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at standard load and at normal load. Her crew consisted of 1,100 officers and enlisted men.\nMachinery.\n\"Hiry\u016b\" was fitted with four geared steam turbine sets with a total of , each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by eight Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines and boilers were the same as those used in the s. The ship's power and slim, cruiser-type hull with a length-to-beam ratio of 10:1 gave her a speed of and made her the fastest carrier in the world at the time of her commissioning. \"Hiry\u016b\" carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at . The boiler uptakes were trunked to the ship's starboard side amidships and exhausted just below flight deck level through two funnels curved downward.\nFlight deck and hangars.\nThe carrier's flight deck was wide and overhung her superstructure at both ends, supported by pairs of pillars. \"Hiry\u016b\" was one of only two carriers ever built whose island was on the port side of the ship ( was the other). It was also positioned further to the rear and encroached on the width of the flight deck, unlike \"S\u014dry\u016b\". Nine transverse arrestor wires were installed on the flight deck that could stop a aircraft. One group of three wires was positioned further forward to allow the ship to land aircraft over the bow, although this was never done in practice. The flight deck was only above the waterline and the ship's designers kept this figure low by reducing the height of the hangars. The upper hangar was and had an approximate height of ; the lower was and had an approximate height of . Together they had an approximate total area of . This caused problems in handling aircraft because the wings of a Nakajima B5N \"Kate\" torpedo bomber could neither be spread nor folded in the upper hangar.\nAircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by three elevators, the forward one abreast the island on the centerline and the other two offset to starboard. The forward platform measured , the middle one , and the rear . They were capable of transferring aircraft weighing up to . \"Hiry\u016b\" had a designed aircraft capacity of 64, plus nine spares.\nArmament.\n\"Hiry\u016b\"'s primary anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of six twin-gun mounts equipped with 12.7-centimeter Type 89 dual-purpose guns mounted on projecting sponsons, three on either side of the carrier's hull. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was approximately eight rounds per minute. The ship was equipped with two Type 94 fire-control directors to control the guns, one for each side of the ship; the starboard-side director was on top of the island and the other director was positioned below flight deck level on the port side.\nThe ship's light AA armament consisted of seven triple and five twin-gun mounts for license-built Hotchkiss 25\u00a0mm Type 96 AA guns. Two of the triple mounts were sited on a platform just below the forward end of the flight deck. The gun was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to \"handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast, and its magazines were too small to maintain high rates of fire\". These guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. The Type 96 guns were controlled by five Type 95 directors, two on each side and one in the bow.\nArmor.\n\"Hiry\u016b\" had a waterline belt with a maximum thickness of over the magazines that reduced to over the machinery spaces and the avgas storage tanks. It was backed by an internal anti-splinter bulkhead. The ship's deck was thick over the machinery spaces and thick over the magazines and avgas storage tanks.\nConstruction and service.\nFollowing the Japanese ship-naming conventions for aircraft carriers, \"Hiry\u016b\" was named \"Flying Dragon\". The ship was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 8 July 1936, launched on 16 November 1937 and commissioned on 5 July 1939. She was assigned to the Second Carrier Division on 15 November. In September 1940, the ship's air group was transferred to Hainan Island to support the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. In February 1941, \"Hiry\u016b\" supported the blockade of Southern China. Two months later, the 2nd Carrier Division, commanded by Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, was assigned to the First Air Fleet, or \"Kido Butai\", on 10 April. \"Hiry\u016b\" returned to Japan on 7 August and began a short refit that was completed on 15 September. She became flagship of the Second Division from 22 September to 26 October while \"S\u014dry\u016b\" was refitting.\nPearl Harbor and subsequent operations.\nIn November 1941, the IJN's Combined Fleet, commanded by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, prepared to participate in Japan's initiation of a formal war with the United States by conducting a preemptive strike against the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 22 November, \"Hiry\u016b\", commanded by Captain Tomeo Kaku, and the rest of the \"Kido Butai\", under Vice Admiral Ch\u016bichi Nagumo and including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hitokappu Bay at Etorofu Island. The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north-central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes. Now the flagship of the Second Carrier Division, the ship embarked 21 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, 18 Aichi D3A \"Val\" dive bombers, and 18 Nakajima B5N \"Kate\" torpedo bombers. From a position north of Oahu, \"Hiry\u016b\" and the other five carriers launched two waves of aircraft on the morning of 7 December 1941 Hawaiian time.\nIn the first wave, 8 B5N torpedo bombers were supposed to attack the aircraft carriers that normally berthed on the northwest side of Ford Island, but none were in Pearl Harbor that day; 4 of the B5N pilots diverted to their secondary target, ships berthed alongside \"1010 Pier\" where the fleet flagship was usually moored. That ship, the battleship , was in drydock and its position was occupied by the light cruiser and the minelayer ; all four torpedoes missed. The other four pilots attacked the battleships and . The remaining 10 B5Ns were tasked to drop armor-piercing bombs on the battleships berthed on the southeast side of Ford Island (\"Battleship Row\") and may have scored one or two hits on them, in addition to causing a magazine explosion aboard the battleship that sank her with heavy loss of life. The 6 A6M Zeros strafed parked aircraft at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa (MCAS Ewa), claiming 22 aircraft destroyed.\nThe second wave consisted of 9 Zeros and 18 D3As, one of each aborting with mechanical problems. The former strafed Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay before moving on to attack Bellows Army Airfield. They strafed the airfield, and shot down two Curtiss P-40 fighters attempting to take off when the Zeros arrived and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber that had earlier diverted from Hickam Army Airfield, and also destroyed a Stinson O-49 observation aircraft on the ground for the loss of one of their own. The fighters with remaining ammunition expended it strafing MCAS Ewa, the rendezvous point for the second-wave fighters. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but it is not possible to identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two D3As from \"Hiry\u016b\" were lost during the attack, one shot down by Second Lieutenant George Welch.\nWhile returning to Japan after the attack, Nagumo ordered that \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and \"Hiry\u016b\" be detached on 16 December to attack the defenders of Wake Island who had already defeated the first Japanese attack on the island. The two carriers reached the vicinity of the island on 21 December and launched 29 D3As and 2 B5Ns, escorted by 18 Zeros, to attack ground targets. They encountered no aerial opposition and launched 35 B5Ns and 6 A6M Zeros the following day. They were intercepted by the 2 surviving Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters of Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-211. The Wildcats shot down 2 B5Ns before they were shot down by PO3c Isao Towara. The garrison surrendered the next day after Japanese troops were landed.\nThe carriers arrived at Kure on 29 December. They were assigned to the Southern Force on 8 January 1942 and departed four days later for the Dutch East Indies. The ships supported the invasion of the Palau Islands and the Battle of Ambon, attacking Allied positions on the island on 23 January with 54 aircraft. Four days later the carriers detached 18 Zeros and 9 D3As to operate from land bases in support of Japanese operations in the Battle of Borneo. \"Hiry\u016b\" and \"S\u014dry\u016b\" arrived at Palau on 28 January and waited for the arrival of the carriers and \"Akagi\". All four carriers departed Palau on 15 February and launched air strikes against Darwin, Australia, four days later. \"Hiry\u016b\" contributed 18 B5Ns, 18 D3As, and 9 Zeros to the attack. Her aircraft attacked the ships in port and its facilities, sinking or setting on fire three ships and damaging two others. The Zeros destroyed 1 P-40E as it was taking off, 2 Consolidated PBY Catalina seaplanes on the water, and a Zero was forced to crash land after being damaged by a P-40E of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 33rd Pursuit Squadron.\n\"Hiry\u016b\" and the other carriers arrived at Staring Bay on Celebes Island on 21 February to resupply and rest before departing four days later to support the invasion of Java. On 1 March 1942, the ship's D3As damaged the destroyer badly enough for her to be caught and sunk by Japanese cruisers. Later that day the dive bombers sank the oil tanker . The four carriers launched an airstrike of 180 aircraft against Tjilatjep on 5 March and set the town on fire, sinking five small ships, and damaging nine others that later had to be scuttled. Two days later, they attacked Christmas Island and \"Hiry\u016b\"'s aircraft sank the Dutch freighter \"Poelau Bras\" before returning to Staring Bay on 11 March to resupply and train for the impending Indian Ocean raid. This raid was intended to secure newly conquered Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies against any Allied attack by destroying base facilities and forces in the eastern Indian Ocean.\nIndian Ocean Raid.\nOn 26 March, the five carriers of the First Air Fleet departed from Staring Bay; they were spotted by a Catalina about southeast of Ceylon on the morning of 4 April. Six of \"Hiry\u016b\"'s Zeros were on Combat Air Patrol (CAP) and helped to shoot it down. Nagumo closed to within of Colombo before launching an airstrike the next morning. \"Hiry\u016b\" contributed 18 B5Ns and 9 Zeros to the force; the latter encountered a flight of 6 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from 788 Naval Air Squadron en route and shot them all down without loss. The Japanese aircraft encountered defending Hawker Hurricane fighters from Nos. 30 and 258 Squadrons RAF over Ratmalana airfield and \"Hiry\u016b\"'s fighters claimed to have shot down 11 with 3 Zeros damaged, although the fighters from the other carriers also made claims. British losses were 21 Hurricanes shot down and 2 more forced to crash land. The D3As and B5Ns inflicted some damage to the port facilities, but a day's warning had allowed much of the shipping in the harbor to be evacuated. The British were attempting to find Nagumo's ships all morning and \"Hiry\u016b\"'s Zeros on CAP over the fleet helped to shoot down an RAF Catalina, shot down a Fairey Albacore torpedo bomber and drove off another from the carrier . Later that morning the British heavy cruisers and were spotted and \"Hiry\u016b\" launched 18 D3As. They sank both ships in combination with the dive bombers from the other carriers.\nOn the morning of 9 April, \"Hiry\u016b\"'s CAP shot down another Catalina attempting to locate the fleet and, later that morning, contributed 18 B5Ns, escorted by 6 Zeros, to the attack on Trincomalee. The fighters engaged 261 Squadron RAF, claiming to have shot down two with two more shared with fighters from the other carriers. British losses were only eight fighters, but the Japanese pilots claimed a total of 49 aircraft shot down when the RAF only had 16 Hurricanes in the fight. The British pilots shot down one of \"Hiry\u016b\"'s B5Ns and forced another to crash land while they were bombing the port. Meanwhile, a floatplane from the battleship spotted the small aircraft carrier , escorted by the destroyer , and every available D3A was launched to attack the ships, escorted by nine Zeros. \"Hiry\u016b\" contributed 18 dive bombers and 3 fighters, but they arrived too late to assist in sinking them and found two other ships further north. They sank the freighter RFA \"Athelstone\" and her escorting corvette, . While this was going on, \"Akagi\" narrowly escaped damage when 9 British Bristol Blenheim bombers from Ceylon penetrated the CAP and dropped their bombs from . \"Hiry\u016b\" had eight Zeros aloft, along with 12 more from the other carriers, and collectively they accounted for 5 of the British bombers for the loss of 1 of \"Hiry\u016b\"'s Zeros. The Blenheims ran into the D3As from , escorted by \"Hiry\u016b\"'s Zeros, on their way back home and lost one more bomber to the Japanese aircraft. The dive bombers claimed to have shot down two Blenheims in conjunction with the Zeros, which claimed one on their own, for the loss of one Zero shot down by the bombers' gunners and one D3A damaged. After launching the dive bombers that sank \"Hermes\" and the other ships, the First Air Fleet reversed course and headed southeast for the Malacca Strait and Japan.\nOn 19 April, while transiting the Bashi Straits between Taiwan and Luzon en route to Japan, \"Hiry\u016b\", \"S\u014dry\u016b\", and \"Akagi\" were sent in pursuit of the American carriers and , which had launched the Doolittle Raid against Tokyo. They found only empty ocean, as the American carriers had immediately departed the area to return to Hawaii. The carriers quickly abandoned the chase and dropped anchor at Hashirajima anchorage on 22 April. Having been engaged in constant operations for four and a half months, the ship, along with the other three carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions, was hurriedly refitted and replenished in preparation for the Combined Fleet's next major operation, scheduled to begin one month hence. While at Hashirajima, \"Hiry\u016b\"'s air group was based ashore at Tomitaka Airfield, near Saiki, \u014cita, and conducted flight and weapons training with the other First Air Fleet carrier units.\nMidway.\nConcerned by the American carrier strikes in the Marshall Islands, Lae-Salamaua, and the Doolittle raids, Yamamoto was determined to force the U.S. Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. He decided to invade and occupy Midway Atoll, which he was sure would draw out the American carriers to defend it. The Japanese code-named the Midway invasion Operation \"MI\". Unknown to the Japanese, the U.S. Navy had divined the Japanese plan by breaking its JN-25 code and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.\nOn 25 May 1942, \"Hiry\u016b\" set out with the Combined Fleet's carrier striking force in the company of \"Kaga\", \"Akagi\", and \"S\u014dry\u016b\", which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on Midway. Her aircraft complement consisted of 18 Zeros, 18 D3As, and 18 B5Ns. Also aboard were three A6Ms of the 6th K\u014dk\u016btai intended as the aerial garrison for Midway. With the fleet positioned northwest of Midway at dawn (04:45 local time) on 4 June 1942, \"Hiry\u016b\"'s portion of the 108-plane airstrike was an attack on the facilities on Sand Island with 18 torpedo bombers, one of which aborted with mechanical problems, escorted by nine Zeros. The air group suffered heavily during the attack: Two B5Ns were shot down by fighters, with a third falling victim to antiaircraft fire. Heavy damage forced a fourth, flown by squadron leader Rokuro Kikuchi, to crash-land on Kure Atoll, where he and his crew were later discovered and killed by U.S. forces. A fifth B5N was forced to ditch on its return, and five more were damaged beyond repair. In addition, two Zeros were also deemed unserviceable, although none were lost.\nThe carrier also contributed three Zeros to the total of 11 assigned to the initial CAP over the four carriers. By 07:05, the carrier had six fighters with the CAP, which helped to defend the \"Kido Butai\" from the first U.S. attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. At this time, Nagumo's carriers were attacked by six U.S. Navy Grumman TBF Avengers and four USAAC Martin B-26 Marauders, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after \"Hiry\u016b\" while the Marauders attacked \"Akagi\". The 30 CAP Zeros in the air at this time, including the six from \"Hiry\u016b\", immediately attacked the American airplanes, shooting down five of the Avengers and two of the B-26s. The Avengers shot down one of \"Hiry\u016b\"'s Zeros. The surviving aircraft dropped their torpedoes, but all missed.\nAt 07:15, Nagumo ordered the B5Ns on \"Kaga\" and \"Akagi\" rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway Island. This process was slowed by the number of ordnance carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. This meant that the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40, he reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, two of \"Hiry\u016b\"'s CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:40.\nAt 07:55, the next American strike from Midway arrived in the form of 16 Marine Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers of Marine Scout Bomber Squadron 241 (VMSB-241) under Major Lofton R. Henderson. \"Hiry\u016b\"'s three CAP fighters were among the nine still aloft that attacked Henderson's planes, shooting down six of them as they executed a fruitless glide bombing attack on \"Hiry\u016b\". In return, the gunner of one of the Dauntlesses shot down one of \"Hiry\u016b\"'s Zeros. At roughly the same time, the Japanese carriers were attacked by 12 USAAC B-17s, bombing from . The high altitude of the B-17s gave the Japanese captains enough time to anticipate where the bombs would land, and they successfully maneuvered out of the impact area. Four B-17s attacked \"Hiry\u016b\", but missed with all their bombs.\n\"Hiry\u016b\" reinforced the CAP with launches of three more Zeros at 08:25. These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next American air strike from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship \"Haruna\" starting around 08:30. \"Haruna\" escaped damage and three of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, they kept the Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.\n\"Hiry\u016b\" began recovering her Midway strike force at around 09:00 and finished shortly by 09:10. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers' crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations were interrupted at 09:18, when the first attacking American carrier aircraft were sighted. These consisted of 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron from the \"Hornet\". They attempted a torpedo attack on \"Sory\u016b\", but all of the American planes were shot down by the 18 CAP fighters, leaving one surviving aviator treading water.\nShortly afterwards, 14 Devastators from Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6) from \"Enterprise\", led by Lieutenant Commander Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey's aircraft tried to sandwich \"Kaga\", but the CAP, reinforced by four additional Zeros launched by \"Hiry\u016b\" at 09:37, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and \"Kaga\" dodged the torpedoes. \"Hiry\u016b\" launched another trio of CAP Zeros at 10:13 after Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3) from \"Yorktown\" was spotted. Two of her Zeros were shot down by Wildcats escorting VT-3 and another was forced to ditch.\nWhile VT-3 was still attacking \"Hiry\u016b\", American dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. It was at this time, around 10:20, that in the words of Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, the \"Japanese air defenses would finally and catastrophically fail.\" Three American dive bomber squadrons now attacked the three other carriers and set each of them on fire. \"Hiry\u016b\" was untouched and proceeded to launch 18 D3As, escorted by six Zeros, at 10:54. \"En route\", the Zeros engaged a group of \"Enterprise\" SBDs that they had spotted. They failed to shoot down any of the dive bombers, but two of the Zeros were shot up by the bombers' rear gunners, with one Zero forced to ditch near a destroyer on its return. American radar detected the incoming Japanese dive bombers at 11:52 and vectored \"Yorktown\"'s CAP of 20 Wildcats against them. The Wildcats shot down three of the remaining Zeros for the loss of one of their own and engaged the D3As. Only seven of the dive bombers survived long enough to make their attack on \"Yorktown\" and two of those were shot down by flak during their dive, but they made three direct hits and two near misses that badly damaged the carrier and set her on fire.\nConfident that his men had sunk \"Yorktown\", Yamaguchi launched a second wave of ten B5Ns (including one from \"Akagi\"), escorted by six Zeros (two from \"Kaga\"), at 13:30, with the instruction that they attack a separate carrier than that hit by the first wave. However, the Americans had managed to extinguish the fires on \"Yorktown\" by 14:00, and the carrier was making by 14:30 when the second strike group approached. As a result, the strike pilots mistook her for one of her undamaged sisters, and launched the attack. At that moment, six Wildcats were on CAP duty, and four of these were vectored toward the attacking aircraft while the other two were retained to cover the takeoff of ten Wildcats fueling on deck. The Japanese were jumped at 14:38 by two Wildcats, which shot down one torpedo bomber before they were both shot down by the escorting Zeros (two Zeros were shot down later for the loss of one Wildcat). Four more B5Ns fell during the attack, but two of the survivors managed to score hits on \"Yorktown\" that damaged three boilers and knocked out all electrical power so that she could not pump fuel oil to starboard to counteract her six-degree list to port. Seventeen minutes later, after the list increased to 23 degrees, the crew was ordered to abandon ship. Of the four Zeros and five B5Ns that returned to \"Hiry\u016b\", only two Zeros and three bombers were still airworthy.\nYamaguchi radioed his intention to Nagumo at 16:30 to launch a third strike against the American carriers at dusk (approximately 18:00), but Nagumo ordered the fleet to withdraw to the west. Unbeknownst to the Japanese, \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\" had already launched airstrikes well before then. \"Enterprise\" launched a total of 26 Dauntlesses at 15:25 using her own aircraft plus those from \"Yorktown\" that had been forced to recover aboard her after \"Yorktown\" was damaged, and \"Hornet\" launched 16 more of her own Dauntlesses at 16:00. At this point in the battle, \"Hiry\u016b\" had only four airworthy dive-bombers and five torpedo-planes left. She also retained 19 of her own fighters on board, as well as a further 13 Zeros on CAP (a composite force of survivors from the other carriers). At 16:45, \"Enterprise\"'s dive bombers spotted the Japanese carrier and began to maneuver for good attacking position while reducing altitude. At 16:56, just as the first Dauntlesses were beginning their dives, Nagumo ordered a change in course to 120 degrees, possibly to prepare to recover his reconnaissance floatplanes, that threw off the aim of the leading SBDs. The Japanese did not even spot the Americans until 17:01. The CAP shot down two of the American aircraft in their dives and another after it was forced to abort its dive when some of \"Yorktown\"'s SBDs passed in front of it, starting their own dives. \"Hiry\u016b\" was struck by four bombs, three on the forward flight deck and one on the forward elevator. The explosions started fires among the aircraft on the hangar deck. The forward half of the flight deck collapsed into the hangar while part of the elevator was hurled against the ship's bridge. The fires were severe enough that the remaining American aircraft attacked the other ships escorting \"Hiry\u016b\", albeit without effect, deeming further attacks on the carrier as a waste of time, because she was aflame from stem to stern. Beginning at 17:42, two groups of B-17s attempted to attack the Japanese ships without success, although one bomber strafed \"Hiry\u016b\"'s flight deck, killing several anti-aircraft gunners.\nAlthough \"Hiry\u016b\"'s propulsion was not affected, the fires could not be brought under control. At 21:23, her engines stopped, and at 23:58 a major explosion rocked the ship. The order to abandon ship was given at 03:15, and the survivors were taken off by the destroyers and . Yamaguchi and Kaku decided to remain on board as \"Hiry\u016b\" was torpedoed at 05:10 by \"Makigumo\" as the ship could not be salvaged. One torpedo missed and the other struck near the bow without the typical plume of water, although the detonation was quite visible. Around 07:00, one of 's Yokosuka B4Y aircraft discovered \"Hiry\u016b\" still afloat and not in any visible danger of sinking. The aviators could also see crewmen aboard the carrier, men who had not received word to abandon ship. They finally launched some of the carrier's boats and abandoned ship around 09:00. Thirty-nine men made it into the ship's cutter only moments before \"Hiry\u016b\" sank around 09:12, taking the bodies of 389 men with her. The cutter drifted for 14 days before being discovered by a PBY Catalina and rescued by the seaplane tender . Four men died of their wounds or exposure before being picked up and a fifth died that night.\nThe loss of \"Hiry\u016b\" and the three other IJN carriers at Midway, comprising two thirds of Japan's total number of fleet carriers and the experienced core of the First Air Fleet, was a strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war. In an effort to conceal the defeat, the ship was not immediately removed from the Navy's registry of ships, instead being listed as \"unmanned\" before finally being struck from the registry on 25 September 1942.\nThe IJN selected a modified version of the \"Hiry\u016b\" design for mass production to replace the carriers lost at Midway. Of a planned program of 16 ships of the , only six were laid down and three were commissioned before the end of the war.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally intended to be one of two s, \"Kaga\" was converted under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty to an aircraft carrier as the replacement for the battlecruiser , which had been irreparably damaged during the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake. \"Kaga\" was rebuilt in 1933\u20131935, increasing her top speed, improving her exhaust systems, and adapting her flight decks to accommodate more modern, heavier aircraft.\nThe ship figured prominently in the development of the IJN's carrier striking force doctrine, which grouped carriers together to give greater mass and concentration to their air power. A revolutionary strategic concept at the time, the employment of the doctrine was crucial in enabling Japan to attain its initial strategic goals during the first six months of the Pacific War.\n\"Kaga\"'s aircraft first supported Japanese troops in China during the Shanghai Incident of 1932 and participated in the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s. With other carriers, she took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin, Australia, and helping secure the conquest of the Dutch East Indies by Japanese forces. She missed the Indian Ocean raid in April as she had to return to Japan for repairs after hitting a reef in February.\nFollowing repairs, \"Kaga\" rejoined the 1st Air Fleet for the Battle of Midway in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on Midway Atoll, \"Kaga\" and three other IJN carriers were attacked by American aircraft from Midway and the carriers , , and . Dive bombers from \"Enterprise\" severely damaged \"Kaga\"; when it became obvious she could not be saved, she was scuttled by Japanese destroyers to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. The loss of \"Kaga\" and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial setback for Japan, and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat. In 1999, debris from \"Kaga\" including a large section of her hull was located on the ocean floor northwest of Midway Island. In 2019, discovered her wreck on the ocean floor.\nDesign and construction.\n\"Kaga\" was laid down as a , and was launched on 17 November 1921 at the Kawasaki Heavy Industries shipyard in Kobe. On 5 February 1922 both \"Tosa\"-class ships were canceled and scheduled to be scrapped under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.\nThe Treaty authorized conversion of two battleship or battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers of up to standard displacement. The incomplete battlecruisers \"Amagi\" and were initially selected, but the Great Kant\u014d earthquake of 1923 damaged \"Amagi\"'s hull beyond economically feasible repair, and \"Kaga\" was selected as her replacement. The formal decision to convert \"Kaga\" to an aircraft carrier was issued 13 December 1923, but no work took place until 1925 as new plans were drafted and earthquake damage to the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal was repaired. She was officially commissioned on 31 March 1928, but this signified only the beginning of sea trials. She joined the Combined Fleet (\"Reng\u014d Kantai\") on 30 November 1929 as the IJN's third carrier to enter service, after (1922) and \"Akagi\" (1927).\n\"Kaga\" was completed with a length of overall. She had a beam of and a draft at full load of . She displaced at standard load, and at full load, nearly less than her designed displacement as a battleship. Her complement totaled 1,340 crewmembers.\nFlight deck arrangements.\n\"Kaga\", like \"Akagi\", was completed with three superimposed flight decks, the only carriers ever to be designed so. The British carriers converted from \"large light cruisers\", , , and , each had two flight decks, but there is no evidence that the Japanese copied the British model. It is more likely that it was a case of the parallel designs converging in separate attempts to improve launch and recovery cycle flexibility by allowing simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft. \"Kaga\"'s main flight deck was long and wide, her middle flight deck was only about long and started in front of the bridge, and her lower flight deck was approximately long. The utility of her middle flight deck was questionable as it was so short that only some of the lightly loaded aircraft could use it, even in an era when the aircraft were much lighter and smaller than they were during World War II. The ever-increasing growth in aircraft performance, size and weight during the 1930s meant that even the bottom flight deck was no longer able to accommodate the take-off roll required for the new generations of aircraft being fielded and it was plated over when the ship was modernized in the mid-1930s. \"Kaga\" lacked an island until one was added during the modernization.\nAs completed, the ship had two main hangar decks and a third auxiliary hangar with a total capacity of 60 aircraft. The hangars opened onto the middle and lower flight decks to allow aircraft to take off directly from the hangars while landing operations were in progress on the main flight deck above. No catapults were fitted. Her forward aircraft elevator was offset to starboard and in size. Her aft elevator was on the centerline and . Her arresting gear was a French transverse system as used on their aircraft carrier and known as the Model Fju (\"Fju shiki\") in the Japanese service. As originally completed, \"Kaga\" carried an air group of 28 Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers, 16 Nakajima A1N fighters and 16 Mitsubishi 2MR reconnaissance aircraft.\nArmament and armor.\n\"Kaga\" was armed with ten 3rd Year Type guns, one twin-gun Type B turret on each side of the middle flight deck and six in casemates aft. They fired projectiles at a rate of three to six rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of ; at 25\u00b0, they had a maximum range between . The Type B turrets were nominally capable of 70\u00b0 elevation to provide additional anti-aircraft (AA) fire, but in practice the maximum elevation was only 55\u00b0. The slow rate of fire and the fixed 5\u00b0 loading angle minimized any real anti-aircraft capability. This heavy gun armament was provided in case she was surprised by enemy cruisers and forced to give battle, but her large and vulnerable flight deck, hangars, and other features made her more of a target in any surface action than a fighting warship. Carrier doctrine was still evolving at this time and the impracticability of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized.\nShe was given an anti-aircraft armament of six twin 10th Year Type Model A2 gun mounts fitted on sponsons below the level of the funnels, where they could not fire across the flight deck, three mounts per side. These guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 45\u00b0 this provided a maximum range of , and they had a maximum ceiling of at 75\u00b0 elevation. Their effective rate of fire was 6 to 8 rounds per minute. She had two Type 89 directors to control her 20\u00a0cm guns and two Type 91 manually powered anti-aircraft directors (\"K\u014dshaki\") to control her 12\u00a0cm guns. \"Kaga\"'s waterline armored belt was reduced from during her reconstruction and the upper part of her torpedo bulge was given of armor. Her deck armor was also reduced from .\nPropulsion.\nWhen \"Kaga\" was being designed, the problem of how to deal with exhaust gases in carrier operations had not been resolved. The swiveling funnels of \"H\u014dsh\u014d\" had not proved successful and wind-tunnel testing had not provided an answer. As a result, \"Akagi\" and \"Kaga\" were given different exhaust systems to evaluate in real-world conditions. \"Kaga\"'s funnel gases were collected in a pair of long horizontal ducts which discharged at the rear of each side of the flight deck, in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep the hot gases away from the flight deck. The predictions proved to be correct, not least because \"Kaga\" was slower than \"Akagi\", which allowed the gases to rise and interfere with landing operations. Another drawback was that the heat of the gases made the crew's quarters located on the side of the ship by the funnels almost uninhabitable.\n\"Kaga\" was completed with four Kawasaki Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines with a total of on four shafts. As a battleship her expected speed had been , but the reduction in displacement from allowed this to increase to , as demonstrated on her sea trials on 15 September 1928. She had twelve Kampon Type B (Ro) boilers with a working pressure of , although only eight were oil-fired. The other four used a mix of oil and coal. She carried of fuel oil and of coal to give her a range of at .\nEarly service and development of carrier doctrine.\nOn 1 December 1931 \"Kaga\" was assigned as the flagship of the First Carrier Division under the command of Rear Admiral Takayoshi Kat\u014d. The First Carrier Division, along with \"H\u014dsh\u014d\", departed for Chinese waters on 29 January 1932 to support Imperial Japanese Army troops during the Shanghai Incident as part of the IJN's 3rd Fleet. The B1M3s carried by \"Kaga\" and \"H\u014dsh\u014d\" were the main bombers used during the brief combat over Shanghai.\n\"Kaga\"'s aircraft, operating from both the carrier and a temporary base at Kunda Airfield in Shanghai, flew missions in support of Japanese ground forces throughout February 1932. During one of these missions three of \"Kaga\"'s Nakajima A1N2 fighters, including one piloted by future ace Toshio Kuroiwa, escorting three Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers, scored the IJN's first air-to-air combat victory on 22 February when they shot down a Boeing P-12 flown by an American volunteer pilot. \"Kaga\" returned to home waters upon the declaration of the cease-fire on 3 March and resumed fleet training with the rest of the Combined Fleet.\nAt this time, the IJN's developing carrier doctrine was still in its earliest stages. \"Kaga\" and the other carriers were initially given roles as tactical force multipliers supporting the fleet's battleships in the IJN's \"decisive battle\" doctrine. In this role, \"Kaga\"'s aircraft were to attack enemy battleships with bombs and torpedoes. Aerial strikes against enemy carriers were later, beginning around 1932\u20131933, deemed of equal importance in order to establish air superiority during the initial stages of battle. The essential component in this strategy was that the Japanese carrier aircraft must be able to strike first with a massed aerial attack. As a result, in fleet training exercises the carriers began to operate together in front of or with the main battle line. This revolutionary strategy emphasized maximum speed from both the carriers and the aircraft they carried as well as larger aircraft with greater range. Thus, longer flight decks on the carriers were required in order to handle the newer, heavier aircraft which were entering service.\n\"Kaga\" was soon judged inferior to \"Akagi\" because of her slower speed, smaller flight deck ( shorter), and problematic funnel arrangement. Because of \"Kaga\"'s perceived limitations, she was given priority over \"Akagi\" for modernization. \"Kaga\" was relegated to reserve status on 20 October 1933 to begin a second major reconstruction, with an official start date of 25 June 1934.\nReconstruction.\nDuring her second reconstruction \"Kaga\"'s two lower flight decks were converted into hangars and, along with the main flight deck, were extended to the bow. This increased the flight deck length to and raised aircraft capacity to 90 (72 operational and 18 in storage). A third elevator forward, , serviced the extended hangars. Bomb and torpedo elevators were modified to deliver their munitions directly to the flight deck. Her arrester gear was replaced by a Japanese-designed Type 1 system. A small starboard island superstructure was also installed.\nHer power plant was completely replaced as were her propellers. \"Kaga\" was equipped with eight improved oil-burning models of the Kampon Type B (Ro) with a working pressure of at a temperature of . New Kampon multi-stage geared turbines were fitted that increased her power from during trials. The hull was lengthened by at the stern to reduce drag and she was given another torpedo bulge above the side armor abreast the upper part of the existing bulge to increase her beam and lower her center of gravity as a result of lessons learned from the \"Tomozuru\" Incident in early 1934. This raised her standard displacement significantly, from . The extra power and the extra displacement roughly offset each other and her speed increased by less than a knot, up to on trials. Her fuel storage was increased to of fuel oil which increased her endurance to at . The lengthy funnel ducting was replaced by a single downturned starboard funnel modeled on that used by the \"Akagi\" with a water-cooling system for the exhaust gasses and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gasses to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. The space freed up by the removal of the funnel ducts was divided into two decks and converted into living quarters for the expanded air group. The carrier's complement increased to 1708 crewmembers.\nThe two twin turrets on the middle flight deck were removed and four new 20\u00a0cm 3rd Year Type No. 1 guns in casemates were added forward. Her 12\u00a0cm anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eight Type 89 guns in twin mounts. They fired projectiles at a rate between 8 and 14 rounds per minute at a muzzle velocity of ; at 45\u00b0, this provided a maximum range of , and a maximum ceiling of . Their sponsons were raised one deck to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire. Eleven twin 25\u00a0mm Type 96 gun mounts were added, also on sponsons. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 50\u00b0, this provided a maximum range of , and an effective ceiling of . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. Six Type 11 machine guns were also carried. Six Type 95 directors were fitted to control the new 25\u00a0mm guns, but \"Kaga\" retained her outdated Type 91 anti-aircraft directors.\nSeveral major weaknesses in \"Kaga\"'s design were not rectified. \"Kaga\"'s aviation fuel tanks were incorporated directly into the structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made fire suppression difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement from the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. In addition, the carrier's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection. Furthermore, there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.\nSino-Japanese War.\n\"Kaga\" returned to service in 1935 and was assigned to the Second Carrier Division. The carrier embarked a new set of aircraft, including 16 Nakajima A2N Type 90 fighters, 16 Aichi D1A Type 94/96 dive bombers, and 28 Mitsubishi B2M Type 89 torpedo bombers.\nThe renewal of hostilities with China at the Marco Polo Bridge in July 1937 found \"Kaga\" in home waters. The ship's fighter squadron completed training at \u014cmura, Nagasaki then helped escort ships taking army reinforcements from Japan to China. On 15 August, along with \"H\u014dsh\u014d\" and , the ship took station in the East China Sea as part of the 3rd Fleet and began supporting Japanese military operations along the central China coast around Shanghai and further inland.\n\"Kaga\" aircraft fought their first battle on 15 August 1937, when thirteen Aichi D1A1 (Type 94) dive-bombers encountered Chinese Air Force Curtiss A-12 Shrike attack-bombers of the 26th and 27th Squadrons at Chao'er Airbase preparing for strikes against Japanese positions in Shanghai, and a dogfight duly ensued between the two unlikely dogfighting opponents; two D1A1s were shot down; a third badly shot-up D1A1 returned to \"Kaga\" with a fatally wounded crewman, while the D1A1 flight claimed three Shrikes. On 16 August 1937, six Type 90 fighters engaged four Chinese aircraft over Jiangwan, shooting down three without loss. Between 17 August and 7 September, \"Kaga\"'s Type 90 and two Mitsubishi A5M Type 96 fighters, which joined the carrier on 22 August, engaged Chinese aircraft on several more occasions. \"Kaga\"'s fighter pilots claimed to have shot down 10 Chinese aircraft in these encounters without loss. On 17 August twelve of the carrier's bombers attacked Hangzhou without fighter escort and 11 of them were shot down by Chinese fighters. On 7 September, three Type 96 (A5M) fighters escorted six Type 96 (D1A2) bombers and were engaged by three Chinese Hawk IIIs near Taihu Lake; two Type 96 bombers were quickly shot down, but the ensuing half-hour long dogfight resulted in no further losses for either side despite claims. Beginning on 15 September, six Type 90 and six Type 96 fighters, 18 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo bombers were temporarily deployed to Kunda Airfield from the ship to support land operations.\nOn 26 September the carrier went to Sasebo for reprovisioning. At Sasebo, the carrier received new replacement aircraft including 32 Yokosuka B4Y Type 96 carrier attack planes (torpedo bombers), 16 Aichi D1A2 Type 96 carrier bombers (dive bombers), and 16 more Type 96 fighters. Several Nakajima A4N Type 95 fighter aircraft augmented the carrier's fighter group at an unspecified later date.\n\"Kaga\" returned to the front in early October 1937, and except for two brief trips to Sasebo, remained off China until December 1938. Using Taiwan (then part of the Empire of Japan) as its base, the carrier steamed supporting military operations from the South and East China Seas. During that time, \"Kaga\" bombers supported army operations by attacking enemy railroad bridges, airfields, and transportation vehicles. The carrier's fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed at least 17 Chinese aircraft in aerial combat while losing five aircraft themselves. On 12 December 1937 \"Kaga\" aircraft participated in the Panay incident.\nOn 11 November 1937, three Chinese Air Force Northrop Gamma 2ECs of the 2nd BG, 14th Squadron led by Captain Yu Y.C. attacked \"Kaga\" off the Maanshan Islands near Shanghai; the bombs fell wide into \"Kaga\"'s wake, and the Chinese Gammas were pursued and intercepted by three A5Ms of \"Kaga\"'s combat air patrol (CAP) led by flight leader Jir\u014d Ch\u014dno, which shot down two of the Gammas, while Yu managed to escape into the clouds and return to base in his damaged Gamma.\nSix \"Kaga\" fighters were assigned to land bases near Shanghai and Nanking between 9 December 1937 and 15 January 1938. Nine fighters were temporarily based out of Nanking from 3 March through 4 April 1938. On 13 April 1938, \"Kaga\" launched eighteen D1A1s and three each of A4Ns and A5Ms on a strike against Canton, and they were met by two squadrons of Gloster Gladiators of the 5th Fighter Group led by Captain John Xinrui Huang and Captain Louie Yim-qun; Huang would score a triple kill in this battle against the \"Kaga\" raid, while Jir\u014d Ch\u014dno (A5M) and Hatsuo Hidaka (A4N) would each claim double kills, including Ch\u014dno's shooting-down of Huang, who was injured bailing out. \"Kaga\"'s fighter group at this time included future aces Jir\u014d Ch\u014dno, Osamu Kud\u014d, Yoshio Fukui, Watari Handa, Masaichi Kond\u014d, Hatsuo Hidaka, Kiichi Oda, Satoru Ono, and Chitoshi Isozaki. The US Navy decrypted an IJN message which reportedly indicated that the attack on the and other neutral ships in the Yangtze River had been knowingly and deliberately planned by an air officer on \"Kaga\".\n\"Kaga\" entered the shipyard on 15 December 1938, where her arresting gear was replaced by a Type 3 system and her bridge was modernized. The flight deck and hangar areas were enlarged, increasing the carrier's aircraft capacity. The ship was completely overhauled from 15 November 1939 to 15 November 1940 before returning to active service. In the meantime, a new generation of aircraft had entered service and \"Kaga\" embarked 12 A5M fighters, 24 D1A dive bombers and 36 B4Y torpedo bombers. Another 18 aircraft were carried in crates as spares.\nThe Japanese carriers' experiences off China had helped further develop the IJN's carrier doctrine. One lesson learned in China was the importance of concentration and mass in projecting naval air power ashore. Therefore, in April 1941 the IJN formed the First Air Fleet to combine all of its fleet carriers under a single command. On 10 April 1941 \"Kaga\" was assigned to the First Carrier Division with \"Akagi\" as part of the new carrier fleet, which also included the Second and Fifth carrier divisions. The IJN centered its doctrine on airstrikes that combined the air groups within carrier divisions, rather than each individual carrier. When more than one carrier division was operating together, the divisions' air groups were combined with each other. This doctrine of combined, massed, carrier air attack groups was the most advanced of its kind of all the world's navies. The IJN, however, remained concerned that concentrating all of its carriers together would render them vulnerable to being wiped out all at once by a massive enemy air or surface strike. Thus, the IJN developed a compromise solution in which the fleet carriers would operate closely together within their carrier divisions but the divisions themselves would operate in loose rectangular formations, with approximately separating the carriers from each other.\nAlthough the concentration of so many fleet carriers into a single unit was a new and revolutionary offensive strategic concept, the First Air Fleet suffered from several defensive deficiencies which gave it, in Mark Peattie's words, a \"'glass jaw': it could throw a punch but couldn't take one.\" Japanese carrier anti-aircraft guns and associated fire control systems had several design and configuration deficiencies which limited their effectiveness. The IJN's fleet CAP consisted of too few fighter aircraft and was hampered by an inadequate early warning system, including a lack of radar. Poor radio communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control of the CAP. The carriers' escorting warships were deployed as visual scouts in a ring at long range, not as close anti-aircraft escorts, as they lacked training, doctrine, and sufficient anti-aircraft guns. These deficiencies would eventually doom \"Kaga\" and other First Air Fleet carriers.\nWorld War II.\nPearl Harbor.\nIn November 1941 the IJN's Combined Fleet, under Isoroku Yamamoto, prepared to participate in Japan's initiation of a formal war with the United States by conducting a preemptive strike against the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 17 November \"Kaga\", under the command of Captain Jisaku Okada, loaded 100 torpedoes at Saeki Bay, Hiroshima; these torpedoes were specially designed for use in the shallow waters of the Pearl Harbor anchorage. On 19 November, \"Kaga\" and the rest of the Combined Fleet's mobile strike force (\"Kido Butai\"), under Chuichi Nagumo and including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hitokappu Bay at Etorofu Island. The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north-central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes.\nFor the attack on Pearl Harbor, \"Kaga\" carried a total of 18 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, 27 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 27 Aichi D3A dive bombers, plus three crated aircraft of each type for the operation. During the morning of 7 December 1941 \"Kaga\" aircraft participated in both First Air Fleet strikes launched against Oahu from a position north of the island. In the first strike of 183 total aircraft (six aborted), 26 \"Kaga\" B5N carrier attack bombers attacked the American ships at anchor with bombs and torpedoes, escorted by nine Zeros. In the second strike of 167 aircraft (four aborted), 26 \"Kaga\" D3A dive bombers targeted the airfield at Ford Island in the middle of the harbor while nine Zeros provided escort and attacked aircraft on the ground. A total of five B5Ns, four Zeros and six D3As from the ship were lost during the two strikes, along with their aircrews, a total of 31 personnel. \"Kaga\"'s bomber and torpedo crews claimed hits on the battleships , , , , , and . The ship's fighter pilots claimed to have shot down one US aircraft and destroyed 20 on the ground. Upon completion of the attack, the First and Fifth Carrier divisions, including \"Kaga\", returned immediately to Japan.\nPacific conquest.\nIn January 1942, together with the rest of the First and Fifth Carrier Division carriers and staging out of Truk (now Chuuk) in Micronesia, \"Kaga\" supported the invasion of Rabaul in the Bismarck Islands. \"Kaga\" provided 27 bomb-carrying B5N and 9 Zeros for the initial airstrike on Rabaul on 20 January 1942, during which one B5N was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The First Carrier Division attacked Allied positions at nearby Kavieng the following day, of which \"Kaga\" contributed nine Zeros and sixteen D3As. On the 22nd \"Kaga\"'s D3As and Zeros again attacked Rabaul and two dive bombers had to make emergency landings, but the crews were rescued. \"Kaga\" returned to Truk on 25 January and Rabaul and Kavieng were successfully occupied by Japanese forces by February.\nOn 9 February \"Kaga\" hit a reef at Palau after she had unsuccessfully sortied against American carrier forces attacking the Marshall Islands on 1 February. The damage reduced the carrier's speed to 18 knots. After temporary repairs, she continued to the Timor Sea, where on 19 February 1942 she, with the other carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions, launched air strikes against Darwin, Australia, from a point southeast of the easternmost tip of Timor. \"Kaga\" contributed 27 B5Ns (carrying bombs), 18 D3A, and 9 Zeros to the attack, which caught the defenders by surprise. Eight ships were sunk, including the destroyer , and fourteen more were damaged, at a cost of only one of \"Kaga\"'s B5Ns. In March 1942, \"Kaga\", based out of Staring-baai, helped cover the invasion of Java, although her only contribution appears to have been aircraft for the 5 March 1942 airstrike on Tjilatjap. In that attack \"Kaga\" contributed 27 bomb-carrying B5N escorted by nine Zeros. The attacking aircraft bombed merchant ships in the harbor, sinking eight of them, and attacked anti-aircraft batteries and a warehouse without loss. Most of the Allied forces in the Dutch East Indies surrendered to the Japanese later in March. \"Kaga\" was unable to participate in the Indian Ocean raid in April because of the damage she had received in February. Instead, she sailed for Sasebo on 15 March for repairs, entering drydock on 27 March. The repairs were completed on 4 May.\nBattle of Midway.\nMidway raid.\nConcerned by the US carrier strikes such as the Doolittle Raid, on the Marshall Islands, and the Lae-Salamaua raids, Yamamoto was determined to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. Yamamoto decided to invade and occupy Midway Island, which he was sure would draw out the American carrier forces to battle. The Midway invasion was codenamed by the Japanese as Operation MI.\nIn support of \"MI\", on 27 May 1942, \"Kaga\" departed the Inland Sea with the Combined Fleet on her final mission, in the company of carriers \"Akagi\", , and which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions. Her aircraft complement was 27 Zeros, 20 D3As, and 27 B5Ns. With the fleet positioned northwest of Midway Island at dawn on 4 June 1942, \"Kaga\" contributed eighteen D3As, commanded by Lieutenant Sh\u014dichi Ogawa, escorted by nine Zeros to the strike against the island. The carrier's B5Ns were armed with torpedoes and kept ready in case enemy ships were discovered during the Midway raid. One each of the D3As and Zeros was shot down by AA fire over Midway, and another four D3As were damaged. \"Kaga\"'s Zero pilots claimed to have shot down 12 US aircraft over Midway Island. One \"Kaga\" B5N was launched to augment the fleet's reconnaissance of the surrounding ocean. The carrier also put up two Zeros on CAP. Another five Zeros reinforced her CAP at 07:00 and the seven fighters helped to defend the Kido Butai from the first US air attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese \"MI\" plan from signals intelligence and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.\nAt 07:15 Admiral Nagumo ordered the B5Ns still on \"Kaga\" and \"Akagi\" rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was limited by the number of ordnance carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. Thus, the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message that American carriers had been spotted. At 07:30 \"Kaga\" recovered three of her CAP.\nSinking.\n\"Kaga\"'s four remaining CAP fighters were in the process of landing when 16 Marine SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from Midway, led by Lofton R. Henderson, attacked around 07:55 without result. Five Zeros were launched at 08:15 and three intercepted a dozen Midway-based United States Army B-17 Flying Fortresses attempting to bomb the three other carriers from , but only limited damage was inflicted on the heavy bombers, although their attacks all missed. Five D3As also joined the CAP around this time. Another trio of Zeros were launched at 08:30. \"Kaga\" began landing her returning Midway strike force aboard around 08:35 and was finished by 08:50; one Zero pilot died after crash-landing his aircraft.\nThe five Zeros launched at 08:15 were recovered aboard at 09:10 and replaced by six more Zeros launched at 09:20. They intercepted the first US carrier aircraft to attack, TBD Devastator torpedo-bombers of VT-8 from the US carrier at 09:22, and shot down all 15, leaving only a single survivor, George H. Gay, Jr., treading water. Shortly thereafter, 14 Devastators from VT-6 from the US carrier , led by Eugene E. Lindsey, were spotted. They tried to sandwich \"Kaga\", but the CAP, reinforced by another six Zeros launched by \"Kaga\" at 10:00, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and the carrier dodged the torpedoes.\nSoon after the torpedo plane attacks, American carrier dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. At 10:22, 25 SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from \"Enterprise\", led by C. Wade McClusky, hit \"Kaga\" with one bomb and at least three bombs. The first landed near her rear elevator and set the berthing compartments on fire, and the next bomb hit the forward elevator and penetrated the upper hangar, setting off explosions and fires among the armed and fueled planes on her hangar deck. The third bomb exploded directly on the island, destroying the bridge, killing Okada and most of his command staff. The 1000-pound bomb hit amidships and penetrated the flight deck to explode on the upper hangar. The explosions ruptured the ship's avgas lines, damaged both her port and starboard fire mains and the emergency generator powering her fire pumps, as well as knocking out the carbon dioxide fire suppression system. Fueled by the avgas pouring onto the hangar deck, the fires detonated the of bombs and torpedoes strewn across the hangar deck in a series of catastrophic multiple fuel-air explosions that blew out the hangar sides. At nearly the same time, dive bombers hit and fatally damaged \"Akagi\" and \"S\u014dry\u016b\".\nUnable to contain her fires, \"Kaga\"'s survivors were taken off by the destroyers and between 14:00 and 17:00. Around 19:25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes from \"Hagikaze\" and sank stern-first at position . Warrant Officer Takeshi Maeda, an injured \"Kaga\" B5N aircrew member rescued by \"Hagikaze\", described the scene: \"My comrade carried me up to the deck so I could see the last moments of our beloved carrier, which was nearby. Even though I was in pain tears started to run down my cheeks, and everyone around me was crying; it was a very sad sight.\"\nThe carrier's crew suffered 811 fatalities, mainly among the aircraft mechanics and armorers stationed on the hangar decks and the ship's engineers, many of whom were trapped below in the boiler and engine rooms by uncontrolled fires raging on the decks above them. Twenty-one of the ship's aviators were killed. \"Kaga\"'s surviving crewmembers were restricted incommunicado to an airbase in Ky\u016bsh\u016b for one to two months after returning to Japan, to help conceal word of the Midway defeat from the Japanese public. Many of the survivors were then transferred back to frontline units without being allowed to contact family. Some of the injured were quarantined in hospitals for almost a year. This was the highest loss of lives of all the Japanese carriers lost at Midway.\nThe loss of \"Kaga\" and the three other IJN carriers at Midway (\"Hiry\u016b\" was also sunk during the battle), with their aircraft and veteran pilots, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war.\nWreck survey.\nIn May 1999, the Nauticos Corporation, in partnership with the US Navy, discovered some wreckage from \"Kaga\". They employed the research vessel during a survey of a fleet exercise area with the US Navy's recently modified SEAMAP acoustic imaging system. A follow-on search by in September 1999 located the wreckage and took photos of it. The wreckage included a long section of hangar bulkhead, two 25\u00a0mm anti-aircraft gun tubs, and a landing light array. The artifacts were at a depth of .\nOn 18 October 2019, the wreck of \"Kaga\" was located by the Director of Undersea Operations for Vulcan Inc. Rob Kraft, David W. Jourdan and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson aboard . She sits upright at a depth of about , buried up to the degaussing wires in the seafloor and with most of her superstructure and flight deck missing. The wreck is surrounded by a large debris field and has been heavily colonized by marine growth. The wreck of \"Akagi\" was found by the same crew two days later. A more extensive survey of the wreck was conducted by the in September 2023.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Along with her sister ship , she took part in several key naval battles during the war, including the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, before being torpedoed and sunk by the U.S. submarine at the Battle of the Philippine Sea.\nDesign.\nThe \"Sh\u014dkaku\"-class carriers were part of the same program that also included the s. No longer restricted by the provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty, which expired in December 1936, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was free to incorporate all those features they deemed most desirable in an aircraft carrier, namely high speed, a long radius of action, heavy protection and a large aircraft capacity. \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was laid down at Yokosuka Dockyard on 12 December 1937, launched on 1 June 1939, and commissioned on 8 August 1941.\nWith an efficient modern design, a displacement of about , and a top speed of , \"Sh\u014dkaku\" could carry 70\u201380 aircraft. Her enhanced protection compared favorably to that of contemporary Allied aircraft carriers and enabled \"Sh\u014dkaku\" to survive serious damage during the battles of the Coral Sea and Santa Cruz.\nHull.\nIn appearance, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" resembled an enlarged , though with a longer overall length, wider beam and a larger island. As in \"Hiry\u016b\", the forecastle was raised to the level of the upper hangar deck to improve seakeeping. She also had a wider, more rounded and heavily flared bow which kept the flight deck dry in most sea conditions.\nThe carrier's forefoot was of the newly developed bulbous type, sometimes referred to informally as a \"Taylor pear\", which served to reduce the hull's underwater drag within a given range of speeds, improving both the ship's speed and endurance. Unlike the larger bulbous forefeet fitted to the battleships and , however, \"Sh\u014dkaku\"'s did not protrude beyond the ship's stem.\n\"Sh\u014dkaku\" was 10,000 tons heavier than , mainly due to the extra armor incorporated into the ship's design. Vertical protection consisted of on the main armor deck over the machinery, magazines and aviation fuel tanks, while horizontal protection consisted of along the waterline belt abreast the machinery spaces, reducing to outboard of the magazines.\n\"Sh\u014dkaku\" normally stowed 150,000 gallons of avgas for operational use. Unlike British carriers, whose aviation fuel was stored in separate cylinders or coffer-dams surrounded by seawater, all pre-war Japanese carriers had their aviation fuel tanks built integral with the ship's hull, and \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was no exception. The dangers this posed, however, did not become evident until wartime experience demonstrated these were often prone to cracking and leaking as the shocks and stresses of hits or near-misses to the carrier's hull were inevitably transferred to and absorbed by the fuel tanks. Following the debacle at Midway in mid-1942, the empty air spaces around \"Sh\u014dkaku\"'s aviation fuel tanks, normally pumped full of inert carbon dioxide, were instead filled with concrete in an attempt to protect them from possible damage. But this did little to prevent volatile fumes spreading to the hangar decks in the event damage did occur, particularly demonstrated when \"Cavalla\" torpedoed and sank her.\nMachinery.\nThe geared turbines installed on \"Sh\u014dkaku\" were essentially the same as those on \"S\u014dry\u016b\", maximum power increasing by to . In spite of all the additional armor, greater displacement and a increase in draught, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was able to attain a speed of just over during trials. Maximum fuel bunkerage was 4100 tons, giving her a radius of action of at . Two same-sized downward-curving funnels on the ship's starboard side, just abaft the island, vented exhaust gases horizontally from the boilers and were sufficiently angled to keep the flight deck free of smoke in most wind conditions.\nFlight deck and hangars.\n\"Sh\u014dkaku\"'s long wood-planked flight deck ended short of the ship's bow and, just barely, short of the stern. It was supported by four steel pillars forward of the hangar box and by two pillars aft.\nThe flight deck and both hangars (upper and lower) were serviced by three elevators, the largest being the forward one at by , the middle and the rear elevators measured by . All three were capable of transferring aircraft weighing up to and raising or lowering them took approximately 15\u201320 seconds.\n\"Sh\u014dkaku\"'s nine Type 4 electrically operated arrester wires followed the same standard arrangement as that on \"Hiry\u016b\", three forward and six aft. They were capable of stopping a aircraft at speeds of . A third crash barrier was added and a light collapsible wind-break screen was installed just forward of the island.\nThe upper hangar was and had an approximate height of ; the lower was and had an approximate height of . Together they had an approximate total area of . Hangar space was not greatly increased in comparison to \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and both \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" could each carry just nine more aircraft than \"S\u014dry\u016b\", giving them a normal operating capacity of seventy-two plus room for twelve in reserve. Unlike on \"S\u014dry\u016b\", the reserve aircraft did not need to be kept in a state of disassembly, however, thereby shortening the time required to make them operational.\nAfter experimenting with port-side islands on two previous carriers, and \"Hiry\u016b\", the IJN opted to build both \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and her sister ship \"Zuikaku\" with starboard-side islands.\nIn September 1942, a Type 21 air-warning radar was installed on \"Sh\u014dkaku\"'s island atop the central fire control director, the first such device to be fitted on any Japanese carrier. The Type 21 had a \"mattress\" antenna and the initial prototypes were light enough that no major structural modifications were necessary. Later versions, however, were bulkier and required eventual removal of the fifth fire control director in order to accommodate the larger and heavier antenna.\nArmament.\n\"Sh\u014dkaku\"'s primary air defense consisted of sixteen Type 89 dual-purpose AA guns in twin mountings. These were sited below flight deck level on projecting sponsons with four such paired batteries on either side of the ship's hull, two forward and two aft. Four fire control directors were installed, two on the port side and two to starboard. A fifth fire control director was located atop the carrier's island and could control any or all of the heavy-caliber guns as needed.\nInitially, light AA defense was provided by twelve triple-mount Type 96 AA guns.\nIn June 1942, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" had her anti-aircraft armament augmented with six triple 25\u00a0mm mounts, two each at the bow and stern, and one each fore and aft of the island. The bow and stern groups each received a Type 95 director. In October another triple 25\u00a0mm mount was added at the bow and stern and 10 single mounts were added before the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944.\nOperational history.\n\"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" formed the Japanese 5th Carrier Division, embarking their aircraft shortly before the Pearl Harbor attack. Each carrier's aircraft complement consisted of 18 Mitsubishi A6M2 \"Zero\" fighters, 27 Aichi D3A1 \"Val\" dive bombers, and 27 Nakajima B5N1 or B5N2 \"Kate\" torpedo bombers.\n\"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" joined the \"Kido Butai\" (\"Mobile Unit/Force\", the Combined Fleet's main carrier battle group) and participated in Japan's early wartime naval offensives, including Pearl Harbor and the attack on Rabaul in January 1942.\nIn the Indian Ocean raid of March\u2013April 1942, aircraft from \"Sh\u014dkaku\", along with the rest of \"Kido Butai\", attacked Colombo, Ceylon on 5 April, sinking two ships in harbor and severely damaging support facilities. The task force also found and sank two Royal Navy heavy cruisers, and , on the same day, as well as the aircraft carrier on 9 April off Batticaloa.\nThe Fifth Carrier Division was then deployed to Truk to support Operation Mo (the planned capture of Port Moresby in New Guinea). During this operation, \"Sh\u014dkaku\"'s aircraft helped sink the American aircraft carrier during the Battle of the Coral Sea but was herself seriously damaged on 8 May 1942 by dive bombers from and \"Lexington\" which scored three bomb hits: one on the carrier's port bow, one to starboard at the forward end of the flight deck and one just abaft the island. Fires broke out but were eventually contained and extinguished. The resulting damage required \"Sh\u014dkaku\" to return to Japan for major repairs.\nOn the journey back, maintaining a high speed in order to avoid a cordon of American submarines out hunting for her, the carrier shipped so much water through her damaged bow that she nearly capsized in heavy seas. She arrived at Kure on 17 May 1942 and entered drydock on 16 June 1942. Repairs were completed within ten days and, a little over two weeks later on 14 July, she was formally reassigned to Striking Force, 3rd Fleet, Carrier Division 1.\nThe time required for repairs, combined with the aircraft and aircrew losses incurred by her and \"Zuikaku\", kept both carriers from participating in the Battle of Midway.\nFollowing her return to front-line duty, both \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and her sister-ship \"Zuikaku\", with the addition of the light carrier , were redesignated as the First Carrier Division and took part in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, where they damaged , but \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was in turn damaged by dive bombers of \"Enterprise\", which prevented the bombardment of nearby Henderson Field.\nThe First Carrier Division subsequently participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942, where they crippled (\"Hornet\" was abandoned and later sunk by Japanese destroyers and ). \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was again seriously damaged, taking at least three (and possibly as many as six) 1,000-lb. bomb hits from a group of fifteen Douglas SBD-3 dive bombers launched from \"Hornet\" and . The Type 21 radar, installed a month ago, enabled the early detection of the incoming U.S. planes, so refueling crews were alerted below deck, giving them time to drain and purge the aviation gasoline lines before they were ruptured by bomb hits, thus saving the ship from the catastrophic avgas fires and explosions that caused most of the carrier sinkings in the Pacific theater. \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was also fortunate as she had few aircraft on board at the time of the attack. As a result, no major avgas fires broke out and her seaworthiness was preserved. Her flight deck and hangars, however, were left in shambles and she was unable to conduct further air operations during the remainder of the battle. The need for repairs kept her out of action for months, leaving other Japanese defensive operations in the Pacific lacking sufficient airpower.\nAfter several months of repairs and training, \"Sh\u014dkaku\", now under the command of Captain Hiroshi Matsubara, was assigned in May 1943 to a counterattack against the Aleutian Islands, but the operation was cancelled after the Allied victory at Attu. For the rest of 1943, she was based at Truk, then returned to Japan for maintenance late in the year.\nSinking.\nIn 1944, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was deployed to the Lingga Islands south of Singapore. On 15 June, she departed with the Mobile Fleet for Operation \"A-Go\", a counterattack against Allied forces in the Mariana Islands, resulting in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Her strike waves suffered heavy losses from U.S. combat air patrols and anti-aircraft fire, but some survived and returned safely to the carrier. One of her D4Y \"Suisei\" strike groups, composed of veterans from the Coral Sea and Santa Cruz engagements, broke through and one plane allegedly struck home with a bomb that damaged the battleship and caused many casualties, but this group suffered heavy losses themselves.\n\"Sh\u014dkaku\" was struck at 11:22 on 19 June by three (possibly four) torpedoes from the submarine , under Commander Herman J. Kossler. As \"Sh\u014dkaku\" had been in the process of refueling and rearming aircraft and was in an extremely vulnerable condition, the torpedo hits started avgas fires that proved impossible to control. At 12:10, an aerial bomb exploded, detonating aviation fuel vapors which had spread throughout the ship. The order to abandon ship was given, but before the evacuation had progressed very far, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" abruptly took on water forward and sank quickly bow-first at position , taking 1,272 men with her. The light cruiser and destroyers , , and rescued Captain Matsubara and 570 men.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A sister ship, , was intended to follow \"S\u014dry\u016b\", but \"Hiry\u016b\"'s design was heavily modified and she is often considered to be a separate class. \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s aircraft were employed in operations during the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s and supported the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in mid-1940. During the first months of the Pacific War, she took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Wake Island, and supported the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. In February 1942, her aircraft bombed Darwin, Australia, and she continued on to assist in the Dutch East Indies campaign. In April, \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s aircraft helped sink two British heavy cruisers and several merchant ships during the Indian Ocean raid.\nAfter a brief refit, \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and three other carriers of the 1st Air Fleet (\"Kid\u014d Butai\") participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on Midway Atoll, the carriers were attacked by aircraft from the island and the carriers , , and . Dive bombers from \"Yorktown\" crippled \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and set her afire. Japanese destroyers rescued the survivors but the ship could not be salvaged and was ordered to be scuttled so as to allow her attendant destroyers to be released for further operations. She sank with the loss of 711 officers and enlisted men of the 1,103 aboard. The loss of \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to the Allies' ultimate victory in the Pacific.\nDesign and description.\n\"S\u014dry\u016b\" was one of two large carriers approved for construction under the Imperial Japanese Navy's 1931\u201332 Supplementary Program (the other being her near-sister \"Hiry\u016b\"). In contrast to some earlier Japanese carriers, such as and , which were conversions of battlecruiser and battleship hulls respectively, \"S\u014dry\u016b\" was designed from the keel up as an aircraft carrier and incorporated lessons learned from the light carrier .\nThe ship had a length of overall, a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at standard load and at normal load. Her crew consisted of 1,100 officers and ratings.\nMachinery.\n\"S\u014dry\u016b\" was fitted with four geared steam turbine sets with a total of , each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by eight Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines and boilers were the same as those used in the s. The ship's power and slim, cruiser-type hull, with a length-to-beam ratio of 10:1, gave her a speed of and made her the fastest carrier in the world at the time of her commissioning. \"S\u014dry\u016b\" carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at . The boiler uptakes were trunked together to the ship's starboard side amidships and exhausted just below flight deck level through two funnels curved downwards.\nFlight deck and hangars.\nThe carrier's flight deck was wide and overhung her superstructure at both ends, supported by pairs of pillars. \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s island was built on a starboard-side extension that protruded beyond the side of the hull so that it did not encroach on the width of the flight deck. Nine transverse arrestor wires were installed on the flight deck and could stop a aircraft. The flight deck was only above the waterline and the ship's designers kept this distance low by reducing the height of the hangars. The upper hangar was and had an approximate height of ; the lower was and had an approximate height of . Together they had an approximate total area of . This caused problems in handling aircraft because the wings of a Nakajima B5N \"Kate\" torpedo bomber could neither be spread nor folded in the upper hangar.\nAircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by three elevators, the forward one abreast the island on the centerline and the other two offset to starboard. The forward platform measured , the middle one , and the rear . They were capable of transferring aircraft weighing up to . \"S\u014dry\u016b\" had an aviation gasoline capacity of for her planned aircraft capacity of sixty-three plus nine spares.\nArmament.\n\"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s primary anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of six twin-gun mounts equipped with 50-caliber 12.7-centimeter Type 89 dual-purpose guns mounted on projecting sponsons, three on either side of the carrier's hull. The guns had a range of , and a ceiling of at an elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was fourteen rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. The ship was equipped with two Type 94 fire-control directors to control the guns, one for each side of the ship, although the starboard director on the island could control all of the Type 89 guns.\nThe ship's light AA armament consisted of fourteen twin-gun mounts for license-built Hotchkiss 25\u00a0mm (1 in) Type 96 AA guns. Three of these were sited on a platform just below the forward end of the flight deck. The gun was the standard Japanese light AA weapon during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it largely ineffective. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to \"handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast\". These guns had an effective range of , and a ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the 15-round magazines. The Type 96 guns were controlled by five Type 95 directors, two on each side and one in the bow.\nArmor.\nTo save weight \"S\u014dry\u016b\" was minimally armored; her waterline belt of of Ducol steel only protected the machinery spaces and the magazines. Comparable figures for \"Hiry\u016b\" were over the machinery spaces and the aviation gasoline storage tanks increasing to over the magazines. \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s waterline belt was backed by an internal anti-splinter bulkhead. The ship's deck was only 25\u00a0mm thick over the machinery spaces and thick over the magazines and aviation gasoline storage tanks.\nConstruction and service.\nFollowing the Japanese ship-naming conventions for aircraft carriers, \"S\u014dry\u016b\" was named \"Blue (or Green) Dragon\". The ship was laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal on 20 November 1934, launched on 23 December 1935 and commissioned on 29 December 1937. She was assigned to the Second Carrier Division after commissioning. Her air group was initially intended to consist of eighteen Mitsubishi A5M (\"Claude\") monoplane fighters, twenty-seven Aichi D1A2 (\"Susie\") Type 96 dive bombers, and twelve Yokosuka B4Y (\"Jean\") Type 96 torpedo bombers, but the A5Ms were in short supply and Nakajima A4N1 biplanes were issued instead. On 25 April 1938, nine A4Ns, eighteen D1A2s, and nine B4Ys transferred to Nanjing to support forces advancing up the Yangtze River. The air group advanced with the successful Japanese offensive, despite the defense by the Chinese Air Force and the Soviet Volunteer Group; it was transferred to Wuhu in early June and then to Anqing. Little is known of its operations there, but its primary role during this time was air defense. One fighter pilot of the group was killed after he shot down a Chinese aircraft. Leaving a few fighters and their pilots behind to serve as the nucleus of a new fighter unit, the air group returned to \"S\u014dry\u016b\" on 10 July. The ship supported operations over Canton in September, but her aircraft saw no aerial combat. She returned home in December and spent most of the next year and a half training.\nIn September\u2013October 1940, the ship was based at Hainan Island to support the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. In February 1941, \"S\u014dry\u016b\" moved to Taiwan to reinforce the blockade of southern China. Two months later, the 2nd Carrier Division was assigned to the First Air Fleet, or \"Kido Butai\", on 10 April. \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s air group was detached in mid-July and transferred to Hainan Island to support the occupation of southern Indochina. \"S\u014dry\u016b\" returned to Japan on 7 August and became flagship of the 2nd Division. She was relieved of that role on 22 September as she began a short refit that was completed on 24 October. The ship arrived at Kagoshima two days later and she resumed her former role as flagship of the Division.\nPearl Harbor and subsequent operations.\nIn November 1941 the IJN's Combined Fleet, under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, prepared to participate in Japan's initiation of war with the United States by conducting a preemptive strike against the US Navy's Pacific Fleet base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 22 November, \"S\u014dry\u016b\", commanded by Captain Ryusaku Yanagimoto, and the rest of the \"Kido Butai\" under Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hitokappu Bay at Etorofu Island. The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north-central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes. At this time \"S\u014dry\u016b\" embarked 21 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, 18 Aichi D3A \"Val\" dive bombers, and 18 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers. From a position north of Oahu, \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and the other five carriers launched two waves of aircraft on the morning of 8 December 1941 (Japan time).\nIn the first wave, eight of \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s B5Ns were supposed to attack the aircraft carriers that normally berthed on the northwest side of Ford Island, but none were in Pearl Harbor that day; six B5Ns attacked the ships that were present, torpedoing the target ship , causing her to capsize, and the elderly light cruiser , damaging her. Two of the B5N pilots diverted to their secondary target, ships berthed alongside \"1010 Pier\", where the fleet flagship was usually moored. That battleship was in drydock and her position was occupied by the light cruiser and the minelayer . One torpedo passed underneath \"Oglala\" and struck \"Helena\" in one of her engine rooms; the other pilot rejected these targets and attacked the battleship . Her other ten B5Ns were tasked to drop armor-piercing bombs on the battleships berthed on the southeast side of Ford Island (\"Battleship Row\") and may have scored one or two hits on them. Her eight A6M Zeros strafed parked aircraft at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, claiming twenty-seven aircraft destroyed in addition to five aircraft shot down.\n\"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s second wave consisted of nine A6M Zeros and seventeen D3As. The former attacked Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, losing one Zero to American anti-aircraft guns. On the return trip, the Zero pilots claimed to have shot down two American aircraft while losing two of their own. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but it is not possible to identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two of them were shot down during the attack.\nWhile returning to Japan, Vice Admiral Ch\u016bichi Nagumo, commander of the First Air Fleet, ordered that \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and \"Hiry\u016b\" be detached on 16 December to attack the defenders of Wake Island who had already defeated the first Japanese attack on the island. The two carriers reached the vicinity of the island on 21 December and launched twenty-nine D3As and two B5Ns, escorted by eighteen Zeros, to attack ground targets. They encountered no aerial opposition and launched thirty-five B5Ns and six A6M Zeros the following day. They were intercepted by the two surviving Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters of Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-211. The Wildcats shot down two B5Ns before they were shot down themselves by the Zeros. The garrison surrendered the next day after Japanese troops were landed.\nThe carriers arrived at Kure on 29 December. They were assigned to the Southern Force on 8 January 1942 and departed four days later for the Dutch East Indies. The ships supported the invasion of the Palau Islands and the Battle of Ambon, attacking Allied positions on the island on 23 January with fifty-four aircraft. Four days later the carriers detached eighteen Zeros and nine D3As to operate from land bases in support of Japanese operations in the Battle of Borneo. On 30 January they destroyed two aircraft on the ground and shot down a Qantas Short Empire flying boat flying to Surabaya to pick up refugees.\n\"S\u014dry\u016b\" and \"Hiry\u016b\" arrived at Palau on 28 January and waited for the arrival of the carriers \"Kaga\" and \"Akagi\". All four carriers departed Palau on 15 February and launched air strikes against Darwin, Australia, four days later. \"S\u014dry\u016b\" contributed eighteen B5Ns, eighteen D3As, and nine Zeros to the attack while flying Combat Air Patrols (CAP) over the carriers. Her aircraft attacked the ships in port and its facilities, sinking or setting on fire eight ships and causing three others to be beached lest they sink. The Zeros destroyed a single Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat; one D3A was lost. The Japanese aircraft spotted a ship on the return trip but had expended all their ordnance and had to be rearmed and refueled before they could attack the vessel. Several hours later, nine of \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s D3As located and bombed an American supply ship of \u00a0gross register tons\u00a0(GRT), \"Don Isidro\", hitting her five times but failing to sink her. \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and the other carriers arrived at Staring Bay on Celebes Island on 21 February to resupply and rest before departing four days later to support the invasion of Java. On 1 March 1942, the ship's D3As damaged the destroyer badly enough for her to be caught and sunk by Japanese cruisers. Later that day the dive bombers sank the oil tanker . The four carriers launched an airstrike of 180 aircraft against Tjilatjep on 5 March, sinking five small ships, damaging another nine badly enough that they had to be scuttled, and set the town on fire. Two days later they attacked Christmas Island before returning to Staring Bay on 11 March to resupply and train for the impending Indian Ocean raid. This raid was intended to secure newly conquered Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies against Allied attack by destroying base facilities and forces in the eastern Indian Ocean.\nIndian Ocean raid.\nOn 26 March 1942, the five carriers of the First Air Fleet departed from Staring Bay; they were spotted by a Catalina about southeast of Ceylon on the morning of 4 April. Nagumo closed to within of Colombo before launching an airstrike the next morning. \"S\u014dry\u016b\" contributed eighteen B5Ns and nine Zeros to the force. The pilots of the latter aircraft claimed to have shot down a single Fairey Fulmar of 806 Naval Air Squadron, plus seven other fighters while losing one of their own. The D3As and B5Ns inflicted some damage to the port facilities, but a day's warning had allowed most of the shipping in the harbor to be evacuated. Later that morning the British heavy cruisers and were spotted and \"S\u014dry\u016b\" launched eighteen D3As. They were the first to attack and claimed to have made fourteen hits on the two ships, sinking both in combination with the dive bombers from the other carriers.\nOn 9 April, \"S\u014dry\u016b\" contributed eighteen B5Ns, escorted by nine Zeros, to the attack on Trincomalee. Her B5Ns were the first to bomb the port and her fighters did not encounter any British fighters. Meanwhile, a floatplane from the battleship spotted the small aircraft carrier , escorted by the Australian destroyer , and every available D3A was launched to attack the ships. \"S\u014dry\u016b\" contributed eighteen dive bombers, but they arrived too late and instead found three other ships further north. They sank the oil tanker \"British Sergeant\" and the Norwegian cargo ship \"Norviken\" before they were attacked by eight Fulmars of 803 and 806 Naval Air Squadrons. The Royal Navy pilots claimed three D3As shot down for the loss of a pair of Fulmars; the Japanese actually lost four D3As with another five damaged. While this was going on, \"Akagi\" narrowly escaped damage when nine British Bristol Blenheim bombers from Ceylon penetrated the CAP and dropped their bombs from . \"S\u014dry\u016b\" had six Zeros aloft, along with fourteen more from the other carriers, and they collectively accounted for five of the British bombers for the loss of one of \"Hiry\u016b\"'s Zeros. After launching the D3As that sank \"Hermes\" and the other ships, the First Air Fleet reversed course and headed southeast for the Malacca Strait before recovering their aircraft; they then proceeded to Japan.\nOn 19 April, while transiting the Bashi Straits between Taiwan and Luzon en route to Japan, \"Akagi\", \"S\u014dry\u016b\", and \"Hiry\u016b\" were sent in pursuit of the American carriers and , which had launched the Doolittle Raid against Tokyo. They found only empty ocean, for the American carriers had immediately departed the area to return to Hawaii. The carriers quickly abandoned the chase and dropped anchor at Hashirajima anchorage on 22 April. Having been engaged in constant operations for four and a half months, \"S\u014dry\u016b,\" along with the other three carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions, was hurriedly refitted and replenished in preparation for the Combined Fleet's next major operation, scheduled to begin one month hence. While at Hashirajima, \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s air group was based ashore at nearby Kasanohara, near Kagoshima, and conducted flight and weapons training with the other First Air Fleet carrier units.\nMidway.\nConcerned by the US carrier strikes in the Marshall Islands, Lae-Salamaua, and the Doolittle raids, Yamamoto was determined to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. He decided to invade and occupy Midway Island, an action that he was sure would draw out the American carriers. The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation \"MI\".\nOn 25 May 1942, \"S\u014dry\u016b\" set out with the Combined Fleet's carrier striking force in the company of \"Kaga\", \"Akagi\", and \"Hiry\u016b\", which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on Midway Island. Her aircraft complement consisted of eighteen Zeros, sixteen D3As, eighteen B5Ns, and two preproduction reconnaissance variants (D4Y1-C) of the new Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber. Also aboard were three A6M Zeros of the 6th K\u014dk\u016btai intended as a portion of the aerial garrison for Midway.\nWith the fleet positioned northwest of Midway at dawn (04:45 local time) on 4 June 1942, \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s part in the 108-plane combined air raid was a strike on the airfield on Eastern Island with eighteen torpedo bombers escorted by nine Zeros. The air group suffered heavily during the attack; a single B5N was shot down by fighters, two more were forced to ditch on the return (both crews rescued), and five (including one that landed aboard \"Hiryu\") were damaged beyond repair. The Japanese did not know that the US Navy had discovered their \"MI\" plan by breaking their cipher, and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.\nThe carrier also contributed 3 Zeros to the total of eleven assigned to the initial combat air patrol (CAP) over the four carriers. By 07:00 the carrier had six fighters with the CAP that helped to defend the \"Kido Butai\" from the first US attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. At this time, Nagumo's carriers were attacked by six US Navy Grumman TBF Avengers from Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) that had been temporarily detached from the \"Hornet\" to Midway, and four United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) Martin B-26 Marauders, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after \"Hiry\u016b\" while the Marauders attacked \"Akagi\". The thirty CAP Zeros in the air at this time, including the six from \"S\u014dry\u016b\", immediately attacked the American airplanes, shooting down five of the Avengers and two of the B-26s. The surviving aircraft dropped their torpedoes, but all missed. \"S\u014dry\u016b\" launched three more Zeros to reinforce the CAP, at 07:10.\nAt 07:15 Admiral Nagumo ordered the B5Ns on \"Kaga\" and \"Akagi\" rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was limited by the number of ordnance carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. The process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, the first six of \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:30.\nAt 07:55, the next American strike from Midway arrived in the form of sixteen Douglas SBD Dauntless bombers of Marine Scout Bomber Squadron 241 (VMSB-241) under Major Lofton R. Henderson. \"S\u014dry\u016b\"'s three CAP fighters were among the nine still aloft that attacked Henderson's planes, shooting down six of them as they executed a fruitless glide-bombing attack on \"Hiry\u016b\". At roughly the same time, a dozen USAAC Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses attacked the Japanese carriers, bombing from . The high altitude of the B-17s gave the Japanese captains enough time to anticipate where the bombs would land and successfully maneuver their ships out of the impact area. Four B-17s attacked \"S\u014dry\u016b\", but they all missed.\nThe CAP defeated the next American air strike from Midway, shooting down three of the eleven Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship \"Haruna\" unsuccessfully, starting at around 08:30. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, they kept the Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast. Around 08:30 \"S\u014dry\u016b\" launched one of her D4Ys on a mission to confirm the location of the American carriers.\n\"S\u014dry\u016b\" began recovering her Midway strike force at around 08:40 and finished shortly by 09:10. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers' crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations were interrupted at 09:18 when the first American carrier aircraft to attack were sighted. These consisted of fifteen Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron from \"Hornet\". The three airborne CAP Zeros were landing aboard at 09:30 when the Americans unsuccessfully attempted a torpedo attack on \"Sory\u016b\", but three of the morning's escort fighters were still airborne and joined the eighteen CAP fighters in destroying Waldron's planes. All of the American planes were shot down, leaving George H. Gay Jr.\u2014the only surviving aviator\u2014treading water.\nShortly afterwards, fourteen Devastators from Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6) from the \"Enterprise\", led by Lieutenant Commander Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey's aircraft tried to sandwich \"Kaga\", but the CAP, reinforced by three more Zeros launched by \"S\u014dry\u016b\" at 09:45, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and \"Kaga\" dodged the torpedoes. \"S\u014dry\u016b\" launched another trio of CAP Zeros at 10:00 and another three at 10:15 after Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3) from was spotted. A Wildcat escorting VT-3 shot down one of her Zeros.\nWhile VT-3 was still attacking \"Hiry\u016b\", American dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. It was at this time, around 10:20, that in the words of Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, the \"Japanese air defenses would finally and catastrophically fail\". At 10:25, \"S\u014dry\u016b\" was attacked by thirteen Dauntlesses from \"Yorktown\"'s Bombing Squadron 3 (VB-3). The carrier received three direct hits from 1,000 lb (454\u00a0kg) bombs: one penetrated to the lower hangar deck amidships, and the other two exploded in the upper hangar deck fore and aft. The hangars contained armed and fueled aircraft preparing for the upcoming strike, resulting in secondary explosions and rupturing the steam pipes in the boiler rooms. Within a very short time the fires on the ship were out of control. At 10:40 she stopped and her crew was ordered to abandon ship five minutes later. The destroyers and rescued the survivors. \"S\u014dry\u016b\" was still afloat and showed no signs of beginning to sink by early evening, so \"Isokaze\" was ordered to scuttle her with torpedoes so as to allow the destroyers to be used for possible operations that night. The destroyer reported at 19:15 that \"S\u014dry\u016b\" had sunk at position . Losses were 711 crew of her complement of 1,103, including Captain Yanagimoto, who chose to remain on board. This was the highest mortality percentage of all the Japanese carriers lost at Midway, due largely to the devastation in both hangar decks.\nThe loss of \"S\u014dry\u016b\" and the three other IJN carriers at Midway, comprising two-thirds of Japan's total number of fleet carriers and the experienced core of the First Air Fleet, was a crucial strategic defeat and contributed significantly to the ultimate Allied victory. In an effort to conceal the defeat, the ship was not immediately removed from the Navy's registry of ships, awaiting a \"suitable opportunity\" before finally being struck from the registry on 10 August 1942.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her aircraft struck airfields during the attack on Pearl Harbor that formally brought the United States into the war. She also participated in the Indian Ocean raid, where her dive bombers sank or helped to sink several major British warships. \"Zuikaku\" and her sister were detached from Kid\u014d Butai to support Operation Mo, the invasion of Port Moresby, New Guinea, during which her torpedo bombers contributed to the sinking of the aircraft carrier at the Battle of the Coral Sea; however heavy airgroup losses and damage to \"Sh\u014dkaku\" resulted in both carriers missing the Battle of Midway. She and her sister fought US carriers at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, and again at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands where she helped to sink the aircraft carrier . During the Battle of the Philippine Sea and Battle of Leyte Gulf, she was damaged by US carrier aircraft, being sunk in the latter engagement.\n\"Zuikaku\" was one of six carriers to participate in the Pearl Harbor attack and was the last of the six to be sunk in the war (, , , and in the Battle of Midway; in the Battle of the Philippine Sea; and \"Zuikaku\" in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.)\nA memorial for the fallen personnel of the \"Zuikaku\" is located at the grounds of Kashihara Shrine, located in the city of Kashihara, Nara Prefecture, Japan.\nService history.\n\"Zuikaku\" was laid down on 25 May 1938, launched on 27 November 1939, and formally commissioned on 25 September 1941. On the day of commissioning, \"Zuikaku\" departed on her maiden voyage from Kobe to Kure. Under the command of Captain Yokokawa Ichibei, \"Zuikaku\" departed for Oita Bight on October 7, arriving at her destination the next day where for the first time she joined her sister ship . Both ships made up Carrier Division 5.\nAttack on Pearl Harbor and subsequent activities.\nOn 26 November 1941, she left Hitokappu Bay for the attack on Pearl Harbor as part of the \"Kid\u014d Butai\" (\"Mobile Force\"). Her aircraft complement consisted of 18 Mitsubishi A6M \"Zero\" fighters, 27 Aichi D3A \"Val\" dive bombers, and 27 Nakajima B5N \"Kate\" torpedo bombers. On 7 December, she launched two waves of aircraft against American military installations on the island of Oahu. In the first wave, 25 Val dive bombers attacked Wheeler Army Airfield and five Zero fighters attacked the airbase at Kaneohe. In the second wave, 27 high-level Kate bombers attacked the airbase at Hickam Field.\nOn the 24th of December, \"Zuikaku\" arrived back at Kure alongside \"Sh\u014dkaku\", , and ( and having previously departed to attack Wake Island), and she was drydocked from the 30th to January 3rd. Meeting \"Sh\u014dkaku\" on the 5th, they departed Hiroshima Bay on the 8th, arriving at Truk on the 14th. In aid of the Japanese conquest against Pacific islands, on January 20 they launched 19 dive bombers and 6 fighters to attack Rabaul, then the next day struck both Lae and Salamaua, and on the 23rd launched strikes to aid the successful landings on both Rabaul and Kavieng before returning to Truk on the 29th. \"Zuikaku\" finally took part in a failed attempt to sweep for allied aircraft carriers on February 1st before departing back to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on the 13th, where her pilots took part in vigorous training exercises until the 28th.\nIndian Ocean Raid.\n\"Zuikaku\" would play a key role in the Indian Ocean Raid throughout April, where the Kid\u014d Butai (excluding which scraped her hull on a reef) attacked various British warships and positions in a multiple-day raid. On the 5th, \"Zuikaku\"'s air group attacked Colombo in an event since named the Easter Sunday Raid. Her torpedo bombers sank the destroyer , while her dive bombers damaged the tanker \"San Cirilo\". Later that night, alongside the other aircraft carriers, \"Zuikaku\"'s aircraft engaged and sank the heavy cruisers and . On the 9th, \"Zuikaku\" and \"Sh\u014dkaku\" raided Trincomalee, where they destroyed the cargo ship and damaged the monitor .\nSinking of HMS \"Hermes\".\nLater that night, a Japanese floatplane launched from the battleship managed to locate the light carrier , and \"Zuikaku\"'s air group was the first to respond, quickly followed by \"Sh\u014dkaku\". Bombers from the pair hit \"Hermes\" almost 40 times, smashing the carrier into a burning hulk. The pair were then joined by planes from the fellow aircraft carrier , who on her own sank the destroyer . The floating wreck of \"Hermes\" rapidly sank, having only managed to shoot down six attacking planes.\n\"Zuikaku,\" alongside \"Sh\u014dkaku,\" was the first aircraft carrier in history to sink an enemy aircraft carrier in combat.\nBattle of the Coral Sea.\nIn May 1942, she was assigned along with \"Sh\u014dkaku\" to support Operation Mo, the invasion of Port Moresby, New Guinea. On the 7th, a large US naval force was located by spotters from the heavy cruisers and , prompting both ships to launch their planes, fearing US carriers in the area. However, once attacked, it was discovered to only be a US convoy. Not wanting their efforts to go to waste, planes from both \"Zuikaku\" and \"Sh\u014dkaku\" combined to sink the destroyer and the oil tanker .\nAlerted by intercepted and decrypted Japanese naval messages, the Americans dispatched the carriers and to stop the operation. On the same day as the carrier's initial attack, the US planes located the light carrier , which \"Lexington\"'s aircraft crippled before \"Yorktown\"'s aircraft finished her off. Both \"Zuikaku\" and \"Sh\u014dkaku\" sent out plane squadrons to scout for the US carriers, but failed to make contact on the 7th.\nOn the 8th, a spotter plane from \"Lexington\" located both \"Zuikaku\" and \"Sh\u014dkaku\", and both carriers attacked with their air groups. Hidden by a rain squall, \"Zuikaku\" escaped detection, but \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was hit three times by bombs and was unable to launch or recover her aircraft. In return, \"Zuikaku\"'s planes located the American carriers, and proceeded to wreak havoc on both ships. First, \"Zuikaku\"'s torpedo bombers, commanded by Shigekazu Shimazaki, caught \"Lexington\" in a pincer attack, hitting the flat top with two torpedoes, cutting her speed to 24 knots and punching through the gasoline storage tanks, leaking gas fumes throughout the ship. Her dive bombers, commanded by Tamotsu Ema, then attacked and crippled \"Yorktown\" with a bomb hit that caused severe damage to her hangar bay and aviation storage rooms and over a dozen near misses. \"Sh\u014dkaku\"'s dive bombers then hit \"Lexington\" with three bombs to her flight deck, starting a large fire.\nDamage control efforts quickly persisted on \"Lexington\", putting out the fires from \"Sh\u014dkaku\"'s bomb hits. However, gas fumes from \"Zuikaku\"'s torpedo hits leaked throughout the ship. When the fumes reached electric motors, a chain reaction of explosion after explosion riddled \"Lexington\" with fatal damage. \"Lexington\" began to sink, as her crew was evacuated. To make sure she hit the ocean floor and wasn't captured by Japanese forces, \"Lexington\" was scuttled by escorting destroyers.\n\"Zuikaku\" was undamaged in the battle, but sustained severe losses in aircraft and aircrew. This required her to return to Japan with her sister ship for resupply and aircrew training, and neither carrier was able to take part in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, where every carrier that participated in the Pearl Harbor attack besides the two \"Sh\u014dkaku\"-class ships was sunk by American carrier-based aircraft. Both ships returned to Kure, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" still operating under her own power despite immense damage. On the 21st, \"Zuikaku\" was targeted by the submarine , but was not damaged. She spent the rest of June and July transiting to various ports and naval facilities.\nBattle of the Eastern Solomons.\nIn August 1942, commanded by Captain Tameteru Notomo, \"Zuikaku\" was dispatched as part of the First Carrier Division along with the repaired \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and their escorts to oppose the American offensive in the Solomon Islands. Their goal was to sink US shipping operating in the Solomons to aid in recapturing Henderson Field, an ex-Japanese air base which was captured by American forces and being used against Japanese shipping to great effect.\nOn the 24th, a floatplane launched from the heavy cruiser spotted a large American task force, consisting of the aircraft carriers and , and their escorts, battleship , four cruisers, and eleven destroyers. Subsequently, both \"Zuikaku\" and \"Sh\u014dkaku\" launched 37 aircraft and attacked the US ships. Due to the haste of Japanese pilots, almost all attacks were focused on \"Enterprise\" to heavy results. The effectiveness of US anti aircraft, particularly of \"North Carolina\"'s part, shot down many attacking aircraft, but in the end, both carriers crippled \"Enterprise\" with three bomb hits. They nearly sank her, with a squadron of seven dive bombers, three from \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and four from \"Zuikaku\", nearly delivering the final blow when \"North Carolina\" shot down every single attacking plane.\nNeither \"Zuikaku\" or \"Sh\u014dkaku\" were damaged during the battle, although \"Sh\u014dkaku\" barely avoided being bombed by \"Enterprise\". However, together they lost 25 aircraft out of 37 launched, and planes from \"Saratoga\" sank the light carrier , while planes from Henderson Field sank the destroyer and the troopship \"Kinryu Maru\". The battle is considered a US victory as \"Zuikaku\" and the other Japanese ships retreated without sinking a single American vessel.\nBattle of Santa Cruz.\nWhile the US still maintained air superiority through Henderson field, their carrier force was greatly diminished. After her big action, \"Saratoga\" was crippled by a torpedo fired from the submarine , putting her out of action, while in September the aircraft carrier was sunk by three torpedo hits fired by the submarine . These actions left as the only American fleet carrier operating in the Pacific, shortly joined by the repaired \"Enterprise\". Taking advantage of this, \"Zuikaku\" and \"Sh\u014dkaku\" were sent out to attack the remaining US carriers in a decisive battle, now joined by the aircraft carrier and the light carrier and their escorts. This would culminate in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.\nThe force set out on October 11. On the 15th, a Japanese patrol plane spotted the destroyer towing a barge that carried fuel and bombs for US forces at Guadalcanal. \"Zuikaku\"'s air group quickly responded, and in a ten-minute battle hit \"Meredith\" with three torpedoes and a number of bombs, causing the destroyer to roll over and sink. The force continued on, and on the 26th was spotted by a Catalina seaplane, shortly followed by the attacks of both \"Hornet\" and \"Enterprise\", just as the Japanese wanted. Dive bombers from \"Enterprise\" hit \"Zuih\u014d\" with a bomb that prevented her from recovering aircraft, while dive bombers from \"Hornet\" scorched \"Sh\u014dkaku\" with at least 3\u20134 (and potentially up to 6) bomb hits and damaged the heavy cruiser \"Chikuma\" with two bombs.\nIn return, the Japanese planes wreaked havoc on American shipping. Fighters from \"Zuih\u014d\" shot down an American torpedo bomber, which in a bamboozling series of events launched its torpedo as it crashed in a friendly fire incident that sank the destroyer , while \"Jun'y\u014d\" damaged the battleship and the light cruiser with bomb hits. \"Zuikaku\" focused her attacks on \"Hornet\", and hit her with three bombs. Two of her bombers that were shot down proceeded to crash into \"Hornet\", one of which still had its bomb equipped which exploded on impact. Meanwhile, planes from \"Sh\u014dkaku\" hit \"Hornet\" with two torpedoes. The damage from both ships left Hornet dead in the water and heavily listing.\nUnder tow from the heavy cruiser , damage control efforts attempted to correct the list on the crippled, but not sunk \"Hornet\" in an attempt to save the ship. However, further air attacks persisted. A flight of nine torpedo bombers from both \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Jun'y\u014d\" attacked the flat top, and while \"Jun'y\u014d\"'s planes missed, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" hit \"Hornet\" with a third and fatal torpedo which caused the US to abandon all efforts to save \"Hornet\".\n\"Zuikaku\" hit \"Hornet\" with another bomb while US destroyers attempted to scuttle \"Hornet\" (though due to the quality of US torpedoes, all either missed or failed to explode). \"Hornet\" slowly sank, and was listing at a 45-degree angle when she was discovered by the destroyers and . They fired their torpedoes, claiming three hits. Because of this, they are sometimes credited with sinking \"Hornet\", but she was already sinking due to damage from the previous air attacks, and would have sunk regardless of any further damage, meaning it's debatable whether they deserve credit for \"Hornet\"'s sinking as opposed to the carrier's loss being pinned solely on the \"Sh\u014dkaku\" twins.\nOf the 110 aircraft launched by the Japanese carriers, only 67 returned to \"Zuikaku\". She then returned to the home islands via Truk for training and aircraft ferrying duties.\nIn February 1943, she covered the evacuation of Japanese ground forces from Guadalcanal. In May, she was assigned to a mission to counterattack the American offensive in the Aleutian Islands, but this operation was cancelled after the Allied victory on Attu on 29 May 1943. Later in 1943, under the command of Captain Kikuchi Tomozo, she was again based at Truk and operated against U.S. forces in the Marshall Islands, but never managed to see combat throughout the rest of the year.\n\"Zuikaku\" started off 1944 by entering drydock at Kure on January 8, and leaving drydock on the 17th. On February 13, \"Zuikaku\" was assigned to carrier division 1 alongside \"Sh\u014dkaku\", and over 2 days received her air group, but her new pilots were poorly trained and inexperienced, a grand fall from the glory days of the Kid\u014d Butai. However, they were sufficient to score \"Zuikaku\" another kill when on 27 February, her torpedo bombers hunted down the submarine and quickly sank her with a single 250-kilogram (551 lb) bomb hit. After ferrying aircraft to Singapore and being drydocked, she joined \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and the new armored aircraft carrier .\nBattle of the Philippine Sea.\nIn June she was assigned to Operation A-Go, an attempt to repulse the Allied invasion of the Mariana Islands. On 19 June, in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, \"Taih\u014d\" and \"Sh\u014dkaku\" were both sunk by American submarines, leaving \"Zuikaku\", the only survivor of Carrier Division One, to recover the Division's few remaining aircraft. On 20 June, a bomb hit started a fire in the hangar, but \"Zuikaku\"'s experienced damage control teams managed to get it under control, and she was able to escape under her own power. After this battle, \"Zuikaku\" was the only survivor of the six fleet carriers that had launched the attack on Pearl Harbor.\nBattle off Cape Enga\u00f1o.\nIn October 1944, she was the flagship of Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's decoy Northern Force in Operation Sh\u014d-G\u014d 1, the Japanese counterattack to the Allied landings on Leyte. On 24 October, as part of the depleted Third Carrier Division, which had just 108 aircraft across four carriers, she launched aircraft along with the light carriers , , and in an ineffective strike against the U.S. Third Fleet. Several of these aircraft were shot down, and the majority of the surviving aircraft did not return to the carriers, instead landing at Japanese land bases on Luzon. However, some of her aircraft made \"kamikaze\" attacks and helped sink the light carrier ; and most of the others were sent to other surviving carriers and air bases, to later sink the escort carrier during the Battle off Samar after again using the new \"kamikaze\" tactics.\nThe next day, during the Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o, she launched her few remaining aircraft for combat air patrol, search, or to join the aircraft already on Luzon. She then came under heavy air attack and was hit by seven torpedoes and nine bombs. With \"Zuikaku\" listing heavily to port, Ozawa shifted his flag to the light cruiser . The order to abandon ship was issued at 13:58 and the naval ensign was lowered. \"Zuikaku\" rolled over and sank stern-first at 14:14, taking the lives of Rear Admiral (promoted from captain 10 days earlier) Kaizuka Takeo and 842 of the ship's crew; 862 officers and men were rescued by the destroyers and . Before her loss, \"Zuikaku\" was the last surviving Japanese carrier to have attacked Pearl Harbor. She was also the only Japanese fleet carrier (as opposed to a light carrier) to have been sunk by aircraft-launched torpedoes, as all others were sunk by bombs delivered by dive bombers or submarine-launched torpedoes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is popular in backgammon, the Melbourne Cup, and college basketball pools during March Madness. A Calcutta auction is a sequential auction, where the bidding for each contestant begins in random order, with only one contestant being bid upon at any time. Accordingly, participants (originally in Calcutta, India, from where this technique was first recorded by the Colonial British) bid among themselves to \"buy\" each of the contestants, with each contestant being assigned to the highest bidder. The contestant will then pay out to the owner a predetermined proportion of the pool depending on how it performs in the tournament.\nWhile variations in payoff schedules exist, in an NCAA Basketball tournament (64 teams, single elimination, maximum six wins) the payoffs could be:\nThe precise rules of a Calcutta can vary from place to place; many tournament organizers employ software programs that apply odds and determine win-place-show amounts. Perhaps the simplest and most common Calcutta payout is 70 percent of the pool to the \"owner\" of the winning tournament team, 30 percent to the \"owner\" of the second-place tournament team.\nAn interesting element of Calcutta auctions is in determining an appropriate wager for each contestant, as the payoff will directly hinge on the size of the pot and thereby the size of the bids being placed. Thus the value of each team fluctuates during the course of the betting. For example, even if a bidder knew the University of North Carolina would be the tournament winner and thus pay out 32% of the pool, he would still be unsure of the exact value of the team (unless it was the last team being bid on) since the payout depends on the sum total of all winning bids, i.e. the final size of the pool.\nAnother typical variation in NCAA Calcutta auctions is the bundling and auctioning off as a block the lowest seeded teams in each region, called the \"Dogs\". For example, the 16th to 13th seeded teams from the Midwest Region would be bid upon as a bundle named the \"Dogs of the Midwest\". The winning bidder would own all 4 teams and usually recoups his or her investment if one or two of the Dogs wins an upset.\nThis is similar to parimutuel betting, in that the winnings are awarded from the total pool of bets, but differs in that only one player can bet on any one contestant. However, a player may purchase as many contestants as they desire.\nOne variation that has grown as the Calcutta auction is used more in conjunction with March Madness involves auctioning teams off in the reverse order of their seeds instead of random order. As bidding evolves, this aids bidders in estimating the final pot size since the heavily favored teams that command the highest bids are auctioned at the end, thereby limiting the risk on the larger bets.\nA Calcutta golf tournament is seen in the 1967 film \"Banning\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the Cultural Revolution, he was persecuted and either drowned himself or was murdered.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nLao She was born Shu Qingchun on 3 February 1899 in Beijing, to a poor Manchu family of the \u0160umuru clan belonging to the Plain Red Banner. His father, who was a guard soldier, died in a street battle with the Eight-Nation Alliance Forces in the course of the Boxer Rebellion events in 1901. \"During my childhood,\" Lao She later recalled, \"I didn't need to hear stories about evil ogres eating children and so forth; the foreign devils my mother told me about were more barbaric and cruel than any fairy tale ogre with a huge mouth and great fangs. And fairy tales are only fairy tales, whereas my mother's stories were 100 percent factual, and they directly affected our whole family.\" In 1913, he was admitted to the Beijing Normal Third High School (now Beijing Third High School), but had to leave after several months because of financial difficulties. In the same year, he was accepted to Beijing Normal University, from which he graduated in 1918.\nCareer.\nBetween 1918 and 1924, Lao She was involved as administrator and faculty member at a number of primary and secondary schools in Beijing and Tianjin. He was highly influenced by the May Fourth Movement (1919). He stated, \"The May Fourth Movement gave me a new spirit and a new literary language. I am grateful to the May Fourth Movement, as it allowed me to become a writer.\"\nHe went on to serve as lecturer in the Chinese section of the School of Oriental Studies (now the School of Oriental and African Studies) at the University of London from 1924 to 1929, living in Notting Hill for most of that period. During his time in London, he absorbed a great deal of English literature (especially Dickens, whom he adored) and began his own writing. His later novel \"Mr Ma and Son\", about a Chinese father and his son in London, drew on these experiences. Up until that time, he had signed his works with his courtesy name She Yu (\u820d\u4e88). In his first novel \"Old Zhang's Philosophy\" (\u8001\u5f20\u7684\u54f2\u5b66 \"Lao Zhang de Zhexue\"), first published on Fiction Monthly, he first adopted the pen name Lao She. \nIn the summer of 1929, he left Britain for Singapore, teaching at the Chinese High School. Between his return to China in the spring of 1930 until 1937, he taught at several universities, including Cheeloo University until 1934, and Shandong University (Qingdao).\nLao She was a major popularizer of humor in China, especially through his novels, his short stories and essays for journals like Lin Yutang's \"The Analects Fortnightly\" (\u8ad6\u8a9e\u534a\u6708\u520a, \"Lunyu Banyuekan\", est. 1932), and his stage plays and other performing arts, notably xiangsheng.\nOn 27 March 1938, The All-China Resistance Association of Writers and Artists was established with Lao She as its leader. The purpose of this organization was to unite cultural workers against the Japanese, and Lao She was a respected novelist who had remained neutral during the ideological discussions between various literary groups in the preceding years.\nIn March 1946, Lao She travelled to the United States on a two-year cultural grant sponsored by the State Department, lecturing and overseeing the translation of several of his novels, including \"The Yellow Storm\" (1951) and his last novel, \"The Drum Singers\" (1952; its Chinese version was not published until 1980). He stayed in the US from 1946 until December 1949. During Lao She's traveling, his friend, Pearl S. Buck, and her husband, had served as sponsors and they helped Lao She live in the U.S. After the People's Republic of China was established, Lao She rejected Buck's advice to stay in America and came back to China. \"Rickshaw Boy\" was translated by Buck in the early 1940s. This action helped Rickshaw Boy become a best seller book in America.\nMarriage and family.\nIn 1930, Hu Jieqing was studying at Beijing Normal University. Hu's mother was afraid that she would delay marriage and having children because of her studies. Linguist Luo Changpei was acquainted with Hu Jieqing's brothers. Once, Lao She went to Hu's house to play, and Hu Mu asked him to play hide and seek. At this time, Lao She happened to be returning from London, and he had written works, so Luo Changpei introduced Lao She to Hu Mu. After learning about Lao She's talent and character, Hu Mu was extremely happy and privately appointed Lao She the son-in-law of Chenglong. Luo discussed together a detailed plan for Lao She and Hu Jieqing to meet. In the winter of 1930, Lao She returned to Peiping. Under Luo's arrangement, Lao She was dragged by friends everywhere to eat, and there was always Hu Jieqing at the dinner table. After frequent meetings, Hu and Lao developed affection. \nIn the summer of 1931 Hu Jieqing graduated. The two held a wedding in the same year. Two weeks after the marriage, Lao She brought his wife to Jinan and continued to teach at the university, while Hu Jieqing taught in a middle school. \nThe couple had four children, Shu Ji, Shu Yi, Shu Yu and Shu Li. The first child of the two was born in 1933 in Jinan, a girl named Shu Ji; son Shu Yi was born two years later, and after another two years, she gave birth to his third child in Chongqing, named Shu Yu, with the youngest girl Shu Li born in 1945.\nDeath.\nLike numerous other intellectuals in China, Lao She experienced mistreatment when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966. Condemned as a counterrevolutionary, he was paraded and struggled by the Red Guards through the streets and beaten publicly at the door steps of the Temple of Confucius in Beijing. According to the official record, this abuse left Lao She greatly humiliated both mentally and physically, and he committed suicide by drowning himself in Beijing's Taiping Lake on 24 August 1966. Leo Ou-fan Lee mentioned the possibility that Lao She was murdered. However, no reliable information has emerged to verify definitively the actual circumstances of Lao's death. His relatives were accused of implication in his \"crimes\", but rescued his manuscripts after his death, hiding them in coal piles and a chimney and moving them from house to house.\nWorks.\nLao She's first novel, \"The Philosophy of Lao Zhang\" was written in London (1926) and modeled on Dickens' \"Nicholas Nickleby\", but is set among students in Beijing. His second novel, \"Zhao Ziyue\" (1927) is set in the same Beijing milieu, but tells the story of a 26-year-old college student's quest for the trappings of fame in a corrupt bureaucracy. Both \"The Philosophy of Lao Zhang\" and \"Zhao Ziyue\" were Lao She's novels which expressed the native Peking lives and memories. He also wrote \"Crescent Moon\" (), written in the early stage of his creative life. It depicts the miserable life of a mother and daughter and their deterioration into prostitution.\nIn 1938, Lao She rewrote \"Classics for Girls\" to change its pre-modern characterisation of women's moral duties with messages urging women's contributions in the Second Sino-Japanese War.133\n\"Mr Ma and Son\".\n\"Mr. Ma and Son\" showed another writing style for Lao She. He described Mr. Ma and his son's life in London Chinatown, showing the poor situation of Chinese people in London. These were praised as reflecting Chinese students' experiences. Lao She used funny words to show cruel social truths. From \"Mr. Ma and Son\", Lao She pointed the stereotype included appearances and spirits and he hoped to get rid of these dirty impressions.\n\"Cat Country\".\n\"Cat Country\" is a satirical fable, sometimes seen as a Chinese science fiction novel, published in 1932 as a thinly veiled observation on China. Lao She wrote it from the perspective of a visitor to the planet Mars. The visitor encountered an ancient civilisation populated by cat-people. The civilisation had long passed its glorious peak and had undergone prolonged stagnation. The visitor observed the various responses of its citizens to the innovations by other cultures. Lao She wrote \"Cat Country\" in direct response to Japan's invasion of China (Manchuria in 1931 and Shanghai in 1932). Paradoxically, \"Cat Country\" has been considered as an artistic failure by the author himself.\n\"Rickshaw Boy\".\nHis novel \"Rickshaw Boy\" (also known in the West as \"Camel Xiangzi\" or \"Rickshaw\") was published in 1936. It describes the tragic life of a rickshaw-puller in Beijing of the 1920s, and revealed the tragedy of lower classes at that time through the narration of the rickshaw boy's story. Xiangzi\u00a0is a stereotype of a social phenomenon: a peasant coming to the city and then turning to an urban tramp, experiencing spiritual crises of all kinds. Not only a problem of particular historical period, it is an all-pervasive one that persists throughout Chinese history. Reading the novel today reveals more about the contemporary Chinese society than the text itself. It is considered to be a classic of modern Chinese literature and a contribution to the genre of world literature about laborers. Moreover, it was translated into English and sold in the USA. In 1945, an unauthorized translation that added a bowdlerized happy ending to the story was published and sold. In 1982, the original version was made into a film of the same title.\n\"Teahouse\".\n\"Teahouse\" is a play in three acts, set in a teahouse called \"Yu Tai\" in Beijing from 1898 until the eve of the 1949 revolution. First published in 1957, the play is a social and cultural commentary on the problems, culture, and changes within China during the early twentieth century. It has been translated into many different languages.\nPromotion of Baihua (National Language).\nLao\u00a0She advocated the use of Baihua or plain language in written Chinese. Baihua evolved a new language from classic Chinese during the May Fourth Movement.\u00a0As the All-China League of Resistance Writers leader, he found he needed to abandon the use of classical Chinese for a more accessible modern style. Lao She was an early user of Baihua, and other writers and artists also adopted Baihua. Modern written Chinese is largely in the plain Baihua style.\nTreasure Boat.\n\"Treasure Boat\" was written by Lao She in 1961. It was the only children's opera he wrote.\nArticle style.\nLao She's writing was known for its humor and irony, being simple but deep. He wrote humorous, satiric novels and short stories and, after the onset of the Sino-Japanese War (1937\u201345), patriotic and propagandistic plays and novels.\nLegacy.\nAfter the end of the Cultural Revolution, Lao She was posthumously \"rehabilitated\" in 1978 and his works were republished. Several of his stories have been made into films, including \"This Life of Mine\" (1950, dir. by Shi Hui), \"Dragon Beard Ditch\" (1952, dir. by Xian Qun), \"Rickshaw Boy\" (1982, dir. by Ling Zifeng), \"The Teahouse\" (1982, dir. by Xie Tian), \"The Crescent Moon\" (1986, dir. by Huo Zhuang), \"The Drum Singers\" (1987, dir. by Tian Zhuangzhuang), and \"The Divorce\" (1992, dir. by Wang Hao-wei). Tian Zhuangzhuang's adaptation of \"The Drum Singers\", also known as \"Street Players\", was mostly shot on location in Sichuan. Some of Lao She's plays have also been staged in the recent past, including \"Beneath the Red Banner\" in 2000 in Shanghai, and \"Dragon's Beard Ditch\" in 2009 in Beijing as part of the celebration of the writer's 110th birthday.\nLao She's former home in Beijing is preserved as the Lao She Memorial Hall, opened to the public as a museum of the writer's work and life in 1999. Originally purchased in 1950, when it was 10 Fengsheng Lane, Naicifu, the address of the traditional courtyard house is now 19 Fengfu Lane. It is close to Wangfujing, in Dongcheng District. Lao She lived there until his death 16 years later. The courtyard contains persimmon trees planted by the writer. His wife called the house 'Red Persimmon Courtyard'.\nThe Lao She Literary Award has been given every two to three years starting in the year 2000. It is sponsored by the Lao She Literature Fund and can only be bestowed on Beijing writers.\nThe Laoshe Tea House, a tourist attraction in Beijing that opened in 1988 and features regular performances of traditional music, is named after Lao She, but features primarily tourist-oriented attractions.\nThree-self principles.\nAs a philosophy, the three-self principles survived in China. The People's Republic of China expelled all foreign missionaries in 1950, and in 1954 forced the Protestant churches to merge into a single body, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Protestant Churches in China, and break ties with foreign money, influence, and leadership. Critics charged that the movement was actually designed to train leaders in patriotism and to facilitate communication between the government and the Christian community. In 1966, as the Cultural Revolution began, public Christian worship was banned, and the Three-self Movement was disbanded. It was reorganized in 1980. Its main role is to articulate new government policies regarding religion. On a more positive note, it has helped foster the sense that the contemporary Chinese Protestant church is an indigenous body and no longer a branch of a foreign institution.\nLao She's work revealed the language, the joys, and the pains of the common people of China. He believed his country and its Christianity needed to be sinicized and not dependent upon the foreigner for funds and direction.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65574", "revid": "50223679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65574", "title": "M4 Sherman", "text": "World War II era medium tank\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe M4 Sherman, officially Medium Tank, M4, was the medium tank most widely used by the United States and Western Allies in World War II. The M4 Sherman proved to be reliable, relatively cheap to produce, and available in great numbers. It was also the basis of several other armored fighting vehicles including self-propelled artillery, tank destroyers, and armored recovery vehicles. Tens of thousands were distributed through the Lend-Lease program to the British Commonwealth, Soviet Union, and other Allied Nations. The tank was named by the British after the American Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman.\nThe M4 Sherman tank evolved from the M3 Lee, a medium tank developed by the United States during the early years of World War II. Despite the M3's effectiveness, the tank's unconventional layout and the limitations of its hull-mounted gun prompted the need for a more efficient and versatile design, leading to the development of the M4 Sherman.\nDevelopment.\nThe M4 Sherman retained much of the mechanical design of the M3, but it addressed several shortcomings and incorporated improvements in mobility, firepower, and ergonomics. One of the most significant changes was the relocation of the main armament\u2014initially a 75\u00a0mm gun\u2014into a fully traversing turret located at the center of the vehicle. This design allowed for more flexible and accurate fire control, enabling the crew to engage targets with greater precision than was possible on the M3. \nThe development of the M4 Sherman emphasized key factors such as reliability, ease of production, and standardization. The U.S. Army and the designers prioritized durability and maintenance ease, which ensured the tank could be quickly repaired in the field. A critical aspect of the design process was the standardization of parts, allowing for streamlined production and the efficient supply of replacement components. Additionally, the tank's size and weight were kept within moderate limits, which facilitated easier shipping and compatibility with existing logistical and engineering equipment, including bridges and transport vehicles. These design principles were essential for meeting the demands of mass production and quick deployment.\nThe M4 Sherman was designed to be more versatile and easier to produce than previous models, which proved vital as the United States entered World War II. It became the most-produced American tank of the conflict, with a total of 49,324 units built, including various specialized variants. Its production volume surpassed that of any other American tank, and it played a pivotal role in the success of the Allied forces. In terms of tank production, the only World War II-era tank to exceed the M4's production numbers was the Soviet T-34, with approximately 84,070 units built.\nOn the battlefield, the Sherman was particularly effective against German light and medium tanks during the early stages of its deployment in 1942. Its 75\u00a0mm gun and relatively superior armor provided an edge over the tanks fielded by Nazi Germany during this period. The M4 Sherman saw widespread use across various theaters of combat, including North Africa, Italy, and Western Europe. It was instrumental in the success of several Allied offensives, particularly after 1942, when the Allies began to gain momentum following the Allied landings in North Africa (Operation Torch) and the subsequent campaigns in Italy and France. The ability to produce the Sherman in large numbers, combined with its operational flexibility and effectiveness, made it a key component of the Allied war effort.\nThe Sherman's role as the backbone of U.S. armored forces in World War II cemented its legacy as one of the most influential tank designs of the 20th century. Despite its limitations\u2014such as relatively thin armor compared to German heavy and medium tanks like the Tiger and Panther\u2014the M4 was designed to be both affordable and adaptable. Its widespread deployment, durability, and ease of maintenance ensured it remained in service throughout the war, and it continued to see action even in the years following World War II in various conflicts and regions. The M4 Sherman remains one of the most iconic tanks in military history, symbolizing the industrial might and innovation of the United States during the war.\nWhen the M4 tank went into combat in North Africa with the British Army at the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942, it increased the advantage of Allied armor over Axis armor and was superior to the lighter German and Italian tank designs. For this reason, the US Army believed that the M4 would be adequate to win the war, and relatively little pressure was initially applied for further tank development. Logistical and transport restrictions, such as limitations imposed by roads, ports, and bridges, also complicated the introduction of a more capable but heavier tank. Tank destroyer battalions using vehicles built on the M4 hull and chassis, but with open-topped turrets and more potent high-velocity guns, also entered widespread use in the Allied armies. Even by 1944, most M4 Shermans kept their dual-purpose 75\u00a0mm gun. By then, the M4 was inferior in firepower and armor to increasing numbers of German upgraded medium tanks and heavy tanks but was able to fight on with the help of considerable numerical superiority, greater mechanical reliability, better logistical support, and support from growing numbers of fighter-bombers and artillery pieces. Later in the war, a more effective armor-piercing gun, the 76\u00a0mm gun M1, was incorporated into production vehicles. To increase the effectiveness of the Sherman against enemy tanks, the British refitted some Shermans with a 76.2\u00a0mm Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun (as the Sherman Firefly). \nThe relative ease of production allowed large numbers of the M4 to be manufactured, and significant investment in tank recovery and repair units allowed disabled vehicles to be repaired and returned to service quickly. These factors combined to give the Allies numerical superiority in most battles, and many infantry divisions were provided with M4s and tank destroyers. By 1944, a typical U.S. infantry division had attached for armor support an M4 Sherman battalion, a tank destroyer battalion, or both.\nAfter World War II, the Sherman, particularly the many improved and upgraded versions, continued to see combat service in many conflicts around the world, including the UN Command forces in the Korean War, with Israel in the Arab\u2013Israeli wars, briefly with South Vietnam in the Vietnam War, and on both sides of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.\nU.S. prototype.\nThe United States Army Ordnance Department designed the M4 medium tank to replace the M3 medium tank. The M3 was an up-gunned development of the M2 medium tank of 1939, in turn, derived from the M2 light tank of 1935. The M3 was developed as a stopgap measure until a new turret mounting a 75\u00a0mm gun could be devised. While it was a big improvement when used by the British in Africa against German forces, the placement of a 37\u00a0mm gun turret on top gave it a very high profile, and the unusual side-sponson mounted main gun, with limited traverse, could not be aimed across the other side of the tank. Though reluctant to adopt British weapons into their arsenal, the American designers were ready to accept proven British ideas. These ideas, as embodied in a tank designed by the Canadian General Staff, also influenced the development of the American Sherman tank. Before long American military agencies and designers had accumulated sufficient experience to forge ahead on several points. In the field of tank armament, the American 75\u00a0mm and 76\u00a0mm dual-purpose tank guns won the acknowledgment of British tank experts. Detailed design characteristics for the M4 was submitted by the Ordnance Department on 31 August 1940, but the development of a prototype was delayed while the production designs of the M3 were finished and the M3 entered full-scale production. On 18 April 1941, the U.S. Armored Force Board chose the simplest of five designs. Known as the T6, the design was a modified M3 hull and chassis, carrying a newly designed turret mounting the M3's 75\u00a0mm gun. This would later become the Sherman.\nThe Sherman's reliability resulted from features developed for U.S. light tanks during the 1930s, including vertical volute spring suspension, rubber-bushed tracks, and a rear-mounted radial engine with drive sprockets in front. The goals were to produce a fast, dependable medium tank able to support infantry, provide breakthrough striking capacity, and defeat any existing Axis nations tank.\nThe T6 prototype was completed on 2 September 1941. The upper hull of the T6 was a single large casting. It featured a single overhead hatch for the driver and a hatch in the side of the hull. In the later M4A1 production model, this large casting was maintained, although the side hatch was eliminated, and a second overhead hatch was added for the assistant driver. The modified T6 was standardized as the M4, and first production completed in February 1942. The cast-hull models would later be re-standardized as M4A1, with the first welded-hull models receiving the designation M4. In August 1942, a variant of the M4 was put forth by the Detroit Arsenal to have angled, rather than rounded hull and turret armor. The changes were intended to improve the tank's protection without increasing weight or degrading other technical characteristics.\nDoctrine.\nAs the United States approached entry into World War II, armor usage was governed by Field Manual\u00a0100\u20135, Operations (published May 1941, the month after the M4 final design). That manual stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The armored division is organized primarily to perform missions that require great mobility and firepower. It is given decisive missions. It is capable of engaging in all forms of combat, but its primary role is in offensive operations against hostile rear areas.\nThe M4 was, therefore, not intended primarily for infantry support. It placed tanks in the \"striking echelon\" of the armored division and placed the infantry in the \"support echelon\", without directing that tanks should only seek to attack other tanks, thus leaving target selection up to the field commander based on what types of targets were available. A field manual covering the use of the Sherman (FM 17\u201333, \"The Tank Battalion, Light and Medium\" of September 1942) described fighting enemy tanks, when necessary, as one of the many roles of the Sherman, but devoted only one page of text and four diagrams to tank-versus-tank action out of 142 pages. This early armored doctrine was heavily influenced by the sweeping early successes of German blitzkrieg tactics. By the time M4s reached combat in significant numbers, battlefield demands for infantry support and tank-versus-tank action far outnumbered the occasional opportunities of rear-echelon attack.\nUnited States doctrine held that the most critical anti-tank work\u00a0\u2013 stopping massed enemy tank attacks\u00a0\u2013 was primarily to be done by towed and self-propelled anti-tank guns, operated by \"Tank Destroyer\" battalions, with friendly tanks being used in support if possible. Speed was essential to bring the tank destroyers from the rear to destroy incoming tanks. This doctrine was rarely followed in combat, as it was found to be impractical. Commanders were reluctant to leave tank destroyers in reserve; if they were, it was also easier for an opposing armored force to achieve a breakthrough against an American tank battalion, which would not have all of its anti-tank weapons at the front during the beginning of any attack.\nU.S. production history.\nThe first production of the Sherman took place at the Lima Locomotive Works and was first used in 1941, with many early vehicles reserved for British use under Lend-Lease; the first production Sherman was given to the U.S. Army for evaluation, and the second tank of the British order went to London. Nicknamed \"Michael\", probably after Michael Dewar, head of the British tank mission in the U.S., the tank was displayed in London and is now an exhibit at The Tank Museum, Bovington, UK.\nIn World War II, the U.S. Army ultimately fielded 16 armored divisions, along with 70 separate tank battalions, while the U.S. Marine Corps fielded six tank battalions. A third of all Army tank battalions, and all six Marine tank battalions, were deployed to the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO). Before September 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had announced a production program calling for 120,000 tanks for the Allied war effort. Although the American industrial complex was not affected by enemy aerial bombing or submarine warfare as was Japan, Germany and, to a lesser degree, Great Britain, an enormous amount of steel for tank production was diverted to the construction of warships and other naval vessels. Steel used in naval construction amounted to the equivalent of approximately 67,000 tanks; and consequently, only about 53,500 tanks were produced during 1942 and 1943.\nThe Army had seven main sub-designations for M4 variants during production: M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, M4A5, and M4A6. These designations did not necessarily indicate linear improvement; in that \"M4A4\" did not indicate it was better than \"M4A3\". These sub-types indicated standardized production variations, which were often manufactured concurrently at different locations. The sub-types differed mainly in engines, although the M4A1 differed from the other variants by its fully cast upper hull, with a distinctive rounded appearance. The M4A4 had a longer engine that required a longer hull and more track blocks, and thus the most distinguishing feature of the M4A4 was the wider longitudinal spacing between the bogies. \"M4A5\" was an administrative placeholder designation for Canadian Ram tank. The M4A6 had a radial diesel engine as well as the elongated chassis of the M4A4, but only 75 of these were ever produced.\nMost Sherman sub-types ran on gasoline. The air-cooled Continental-produced Wright R-975 Whirlwind 9-cylinder radial gasoline engine in the M4 and M4A1 produced . The M4A3 used the liquid-cooled Ford GAA V8 gasoline engine, and the M4A4 used the liquid-cooled 30 cylinder Chrysler A57 multibank gasoline engine. There were also two diesel-engined variants. The M4A2 was powered by a pair of liquid-cooled GMC Detroit Diesel 6\u201371 two-stroke inline engines, that produced a total of , while the M4A6 used an RD-1820 (a redesigned Caterpillar D-200A air-cooled radial diesel engine, adapted from Wright Aeronautical's Wright R-1820 \"Cyclone 9\" nine-cylinder radial aircraft engine.) that produced . A 24-volt electrical system was used in the M4. The M4A2 and M4A4 were mostly supplied to other Allied countries under Lend-Lease.\nThe term \"M4\" can refer specifically to the initial sub-type with its Continental radial engine, or generically, to the entire family of seven Sherman sub-types, depending on context. Many details of production, shape, strength, and performance improved while in production, without a change to the tank's basic model number. These included stronger suspension units, safer \"wet\" (W) ammunition stowage, and stronger or more effective armor arrangements, such as the M4 \"Composite\", which had a cheaper to produce cast front hull section mated to a regular welded rear hull. British nomenclature for Shermans was by mark numbers for the different hulls with letters for differences in armament and suspension: \"A\" for a vehicle with the 76\u00a0mm gun, \"B\" for the 105\u00a0mm howitzer, \"C\" for the 17-pounder gun, and \"Y\" for any vehicle equipped with horizontal volute spring suspension (HVSS), e.g. British operated M4A1(76) was known as Sherman IIA.\nEarly Shermans mounted a 75\u00a0mm medium-velocity general-purpose gun. Although Ordnance began work on the T20/22/23 series as Sherman replacements, the Army Ground Forces were satisfied with the M4 and Armored Force Board considered some features of the experimental tanks unsatisfactory. Continuing with M4 minimized production disruption but elements of the experimental designs were incorporated into the Sherman. Later M4A1, M4A2, and M4A3 models received the larger turret with high velocity 76\u00a0mm gun trialed on the T23 tank. The first standard-production 76\u00a0mm gun-armed Sherman was an M4A1, accepted in January 1944, which first saw combat in July 1944 during Operation Cobra. Variants of the M4 and M4A3 were factory-produced with a 105\u00a0mm howitzer and a distinctive rounded gun mantlet, which surrounded the main gun, on the turret. The first Sherman variant to be armed with the 105\u00a0mm howitzer was the M4, first accepted in February 1944.\nFrom May to July 1944, the Army accepted a limited run of 254 M4A3E2 \"Jumbo\" Shermans, which had very thick hull armor and the 75\u00a0mm gun in a new, better-protected T23-style turret (\"Jumbos\" could mount the 76\u00a0mm M1 cannon), to assault fortifications, leading convoys, and spearhead armored columns. The M4A3 model was the first to be factory-produced with the HVSS system with wider tracks to distribute weight, beginning in August 1944. With the smooth ride of the HVSS, it gained the nickname \"Easy Eight\" from its experimental \"E8\" designation. The M4 and M4A3 105\u00a0mm-armed tanks, as well as the M4A1 and M4A2 76\u00a0mm-armed tanks, were also eventually equipped with HVSS. Both the Americans and the British developed a wide array of special attachments for the Sherman, although few saw combat, remaining experimental. Those that saw action included a bulldozer blade, the Duplex Drive system, flamethrowers for \"Zippo\" flame tanks, and various rocket launchers such as the T34 Calliope. British variants (DDs and mine flails) formed part of the group of specialized vehicles collectively known as \"Hobart's Funnies\" (after Percy Hobart, commander of the 79th Armoured Division).\nThe M4 Sherman's basic chassis was used for all the sundry roles of a modern mechanized force. These included the M10 and M36 tank destroyers; M7B1, M12, M40, and M43 self-propelled artillery; the M32 and M74 \"tow truck\"-style recovery tanks with winches, booms, and an 81\u00a0mm mortar for smoke screens; and the M34 (from M32B1) and M35 (from M10A1) artillery prime movers.\nService history.\nAllocation.\nDuring World War II, approximately 19,247 Shermans were issued to the U.S. Army and about 1,114 to the U.S. Marine Corps. The U.S. also supplied 17,184 to United Kingdom (some of which in turn went to the Canadians and the Free Poles), while the Soviet Union received 4,102 and an estimated 812 were transferred to China. These numbers were distributed further to the respective countries' allied nations.\nThe U.S. Marine Corps used the diesel M4A2 and gasoline powered M4A3 in the Pacific. However, the Chief of the Army's Armored Force, Lt. Gen. Jacob L. Devers, ordered that no diesel-engined Shermans be used by the Army outside the Zone of Interior (the continental U.S.). The Army used all types for either training or testing within the United States but intended the M4A2 and M4A4 (with the A57 Multibank engine) to be the primary Lend-Lease exports.\nFirst combat.\nShermans were being issued in small numbers for familiarization to U.S. armored divisions when there was a turn of events in the Western Desert campaign. On 21 June 1942, Axis forces captured Tobruk, threatening Egypt and Britain's supply line through the Suez Canal. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was at the Second Washington Conference when news of the defeat broke; President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked what he could do to help and Churchill replied at once, \"Give us as many Sherman tanks as you can spare and ship them to the Middle East as quickly as possible.\" The US considered collecting all Shermans together to be able to send the 2nd Armored Division under Patton to reinforce Egypt, but delivering the Shermans directly to the British was quicker and over 300 \u2013 mostly M4A1s, but also including M4A2s \u2013 had arrived there by September 1942.\nThe Shermans were modified for desert warfare with shields over the tracks and another stowage. The Sherman first saw combat at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 with the British 8th Army. At the start of the offensive, there were 252 tanks fit for action. These equipped the British 9th Armoured Brigade (for the battle under the New Zealand Division), 2nd Armoured Brigade (1st Armoured Division), and 8th and 20th Armoured Brigades (10th Armoured Division). Their first encounter with tanks was against German Panzer III and IV tanks with long 50\u00a0mm and 75\u00a0mm guns engaging them at . There were losses to both sides.\nThe first U.S. Shermans in battle were M4s and M4A1s in Operation Torch the following month. On 6 December, near Tebourba, Tunisia, a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment was lost to enemy tanks and anti-tank guns.\nAdditional M4s and M4A1s replaced M3s in U.S. tank battalions over the course of the North African campaign.\nThe M4 and M4A1 were the main types in U.S. units until the fall of 1944 when the Army began replacing them with the preferred M4A3 with its more powerful engine. Some M4s and M4A1s continued in U.S. service for the rest of the war. The first Sherman to enter combat with the 76\u00a0mm gun in July 1944 was the M4A1, then the M4A2, closely followed by the M4A3. By the end of the war, roughly half the U.S. Army Shermans in Europe had the 76\u00a0mm gun. The first HVSS-equipped Sherman to see combat was the M4A3(76)W in December 1944.\nEastern Front.\nUnder Lend-Lease, 4,102 M4A2 medium tanks were sent to the Soviet Union. Of these, 2,007 were equipped with the original 75\u00a0mm main gun, with 2,095 mounting the more-capable 76\u00a0mm gun. The total number of Sherman tanks sent to the USSR under Lend-Lease represented 18.6% of all Lend-Lease Shermans. The first 76\u00a0mm-armed M4A2 Shermans started to arrive in the Soviet Union in the late summer of 1944. The Soviet records reported the receiving of 3,664 tanks; the difference mainly due to deliveries being sunk on the way and discrepancies between the United States and Soviet Union archives\nThe Red Army considered the M4A2 to be much less prone to catch fire due to ammunition detonation than the T-34/76, but the M4A2 had a higher tendency to overturn in road accidents and collisions or because of rough terrain than the T-34 due to its higher center of gravity.\nBy 1945, some Red Army armored units were equipped entirely with the Sherman. Such units included the 1st Guards Mechanized Corps, the 3rd Guards Mechanized Corps and the 9th Guards Mechanized Corps, amongst others. According to Soviet tanker Dmitriy Loza, the Sherman was held in good regard and viewed positively by many Soviet tank crews, with compliments given to its reliability, ease of maintenance, generally good firepower (referring especially to the 76\u00a0mm gun version) as well as an auxiliary power unit (APU) to keep the tank's batteries charged without having to run the main engine, as was required on the T-34. However, according to Soviet tank crews, the Sherman also had disadvantages, the greatest being its high center of gravity and the ease of hitting it by enemy fire. The Sherman's relatively narrow-set tracks struggled to negotiate muddy terrain compared to the wider-set tracks of the T-34 or German Panther tank.\nDavid M. Glantz wrote: \"[The Sherman\u2019s] narrow treads made it much less mobile on mud than its German and Soviet counterparts, and it consumed great quantities of fuel...\" Glantz noted that Soviet tankers preferred the American tanks to the British ones, but preferred Soviet ones most of all.\nPacific Theater.\nWhile combat in the European theater often consisted of high-profile armored warfare, the mainly naval nature of the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) relegated it to secondary status for both the Allies and the Japanese. While the U.S. Army fielded 16 armored divisions and 70 separate tank battalions during the war, only a third of the battalions and none of the divisions were deployed to the Pacific Theater. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) deployed only their 1st Tank Division and 2nd Tank Division to the Pacific during the war with the 3rd Tank Division being deployed in Burma, China and Manchukuo's border with the Soviet Union and the 4th Tank Division remaining on the Japanese home islands in preparation for an allied invasion that never came. Armor from both sides mostly operated in jungle terrain that was poorly suited to armored warfare. For this type of terrain, the Japanese and the Allies found light tanks easier to transport and deploy.\nDuring the early stages of combat in the Pacific, specifically, the Guadalcanal campaign, the U.S. Marine Corps' M2A4 light tank fought against the equally matched Type 95 Ha-Go light tank; both were armed with a 37\u00a0mm main gun. However, the M2 (produced in 1940) was newer by five years. By 1943, the IJA still used the Type 95 and Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tanks, while Allied forces were quickly replacing their light tanks with 75\u00a0mm-armed M4s. The Chinese in India received 100 M4 Shermans and used them to great effect in the subsequent 1944 and 1945 offensives in the China Burma India Theater.\nTo counter the Sherman, the Japanese developed the Type 3 Chi-Nu and the heavier Type 4 Chi-To; both tanks were armed with 75\u00a0mm guns, albeit of different type. Only 166 Type 3s and two Type 4s were built, and none saw combat; they were saved for the defense of the Japanese home islands, leaving 1930s era light and medium armor to do battle against 1940s-built Allied light and medium armor.\nDuring the later years of the war, general purpose high explosive ammunition was preferred for fighting Japanese tanks because armor-piercing rounds, which had been designed for penetrating thicker steel, often went through the thin armor of the Type 95 Ha-Go (the most commonly encountered Japanese tank) and out the other side without stopping. Although the high-velocity guns of tank destroyers were useful for penetrating fortifications, M4s armed with flamethrowers were often deployed, as direct fire seldom destroyed Japanese fortifications.\nKorean War.\nDuring the Korean War, the M4A3E8 \"Easy Eight\" was the main tank force of the U.S. military until the signing of the armistice agreement.\nAt the outbreak of the war, the U.S. military tried to deploy the M4A3E8, a medium-sized tank of the same class, to respond to North Korean T-34-85, but there were few tanks available for rapid deployment from the Far East due to disarmament after World War II. The U.S. Far East Command collected 58 M4A3E8 scattered throughout Japan, created the 8072nd Temporary Tank Battalion (later renamed to the 89th Tank Battalion) on 17 July and landed them in Busan on 1 August. The 8072nd Temporary Tank Battalion was immediately deployed for Battle of Masan to support the 25th U.S. Infantry Division.\nSince then, a total of 679 M4A3E8 were deployed on the Korean Peninsula in 1950. The M4A3E8 and T-34-85 were comparable and could destroy each other at normal combat ranges, although the use of High-Velocity Armor Piercing ammunition, advanced optics, and better crew training gave the Sherman an advantage. The M4A3E8, using 76\u00a0mm HVAP ammunition, destroyed 41 enemy tanks from July to November 1950.\nThe M4A3E8 had weaker anti-tank combat capability compared to the larger caliber M26 Pershing and the M46 Patton that were operated at the same time. However, the lighter M4A3E8 became the preferred U.S. tank in the later phases of the war. It was considered more advantageous in terms of maneuverability on rough terrain and ease of maintenance due to the mechanical reliability. Because of this feature, the M4A3E8 were widely used for providing close support to infantry units, particularly during battles for high ground and mountains.\nFrom December 1951, around 20 M4A3E8s saw service with the Republic of Korea Marine Corps during the war while the Army operated M36 GMCs as its main armored asset.\nOther uses.\nAfter World War II, the U.S. kept the M4A3E8 \"Easy Eight\" in service, with either the 76\u00a0mm gun or a 105\u00a0mm M4 howitzer. The U.S. Army replaced the M4 in 1957, in favor of the M47 Patton, M48 Patton and, M60 Patton. The U.S. continued to transfer Shermans to its allies, which contributed to widespread foreign use.\nThe Israeli Defense Force used Shermans from its creation in 1948 until the 1980s, having first acquired a single M4A2 lacking the main armament from British forces as they withdrew from Israel. The popularity of the tank (having now been re-armed) compared to the outdated, 1934-origin French Renault R35 interwar light tanks with their 37\u00a0mm short-barreled guns, which made up the bulk of the IDF's tank force, led to the purchase of 30 unarmed M4(105\u00a0mm)s from Italian scrapyards. Three of these, plus the original M4A2, saw extensive service in the 1948-9 war of independence. The remainder were then serviced and rearmed with 75\u00a0mm guns and components whenever these became available, composing a large part of Israeli tank forces for the next eight years. The 75\u00a0mm-armed Shermans were replaced by M4A1 (76\u00a0mm) Shermans imported from France before the 1956 Suez Crisis after it was realized that their armor penetration was insufficient for combat against newer tanks such as the IDF Centurions as well as the T-34-85s being delivered to Egyptian forces. During further upgrades, the French military helped develop a conversion kit to upgrade about 300 Shermans to the long high-velocity 75\u00a0mm gun CN 75-50 used in the AMX-13. These were designated Sherman M-50 by the Israelis. Before the Six-Day War in 1967, the Israeli Army upgraded about 180 M4A1(76)W HVSS Shermans with the French 105\u00a0mm Mod\u00e8le F1 gun, re-engined them with Cummins diesel engines, and designated the upgraded tank Sherman M-51. The Sherman tanks, fighting alongside the 105\u00a0mm Centurion \"Shot Kal\" and M48 Patton tanks, were able to defeat the T-34-85, T-54/55/62 series, and IS-3 tanks used by the Egyptian and Syrian forces in the 1967 Six-Day War.\nM4A3s were also used by British forces in Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution until 1946 when they were passed on to the KNIL, which used them until 1949 before they were passed on to the Indonesian National Armed Forces.\nArmament.\nGun development.\nAs the Sherman was being designed, provisions were made so that multiple types of main armament (specified as a 75\u00a0mm gun, a 3-inch gun, or a 105\u00a0mm howitzer) could be mounted in the turret. The possibility of mounting the main gun of the M6 heavy tank, the 3-inch gun M7, in the turret of the M4 Sherman was explored first, but its size and weight (the weapon was modified from a land-based antiaircraft gun) made it too large to fit in the turret of the Sherman. Development on a new 76\u00a0mm gun better suited to the Sherman began in fall 1942.\nIn early 1942, tests began on the feasibility of mounting a 105\u00a0mm howitzer into the turret of the Sherman. The basic 105\u00a0mm howitzer M2A1 was found to be ill-designed for mounting in a tank turret, so it was completely redesigned and re-designated the 105\u00a0mm howitzer M4. After modifications to the turret (concerning the balancing of the gun and the strength of the power traverse) and interior of the hull (concerning the stowage of the 105\u00a0mm ammunition), the Ordnance Department expressed its approval of the project, and production of M4 tanks armed with 105\u00a0mm howitzers began in February 1944.\nThe Sherman would enter combat in 1942 equipped with the 75\u00a0mm gun M3, a 40-caliber gun that could penetrate an estimated of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) at 90 degrees, a range of and at firing the usual M61 APCBC round, and equipped with an M38A2 telescopic gunsight. Facing the early Panzer III and Panzer IV in North Africa, the Sherman's gun could penetrate the frontal armor of these tanks at normal combat ranges, within . U.S. Army Intelligence discounted the arrival of the Tiger I in 1942 and the Panther tank in 1943, predicting that the Panther would be a heavy tank like the Tiger I, and doubted that many would be produced. There were also reports of British QF 6-pounder (57\u00a0mm) guns being able to destroy the Tiger I. However, this only happened at very close ranges and against the thinner side armor. Due to their misconceptions related to this, and also due to tests that seemed to prove that the 76\u00a0mm gun was able to destroy both the Tiger and the Panther, the leadership of Army Ground Forces were not especially concerned by the Tiger I. The criteria and results of the 76\u00a0mm gun tests were later ruled to have been inaccurate when compared to real-world conditions (tests against sections of American armor plate configured to resemble those found on a Panther tank suggested that the new M1A1 gun would be adequate, but testing against actually captured Panther tanks was never done), with Eisenhower even remarking that he was wrongly told by Ordnance that the 76\u00a0mm could knock out any German tank. The Army also failed to anticipate that the Germans would attempt to make the Panther the standard tank of their panzer divisions in 1944, supported by small numbers of Tiger I and IIs.\nWhen the newly designed 76\u00a0mm gun, known as the T1, was first installed in the M4 in spring 1943, it was found to unbalance the turret, and the gun barrel also protruded too far forward, making it more difficult to transport and susceptible to hitting the ground when the tank traveled over undulating terrain. The barrel length was reduced by (from 57 calibers to 52), resulting in the M1 variant. Mounting this gun in the original M4 turret proved problematic, so the turret for the aborted T23 tank project was used instead for the definitive production version of the 76\u00a0mm M4 Shermans, along with a modified version of the gun known as the M1A1.\nDespite the Ordnance Department's development of new 76\u00a0mm and 90\u00a0mm anti-tank guns, the Army Ground Forces rejected their deployment as unnecessary. An attempt to upgrade the M4 Sherman by installing the 90\u00a0mm-armed turret from the T26 tank project on an M4 hull in April 1944 (referred to as the M4/T26) was halted after realizing it could not go into production sooner than the T26 and would likely delay T26 development. Even in 1943, most German armored fighting vehicles (later models of the Panzer IV tank, StuG III assault gun and Marder III \"panzerjaeger\" self-propelled anti-tank gun) mounted the 7.5 cm KwK 40. As a result, even weakly armored light German tank destroyers such as the Marder III, which was meant to be a stop-gap measure to fight Soviet tanks in 1942, could destroy Shermans from a distance. The disparity in firepower between the German armored fighting vehicles that began to be fielded in 1943 and the 75\u00a0mm-armed M4 was the impetus to begin production of 76\u00a0mm-armed M4s in January 1944. In testing before the invasion of Normandy, the 76\u00a0mm gun was found to have an undesirably large muzzle blast that kicked up dust from the ground and obscured vision for further firing. The M1A1C gun, which entered production lines in March 1944, was threaded for a muzzle brake, but as the brakes were still in development, the threads were protected with a cap. The addition of a muzzle brake on the new M1A2 gun (which also incorporated a faster rifling twist leading to a slight accuracy increase at longer ranges) beginning in October 1944 finally solved this problem by directing the blast sideways.\nArmy doctrine at the time emphasized the multirole ability of the tank, and the capability of the high explosive shell was considered important. Being a dedicated anti-tank gun, the 76\u00a0mm had a much weaker high explosive shell than the existing 75\u00a0mm and was not initially accepted by various U.S. armored division commanders, even though many had already been produced and were available. All of the U.S. Army M4s deployed initially in Normandy in June 1944 had the 75\u00a0mm gun. Fighting against Panther tanks in Normandy quickly demonstrated the need for better anti-tank firepower, and the 76\u00a0mm M4s were deployed to First Army units in July 1944. Operation Cobra was the combat debut of the 76\u00a0mm gun-armed Sherman, in the form of the M4A1(76)W. General George S. Patton's Third Army were initially issued 75\u00a0mm M4s and accepted 76\u00a0mm-armed M4s only after the Battle of Arracourt against Panther tanks in late September 1944.\nThe higher-velocity 76\u00a0mm gun gave Shermans anti-tank firepower equal to many of the German vehicles they encountered, particularly the Panzer IV and StuG III, but its gun was inferior to that of the Tiger or the Panther. The 76\u00a0mm could penetrate of unsloped RHA at and at using the usual M62 round. The M1 helped to equalize the Sherman and the Panzer IV in terms of firepower; the 48-caliber 7.5 cm KwK 40 (75\u00a0mm L/48) of the Panzer IV could penetrate of unsloped RHA at and at . The 76\u00a0mm gun was still inferior to the much more powerful 70-caliber 7.5 cm KwK 42 (75\u00a0mm L/70) of the Panther, which could penetrate of unsloped RHA at and at using the usual PzGr.39/42 round. The 76\u00a0mm was capable of knocking out a Panther at normal combat ranges from the flanks or rear but could not overcome the glacis plate. Due to its 55-degree slope, the Panther's glacis had a line-of-sight thickness of with actual effectiveness being even greater. An M4 might only knock out a Panther frontally from point-blank range by aiming for its turret front and transverse-cylindrical shaped mantlet, the lower edge of which on most Panthers (especially the earlier Ausf. D and A versions) constituted a vulnerable shot trap. A 76\u00a0mm-armed Sherman could penetrate the upper frontal hull superstructure of a Tiger I tank from normal combat ranges. Although the new gun lessened the gap between the two tanks, the Tiger I was still capable of knocking an M4 out frontally from over .\nIn late summer 1944, after breaking out of the bocage and moving into open country, U.S. tank units that engaged German defensive positions at longer ranges sometimes took 50% casualties before spotting where the fire was coming from. The average combat range noted by the Americans for tank-versus-tank action was . Sherman crews also had concerns about firing from longer ranges, as Sherman's high-flash powder made their shots easier to spot. This, and the U.S. Army's usual offensive tactical situation, often contributed to losses suffered by the U.S. Army in Europe. Even though the various gunsights fitted to the Sherman had fewer magnification settings than those fitted to German tanks, their gunners were able to use a secondary periscope that featured a far larger field of view than their German counterparts.\nT4 High-Velocity Armor Piercing (HVAP) ammunition became available in September 1944 for the 76\u00a0mm gun. The projectile contained a tungsten penetrator surrounded by a lightweight aluminum body and ballistic windshield, which gave it a higher velocity and more penetrating power. The increased penetration of HVAP allowed the 76\u00a0mm gun to match the Panther's 7.5 cm KwK 42 APCR shot. However, its performance was heavily degraded by sloped armor such as the Panther's glacis. Because of tungsten shortages, HVAP rounds were constantly in short supply. Priority was given to U.S. tank destroyer units and over half of the 18,000 projectiles received were not compatible with the 76\u00a0mm gun M1, being fitted into the cartridge case of the M10 tank destroyer's 3-inch gun M7. Most Shermans carried only a few rounds at any one time, and some units never received any.\nThe British anticipated future developments in German armor and began development of a anti-tank gun even before its 57\u00a0mm predecessor entered service. Out of expediency and also driven by delays in their new tank designs, they mounted the powerful 76.2\u00a0mm Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun in a standard 75\u00a0mm M4 Sherman turret. This conversion became the Sherman Firefly. The U.S. M1 gun and the 17-pounder had nearly identical bore diameters, but the British piece used a more voluminous cartridge case containing a much bigger propellant charge. This allowed it to penetrate of unsloped RHA at and at using APCBC ammunition. The 17-pounder still could not penetrate the steeply sloped glacis plate of the Panther but it was expected to be able to pierce its gun mantlet at over ; moreover it was estimated it would defeat the Tiger I's frontal armor from . However, British Army test results conducted with two Fireflys against a Panther turret-sized target demonstrated relatively poor accuracy at long range; a hit probability of 25.4% at with APCBC, and only 7.4% with APDS. In late 1943, the British offered the 17-pounder to the U.S. Army for use in their M4 tanks. General Devers insisted on comparison tests between the 17-pounder and the U.S. 90\u00a0mm gun. The tests were finally done on 25 March \u2013 23 May 1944; they seemed to show the 90\u00a0mm gun was equal to or better than the 17-pounder. By then, production of the 76\u00a0mm-armed M4 and the 90\u00a0mm-armed M36 were both underway and U.S. Army interest in the 17-pounder waned. Late in 1944, the British began to produce tungsten sabot rounds for the 17-pounder, which could readily breach the armor of even the Tiger II; these were not as accurate as standard rounds and not generally available.\nAfter the heavy tank losses of the Battle of the Bulge, in January 1945, General Eisenhower asked that no more 75\u00a0mm M4s be sent to Europe: only 76\u00a0mm M4s were wanted. Interest in mounting the British 17-pounder in U.S. Shermans flared anew. In February 1945, the U.S. Army began sending 75\u00a0mm M4s to England for conversion to the 17-pounder. Approximately 100 conversions were completed by the beginning of May. By then, the end of the war in Europe was clearly in sight, and the U.S. Army decided the logistical difficulties of adding a new ammunition caliber to the supply system was not warranted. None of the converted 17-pounder M4s was deployed in combat by the U.S., and it is unclear what happened to most of them, although some were given to the British as part of Lend-Lease post-war.\nThe tank destroyer doctrine.\nGeneral Lesley J. McNair was head of the Army Ground Forces from 1942 to 1944. McNair, a former artilleryman, advocated for the role of the tank destroyer (TD) within the U.S. Army. In McNair's opinion, tanks were to exploit breakthroughs and support infantry, while masses of attacking hostile tanks were to be engaged by tank destroyer units, which were composed of a mix of self-propelled and towed anti-tank guns. Self-propelled tank destroyers, called \"gun motor carriages\" (as were any U.S. Army self-propelled armored vehicles mounting an artillery piece of heavy caliber), were similar to tanks but were lightly armored with open-topped turrets. The tank destroyers were supposed to be faster and carry a more powerful anti-tank gun than tanks (although in reality tanks often received more powerful guns before tank destroyers did) and armor was sacrificed for speed. Armored Force and Tank Destroyer Force doctrine were developed separately, and it was not against Armored Force doctrine for friendly tanks to engage hostile tanks that appeared while attacking or defending; tank destroyers were to engage numbers of enemy tanks that broke through friendly lines.\nMcNair approved the 76\u00a0mm upgrade to the M4 Sherman and production of the 90\u00a0mm gun-armed M36 tank destroyer, but he at first staunchly opposed mass production of the T20 medium tank series and its descendants, the T25 and T26 (which would eventually become the M26 Pershing) during the crucial period of 1943 because they did not meet the two criteria of the Army Ground Forces for accepting new equipment; they were not \"battle worthy,\" and he saw no \"battle need\" for them. In fall 1943, Lieutenant General Devers, commander of U.S. forces in the European Theater of Operations (ETO), asked for 250 T26 tanks for use in the invasion of France; McNair refused, citing the fact that he believed the M4 was adequate. Devers appealed all the way to the War Department, and Major General Russell L. Maxwell, the Assistant Chief of Staff G-4 of the War Department General Staff, ordered the 250 tanks built in December 1943. McNair finally relented in his opposition, but still opposed mass production; his Army Ground Forces even asked for the tanks to be \"down-gunned\" from 90\u00a0mm to 75 or 76\u00a0mm in April 1944, believing the 76\u00a0mm gun was capable of performing satisfactorily. General George C. Marshall then summarily ordered the tanks to be provided to the ETO as soon as possible. Soon after the Normandy invasion in June 1944, General Dwight D. Eisenhower urgently requested heavy tanks, but McNair's continued opposition to mass production due to persistent serious mechanical problems with the vehicles delayed their procurement. That same month, the War Department reversed course and completely overruled the Army Ground Forces when making their tank production plan for 1945. 7,800 tanks were to be built, of which 2,060 were to be T26s armed with 90\u00a0mm guns, 2,728 were to be T26s armed with 105\u00a0mm howitzers and 3,000 were to be M4A3 Sherman tanks armed with 105\u00a0mm howitzers. As a part of the plan, the British requested 750 90\u00a0mm-armed T26s and 200 105\u00a0mm-armed T26s. General McNair was killed in a botched air support mission in July 1944, and the path to production for the T26 tank became somewhat clearer. General Marshall intervened again and the tanks were eventually brought into full production. However, only a few T26 tanks (by then designated M26) saw combat beginning in February 1945, too late to have any effect on the battlefield.\nVariants.\nThe Sherman, like its M3 predecessor, was one of the first tanks to feature a gyroscopically stabilized gun and sight. The stabilization was only in the vertical plane; the mechanism could not slew the turret. The stabilizer was sufficient to keep the gun's elevation setting within 1/8th of a degree, or 2 mils, while crossing moderately rough terrain at . This gave a hit probability of 70% on enemy tanks at ranges of to . The utility of the stabilization is debatable, with some saying it was useful for its intended purpose, others that it was useful only for using the sights for stabilized viewing on the move. Some operators disabled the stabilizer.\nThe 75\u00a0mm gun also had an effective canister round that functioned as a large shotgun. In the close fighting of the French \"bocage\" of Normandy, the U.S. Army's 2nd Armored Division tanks used Culin Hedgerow Cutters fitted to their tanks to push three tanks together through a hedgerow. The flank tanks would clear the back of the hedgerow on their side with canister rounds while the center tank would engage and suppress known or suspected enemy positions on the next hedgerow. This approach permitted surprisingly fast progress through the very tough and well-defended hedgerows in Normandy. Over 500 sets of these were fitted to US armored vehicles, and many fitted to various British tanks (where they were called \"prongs\").\nThe 75\u00a0mm gun had a white phosphorus shell originally intended for use as an artillery marker to help with targeting. M4 tank crews discovered that the shell could also be used against the Tiger and Panther\u2014when the burning white phosphorus adhered to the German tanks, their excellent optics would be blinded and the acrid smoke would get sucked inside the vehicle, making it difficult or impossible for the crew to breathe. This, and the fear of fire starting or spreading inside the tank, would sometimes cause the crew to abandon the tank. There were several recorded instances where white phosphorus shells defeated German tanks in this fashion.\nM4 Shermans armed with the 105\u00a0mm M4 howitzer were employed as a three-vehicle \"assault gun\" platoon under the tank battalion headquarters company along with another one in each medium tank company (a total of six tanks in the battalion) to provide close fire support and smoke. Armored infantry battalions were also eventually issued three of 105\u00a0mm Shermans in the headquarters company. The 105\u00a0mm-armed variants were issued the M67 high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round; although very effective the low muzzle velocity made hitting enemy armor difficult. The 105\u00a0mm Shermans were not equipped with a power-traversing turret, and this resulted in complaints from soldiers in the field. An upgrade was not available before the end of the war.\nSecondary armament.\nThe standard secondary armament comprised; a coaxial .30 caliber M1919 Browning machine gun A5 with 4,750 rounds of ammunition, a ball-mounted M1919 A4 in the front hull operated by the assistant driver and a pintle mounted .50 caliber M2 Browning HB machine gun with 300 rounds on the turret roof for anti-aircraft protection. Early production models of the M4 and M4A1 also had a pair of fixed, forward firing M1919 machine guns mounted in the front hull and operated by the driver; this arrangement was inherited from the M2 and M3 medium tanks and was a result of a World War I requirement to be able to sweep the ground in front of an advancing tank with unaimed fire.\nArmor.\nTurret.\nThe turret armor of the 75\u00a0mm and 105\u00a0mm armed M4 ranged from to thick. The turret front armor was 76.2\u00a0mm thick, angled at 30 degrees from the vertical, giving an effective thickness of . The opening in the front of the M4's turret for the main gun was covered by a rounded thick rotor shield. Early Shermans that had a periscopic sight for the main gun mounted in the turret roof possessed a small thick mantlet that only covered the hole where the main gun barrel protruded; the exposed barrel of the coaxial machine gun was vulnerable to bullet splash or shrapnel and a small armored cover was manufactured to protect it. When the Sherman was later fitted with a telescopic sight next to the main gun, a larger thick gun mantlet that covered the entire rotor shield including the sight and coaxial machine gun barrel was produced. 105\u00a0mm-armed Sherman tanks did not have a rotor shield, possessing only the mantlet to cover the opening in the turret front. The turret side armor was thick at a 5-degree angle from the vertical. The turret rear armor was thick and vertical, while the turret roof armor was thick, and flat.\nLater models of the M4A1, M4A2 and M4A3 Sherman tanks were equipped with the T80 turret developed for the T23 tank and the new 76\u00a0mm gun. This turret's armor was thick on the sides and rear, angled from 0 to 13 degrees from the vertical. It had a thick roof, which sat at 0 to 45 degrees from the vertical. The front of the T23 turret, which like the 105\u00a0mm-armed Sherman's turret, did not have a rotor shield, was protected by an unsloped thick cast gun mantlet. Combat experience indicated that the single hatch in the three-man 75\u00a0mm gun turret was inadequate for timely evacuation, so Ordnance added a loader's hatch beside the commander's beginning in late 1943. All 76\u00a0mm gun turrets had two roof hatches.\nHull.\nThe Sherman's glacis plate was originally thick. and angled at 56 degrees from the vertical, providing an effective thickness of . The M4, M4A1, early production M4A2, and early production M4A3 possessed protruding cast \"hatchway\" structures that allowed the driver and assistant driver's hatches to fit in front of the turret ring. In these areas, the effect of the glacis plate's slope was greatly reduced. Later Shermans had an upgraded glacis plate that was uniformly thick and sloped at 47 degrees from the vertical, providing an effective thickness of over the entire plate. The new design improved overall ballistic protection by eliminating the \"hatchways\", while also allowing for larger hatches for the driver and bow gunner. The cast hull M4A1 for the most part retained its previous glacis shape even after the larger hatches were introduced; the casting, irrespective of the larger hatches, sat 37 to 55 degrees from the vertical, with the large majority of the piece sitting closer to a 55-degree angle.\nThe transmission housing was rounded, made of three cast sections bolted together or cast as one piece. It ranged from thick. The upper and lower hull sides were thick, and vertical, while the upper hull rear was also thick, vertical or sloped at 10 degrees from the vertical. The lower hull rear, which protected the engine, was thick, sloped at 0 to 22 degrees from the vertical depending upon the variant. The hull roof was . The hull floor ranged from thick under the driver and assistant driver's positions to thick at the rear. The M4 had a hatch on the hull bottom to dispose of spent shell casings and to provide an emergency escape route. In the Pacific, Marines often used this Sherman feature in reverse to recover wounded infantry under fire.\nEffectiveness.\nThe armor of the Sherman was ineffective against most Axis tanks (such as tanks like the Panzer IV with 7.5\u00a0cm cannon and above) along with anti-tank weapon fire early in the war during multiple occasions. So it was decided it needed a compound angle to resist later German tank and anti-tank guns. The distinctive protruding \"hatchways\" of the early Sherman compromised the 56 degree-angled glacis plate, making them weak points where the effect of the glacis plate's slope was greatly reduced. In 1943, to make the thickness of these areas equal with the rest of the glacis plate, appliqu\u00e9 armor plates were fitted in front of them.\nA \"Waffenamt-Pr\u00fcfwesen\" 1 report estimated that with the M4 angled 30 degrees sideways and APCBC round, the Tiger I's 8.8\u00a0cm KwK 36 L/56 gun would be capable of penetrating the differential case of an American M4 Sherman from and the turret front from , but the Tiger's 88\u00a0mm gun would not penetrate the upper glacis plate at any range and that the Panther, with its long-barreled 7.5\u00a0cm KwK 42 L/70, would have to close in to to achieve a penetration in the same situation. However, other German documents suggested that the glacis of a Sherman could be penetrated at a range of by the Tiger I. The Tiger I was estimated to be able to penetrate the Sherman in most other armor plates at a range of or above, far exceeding the ranges at which the tank itself was vulnerable to fire from the Sherman.\nAlthough the later-model German medium and heavy tanks were greatly feared, Buckley opined \"The vast majority of German tanks encountered in Normandy were either inferior or merely equal to the Sherman.\" (Panzer III or Panzer IV)\nResearch for tank casualties in Normandy from 6 June to 10 July 1944 conducted by the British No. 2 Operational Research Section concluded that from a sample of 40 Sherman tanks, 33 tanks burned (82 percent) and 7 tanks remained unburned following an average of 1.89 penetrations. In comparison, from a sample of five Panzer IVs, four tanks burned (80 percent) and one tank remained unburned, following an average of 1.5 penetrations. The Panther tank burned 14 times (63 percent) from a sample of 22 tanks and following 3.24 penetrations, while the Tiger burned four times (80 percent) out of a sample of five tanks following 3.25 penetrations. John Buckley, using a case study of the British 8th and 29th Armoured Brigades, found that of their 166 Shermans knocked out in combat during the Normandy campaign, 94 (56.6 percent) burned out. Buckley also notes that an American survey carried out concluded that 65% of tanks burned out after being penetrated. United States Army research proved that the major reason for this was the stowage of main gun ammunition in the vulnerable sponsons above the tracks. A U.S. Army study in 1945 concluded that only 10\u201315 percent of wet stowage Shermans burned when penetrated, compared to 60\u201380 percent of the older dry-stowage Shermans. As a burned tank was unrecoverable, it was prudent in combat to continue to fire at a tank until it caught fire.\nAt first, a partial remedy to ammunition fires in the M4 was found in 1943 by welding appliqu\u00e9 armor plates to the sponson sides over the ammunition stowage bins, though there was doubt that these had any effect. Later models moved ammunition stowage to the hull floor, with water jackets surrounding each storage bin. The practice, known as \"wet stowage\", reduced the chance of fire after a hit to about 15 percent. The Sherman allegedly gained the grim nickname \"Tommy Cooker\" (by the Germans, who referred to British soldiers as \"Tommies\"; a tommy cooker was a World War I-era trench stove), though no evidence appears to exist beyond anecdote on the Allied side and post-war. Conversely, it was also allegedly called \"Ronson\" or \"Zippo\" due to the flamethrower version of the tank, and not because \"it lights the first time, every time\"; this nickname story has been almost conclusively proven to be a fabrication as the Ronson company did not begin using the slogan until the 1950s and the average soldier did not have a Ronson lighter. Fuel fires occasionally occurred, but such fires were far less common and less deadly than ammunition fires. In many cases, the fuel tank of the Sherman was found intact after a fire. Tankers described \"fierce, blinding jets of flame\", which is consistent with burning pressurized hydraulic fluid, but not gasoline-related fires.\nOverview.\nComparisons can be drawn between the T-34 and the U.S. M4 Sherman tank. Both tanks were the backbone of the armored units in their respective armies, both nations distributed these tanks to their allies, who also used them as the mainstay of their own armored formations, and both were upgraded extensively and fitted with more powerful guns. Both were designed for mobility and ease of manufacture and maintenance, sacrificing some performance for these goals. Both chassis were used as the foundation for a variety of support vehicles, such as armor recovery vehicles, tank destroyers, and self-propelled artillery. Both were an approximately even match for the standard German medium tank, the Panzer IV, though each of these three tanks had particular advantages and weaknesses compared with the other two. Neither the T-34 nor the M4 was a match for Germany's heavier tanks, the Panther (technically a medium tank) or the Tiger I; the Soviets used the IS-2 heavy tank and the U.S. used the M26 Pershing as the heavy tanks of their forces instead.\nUpgrades.\nUpgrades included the rectangular armor patches protecting ammunition stowage mentioned above, and smaller armor patches in front of each of the protruding hatchway structures in the glacis in an attempt to mitigate their ballistic weakness. Field improvisations included placing sandbags, spare track links, concrete, wire mesh, or even wood for increased protection against shaped-charge rounds. While mounting sandbags around a tank had little effect against high-velocity anti-tank gunfire it was thought to provide standoff protection against HEAT weapons, primarily the German \"Panzerfaust\" anti-tank grenade launcher and the 88\u00a0mm caliber \"Panzerschreck\" anti-tank rocket launcher. In the only study known to have been done to test the use of sandbags, on 9 March 1945, officers of the 1st Armored Group tested standard \"Panzerfaust\" 60s against sandbagged M4s; shots against the side blew away the sandbags and still penetrated the side armor, whereas shots fired at an angle against the front plate blew away some of the sandbags but failed to penetrate the armor. Earlier, in the summer of 1944, General Patton, informed by his ordnance officers that sandbags were useless, and that the machines' chassis suffered from the extra weight, had forbidden the use of sandbags. Following the clamor for better armor and firepower after the losses of the Battle of the Bulge, Patton ordered extra armor plates salvaged from knocked-out American and German tanks welded to the turrets and hulls of tanks of his command. Approximately 36 of this up-armored M4s were supplied to each of the three armored divisions of the Third Army in the spring of 1945.\nM4A3E2.\nThe M4A3E2 Sherman \"Jumbo\" assault tank variant, based upon a standard M4A3(75)W hull, had an additional plate welded to the glacis, giving a total thickness of , which resulted in a glacis of line-of-sight thickness, and over effective thickness. The sponson sides had thick plates welded on, to make them thick. The transmission cover was significantly thicker, and a new, more massive T23-style turret with of armor on the sides and rear and a thick flat roof. The gun mantlet had an additional of armor welded on giving a total thickness of 177.8\u00a0mm. It was originally to be armed with the 76\u00a0mm gun, but the 75\u00a0mm was preferred for infantry support and was used, although some were later upgraded to use the 76\u00a0mm. The higher weight required changing the transmission gear ratios to reduce maximum speed to 22\u00a0mph, and crews were warned not to let the suspension \"bottom\" too violently. 254 were built at the Fisher Tank Arsenal from May to July 1944, and arrived in Europe in the fall of 1944, being employed throughout the remainder of the fighting in various roles. They were considered \"highly successful\".\nMobility.\nIn its initial specifications for a replacement for the M3 medium tank, the U.S. Army restricted Sherman's height, width, and weight so that it could be transported via typical bridges, roads, railroads, and landing craft without special accommodation. Army Regulation 850-15 initially restricted the widths of a tank to 103 inches (2.62 m) and its weight to 30 tons (27.2 t). This greatly aided the strategic, logistical, and tactical flexibility and mobility of all Allied armored forces using the Sherman.\nA long-distance service trial conducted in Britain in 1943 compared diesel and gasoline Shermans to Cromwell tanks (Rolls-Royce Meteor engine) and Centaur (Liberty L-12). The British officer commanding the trial concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They are utterly reliable...I do not think they are quite as good as the Cromwell across the country when they are running on rather worn rubber tracks and the going is greasy, neither does one get as smooth a ride, but they appear so infinitely superior in every other way particularly in reliability with a minimum of maintenance that this cross-country consideration is completely overweighed.\nThe Sherman had good speed both on and off-road. Off-road performance varied. In the desert, the Sherman's rubber-block tracks performed well, and in the confined, hilly terrain of Italy, the smaller, nimbler Sherman could often cross terrain that some heavy German tanks could not. Albert Speer recounted in his autobiography \"Inside the Third Reich\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On the southwestern front (Italy) reports on the cross-country mobility of the Sherman have been very favorable. The Sherman climbs mountains our tank experts consider inaccessible to tanks. One great advantage is that the Sherman has a very powerful motor in proportion to its weight. Its cross-country mobility on level ground is, as the 26th Panzer Division reports, definitely superior to that of our tanks.\nHowever, while this may have held compared with the first-generation German tanks, such as the Panzer III and Panzer IV, comparative testing with the second generation wide-tracked German tanks (Panther and Tiger) conducted by the Germans at their Kummersdorf testing facility, as well as by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division, proved otherwise. The M4's initial tracks were 16.5 inches wide. This produced ground pressure of 14 pounds per square inch. U.S. crews found that on soft ground, the narrow tracks of the Sherman gave poorer ground pressure compared to the Panther and Tiger.\nBecause of their wider tracks and use of the characteristic \"Schachtellaufwerk\" interleaved and overlapped road wheels (as used on pre-war origin German half-track vehicles), the Panther and Tiger had greater mobility on soft ground because of their greater flotation (i.e., lower ground pressure). Lieutenant Colonel Wilson M. Hawkins of the 2nd Armored Division wrote the following comparing the U.S. M4 Sherman and the German Panther in a report to Allied headquarters:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It has been claimed that our tank is the more maneuverable. In recent tests, we put a captured German Mark V [Panther] against all models of our own. The German tank was the faster, both across the country and on the highway, and could make sharper turns. It was also the better hill climber.\nThis was backed up in an interview with Technical Sergeant Willard D. May of the 2nd Armored Division who commented: \"I have taken instructions on the Mark V [Panther] and have found, first, it is easily as maneuverable as the Sherman; second the flotation exceeds that of the Sherman.\"\nStaff Sergeant and tank platoon sergeant Charles A. Carden completes the comparison in his report:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Mark V [Panther] and VI [Tiger] in my opinion have more maneuverability and certainly more flotation. I have seen in many cases where the Mark V and VI tanks could maneuver nicely over ground where the M4 would bog down. On one occasion I saw at least 10 Royal Tigers [Tiger II] make a counterattack against us over ground that for us was nearly impassable.\nThe U.S. Army issued extended end connectors (\"duckbills\") to add width to the standard tracks as a stopgap solution. Duckbills began to reach front-line tank battalions in fall 1944 but were original factory equipment for the heavy M4A3E2 Jumbo to compensate for the extra weight of armor. The M4A3(76)W HVSS Shermans and other late models with wider-tracked suspensions corrected these problems but formed only a small proportion of the tanks in service even in 1945.\nReliability.\nM4A1.\nIn September 1942 the British developed some potential improvements and tested the tanks.\nAfter the springs of the left front bogie broke, considered typical for this type of suspension. Oil accumulated on the floor of the engine compartment during driving. The engine periodically stalled under high load due to interrupted fuel supply. It was found that the engine had been built and installed incorrectly. Upon disassembly carbon deposits were found on the working surfaces of the cylinders; they were very worn out after only 65 hours of operation or run. In the absence of a replacement by 10 October, the engine was put back in the tank; the revised fuel system was supposed to improve the stalling engine.\nIn November 1943, several M4A1 Shermans were tested at the American proving ground to test British innovations. On one of them, 37 experimental changes were made, on the second \u2013 47, on the third \u2013 53. In total, 60 changes were developed and implemented for the Shermans, most of which were considered successful after a 600-mile run and firing.\nM4A2.\nIn Africa, the British engines ran for 700\u2013900 miles (1130\u20131450\u00a0km), or 180\u2013200 hours. The engine had to be inspected and repaired after 100 hours, which significantly extended its service life, but there was not enough time for such work, and among crews, it was believed that there was little benefit in the procedure. The engine left much to be desired, as evidenced by attempts at modifications in the Eighth Army, which did not affect the reliability of the tank. The Shermans also had other defects, including broken wiring, breaking ignition coils, and clutch rods.\nThe improved return roller design performed much better than that which the early Sherman production inherited from the M3. A February 1943 report described a unit where there were no broken bogey coil springs even after a 1,000-mile (1,600\u00a0km) march. The tracks however suffered; the rubber flaked off and after a run of 600 miles (970\u00a0km) the tracks were unusable. Some units rode on tracks without the rubber pads, but the rubber tires of the rollers wore down faster. The introduction of radially grooved tires helped to cope with overheating when driving fast in the desert, but de-lamination of the tires still led to cracks in the rollers after 300 miles (480\u00a0km).\nThe M4A2 performed very well in hot climates in general. The British sent as many of these as possible to the Mediterranean theater, retaining a minimum of vehicles for training in the UK. Complaints began to come in about carbon fouling of the injectors due to oil getting into the combustion chamber.\nOther mechanical problems were rare and were most common in the left engine. Shermans suffered from wear to tire trackpads which were mitigated by changing to all-metal tracks and ventilated rollers. The tanks proved to be very reliable with proper operation. In June 1943, it was noted that the average service life was estimated at 1,500 miles (2,400\u00a0km). The M4A2 was rated \"very high\", while the M4A1 was rated \"high\".\nThe Soviet 6th Guards Tank Army determined the lifespan of their M4A2 Shermans to be or 250\u2013300 hours, comparable to the T-34.\nM4A3.\nThe Ford V-8 engined M4A3s took part in the 1943 'survival' race. On average, the engines worked for 255 hours, though one failed after 87 hours of running. Three tanks were taken out of the test at 187, 247, and 295 operating hours due to reasons unrelated to the engine. The report noted that even disqualified motors could be returned to service by replacing only one part: the rest were still in excellent condition. Of all the Ford engines, it turned out to be the most service friendly. The M4A3 tanks covered a greater distance than other Shermans: ten vehicles covered 20,346 miles (32,743\u00a0km) in total (half on-the-road, half off-road) over 2,388 hours - an impressive achievement.\nThe M4A3 continued to lead to reliability through further testing. On tests in the winter and spring of 1944, one tank covered in 203 hours and 25 minutes. An M4 failed after only 15 hours and 10 minutes and was replaced by another. The M4A1 lasted 27 hours 15 minutes, and the M4A4 covered 1,343 miles (2,161\u00a0km) in 149 hours and 35 minutes.\nAround the same time, another reliability test began, albeit on a smaller scale of 20 Shermans of various types including four M4A3. The time spent on repairs was carefully measured: on average, the M4A3 took 110 hours to service the engine, which was better than the M4A1 (132 hours) or M4A2 (143 hours), but more than double the average of 45 hours on maintenance of the Chrysler multibank by M4A4 crews. M4A3 remained superior in transmission time: 112 hours versus 340 hours for the M4A4. In terms of suspension, the tanks turned out to be approximately equal. None of the tanks with Ford engines passed the entire route: they dropped out after 293, 302, 347, and 350 hours of running. Only three Chrysler engines and one General Motors diesel engine coped with the task.\nAlthough M4A3s were not in service with other armies, some were supplied to the Allies for review. In early January 1943, a new M4A3 was provided to the British Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment. By 16 January, it began trials. The engine failed after 495 miles (800\u00a0km). A new engine was delivered by the end of February. This gave more power and better performance and despite multiple problems, the tank achieved 2,000 miles (3,220\u00a0km). The British considered the M4A3 a very reliable tank but far from perfect. An upgraded vehicle was tested in the spring of 1944; it covered over 3,000 miles (4,863\u00a0km) through several defects accumulated over the course of the run. The M4A3 was considered an outstanding vehicle for its reliability.\nM4A4.\nIn October 1942, five M3A4s and five M4A4s were tested in the California desert, which was a monstrous test for vehicles with an unsatisfactory cooling system. Constant breakdowns of auxiliary engine units put an end to the tank's combat career in the US Army. By the spring of 1943, the recommendations given by the Armored Council had been implemented, and 10 M4A4 tanks had been driven to a 4,000-miles (6,440\u00a0km) range. The average service life of the A57 engine reached 240 hours. M4A4 tanks took second place in reliability after the M4A3 with a Ford GAA engine (255 hours), ahead of diesel M4A2 (225 hours) and M4A1 radial (218 hours). The M4A4 was the easiest to maintain.\nAdditional tests of four M4A4s from 8 October 1943, to 14 February 1944, showed even better results: one engine broke down after 339 hours, three others worked 400 hours with less than 10% power loss. 3 out of 4 M4A4 could finish the Armored Council test and drive for 4,000-miles (6,440\u00a0km).\nDespite the positive outcomes of additional testing, oil and fuel consumption was still too high for the engine to be recommended for service in the American army. Production of the M4A4 was discontinued on 10 October 1943, and it was declared obsolete in 1945.\nEngine.\nThe M4 Sherman used four different engines, each of a very different type. Diesel M4A2s had a significant superiority over the R975 gasoline engines. The first M4A3 tank with a Ford GAA V8 gasoline engine, surpassing the R975 in all aspects, was assembled in May 1942, and even the M4A4 had a more reliable engine.\nThe R975 engine began to lose relevance once the vehicle was put into service. The R975 was initially powered by high-octane aviation gasoline. With the entry of the United States into the war, it was necessary to change to a lower grade fuel. To maintain performance, the maximum octane number of fuel for the new engine was limited to 80. In April 1942, an engine with a compression ratio of 5.7 was tested, which was considered acceptable. The nominal revs increased from 1200 to 1800 per minute. The new engine used a richer fuel mixture and had a larger combustion chamber.\nEngines were compared in large-scale tests at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in the winter of 1943\u20131944 with four examples each of M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, and M4A4. The endpoint was 4,000 miles or 400 hours run time. Faults with anything except the motor were repaired and testing resumed; only critical damage or loss of a third of its original power took the engine out of the competition.\nDuring the tests, it took 132 hours to service the R-975 in the M4A1, 143 hours for the GM diesel M4A2, 110 hours for the Ford GAA M4A3, and 45 hours for the multibank M4A4. None of the R975 engines reached the 200 hours mark, failing on average after 166 hours. It was noted that a lot of time was spent on servicing the air filters for the R-975; over 23 days of testing, 446 man-hours were spent on cleaning and repairing them.\nAn M4 with the R975-C1 engine was tested a year later over a 5,000-mile (8,050\u00a0km) test in which the engine had to be replaced three times. In addition, there were transmission and suspension problems. The filters performed poorly: it was noted that sand and dust severely spoil the engine and other units.\nWork to improve the reliability of the R975 engine led to quite significant changes, resulting in the R975-C4. Engine power increased from , and fuel consumption decreased by 10%. The engine torque went from 1800 Nm at 1900 pm to 2040 Nm. Older engines were upgraded to the later model during a major overhaul.\nThe new engine was approved for production on 17 June 1943, with 200 units ordered for the gun motor carriage T70 tank destroyer. In October 1943 the British demanded that it be provided for their Shermans. Tests in February 1944 on the M4A1 tank that as well as increased power: oil consumption dropped by 35% and cylinder temperature by 50\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe speed increased: the M4A1 with the new engine covered 1.5 miles (2.4\u00a0km) of paved track in 4 minutes and 45 seconds \u2013 47 seconds faster than the tank with the R975-C1 engine. Tests have also shown increased reliability. The three new R975-C4s installed on the M4A1 were withdrawn from testing after 177, 219, and 231 hours, respectively, and the R975-C1, upgraded to the C4 standard, worked 222 hours on the M4 tank. Compared to its predecessor, the service life of the engines has increased, albeit only slightly.\nIn 1943, the Americans conducted large-scale trials of all types of Shermans. In total, 40 tanks were admitted to them: 10 each M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, and M4A4. The target was 400 hours or 4000 miles before the engine failed. The rest of the tank units could be repaired an unlimited number of times.\nBy 23 April 1943, ten M4A2 had covered a total of 16,215 miles (8229 miles on-road and 7,986 miles off-road), operating for 1,825 hours. Fuel consumption of the M4A2 was lower than that of other Shermans: 1.1 mpg (214 liters per 100\u00a0km) on the highway, and 0.5 miles per gallon (470 liters per 100\u00a0km) on off-road. On average, tanks consumed 0.81 quarts (0.76 liters) of oil per engine hour. The tests ended on 11 May. By that time, the M4A2 had covered 22,126 miles, running 2,424 hours. The average speed of the M4A2 was the fastest at . The M4A1 and M4A4 both made , while the M4A3 made .\nIn terms of reliability, the M4A2 was in third place. The first engine failed after 75 hours of operation. Two engines worked all 400 hours, while one was in good condition, and the other was on its last legs. On average, the engines worked for 225 hours before the breakdown of the internal units. Only the R-975 engines showed themselves worse than the GM 6\u201371 (average service life of 218 hours). Ford GAA (255 hours) and Chrysler A57 (240 hours) proved to be more reliable. In terms of time spent on maintenance, the M4A2 came in second.\nThe tanks continued to race for survival. At the end of 1943, 20 vehicles entered trials at once: four M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, and new M4E1 with an experimental engine. The Shermans drove on three types of surfaces: fine loose sand, clayey stony ground, and highways. As in previous tests, during the run, the repairmen could change any units, and only the breakdown of internal components and engine parts disqualified the tank.\nBy 27 December, all M4A1s (average mileage of 166 hours) and one M4A3 were out of order, but not a single tank with a diesel engine. By 18 February, tests for the M4A2 ended. Three tanks failed after 276, 278, and 353 hours, respectively, while one covered 4295 miles in 403 hours and was still on the move. From M4A3, one tank also remained on the move, but with a rather modest mileage, since it had been under repair for a long time. Of the four M4A4s, one tank broke down, and the M4E1 was removed from testing \u2013 it was decided that the RD1820 engine would not go into a large series anyway.\nBy 18 March, the tanks had finished testing. The M4A4 turned out to be the most reliable again: out of four tanks, three reached the finish line. The M4A4 engine also took the least time to service: 45 hours per tank. M4A2 was in second place, as the last M4A3 still broke down, and did not cover the required distance. However, the maintenance of the GM 6\u201371 engine took 143 hours \u2013 more than the M4A3 (110 hours) or M4A1 (132 hours). The M4A2 also did not shine in servicing the transmission group: it took 220 hours to take care of each tank (only the M4A4 with 340 hours did more). In terms of suspension service time, the tank was at the level of other \"Shermans\": 205 hours. A total of 327 hours of a run of the average diesel Sherman took 594.5 hours of mechanics' work.\nUS variants.\nVehicles that used the M4 chassis or hull derived from M4:\nForeign variants and use.\nThe Sherman was extensively supplied through Lend-Lease to Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and Free France. Britain received 17,181 in various models, mostly M4\u04102s and M4A4s (5,041 Sherman III and 7,167 V, respectively), of which over 2000 were re-equipped with a more powerful gun to become the Sherman Firefly. The Soviet Union was shipped 4,065 M4 (M4A2s: 1,990 with 75\u00a0mm- and 2,073 with 76\u00a0mm-armed versions, 2 M4A4s), or 4,102 M4 (2,007 with 75\u00a0mm- and 2,095 with 76\u00a0mm versions). \u0415nrolled 3,664. The Free French were the third largest recipient, being given 755 during 1943 and 1944. At least 57 (or 157) Shermans were also delivered to other U.S. allies.\nA similar vehicle was developed in Canada from January 1941, known as the Ram tank. Like the Sherman, this was based on the M3 Lee's chassis and powertrain upgraded to have a turret, although it used a new turret of Canadian design. One improvement was the use of all-steel 'CDP' (Canadian Dry Pin) tracks, which although an inch narrower than the early M4 steel and rubber pad tracks, were cheaper to produce and gave better traction. Suspension units and roadwheels remained the M3 vertical volute pattern, with the idler \"above\" the mounting bracket, rather than the M4 development with the idler moved behind the mounting bracket to give more room for suspension travel. The Ram had a distinctive turret with a bolted flat-faced mantlet and the UK 6-pounder gun, with the hull machine gunner housed in a rotating turret based on the M3 'Lee' cupola, rather than the simpler ball-mount that was becoming universal for tank hull guns. Production facilities for the Ram were constructed at the Montreal Locomotive Works, with the aid of Alco, but the large armor castings for turret and hull were supplied by General Steel Castings in the US. Greater Sherman production and availability meant that the Ram was never used in action as a gun tank, being either used for training or converted to Kangaroo armored personnel carriers.\nA later Canadian medium tank, produced in late 1943, was the Grizzly, an adaption of the Sherman M4A1. This differed only in details, such as the CDP tracks, British radio equipment, and the British 2\" smoke mortar in the turret roof. 188 were produced.\nAfter World War II, Shermans were supplied to some NATO armies; Shermans were used by the U.S. and allied forces in the Korean War.\nAfter World War II, quite a few Shermans also went to Israel. The Israeli Ordnance Corps, seeking an upgrade, up-gunned it using the 75mm CN-75-50 L/61.5 from the French AMX-13/75 light tank and the 105 mm Mod\u00e8le F1 from the French AMX-30 Main Battle Tank, designated the M-50 and M-51 respectively. These Super Shermans, as they were often called, were remarkable examples of how a long-obsolete design can be upgraded for front-line use. They saw combat in the 1967 Six-Day War, fighting Soviet World War II-era armor like the T-34-85, and also in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The M-50 and M-51 Super Shermans were eventually retired from Israel in 1980, and were replaced by the much more modern Merkava platform.\nParaguay retired three Shermans from the \"Regimiento Escolta Presidencial\" (REP, \"Presidential Escort Regiment\") in 2018, which marked the end of service of the final Sherman tanks in use anywhere in the world.\nFormer operators.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\nTanks of comparable role, performance and era.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
