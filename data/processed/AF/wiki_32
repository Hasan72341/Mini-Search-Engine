Taking place in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, the battle was the first naval action in which the opposing fleets neither sighted nor fired upon one another, attacking over the horizon from aircraft carriers instead. It was also the first military battle between aircraft carriers.\nTo strengthen their defensive position in the South Pacific, the Japanese decided to invade and occupy Port Moresby (in New Guinea) and Tulagi (in the southeastern Solomon Islands). The plan, Operation Mo, involved several major units of Japan's Combined Fleet. Two fleet carriers and a light carrier were assigned to provide air cover for the invasion forces, under the overall command of Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue. The U.S. learned of the Japanese plan through signals intelligence and sent two U.S. Navy carrier task forces and a joint Australian-American cruiser force to oppose the offensive, under the overall command of U.S. Admiral Frank J. Fletcher.\nOn 3\u20134 May, Japanese forces invaded and occupied Tulagi, although several supporting warships were sunk or damaged in a surprise attack by the U.S. carrier . Alerted to the presence of enemy aircraft carriers, the Japanese fleet carriers advanced towards the Coral Sea to locate and destroy the Allied naval forces. On the evening of 6 May, the two carrier fleets closed to within but did not detect each other in the darkness. The next day, both fleets launched airstrikes against what they thought were the enemy fleet carriers, but both sides actually attacked other targets. The U.S. sank the Japanese light carrier , and the Japanese sank the destroyer , and damaged the fleet oiler . On 8 May, both sides finally located and attacked the other's fleet carriers, leaving the Japanese fleet carrier damaged, the U.S. fleet carrier \"Yorktown\" damaged, and the so critically damaged it was later scuttled.\nBoth sides having suffered heavy aircraft losses and carriers sunk or damaged, the two forces disengaged and retired from the area. Because of the loss of carrier air cover, Inoue also recalled the Port Moresby invasion fleet. Although the battle was a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk, it has been described as a strategic victory for the Allies. The battle marked the first time since the start of the war that a major Japanese advance had been turned back. More important, the damage to \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and the aircraft losses of prevented both ships from participating in the Battle of Midway the following month.\nBackground.\nJapanese expansion.\nOn 8 December 1941 (7 December U.S. time), Japan declared war on the U.S. and the British Empire, after Japanese forces attacked Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong as well as the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor. In launching this war, Japanese leaders sought to neutralize the U.S. fleet, seize territory rich in natural resources, and obtain strategic military bases to defend their far-flung empire. In the words of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) Combined Fleet's \"Secret Order Number One\", dated 1 November 1941, the goals of the initial Japanese campaigns in the impending war were to \"[eject] British and American strength from the Netherlands Indies and the Philippines, [and] to establish a policy of autonomous self-sufficiency and economic independence.\"\nTo support these goals, during the first few months of 1942, besides Malaya, Japanese forces attacked and took control of the Philippines, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, Wake Island, New Britain, the Gilbert Islands and Guam, inflicting heavy losses on opposing Allied land, naval and air forces. Japan planned to use these conquered territories to establish a perimeter defense for its empire from which it expected to employ attritional tactics to defeat or exhaust any Allied counterattacks.\nShortly after the war began, Japan's Naval General Staff recommended an invasion of Northern Australia to prevent Australia from being used as a base to threaten Japan's perimeter defences in the South Pacific. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) rejected the recommendation, stating that it did not have the forces or shipping capacity available to conduct such an operation. At the same time, Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue, commander of the IJN's Fourth Fleet (also called the South Seas Force) which consisted of most of the naval units in the South Pacific area, advocated the occupation of Tulagi in the southeastern Solomon Islands and Port Moresby in New Guinea, which would put Northern Australia within range of Japanese land-based aircraft. Inoue believed the capture and control of these locations would provide greater security and defensive depth for the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. The navy's general staff and the IJA accepted Inoue's proposal and promoted further operations, using these locations as supporting bases, to seize New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa and thereby cut the supply and communication lines between Australia and the United States.\nIn April 1942, the army and navy developed a plan that was titled Operation \"MO\". The plan called for Port Moresby to be invaded from the sea and secured by 10 May. The plan also included the seizure of Tulagi on 2\u20133 May, where the navy would establish a seaplane base for potential air operations against Allied territories and forces in the South Pacific and to provide a base for reconnaissance aircraft. Upon the completion of \"MO\", the navy planned to initiate Operation RY, using ships released from \"MO\", to seize Nauru and Ocean Island for their phosphate deposits on 15 May. Further operations against Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia (Operation FS) were to be planned once \"MO\" and \"RY\" were completed. Because of a damaging air attack by Allied land- and carrier-based aircraft on Japanese naval forces invading the Lae-Salamaua area in New Guinea in March, Inoue requested Japan's Combined Fleet send carriers to provide air cover for \"MO\". Inoue was especially worried about Allied bombers stationed at air bases in Townsville and Cooktown, Australia, beyond the range of his own bombers, based at Rabaul and Lae.\nAdmiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Combined Fleet, was concurrently planning an operation for June that he hoped would lure the U.S. Navy's carriers, none of which had been damaged in the Pearl Harbor attack, into a decisive showdown in the central Pacific near Midway Atoll. In the meantime Yamamoto detached some of his large warships, including two fleet carriers, a light carrier, a cruiser division, and two destroyer divisions, to support \"MO\", and placed Inoue in charge of the naval portion of the operation.\nAllied response.\nUnknown to the Japanese, the U.S. Navy, led by the Communication Security Section of the Office of Naval Communications, had for several years enjoyed increasing success with penetrating Japanese communication ciphers and codes. By March 1942, the U.S. was able to decipher up to 15% of the IJN's \"Ro\" or \"Naval Codebook D\" code (called \"JN-25B\" by the U.S.), which was used by the IJN for about half of its communications. By the end of April, the U.S. was reading up to 85% of the signals broadcast in the \"Ro\" code.\nIn March 1942, the U.S. first noticed mention of the \"MO\" operation in intercepted messages. On 5 April, the U.S. intercepted an IJN message directing a carrier and other large warships to proceed to Inoue's area of operations. On 13 April, the British deciphered an IJN message informing Inoue that the Fifth Carrier Division, consisting of the fleet carriers and , was en route to his command from Formosa via the main IJN base at Truk. The British passed the message to the U.S., along with their conclusion that Port Moresby was the likely target of \"MO\".\nAdmiral Chester W. Nimitz, the new commander of U.S. forces in the Central Pacific, and his staff discussed the deciphered messages and agreed that the Japanese were likely initiating a major operation in the Southwest Pacific in early May with Port Moresby as the probable target. The Allies regarded Port Moresby as a key base for a planned counteroffensive, under General Douglas MacArthur, against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific area. Nimitz's staff also concluded that the Japanese operation might include carrier raids on Allied bases in Samoa and at Suva. Nimitz, after consultation with Admiral Ernest King, Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet, decided to contest the Japanese operation by sending all four of the Pacific Fleet's available aircraft carriers to the Coral Sea. By 27 April, further signals intelligence confirmed most of the details and targets of the \"MO\" and \"RY\" plans.\nOn 29 April, Nimitz issued orders that sent his four carriers and their supporting warships towards the Coral Sea. Task Force 17 (TF\u00a017), commanded by Rear Admiral Fletcher and consisting of the carrier , escorted by three cruisers and four destroyers and supported by a replenishment group of two oilers and two destroyers, was already in the South Pacific, having departed Tongatabu on 27 April en route to the Coral Sea. TF 11, commanded by Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch and consisting of the carrier with two cruisers and five destroyers, was between Fiji and New Caledonia. TF 16, commanded by Vice Admiral William F. Halsey and including the carriers and , had just returned to Pearl Harbor from the Doolittle Raid in the central Pacific. TF\u00a016 immediately departed but would not reach the South Pacific in time to participate in the battle. Nimitz placed Fletcher in command of Allied naval forces in the South Pacific area until Halsey arrived with TF\u00a016. Although the Coral Sea area was under MacArthur's command, Fletcher and Halsey were directed to continue to report to Nimitz while in the Coral Sea area, not to MacArthur.\nBased on un-encrypted intercepted radio traffic from TF\u00a016 as it returned to Pearl Harbor, the Japanese assumed that all but one of the U.S. Navy's carriers were in the central Pacific. The Japanese did not know the location of the remaining carrier, but did not expect a U.S. carrier response to \"MO\" until the operation was well under way.\nBattle.\nPrelude.\nDuring late April, the Japanese submarines and reconnoitered the area where landings were planned. The submarines investigated Rossel Island and the Deboyne Group anchorage in the Louisiade Archipelago, Jomard Channel, and the route to Port Moresby from the east. They did not sight any Allied ships in the area and returned to Rabaul on 23 and 24 April respectively.\nThe Japanese Port Moresby Invasion Force, commanded by Rear Admiral K\u014ds\u014d Abe, included 11 transport ships carrying about 5,000 soldiers from the IJA's South Seas Detachment plus about 500 troops from the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF). Escorting the transports was the Port Moresby Attack Force with one light cruiser and six relatively old and s under the command of Rear Admiral Sadamichi Kajioka. Abe's ships departed Rabaul for the trip to Port Moresby on 4 May and were joined by Kajioka's force the next day. The ships, proceeding at , planned to transit the Jomard Channel in the Louisiades to pass around the southern tip of New Guinea to arrive at Port Moresby by 10 May. The Allied garrison at Port Moresby numbered around 5,333 men, but only half of these were infantry and all were badly equipped and undertrained.\nThe Tulagi invasion force, commanded by Rear Admiral Kiyohide Shima, consisted of two minelayers, two older \"Mutsuki\"-class destroyers, five minesweepers, two subchasers and a transport ship carrying about 400 troops from the 3rd Kure SNLF. Supporting the Tulagi force was the covering group with the light carrier , the IJN's four / heavy cruisers, and one destroyer, commanded by Rear Admiral Aritomo Got\u014d. A separate cover force (sometimes referred to as the support group), commanded by Rear Admiral Kuninori Marumo and consisting of two light cruisers, the seaplane tender and three gunboats, joined the covering group in providing distant protection for the Tulagi invasion. Once Tulagi was secured on 3 or 4 May, the covering group and cover force were to reposition to help screen the Port Moresby invasion. Inoue directed the \"MO\" operation from the cruiser , with which he arrived at Rabaul from Truk on 4 May.\nGot\u014d's force left Truk on 28 April, cut through the Solomons between Bougainville and Choiseul and took station near New Georgia Island. Marumo's support group sortied from New Ireland on 29 April headed for Thousand Ships Bay, Santa Isabel Island, to establish a seaplane base on 2 May to support the Tulagi assault. Shima's invasion force departed Rabaul on 30 April.\nThe Carrier Strike Force, with the carriers \"Zuikaku\" and \"Sh\u014dkaku\", two heavy cruisers, and six destroyers, sortied from Truk on 1 May. The strike force was commanded by Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi (flag on cruiser ), with Rear Admiral Ch\u016bichi Hara, on \"Zuikaku\", in tactical command of the carrier air forces. The Carrier Strike Force was to proceed down the eastern side of the Solomon Islands and enter the Coral Sea south of Guadalcanal. Once in the Coral Sea, the carriers were to provide air cover for the invasion forces, eliminate Allied air power at Port Moresby, and intercept and destroy any Allied naval forces which entered the Coral Sea in response.\nEn route to the Coral Sea, Takagi's carriers were to deliver nine Zero fighter aircraft to Rabaul. Bad weather during two attempts to make the delivery on 2\u20133 May compelled the aircraft to return to the carriers, stationed from Rabaul, and one of the Zeros was forced to ditch in the sea. In order to try to keep to the \"MO\" timetable, Takagi was forced to abandon the delivery mission after the second attempt and direct his force towards the Solomon Islands to refuel.\nTo give advance warning of the approach of any Allied naval forces, the Japanese sent submarines , , and to form a scouting line in the ocean about southwest of Guadalcanal. Fletcher's forces had entered the Coral Sea area before the submarines took station, and the Japanese were therefore unaware of their presence. Another submarine, , which was sent to scout around Noum\u00e9a, was attacked by \"Yorktown\" aircraft on 2 May. The submarine took no damage and apparently did not realize that it had been attacked by carrier aircraft. \"Ro-33\" and \"Ro-34\" were also deployed in an attempt to blockade Port Moresby, arriving off the town on 5 May. Neither submarine engaged any ships during the battle.\nOn the morning of 1 May, TF\u00a017 and TF\u00a011 united about northwest of New Caledonia (). Fletcher immediately detached TF\u00a011 to refuel from the oiler , while TF\u00a017 refueled from . TF\u00a017 completed refueling the next day, but TF\u00a011 reported that they would not be finished fueling until 4 May. Fletcher elected to take TF\u00a017 northwest towards the Louisiades and ordered TF\u00a011 to meet TF 44, which was en route from Sydney and Noum\u00e9a, on 4 May once refueling was complete. TF\u00a044 was a joint Australia\u2013U.S. warship force under MacArthur's command, led by Australian Rear Admiral John Crace and made up of the cruisers , , and , along with three destroyers. Once it completed refueling TF\u00a011, \"Tippecanoe\" departed the Coral Sea to deliver its remaining fuel to Allied ships at Efate.\nTulagi.\nEarly on 3 May, Shima's force arrived off Tulagi and began disembarking the naval troops to occupy the island. Tulagi was undefended: the small garrison of Australian commandos and a Royal Australian Air Force reconnaissance unit evacuated just before Shima's arrival. The Japanese forces immediately began construction of a seaplane and communications base. Aircraft from \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" covered the landings until early afternoon, when Got\u014d's force turned towards Bougainville to refuel in preparation to support the landings at Port Moresby.\nAt 17:00 on 3 May, Fletcher was notified that the Japanese Tulagi invasion force had been sighted the day before, approaching the southern Solomons. Unknown to Fletcher, TF\u00a011 completed refueling that morning ahead of schedule and was only east of TF\u00a017, but was unable to communicate its status because of Fletcher's orders to maintain radio silence. TF\u00a017 changed course and proceeded at towards Guadalcanal to launch airstrikes against the Japanese forces at Tulagi the next morning.\nOn 4 May, from a position south of Guadalcanal (), a total of 60 aircraft from TF\u00a017 launched three consecutive strikes against Shima's forces off Tulagi. \"Yorktown\"'s aircraft surprised Shima's ships and sank the destroyer () and three of the minesweepers, damaged four other ships, and destroyed four seaplanes which were supporting the landings. The U.S. lost one torpedo bomber and two fighters in the strikes, but all of the aircrew were eventually rescued. After recovering its aircraft late in the evening of 4 May, TF\u00a017 retired towards the south. In spite of the damage suffered in the carrier strikes, the Japanese continued construction of the seaplane base and began flying reconnaissance missions from Tulagi by 6 May.\nTakagi's Carrier Striking Force was refueling north of Tulagi when it received word of Fletcher's strike on 4 May. Takagi terminated refueling, headed southeast, and sent scout planes to search east of the Solomons, believing that the U.S. carriers were in that area. Since no Allied ships were in that area, the search planes found nothing.\nAir searches and decisions.\nAt 08:16 on 5 May, TF\u00a017 rendezvoused with TF\u00a011 and TF\u00a044 at a predetermined point south of Guadalcanal (). At about the same time, four Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters from \"Yorktown\" intercepted a Kawanishi H6K reconnaissance flying boat from the Yokohama Air Group of the 25th Air Flotilla based at the Shortland Islands and shot it down from TF\u00a011. The aircraft failed to send a report before it crashed, but when it didn't return to base the Japanese correctly assumed that it had been shot down by carrier aircraft.\nA message from Pearl Harbor notified Fletcher that radio intelligence deduced the Japanese planned to land their troops at Port Moresby on 10 May and their fleet carriers would likely be operating close to the invasion convoy. Armed with this information, Fletcher directed TF\u00a017 to refuel from \"Neosho\". After the refueling was completed on 6 May, he planned to take his forces north towards the Louisiades and do battle on 7 May.\nIn the meantime, Takagi's carrier force steamed down the east side of the Solomons throughout the day on 5 May, turned west to pass south of San Cristobal (Makira), and entered the Coral Sea after transiting between Guadalcanal and Rennell Island in the early morning hours of 6 May. Takagi commenced refueling his ships west of Tulagi in preparation for the carrier battle he expected would take place the next day.\nOn 6 May, Fletcher absorbed TF\u00a011 and TF\u00a044 into TF\u00a017. Believing the Japanese carriers were still well to the north near Bougainville, Fletcher continued to refuel. Reconnaissance patrols conducted from the U.S. carriers throughout the day failed to locate any of the Japanese naval forces, because they were located just beyond scouting range.\nAt 10:00, a Kawanishi reconnaissance flying boat from Tulagi sighted TF\u00a017 and notified its headquarters. Takagi received the report at 10:50. At that time, Takagi's force was about north of Fletcher, near the maximum range for his carrier aircraft. Takagi, whose ships were still refueling, was not yet ready to engage in battle. He concluded, based on the sighting report, TF\u00a017 was heading south and increasing the range. Furthermore, Fletcher's ships were under a large, low-hanging overcast which Takagi and Hara felt would make it difficult for their aircraft to find the U.S. carriers. Takagi detached his two carriers with two destroyers under Hara's command to head towards TF\u00a017 at in order to be in position to attack at first light the next day while the rest of his ships completed refueling.\nU.S. B-17 bombers based in Australia and staging through Port Moresby attacked the approaching Port Moresby invasion forces, including Got\u014d's warships, several times during the day on 6 May without success. MacArthur's headquarters radioed Fletcher with reports of the attacks and the locations of the Japanese invasion forces. MacArthur's fliers' reports of seeing a carrier (\"Sh\u014dh\u014d\") about northwest of TF\u00a017 further convinced Fletcher fleet carriers were accompanying the invasion force.\nAt 18:00, TF\u00a017 completed fueling and Fletcher detached \"Neosho\" with a destroyer, , to take station further south at a prearranged rendezvous (). TF\u00a017 then turned to head northwest towards Rossel Island in the Louisiades. Unbeknownst to the two adversaries, their carriers were only away from each other by 20:00 that night. At 20:00 (), Hara reversed course to meet Takagi who completed refueling and was now heading in Hara's direction.\nLate on 6 May or early on 7 May, \"Kamikawa Maru\" set up a seaplane base in the Deboyne Islands in order to help provide air support for the invasion forces as they approached Port Moresby. The rest of Marumo's Cover Force then took station near the D'Entrecasteaux Islands to help screen Abe's oncoming convoy.\nCarrier battle, first day.\nMorning strikes.\nAt 06:25 on 7 May, TF\u00a017 was south of Rossel Island (). At this time, Fletcher sent Crace's cruiser force, now designated Task Group 17.3 (TG\u00a017.3), to block the Jomard Passage. Fletcher understood that Crace would be operating without air cover since TF\u00a017's carriers would be busy trying to locate and attack the Japanese carriers. Detaching Crace reduced the anti-aircraft defenses for Fletcher's carriers. Nevertheless, Fletcher decided the risk was necessary to ensure the Japanese invasion forces could not slip through to Port Moresby while he engaged the carriers.\nBelieving Takagi's carrier force was somewhere north of him, in the vicinity of the Louisiades, beginning at 06:19, Fletcher directed \"Yorktown\" to send 10 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers as scouts to search that area. Hara in turn believed Fletcher was south of him and advised Takagi to send the aircraft to search that area. Takagi, about east of Fletcher (), launched 12 Nakajima B5Ns at 06:00 to scout for TF\u00a017. Around the same time, Got\u014d's cruisers and launched four Kawanishi E7K2 Type 94 floatplanes to search southeast of the Louisiades. Augmenting their search were several floatplanes from Deboyne, four Kawanishi H6Ks from Tulagi, and three Mitsubishi G4M bombers from Rabaul. Each side readied the rest of its carrier attack aircraft to launch immediately once the enemy was located.\nAt 07:22 one of Takagi's carrier scouts, from \"Sh\u014dkaku\", reported U.S. ships bearing 182\u00b0 (just west of due south), from Takagi. At 07:45, the scout confirmed that it had located \"one carrier, one cruiser, and three destroyers\". Another \"Sh\u014dkaku\" scout aircraft quickly confirmed the sighting. The \"Sh\u014dkaku\" aircraft actually sighted and misidentified the oiler \"Neosho\" and destroyer \"Sims\", which had earlier been detailed away from the fleet to a southern rendezvous point. Believing that he had located the U.S. carriers, Hara, with Takagi's concurrence, immediately launched all of his available aircraft. A total of 78 aircraft\u201418 Zero fighters, 36 Aichi D3A dive bombers, and 24 torpedo aircraft\u2014began launching from \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" at 08:00 and were on their way by 08:15 towards the reported sighting. The strike force was under overall command of Lieutenant Commander Kakuichi Takahashi, while Lieutenant Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki led its torpedo bombers.\nAt 08:20, one of the \"Furutaka\" aircraft found Fletcher's carriers and immediately reported it to Inoue's headquarters at Rabaul, which passed the report on to Takagi. The sighting was confirmed by a \"Kinugasa\" floatplane at 08:30. Takagi and Hara, confused by the conflicting sighting reports they were receiving, decided to continue with the strike on the ships to their south, but turned their carriers towards the northwest to close the distance with \"Furutaka's\" reported contact. Takagi and Hara considered that the conflicting reports might mean that the U.S. carrier forces were operating in two separate groups.\nAt 08:15, a \"Yorktown\" SBD piloted by John L. Nielsen sighted Got\u014d's force screening the invasion convoy. Nielsen, making an error in his coded message, reported the sighting as \"two carriers and four heavy cruisers\" at , northwest of TF17. Fletcher concluded that the Japanese main carrier force was located and ordered the launch of all available carrier aircraft to attack. By 10:13, the U.S. strike of 93 aircraft\u201418 Grumman F4F Wildcats, 53 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, and 22 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers\u2014was on its way. At 10:19, Nielsen landed and discovered his coding error. Although Got\u014d's force included the light carrier \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\", Nielsen thought that he saw two cruisers and four destroyers and thus the main fleet. At 10:12, Fletcher received a report of an aircraft carrier, ten transports, and 16 warships south of Nielsen's sighting at . The B-17s actually saw the same thing as Nielsen: \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\", Got\u014d's cruisers, plus the Port Moresby Invasion Force. Believing that the B-17's sighting was the main Japanese carrier force (which was in fact well to the east), Fletcher directed the airborne strike force towards this target.\nAt 09:15, Takahashi's strike force reached its target area, sighted \"Neosho\" and \"Sims\", and searched in vain for the U.S. carriers for a couple of hours. Finally, at 10:51 \"Sh\u014dkaku\" scout aircrews realized they were mistaken in their identification of the oiler and destroyer as aircraft carriers. Takagi now realized the U.S. carriers were between him and the invasion convoy, placing the invasion forces in extreme danger. At 11:15, the torpedo bombers and fighters abandoned the mission and headed back towards the carriers with their ordnance, while the 36 dive bombers attacked the two U.S. ships.\nFour dive bombers attacked \"Sims\" and the rest dived on \"Neosho\". The destroyer was hit by three bombs, broke in half, and sank immediately, killing all but 14 of her 192-man crew. \"Neosho\" was hit by seven bombs. One of the dive bombers, hit by anti-aircraft fire, crashed into the oiler. Heavily damaged and without power, \"Neosho\" was left drifting and slowly sinking (). Before losing power, \"Neosho\" was able to notify Fletcher by radio that she was under attack and in trouble, but garbled any further details as to just who or what was attacking her and gave wrong coordinates () for her position.\nThe U.S. strike aircraft sighted \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" a short distance northeast of Misima Island at 10:40 and deployed to attack. The Japanese carrier was protected by four Zeros and two Mitsubishi A5M fighters flying combat air patrol (CAP), as the rest of the carrier's aircraft were being prepared below decks for a strike against the U.S. carriers. Got\u014d's cruisers surrounded the carrier in a diamond formation, off each of \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\"'s corners.\nAttacking first, \"Lexington\"'s air group, led by Commander William B. Ault, hit \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" with two bombs and five torpedoes, causing severe damage. At 11:00, \"Yorktown\"'s air group attacked the burning and now almost stationary carrier, scoring with up to 11 more bombs and at least two torpedoes. Torn apart, \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" sank at 11:35 (). Fearing more air attacks, Got\u014d withdrew his warships to the north, but sent the destroyer back at 14:00 to rescue survivors. Only 203 of the carrier's 834-man crew were recovered. Three U.S. aircraft were lost in the attack: two SBDs from \"Lexington\" and one from \"Yorktown\". All of \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\"'s aircraft complement of 18 was lost, but three of the CAP fighter pilots were able to ditch at Deboyne and survived. At 12:10, using a prearranged message to signal TF\u00a017 on the success of the mission, \"Lexington\" SBD pilot and squadron commander Robert E. Dixon radioed \"Scratch one flat top! Signed Bob.\"\nAfternoon operations.\nThe U.S. aircraft returned and landed on their carriers by 13:38. By 14:20, the aircraft were rearmed and ready to launch against the Port Moresby Invasion Force or Got\u014d's cruisers. Fletcher was concerned that the locations of the rest of the Japanese fleet carriers were still unknown. He was informed that Allied intelligence sources believed that up to four Japanese carriers might be supporting the \"MO\" operation. Fletcher concluded that by the time his scout aircraft found the remaining carriers it would be too late in the day to mount a strike. Thus, Fletcher decided to hold off on another strike this day and remain concealed under the thick overcast with fighters ready in defense. Fletcher turned TF\u00a017 southwest.\nApprised of the loss of \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\", Inoue ordered the invasion convoy to temporarily withdraw to the north and ordered Takagi, at this time located east of TF\u00a017, to destroy the U.S. carrier forces. As the invasion convoy reversed course, it was bombed by eight U.S. Army B-17s, but was not damaged. Got\u014d and Kajioka were told to assemble their ships south of Rossel Island for a night surface battle if the U.S. ships came within range.\nAt 12:40, a Deboyne-based seaplane sighted and reported Crace's detached cruiser and destroyer force on a bearing of 175\u00b0, from Deboyne. At 13:15, an aircraft from Rabaul sighted Crace's force but submitted an erroneous report, stating the force contained two carriers and was located, bearing 205\u00b0, from Deboyne. Based on these reports, Takagi, who was still awaiting the return of all of his aircraft from attacking \"Neosho\", turned his carriers due west at 13:30 and advised Inoue at 15:00 that the U.S. carriers were at least west of his location and that he would therefore be unable to attack them that day.\nInoue's staff directed two groups of attack aircraft from Rabaul, already airborne since that morning, towards Crace's reported position. The first group included 12 torpedo-armed G4M bombers and the second group comprised 19 Mitsubishi G3M land attack aircraft armed with bombs. Both groups found and attacked Crace's ships at 14:30 and claimed to have sunk a \"-type\" battleship and damaged another battleship and cruiser. In reality, Crace's ships were lightly damaged and shot down four G4Ms. A short time later, three U.S. Army B-17s mistakenly bombed Crace, but caused no damage. At the conclusion of the attack, the detachment of cruisers suffered several wounded and a few men killed aboard the \"Chicago\".\nCrace at 15:26 radioed Fletcher he could not complete his mission without air support. Crace retired southward to a position about southeast of Port Moresby to increase the range from Japanese carrier- or land-based aircraft while remaining close enough to intercept any Japanese naval forces advancing beyond the Louisiades through either the Jomard Passage or the China Strait. Crace's ships were low on fuel, and as Fletcher was maintaining radio silence (and had not informed him in advance), Crace had no idea of Fletcher's location, status, or intentions.\nShortly after 15:00, \"Zuikaku\" monitored a message from a Deboyne-based reconnaissance aircraft reporting (incorrectly) that Crace's force had altered course to 120\u00b0 true (southeast). Takagi's staff assumed the aircraft was shadowing Fletcher's carriers and determined if the Allied ships held that course, they would be within striking range shortly before nightfall. Takagi and Hara were determined to attack immediately with a select group of aircraft, minus fighter escort, even though it meant the strike would return after dark.\nTo try to confirm the location of the U.S. carriers, at 15:15 Hara sent a flight of eight torpedo bombers as scouts to sweep westward. About that same time, the dive bombers that had attacked \"Neosho\" returned and landed. Six of the weary dive bomber pilots were told they would be immediately departing on another mission. Choosing his most experienced crews, including Takahashi, Shimazaki and Lieutenant Tamotsu Ema, at 16:15 Hara launched 12 dive bombers and 15 torpedo planes with orders to fly on a heading of 277\u00b0 to . The eight scout aircraft reached the end of their search leg and turned back without seeing Fletcher's ships.\nAt 17:47, TF\u00a017 \u2013 operating under thick overcast west of Takagi \u2013 detected the Japanese strike on radar heading in their direction, turned southeast into the wind, and vectored 11 CAP Wildcats, led by Lieutenant Commanders Paul H. Ramsey and James H. Flatley, to intercept. Taking the Japanese formation by surprise, the Wildcats shot down seven torpedo bombers and one dive bomber, and heavily damaged another torpedo bomber (which later crashed), at a cost of three Wildcats lost.\nHaving taken heavy losses in the attack, which also scattered their formations, the Japanese strike leaders canceled the mission after conferring by radio. The Japanese aircraft all jettisoned their ordnance and reversed course to return to their carriers. The sun set at 18:30. Several of the Japanese dive bombers encountered the U.S. carriers in the darkness, around 19:00, and briefly confused as to their identity, circled in preparation for landing before anti-aircraft fire from TF\u00a017's destroyers drove them away. By 20:00, TF\u00a017 and Takagi were about apart. Takagi turned on his warships' searchlights to help guide the 18 surviving aircraft back and all were recovered by 22:00.\nIn the meantime, at 15:18 and 17:18 \"Neosho\" was able to radio TF\u00a017 she was drifting northwest in dire straits. \"Neosho\"'s 17:18 report gave wrong coordinates, which hampered subsequent U.S. rescue efforts to locate the oiler. More significantly, the news informed Fletcher his only nearby available fuel supply was gone.\nAs nightfall ended aircraft operations for the day, Fletcher ordered TF\u00a017 to head west and prepared to launch a 360\u00b0 search at first light. Crace also turned west to stay within striking range of the Louisiades. Inoue directed Takagi to make sure he destroyed the U.S. carriers the next day, and postponed the Port Moresby landings to 12\u00a0May. Takagi elected to take his carriers north during the night so he could concentrate his morning search to the west and south and ensure that his carriers could provide better protection for the invasion convoy. Got\u014d and Kajioka were unable to position and coordinate their ships in time to attempt a night attack on the Allied warships.\nBoth sides expected to find each other early the next day, and spent the night preparing their strike aircraft for the anticipated battle as their exhausted aircrews attempted to get a few hours' sleep. In 1972, U.S. Vice Admiral H. S. Duckworth, after reading Japanese records of the battle, commented, \"Without a doubt, May\u00a07, 1942, vicinity of Coral Sea, was the most confused battle area in world history.\" Hara later told Yamamoto's chief of staff, Admiral Matome Ugaki, he was so frustrated with the \"poor luck\" the Japanese experienced on 7 May that he felt like quitting the navy.\nCarrier battle, second day.\nAttack on the Japanese carriers.\nAt 06:15 on 8 May, from a position east of Rossel Island (), Hara launched seven torpedo bombers to search the area bearing 140\u2013230\u00b0, out to from the Japanese carriers. Assisting in the search were three Kawanishi H6Ks from Tulagi and four G4M bombers from Rabaul. At 07:00, the carrier striking force turned to the southwest and was joined by two of Got\u014d's cruisers, \"Kinugasa\" and \"Furutaka\", for additional screening support. The invasion convoy, Got\u014d, and Kajioka steered towards a rendezvous point east of Woodlark Island to await the outcome of the carrier battle. During the night, the warm frontal zone with low clouds which had helped hide the U.S. carriers on 7 May moved north and east and now covered the Japanese carriers, limiting visibility to between .\nAt 06:35, TF\u00a017 \u2013 operating under Fitch's tactical control and positioned southeast of the Louisiades, launched 18 SBDs to conduct a 360\u00b0 search out to . The skies over the U.S. carriers were mostly clear, with visibility.\nAt 08:20, a \"Lexington\" SBD piloted by Joseph G. Smith spotted the Japanese carriers through a hole in the clouds and notified TF\u00a017. Two minutes later, a \"Sh\u014dkaku\" search plane commanded by Kenz\u014d Kanno sighted TF\u00a017 and notified Hara. The two forces were about apart. Both sides raced to launch their strike aircraft.\nAt 09:15, the Japanese carriers launched a combined strike of 18 fighters, 33 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo planes, commanded by Takahashi, with Shimazaki again leading the torpedo bombers. The U.S. carriers each launched a separate strike. \"Yorktown\"'s group consisted of 6 fighters, 24 dive bombers, and 9 torpedo planes and was on its way by 09:15. \"Lexington\"'s group of 9 fighters, 15 dive bombers, and 12 torpedo planes was off at 09:25. Both the U.S. and Japanese carrier warship forces turned to head directly for each other's location at high speed in order to shorten the distance their aircraft would have to fly on their return legs.\n\"Yorktown\"'s dive bombers, led by William O. Burch, reached the Japanese carriers at 10:32, and paused to allow the slower torpedo squadron to arrive so that they could conduct a simultaneous attack. At this time, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" were about apart, with \"Zuikaku\" hidden under a rain squall of low-hanging clouds. The two carriers were protected by 16 CAP Zero fighters. The \"Yorktown\" dive bombers commenced their attacks at 10:57 on \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and hit the radically maneuvering carrier with two bombs, tearing open the forecastle and causing heavy damage to the carrier's flight and hangar decks. The \"Yorktown\" torpedo planes missed with all of their ordnance. Two U.S. dive bombers and two CAP Zeros were shot down during the attack.\n\"Lexington\"'s aircraft arrived and attacked at 11:30. Two dive bombers attacked \"Sh\u014dkaku\", hitting the carrier with one bomb, causing further damage. Two other dive bombers dove on \"Zuikaku\", missing with their bombs. The rest of \"Lexington\"'s dive bombers were unable to find the Japanese carriers in the heavy clouds. \"Lexington\"'s TBDs missed \"Sh\u014dkaku\" with all 11 of their torpedoes. The 13 CAP Zeros on patrol at this time shot down 3 Wildcats.\nWith her flight deck heavily damaged and 223 of her crew killed or wounded, having also suffered explosions in her gasoline storage tanks and an engine repair workshop destroyed, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was unable to conduct further aircraft operations. Her captain, Takatsugu J\u014djima, requested permission from Takagi and Hara to withdraw from the battle, to which Takagi agreed. At 12:10, \"Sh\u014dkaku\", accompanied by two destroyers, retired to the northeast.\nAttack on the U.S. carriers.\nAt 10:55, \"Lexington\"'s CXAM-1 radar detected the inbound Japanese aircraft at a range of and vectored nine Wildcats to intercept. Expecting the Japanese torpedo bombers to be at a much lower altitude than they actually were, six of the Wildcats were stationed too low, and thus missed the Japanese aircraft as they passed by overhead. Because of the heavy losses in aircraft suffered the night before, the Japanese could not execute a full torpedo attack on both carriers. Lieutenant Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki, commanding the Japanese torpedo planes, sent 14 to attack \"Lexington\" and 4 to attack \"Yorktown\". A Wildcat shot down one and patrolling SBDs (8 from \"Yorktown\", 15 from \"Lexington\") destroyed 3 more as the Japanese torpedo planes descended to take attack position. In return, escorting Zeros shot down 4 \"Yorktown\" SBDs. One of the survivors, Swede Vejtasa, claimed 3 Zeros during the onslaught (though none were lost).\nThe Japanese attack began at 11:13 as the carriers, stationed apart, and their escorts opened fire with anti-aircraft guns. The four torpedo planes which attacked \"Yorktown\" all missed. The remaining torpedo planes successfully employed a pincer attack on \"Lexington\", which had a much larger turning radius than \"Yorktown\", and, at 11:20, hit her with two Type 91 torpedoes. The first torpedo buckled the port aviation gasoline stowage tanks. Undetected, gasoline vapors spread into surrounding compartments. The second torpedo ruptured the port water main, reducing water pressure to the three forward firerooms and forcing the associated boilers to be shut down. The ship could still make with her remaining boilers. Four of the Japanese torpedo planes were shot down by anti-aircraft fire.\nThe 33 Japanese dive bombers circled to attack from upwind, and thus did not begin their dives from until three to four minutes after the torpedo planes began their attacks. The 19 \"Sh\u014dkaku\" dive bombers, under Takahashi, lined up on \"Lexington\" while the remaining 14, directed by Tamotsu Ema, targeted \"Yorktown\". Escorting Zeros shielded Takahashi's aircraft from four \"Lexington\" CAP Wildcats which attempted to intervene, but two Wildcats circling above \"Yorktown\" were able to disrupt Ema's formation. Takahashi's bombers damaged \"Lexington\" with two bomb hits and several near misses, causing fires which were contained by 12:33. At 11:27, \"Yorktown\" was hit in the centre of her flight deck by a single , semi-armour-piercing bomb which penetrated four decks before exploding, causing severe structural damage to an aviation storage room and killing or seriously wounding 66 men, as well as damaging the superheater boilers which rendered them inoperable. Up to 12 near misses damaged \"Yorktown\"'s hull below the waterline. Two of the dive bombers were shot down by a CAP Wildcat during the attack.\nAs the Japanese aircraft completed their attacks and began to withdraw, believing that they had inflicted fatal damage to both carriers, they ran a gauntlet of CAP Wildcats and SBDs. In the ensuing aerial duels, three SBDs and three Wildcats for the U.S., and three torpedo bombers, one dive bomber, and one Zero for the Japanese were downed. By 12:00, the U.S. and Japanese strike groups were on their way back to their respective carriers. During their return, aircraft from the two adversaries passed each other in the air, resulting in more air-to-air altercations. Kanno's and Takahashi's aircraft were shot down, killing both of them. Two future U.S. destroyers were named after naval pilots lost in this confrontation: the USS \"Rinehart\" and USS \"Mason\".\nRecovery, reassessment and retreat.\nThe strike forces, with many damaged aircraft, reached and landed on their respective carriers between 12:50 and 14:30. In spite of damage, \"Yorktown\" and \"Lexington\" were able to recover aircraft from their returning air groups. During recovery operations, for various reasons the U.S. lost an additional five SBDs, two TBDs, and a Wildcat, and the Japanese lost two Zeros, five dive bombers, and one torpedo plane. Forty-six of the original sixty-nine aircraft from the Japanese strike force returned from the mission and landed on \"Zuikaku\". Of these, three more Zeros, four dive bombers and five torpedo planes were judged damaged beyond repair and were immediately jettisoned into the sea.\nAs TF\u00a017 recovered its aircraft, Fletcher assessed the situation. The returning aviators reported they heavily damaged one carrier, but that another had escaped damage. Fletcher noted that both his carriers were hurt and that his air groups had suffered high fighter losses. Fuel was also a concern due to the loss of \"Neosho\". At 14:22, Fitch notified Fletcher that he had reports of two undamaged Japanese carriers and that this was supported by radio intercepts. Believing that he faced overwhelming Japanese carrier superiority, Fletcher elected to withdraw TF\u00a017 from the battle. Fletcher radioed MacArthur the approximate position of the Japanese carriers and suggested that he attack with his land-based bombers.\nAround 14:30, Hara informed Takagi that only 24 Zeros, 8 dive bombers, and 4 torpedo planes from the carriers were currently operational. Takagi was worried about his ships' fuel levels; his cruisers were at 50% and some of his destroyers were as low as 20%. At 15:00, Takagi notified Inoue his fliers had sunk two U.S. carriers \u2013 \"Yorktown\" and a \"-class\" \u2013 but heavy losses in aircraft meant he could not continue to provide air cover for the invasion. Inoue, whose reconnaissance aircraft sighted Crace's ships earlier that day, recalled the invasion convoy to Rabaul, postponed \"MO\" to 3 July, and ordered his forces to assemble northeast of the Solomons to begin the \"RY\" operation. \"Zuikaku\" and her escorts turned towards Rabaul while \"Sh\u014dkaku\" headed for Japan.\nAboard \"Lexington\", damage control parties put out the fires and restored her to operational condition, but at 12:47, sparks from unattended electric motors ignited gasoline fumes near the ship's central control station. The resulting explosion killed 25 men and started a large fire. Around 14:42, another large explosion occurred, starting a second severe fire. A third explosion occurred at 15:25 and at 15:38 the ship's crew reported the fires as uncontrollable. \"Lexington\"'s crew began abandoning ship at 17:07. After the carrier's survivors were rescued, including Admiral Fitch and the ship's captain, Frederick C. Sherman, at 19:15 the destroyer fired five torpedoes into the burning ship, which sank in 2,400\u00a0fathoms at 19:52 (). Two hundred and sixteen of the carrier's 2,951-man crew went down with the ship, along with 36 aircraft. \"Phelps\" and the other assisting warships left immediately to rejoin \"Yorktown\" and her escorts, which departed at 16:01, and TF\u00a017 retired to the southwest. Later that evening, MacArthur informed Fletcher that eight of his B-17s had attacked the invasion convoy and that it was retiring to the northwest.\nThat evening, Crace detached \"Hobart\", which was critically low on fuel, and the destroyer , which was having engine trouble, to proceed to Townsville. Crace overheard radio reports saying the enemy invasion convoy had turned back, but, unaware Fletcher had withdrawn, he remained on patrol with the rest of TG\u00a017.3 in the Coral Sea in case the Japanese invasion force resumed its advance towards Port Moresby.\nAftermath.\nOn 9 May, TF\u00a017 altered course to the east and proceeded out of the Coral Sea via a route south of New Caledonia. Nimitz ordered Fletcher to return \"Yorktown\" to Pearl Harbor as soon as possible after refueling at Tongatabu. During the day, U.S. Army bombers attacked Deboyne and \"Kamikawa Maru\", inflicting unknown damage. In the meantime, having heard nothing from Fletcher, Crace deduced that TF17 had departed the area. At 01:00 on 10 May, hearing no further reports of Japanese ships advancing towards Port Moresby, Crace turned towards Australia and arrived at Cid Harbor, south of Townsville, on 11 May.\nAt 22:00 on 8 May, Yamamoto ordered Inoue to turn his forces around, destroy the remaining Allied warships, and complete the invasion of Port Moresby. Inoue did not cancel the recall of the invasion convoy, but ordered Takagi and Got\u014d to pursue the remaining Allied warship forces in the Coral Sea. Critically low on fuel, Takagi's warships spent most of 9 May refueling from the fleet oiler \"T\u014dh\u014d Maru\". Late in the evening of 9 May, Takagi and Got\u014d headed southeast, then southwest into the Coral Sea. Seaplanes from Deboyne assisted Takagi in searching for TF\u00a017 on the morning of 10 May. Fletcher and Crace were already well on their way out of the area. At 13:00 on 10 May, Takagi concluded that the enemy was gone and decided to turn back towards Rabaul. Yamamoto concurred with Takagi's decision and ordered \"Zuikaku\" to return to Japan to replenish her air groups. At the same time, \"Kamikawa Maru\" packed up and departed Deboyne. At noon on 11 May, a U.S. Navy PBY on patrol from Noum\u00e9a sighted the drifting \"Neosho\" (). The U.S. destroyer responded and rescued 109 \"Neosho\" and 14 \"Sims\" survivors later that day, then scuttled the tanker with gunfire.\nOn 10 May, Operation RY commenced. After the operation's flagship, minelayer , was sunk by the U.S. submarine on 12 May (), the landings were postponed until 17 May. In the meantime, Halsey's TF\u00a016 reached the South Pacific near Efate and, on 13 May, headed north to contest the Japanese approach to Nauru and Ocean Island. On 14 May, Nimitz, having obtained intelligence concerning the Combined Fleet's upcoming operation against Midway, ordered Halsey to make sure that Japanese scout aircraft sighted his ships the next day, after which he was to return to Pearl Harbor immediately. At 10:15 on 15 May, a Kawanishi reconnaissance aircraft from Tulagi sighted TF\u00a016 east of the Solomons. Halsey's feint worked. Fearing a carrier air attack on his exposed invasion forces, Inoue immediately canceled \"RY\" and ordered his ships back to Rabaul and Truk. On 19 May, TF\u00a016 \u2013 which returned to the Efate area to refuel \u2013 turned towards Pearl Harbor and arrived there on 26 May. \"Yorktown\" reached Pearl the following day.\n\"Sh\u014dkaku\" reached Kure, Japan, on 17 May, almost capsizing en route during a storm due to her battle damage. \"Zuikaku\" arrived at Kure on 21 May, having made a brief stop at Truk on 15 May. Acting on signals intelligence, the U.S. placed eight submarines along the projected route of the carriers' return paths to Japan, but the submarines were not able to make any attacks. Japan's Naval General Staff estimated that it would take two to three months to repair \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and replenish the carriers' air groups. Thus, both carriers would be unable to participate in Yamamoto's upcoming Midway operation. The two carriers rejoined the Combined Fleet on 14 July and were key participants in subsequent carrier battles against U.S. forces. The five \"I\"-class submarines supporting the \"MO\" operation were retasked to support an attack on Sydney Harbour three weeks later as part of a campaign to disrupt Allied supply lines. En route to Truk the submarine \"I-28\" was torpedoed on 17 May by the U.S. submarine and sank with all hands.\nSignificance.\nThe public on both sides were informed of victory with overstatement of enemy losses and understatement of their own\u2014the Americans claimed to have sunk between 18 and 37 ships. In terms of actual ships lost, the Japanese won a tactical victory by sinking the U.S. fleet carrier \"Lexington\", an oiler, and a destroyer\u2014\u2014versus a light carrier, a destroyer, and several smaller warships\u2014\u2014sunk by the U.S. side. \"Lexington\" represented, at that time, 25% of U.S. carrier strength in the Pacific.\nFrom a strategic perspective, however, the battle was an Allied victory as it averted the seaborne invasion of Port Moresby, lessening the threat to the supply lines between the U.S. and Australia. Although the withdrawal of \"Yorktown\" from the Coral Sea conceded the field, the Japanese were forced to abandon the operation that had initiated the Battle of the Coral Sea in the first place.\nThe battle marked the first time that a Japanese invasion force was turned back without achieving its objective, which greatly lifted the morale of the Allies after a series of defeats by the Japanese during the initial six months of the Pacific Theatre. Port Moresby was vital to Allied strategy and its garrison could well have been overwhelmed by the experienced Japanese invasion troops. The U.S. Navy also exaggerated the damage it inflicted, which later caused the press to treat its reports of Midway with more caution.\nThe results of the battle had a substantial effect on the strategic planning of both sides. Without a hold in New Guinea, the subsequent Allied advance, arduous as it was, would have been even more difficult. For the Japanese, who focused on the tactical results, the battle was seen as merely a temporary setback. The results of the battle confirmed the low opinion held by the Japanese of U.S. fighting capability and supported their overconfident belief that future carrier operations against the U.S. were assured of success.\nForces available for Midway.\nOne of the most significant effects of the Coral Sea battle was the temporary loss of \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" to Yamamoto's planned battle against the U.S. carriers at Midway. (\"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" was to have been employed at Midway in a tactical role supporting the Japanese invasion ground forces.) Although \"Zuikaku\" was undamaged, she had lost a large number of aircraft in the battle, and the Japanese apparently did not even consider trying to include \"Zuikaku\" in the forthcoming operation. No effort appears to have been made to combine the surviving \"Sh\u014dkaku\" aircrews with \"Zuikaku\"'s air groups or to quickly provide \"Zuikaku\" with replacement aircraft. \"Sh\u014dkaku\" herself was unable to conduct further aircraft operations, with her flight deck heavily damaged, and she required almost three months of repair in Japan.\nThe Japanese believed that they sank two carriers in the Coral Sea, but this still left at least two more U.S. Navy carriers, \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\", to help defend Midway. In fact, \"Yorktown\" had only been damaged, but she had also lost a large number of planes in the battle. Unlike the Japanese, the U.S. Navy put forth a maximum effort to make \"Yorktown\" available for the coming battle. Although the damage was estimated to take 90 days to repair, Nimitz gave the shipyard only three days, and only the most critical repairs were made to make the ship seaworthy. \"Yorktown\" left Pearl Harbor with three of her boilers inoperative and a maximum speed of 27 knots. Unlike the Japanese, the U.S. Navy was willing to put one aircraft carrier's air group on another ship. To make up aircraft losses from the Coral Sea, three of the four \"Yorktown\" squadrons were sent ashore and replaced by squadrons from \"Saratoga\", which had been sent to the West Coast for repairs after being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. \"Yorktown\" would go into battle with her own scouting squadron, but \"Saratoga\"'s torpedo bomber, dive bomber, and fighter squadrons.\nThe U.S. aircraft carriers had slightly larger aircraft complements than the Japanese carriers, which, when combined with the land-based aircraft at Midway, the availability of \"Yorktown\", and the loss of two Japanese carriers, meant that the Japanese Navy and the U.S. Navy would have near parity in aircraft for the impending battle. At Midway, aircraft flying from \"Yorktown\" played crucial roles in the American victory. \"Yorktown\"'s planes sank the , located , and helped \"Enterprise\" planes sink \"Hiry\u016b\". \"Yorktown\" also absorbed both Japanese aerial counterattacks at Midway which otherwise would have been directed at \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\".\nHistorians H. P. Willmott, Jonathan Parshall, and Anthony Tully believe Yamamoto made a significant strategic error in his decision to support \"Operation MO\" with strategic assets. Since Yamamoto had decided the decisive battle with the U.S. was to take place at Midway, he should not have diverted any of his important assets, especially fleet carriers, to a secondary operation like \"MO\". Yamamoto's decision meant Japanese naval forces were weakened just enough at both the Coral Sea and Midway battles to allow the Allies to defeat them in detail. Willmott adds, if either operation was important enough to commit fleet carriers, then all of the Japanese carriers should have been committed to each in order to ensure success. By committing crucial assets to \"MO\", Yamamoto made the more important Midway operation dependent on the secondary operation's success.\nYamamoto apparently missed two major implications of the Coral Sea battle. The unexpected appearance of U.S. carriers in exactly the right place and time, might have led him to believe the US had cracked IJN codes with cryptanalysis. He also failed to appreciate the U.S. Navy carrier aircrews demonstrating sufficient skill and determination to do significant damage to the Japanese carrier forces. Both would be repeated at Midway, where Japan lost four fleet carriers, the core of her naval offensive forces, and thereby lost the strategic initiative in the Pacific War. Parshall and Tully point out that, due to U.S. industrial strength, once Japan lost its numerical superiority in carrier forces as a result of Midway, Japan could never regain it, adding \"The Battle of the Coral Sea had provided the first hints that the Japanese high-water mark had been reached, but it was the Battle of Midway that put up the sign for all to see.\"\nSituation in the South Pacific.\nThe Australians and U.S. forces in Australia were initially disappointed with the outcome of the Battle of the Coral Sea, fearing the \"MO\" operation was the precursor to an invasion of the Australian mainland and the setback to Japan was only temporary. In a meeting held in late May, the Australian Advisory War Council described the battle's result as \"rather disappointing\" given that the Allies had advance notice of Japanese intentions. General MacArthur provided Australian Prime Minister John Curtin with his assessment of the battle, stating that \"all the elements that have produced disaster in the Western Pacific since the beginning of the war\" were still present as Japanese forces could strike anywhere if supported by major elements of the IJN.\nBecause of the severe losses in carriers at Midway, the Japanese were unable to support another attempt to invade Port Moresby from the sea, forcing Japan to try to take Port Moresby by land. Japan began its land offensive towards Port Moresby along the Kokoda Track on 21 July from Buna and Gona. By then, the Allies had reinforced New Guinea with additional troops (primarily Australian) starting with the Australian 14th Brigade which embarked at Townsville on 15 May. The added forces slowed, then eventually halted the Japanese advance towards Port Moresby in September 1942, and defeated an attempt by the Japanese to overpower an Allied base at Milne Bay.\nIn the meantime, the Allies learned in July that the Japanese had begun building an airfield on Guadalcanal. Operating from this base the Japanese would threaten the shipping supply routes to Australia. To prevent this from occurring, the U.S. chose Tulagi and nearby Guadalcanal as the target of their first offensive. The failure of the Japanese to take Port Moresby, and their defeat at Midway, had the effect of dangling their base at Tulagi and Guadalcanal without effective protection from other Japanese bases. Tulagi and Guadalcanal were four hours flying time from Rabaul, the nearest large Japanese base.\nThree months later, on 7 August 1942, 11,000 United States Marines landed on Guadalcanal, and 3,000 U.S. Marines landed on Tulagi and nearby islands. The Japanese troops on Tulagi and nearby islands were outnumbered and killed almost to the last man in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu\u2013Tanambogo and the U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal captured an airfield under construction by the Japanese. Thus began the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands campaigns that resulted in a series of attritional, combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces over the next year which, in tandem with the New Guinea campaign, eventually neutralized Japanese defenses in the South Pacific, inflicted irreparable losses on the Japanese military\u2014especially its navy\u2014and contributed significantly to the Allies' eventual victory over Japan.\nThe delay in the advance of Japanese forces also allowed the Marine Corps to land on Funafuti on 2 October 1942, with a Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees) building airfields on three of the atolls of Tuvalu from which USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers of the Seventh Air Force operated. The atolls of Tuvalu acted as a staging post during the preparation for the Battle of Tarawa and the Battle of Makin that commenced on 20 November 1943, which was the implementation of Operation Galvanic.\nNew type of naval warfare.\nThe battle was the first naval engagement in history in which the participating ships never sighted or fired directly at each other. Instead, manned aircraft acted as the offensive artillery for the ships involved. Thus, the respective commanders were participating in a new type of warfare, carrier-versus-carrier, with which neither had any experience. In H. P. Willmot's words, the commanders \"had to contend with uncertain and poor communications in situations in which the area of battle had grown far beyond that prescribed by past experience but in which speeds had increased to an even greater extent, thereby compressing decision-making time.\" Because of the greater speed with which decisions were required, the Japanese were at a disadvantage as Inoue was too far away at Rabaul to effectively direct his naval forces in real time, in contrast to Fletcher who was on-scene with his carriers. The Japanese admirals involved were often slow to communicate important information to one another.\nResearch has examined how commanders' choices affected the battle's outcome. Two studies used mathematical models to estimate the impact of various alternatives. For example, suppose the U.S. carriers had chosen to sail separately (though still nearby), rather than together. The models indicated the Americans would have suffered slightly less total damage, with one ship sunk but the other unharmed. However, the battle's overall outcome would have been similar. By contrast, suppose one side had located its opponent early enough to launch a first strike, so that only the opponent's survivors could have struck back. The modeling suggested striking first would have provided a decisive advantage, even more beneficial than having an extra carrier.\nThe experienced Japanese carrier aircrews performed better than those of the U.S., achieving greater results with an equivalent number of aircraft. The Japanese attack on the U.S. carriers on 8 May was better coordinated than the U.S. attack on the Japanese carriers. The Japanese suffered much higher losses to their carrier aircrews, losing ninety aircrew killed in the battle compared with thirty-five for the U.S. side. Japan's cadre of highly skilled carrier aircrews with which it began the war were, in effect, irreplaceable because of an institutionalised limitation in its training programs and the absence of a pool of experienced reserves or advanced training programs for new airmen. Coral Sea started a trend which resulted in the irreparable attrition of Japan's veteran carrier aircrews by the end of October 1942.\nThe U.S. did not perform as expected, but it learned from its mistakes in the battle and made improvements to its carrier tactics and equipment, including fighter tactics, strike coordination, torpedo bombers and defensive strategies, such as anti-aircraft artillery, which contributed to better results in later battles. Radar gave the U.S. a limited advantage in this battle, but its value to the U.S. Navy increased over time as the technology improved and the Allies learned how to employ it more effectively. Following the loss of \"Lexington\", improved methods for containing aviation fuel and better damage control procedures were implemented by the U.S. Coordination between the Allied land-based air forces and the U.S. Navy was poor during this battle, but this too would improve over time.\nJapanese and U.S. carriers faced off against each other again in the battles of Midway, the Eastern Solomons, and the Santa Cruz Islands in 1942; and the Philippine Sea in 1944. Each of these battles was strategically significant, to varying degrees, in deciding the course and ultimate outcome of the Pacific War.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nPrint.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOnline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61998", "revid": "1316266696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61998", "title": "John Grisham", "text": "American writer and lawyer (born 1955)\nJohn Ray Grisham Jr. (; born February 8, 1955) is an American writer, lawyer, and former politician, known for his best-selling legal thrillers. According to the American Academy of Achievement, Grisham has written 37 consecutive number-one fiction bestsellers, and his books have sold 300 million copies worldwide. Along with Tom Clancy and J.K. Rowling, Grisham is one of only three anglophone authors to have sold two million copies on the first printing.\nGrisham graduated from Mississippi State University and earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1981. He practiced criminal law for about a decade and served in the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1983 to 1990. Grisham's first novel, \"A Time to Kill,\" was published in June 1989, four years after he began writing it. It was later adapted into the 1996 feature film of the same name. Grisham's first bestseller, \"The Firm\", sold more than seven million copies, and was also adapted into a 1993 feature film of the same name, starring Tom Cruise, and a 2012 TV series that continues the story ten years after the events of the film and novel. Seven of his other novels have also been adapted into films: \"The Chamber\", \"The Client\", \"A Painted House\", \"The Pelican Brief\", \"The Rainmaker\", \"The Runaway Jury\", and \"Skipping Christmas\".\nEarly life.\nGrisham, the second of five children, was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to Wanda (n\u00e9e Skidmore) and John Ray Grisham. His father was a construction worker and a cotton farmer, and his mother was a homemaker. When Grisham was four years old, his family settled in Southaven, Mississippi, near Memphis, Tennessee. As a child, he wanted to be a baseball player. As noted in the foreword to \"Calico Joe\", Grisham gave up playing baseball at the age of 18, after a game in which a pitcher aimed a beanball at him and narrowly missed doing the young Grisham grave harm.\nAlthough Grisham's parents lacked formal education, his mother encouraged him to read and prepare for college. He drew on his childhood experiences for his novel \"A Painted House\". Grisham started working for a plant nursery as a teenager, watering bushes for $1.00 an hour. He was soon promoted to a fence crew for $1.50 an hour. He wrote about the job: \"there was no future in it\". At 16, Grisham took a job with a plumbing contractor but says he \"never drew inspiration from that miserable work\".\nInitially, Grisham attended Horn Lake High School, a school that was so overcrowded some classes met in a church or a gymnasium. In 1971, he transferred to Southaven High School, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He credits his 12th grade English teacher, Frances McGuffey, for inspiring his love for reading and for introducing him to the works of John Steinbeck in particular.\nThrough one of his father's contacts, Grisham managed to find work on a highway asphalt crew in Mississippi at age 17. It was during this time that an unfortunate incident got him \"serious\" about college. A fight with gunfire broke out among the crew, causing Grisham to run to a nearby restroom to find safety. He did not come out until after the police had detained the perpetrators. He hitchhiked home and started thinking about college. His next work was in retail, as a sales clerk in a department store men's underwear section, which he described as \"humiliating\". By this time, Grisham was halfway through college. Planning to become a tax lawyer, he was soon overcome by \"the complexity and lunacy\" of it, deciding instead to return to his hometown as a trial lawyer.\nGrisham attended the Northwest Mississippi Community College in Senatobia, Mississippi, where he hoped to launch his baseball career but was benched instead. He and two close friends, Bubba Logan and Parker Pickle, transferred to Delta State University in Cleveland where Grisham hoped to revive his baseball career as a walk on player, but he was cut from the team and he left school after one semester. Ultimately, Grisham changed colleges three times before completing a degree. Although he started there as an economics major, he eventually graduated from Mississippi State University in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science in accounting after being inspired by a fellow student, a Vietnam veteran, who planned to go to law school. He later enrolled in the University of Mississippi School of Law intending to become a tax lawyer, but his interest shifted to general civil litigation. He graduated in 1981 with a J.D. degree.\nCareer.\nLaw and politics.\nGrisham practiced law for about a decade and won election as a Democrat to the Mississippi House of Representatives, serving from 1983 to 1990. He challenged the incumbent after becoming embarrassed by Mississippi's national reputation and inspired by the passage of the Education Reform Act of 1982. Grisham represented the 7th District, which included DeSoto County, Mississippi. By his second term in the state legislature, he was the vice-chairman of the Apportionment and Elections Committee and a member of several other committees. He supported Representative Ed Perry's unsuccessful bid for the House speakership in 1987. With a different speaker elected at the beginning of the 1988 legislative session, Grisham was out of favor with the new legislative leaders and assigned to more minor committee roles. Not as busy with political affairs, he devoted more time to his novel, \"The Firm\". Grisham later reflected that if Perry had become speaker he might have been given more committee responsibilities and thus unable to write.\nGrisham's writing career blossomed with the success of his second book, \"The Firm\", and he gave up practicing law, except for returning briefly in 1996 to represent the family of a railroad worker who was killed on the job. His official website states: \"He was honoring a commitment made before he had retired from the law to become a full-time writer. Grisham successfully argued his clients' case, earning them a jury award of $683,500 \u2014 the biggest verdict of his career.\"\nWriting career.\nAlthough he failed English in community college, Grisham received praise for his writing while taking a business correspondence course during law school. Grisham said a case that inspired his first novel came in 1984, but it was not his case. He heard a 12-year-old girl telling a jury what had happened to her. Her story intrigued Grisham. He saw how the members of the jury cried as she told them about having been raped and beaten. \"I remember staring at the defendant and wishing I had a gun.\" It was then, Grisham later wrote in \"The New York Times\", that a story was born. Over the next three years, he wrote his first book, \"A Time to Kill\". The book was rejected by 28 publishers before Wynwood Press, an unknown publisher, agreed to give it a modest 5,000 copy printing. It was published in June 1988.\nThe day after Grisham completed \"A Time to Kill\", he began work on his second novel, \"The Firm\". \"The Firm\" remained on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for 47 weeks, and became the seventh bestselling novel of 1991. This would begin a streak of having one of the top 10 best selling novels of the year for nearly the next two decades. In 1992 and 1993 he had the second-bestselling book of the year with \"The Pelican Brief\" and \"The Client\", and from 1994 to 2000 he had the number one bestselling book every year. In 2001 Grisham did not have the bestselling book of the year, but had both the second and third books on the list with \"Skipping Christmas\" and \"A Painted House\".\nIn 1992, \"The Firm\" was made into a film starring Tom Cruise and Ed Harris and was released in June 1993, grossing $270 million. A feature film version of \"The Pelican Brief\" starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington was released later that year and grossed $195 million. Following their success, Regency Enterprises paid Grisham $2.25 million for the rights to \"The Client\" which was released in 1994 starring Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones. Universal Pictures then commissioned Grisham with the highest amount ever for an unpublished novel, paying $3.75 million for the rights to \"The Chamber\". In August 1994, New Regency paid a record $6 million for the rights to \"A Time to Kill\", with Grisham asking for a guarantee that Joel Schumacher, the director of \"The Client\", would direct.\nBeginning with \"A Painted House\", Grisham broadened his focus from law to the more general rural South but continued to write legal thrillers at the rate of one per year. In 2002 he once again claimed the number one book of the year with \"The Summons\". In 2003 and 2004 he missed the number one bestseller of the year due to the success of \"The Da Vinci Code\" by Dan Brown, but he once again produced two novels which ended the year in the top 5. In 2004, \"The Last Juror\" ended the year at number four, and in 2005 he overtook \"The Da Vinci Code\" and returned to number one for the year with \"The Broker\". The year 2006 marked the first time since 1990 that he did not have one of the top-selling books of the year, but he returned to number two in 2007, number one in 2008, and number two in 2009. Grisham has also written sports fiction and comedy fiction. He wrote the original screenplay for and produced the 2004 baseball movie \"Mickey\", which starred Harry Connick Jr.\nIn 2005, Grisham received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award, which is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust. In 2010, Grisham started writing a series of legal thrillers for children. They feature Theodore Boone, a 13-year-old who gives his classmates legal advice on a multitude of scenarios, ranging from rescuing impounded dogs to helping their parents prevent their house from being repossessed. He said, \"I'm hoping primarily to entertain and interest kids, but at the same time I'm quietly hoping that the books will inform them, in a subtle way, about law.\" He also stated that it was his daughter, Shea, who inspired him to write the Theodore Boone series. \"My daughter Shea is a teacher in North Carolina and when she got her fifth grade students to read the book, three or four of them came up afterwards and said they'd like to go into the legal profession.\"\nIn an October 2006 interview on the \"Charlie Rose\" show, Grisham stated that he usually takes only six months to write a book, and his favorite author is John le Carr\u00e9. In 2011 and 2012, his novels \"The Litigators\" and \"The Racketeer\" claimed the top spot in \"The New York Times\" best seller list. The novels were among the best selling books of those years, spending several weeks atop various best seller lists. In 2013, he again reached the top five in the US best-seller list. In November 2015, his novel \"Rogue Lawyer\" was at the top of the \"New York Times\" Fiction Best Seller for two weeks.\nIn 2017, Grisham released two legal thrillers. \"Camino Island\" was published on June 6, 2017. The book appeared at the top of several best seller lists including \"USA Today\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"The New York Times\". \"The Rooster Bar\", published on October 24, 2017, was called \"his most original work yet\", in \"The News Herald\", and a \u201cbuoyant, mischievous thriller\u201d in \"The New York Times\".\nSouthern settings.\nSeveral of Grisham's legal thrillers are set in the fictional town of Clanton, Mississippi, located in the fictional Ford County, a northwest Mississippi town still deeply divided by racism. The first novel set in Clanton was \"A Time to Kill\". Other stories set there include \"The Last Juror\", \"The Summons\", \"The Chamber\", \"The Reckoning\", \"A Time for Mercy\" and \"Sycamore Row\". The stories in the collection \"Ford County\" are also set in and around Clanton. Other Grisham novels have non-fictional Southern settings, for example \"The Partner\", \"The Runaway Jury\", and \"The Boys from Biloxi\" are set in Biloxi, and large portions of \"The Pelican Brief\" in New Orleans. \"A Painted House\" is set in and around the town of Black Oak, Arkansas, where Grisham spent some of his childhood.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage.\nGrisham married Renee Jones on May 8, 1981. The couple have two children.\nReal estate holdings.\nThe family splits their time among their home in Charlottesville, Virginia, a home in Destin, Florida, and a condominium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Their former and longtime Victorian home on a farm outside Oxford, Mississippi, was given to the University of Mississippi after 2011.\nGrisham owns a beachfront home on Amelia Island in Florida.\nReligion.\nGrisham is a member of the University Baptist Church in Charlottesville, Virginia, itself a constituent of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. Grisham opposes a literalist understanding of the Bible, and endorses the American separation of church and state. In 1993, he created with his wife a foundation, entirely financed by his royalties, which contributes to Baptist missionaries in Brazil for the purchase of medicines and the construction of chapels, clinics and schools. He also participated in some missionary work in Brazil, under the First Baptist Church of Oxford.\nBaseball.\nGrisham has a lifelong passion for baseball, demonstrated partly by his support of Little League activities in both Oxford, Mississippi, and in Charlottesville. In 1996, Grisham built a $3.8 million youth baseball complex. In \"A Painted House\", a novel with strong autobiographical elements, the protagonist, a seven-year-old farmer boy, manifests a strong wish to become a baseball player. He remains a fan of Mississippi State University's baseball team and wrote about his ties to the university and the Left Field Lounge in the introduction for the book \"Dudy Noble Field: A Celebration of MSU Baseball\". Since moving to the Charlottesville area, Grisham has become a supporter of Virginia Cavaliers athletics and is regularly seen sitting courtside at basketball games. Grisham also contributed to a $1.2 million donation to the Cavalier baseball team in Charlottesville, Virginia, which was used in the 2002 renovation of Davenport Field. His son Ty played college baseball for the University of Virginia.\nPolitical activism.\nGrisham is a member of the board of directors of the Innocence Project, which campaigns to free and exonerate unjustly convicted people on the basis of DNA evidence. The Innocence Project contends that wrongful convictions are not isolated or rare events but instead arise from systemic defects. Grisham has testified before Congress on behalf of the Innocence Project.\nGrisham has appeared on \"Dateline NBC\", \"Bill Moyers Journal\" on PBS, and other programs. He wrote for \"The New York Times\" in 2013 about an unjustly held prisoner at Guantanamo. Grisham opposes capital punishment, a position very strongly manifested in the plot of \"The Confession\". He believes that prison rates in the United States are excessive, and the justice system is \"locking up far too many people\". Citing examples including \"black teenagers on minor drugs charges\" to \"those who had viewed child porn online\", he controversially added that he believed not all viewers of child pornography are necessarily pedophiles. After hearing from numerous people against this position, he later recanted this statement in a Facebook post. He went on to clarify that he was defending a former friend from law school who was caught in a sting thinking he was looking at adult porn but it was in reality sixteen- and seventeen-year-old minors and went on to add, \"I have no sympathy for real pedophiles. God, please lock those people up. Anyone who harms a child for profit or pleasure ... Should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\"\nThe Mississippi State University Libraries, Manuscript Division, maintains the John Grisham Room, an archive containing materials generated during the author's tenure as Mississippi State Representative and relating to his writings. In 2012, the Law Library at the University of Mississippi School of Law was renamed in his honor. It had been named for more than a decade after the late Senator James Eastland. In 2015, Grisham, along with about 60 others, signed a letter published in the \"Clarion-Ledger\" urging that an inset within the flag of Mississippi containing a Confederate flag be removed. He co-authored the letter with author Greg Iles; the pair contacted various public figures from Mississippi for support. Grisham supported Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016. In his 2018 Fall Convocation address to new students, Grisham described Mississippi State University as a place where he felt at home, noting, \"I loved the big lecture halls, and I came to enjoy the professors. For the first time, after being at several schools, I was on a real campus with a diverse student body, different professors from around the world, big time sports, all of the activities that a big college can bring, and I really fell in love with State.\"\nBibliography.\nA complete listing of works by John Grisham:\nNovels.\n\"Jake Brigance\" series:\n\"Rogue Lawyer\" series:\n 0.5. \"Partners\" (2016), short story\n\"The Whistler\" series:\n 0.5. \"Witness to a Trial\" (2016), short story\n\"Camino Island\" series:\n\"Mitch McDeere\" series:\nStand-alones:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nYoung adult novels.\n\"Theodore Boone\" series:\nShort stories.\nCollections:\nUncollected short stories:\nAdaptations.\nFeature films.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61999", "revid": "38056903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61999", "title": "Danielle Steel", "text": "American author (born 1947)\nDanielle Fernandes Dominique Schuelein-Steel (born August 14, 1947) is an American writer best known for her romance novels. She is the bestselling living author and the fourth-best-selling fiction author of all time, with over 800\u00a0million copies sold. As of 2024, she has written 210 books, including over 182 novels. \nBased in California for most of her career, Steel has produced several books a year, often juggling up to five projects at once. All her novels have been bestsellers, including those issued in hardback, despite \"a resounding lack of critical acclaim\" (\"Publishers Weekly\"). Her books often involve rich families facing a crisis, threatened by dark elements such as prison, fraud, blackmail, and suicide. Steel has also published children's fiction and poetry, as well as creating a foundation that funds mental-illness-related organizations. Her books have been translated into 43 languages, with 22 adapted for television, including two that have received Golden Globe nominations.\nEarly life.\nSteel was born Danielle Fernandes Dominique Schuelein-Steel in New York City to a German father and a Portuguese mother. Her father, John Schuelein-Steel, was a German-Jewish immigrant and a descendant of owners of L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u beer. Her mother, Norma da Camara Stone dos Reis, was the daughter of a Portuguese diplomat. She spent much of her childhood in France, where from an early age she was included in her parents' dinner parties, giving her an opportunity to observe the habits and lives of the wealthy and famous. Her parents divorced when she was eight, and she was raised primarily by her father, rarely seeing her mother.\nSteel started writing stories as a child, and by her late teens had begun writing poetry. Raised Catholic, she thought of becoming a nun during her early years. A 1965 graduate of the \"Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de New York\", she studied literature design and fashion design, first at Parsons School of Design and then at New York University.\nCareer.\n1965\u20131971: Career beginnings.\nWhile still attending New York University, Steel began writing, completing her first manuscript at 19. Steel worked for a public-relations agency in New York called Supergirls. A client, \"Ladies' Home Journal\" editor John Mack Carter, encouraged her to focus on writing, having been impressed with her freelance articles. He suggested she write a book, which she did. She later moved to San Francisco and worked as a copywriter for Grey Advertising.\n1972\u20131981: First novels and growing success.\nHer first novel, \"Going Home\", was published in 1973. The novel contained many of the themes that her writing would become well known for, including a focus on family issues and human relationships. Her relationship with her second husband influenced \"Passion's Promise\" and \"Now and Forever\", the two novels that launched her career. With the success of her fourth book, \"The Promise\", she became a participant in San Francisco high society.\n1981\u20131996: Fame and expansion to new genres.\nBeginning in 1991, Steel had become a near-permanent fixture on \"The New York Times\" hardcover and paperback bestsellers lists. In 1999, she was listed in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for having a book on the \"New York Times Bestseller List\" for the most consecutive weeks of any author\u2014456 consecutive weeks at that time. Steel is a prolific author, often releasing several books per year. Each book takes 2\u00bd years to complete, so Steel has developed an ability to juggle up to five projects at once, researching one book while outlining another, then writing and editing additional books. Since her first book was published, every one of her novels has hit bestseller lists in paperback, and each one released in hardback has also been a hardback bestseller.\nDuring this time, Steel also expanded to non-fiction work. \"Having a Baby\" was published in 1984 and featured a chapter by Steel about suffering through miscarriage. The same year she published a book of poetry, \"Love: Poems.\" She also ventured into children's fiction, penning a series of 57 illustrated books for young readers. These books, known as the \"Max and Martha\" series, aim to help children face real-life problems: new baby, new school, loss of loved one, etc. In addition, Steel has authored the \"Freddie\" series. These four books address other real-life situations: first night away from home, trip to the doctor, etc.\nIn 1993, Steel sued writer Lorenzo Bene, who had intended to disclose in his book that her son Nick was adopted by her then-current husband John Traina, despite the fact that adoption records are sealed in California. A San Francisco judge made a highly unusual ruling allowing the seal on Nick's adoption to be overturned, although he was still a minor. This order was confirmed by a California Appellate Judge, who ruled that because Steel was famous, her son's adoption did not have the same privacy right, and the book was allowed to be published.\n1997\u2013present: Continued success and awards.\nAfter years of near-constant writing, in 2003 Steel opened an art gallery in San Francisco, Steel Gallery, which showed contemporary work and exhibited the paintings and sculptures of emerging artists. The gallery closed in 2007. She continues to curate shows a few times a year for the Andrea Schwartz Gallery in San Francisco.\nIn 2002, Steel was decorated by the French government as an \"Officier\" of the \"Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\", for her contributions to world culture.\nShe has additionally received:\nIn 2006 Steel reached an agreement with Elizabeth Arden to launch a new perfume, Danielle by Danielle Steel.\nIn 2014, she wrote an article for SFGate writing about her concern that San Francisco was losing its heart.\nPersonal life.\nSteel married French banker Claude-\u00c9ric Lazard in 1965 at age 18 and gave birth to their daughter Beatrix. Steel and Lazard separated in 1972. While still married to Lazard, Steel met Danny Zugelder while interviewing an inmate in a prison near Lompoc, California, where Zugelder was also incarcerated. He moved in with Steel when he was paroled in June 1973, but returned to prison in early 1974 on robbery and rape charges. After receiving her divorce from Lazard in 1975, she married Zugelder in the prison canteen. During their relationship, Steel suffered multiple miscarriages. She divorced Zugelder in 1978.\nSteel married her third husband, William George Toth, in 1978, while pregnant with their son, Nick. They divorced in March 1981.\nSteel married for the fourth time in 1981, to John Traina, a shipping and cruise magnate and later vintner and art collector who was the ex-husband of Dede Wilsey. Together they had five children, Samantha, Victoria, Vanessa, Maxx, and Zara. Traina adopted Steel's son Nick and gave him his family name and Steel also became stepmother of Traina's sons Trevor and Todd. Determined to spend as much time as possible with her children, Steel often wrote at night, making do with only four hours of sleep. Steel and Traina divorced in 1995.\nHer fear of flying created many challenges in the early 1980s; she went through an eight-week course based at the San Francisco airport to overcome her fear.\nSteel married for a fifth time, to Silicon Valley financier Thomas James Perkins, but the marriage ended after four years in 2002. Steel has said that her novel \"The Klone and I\" was inspired by a private joke between herself and Perkins. In 2006, Perkins dedicated his novel \"Sex and the Single Zillionaire\" to Steel.\nSteel's longtime residence was in San Francisco, but she now spends most of her time at a second home in Paris. Her 55-room San Francisco home, Spreckels Mansion, was built in c.1912 as the mansion of sugar tycoon Adolph B. Spreckels.\nDespite her public image and varied pursuits, Steel is known to be shy and because of that and her desire to protect her children from the tabloids, she rarely grants interviews or makes public appearances.\nNick Traina and Yo Angel Foundations.\nSteel's son, Nick Traina, died by suicide in 1997. Traina was the lead singer of San Francisco punk bands Link 80 and Knowledge. To honor his memory, Steel wrote the nonfiction book \"His Bright Light\", about Nick's life and death. Proceeds of the book, which reached \"The New York Times\" Non-Fiction Bestseller List, were used to found the Nick Traina Foundation, which Steel runs, to fund organizations dedicated to treating mental accessibility issues. To gain more recognition for children's mental health, Steel has lobbied for legislation in Washington, and previously held a fundraiser every two years (known as The Star Ball) in San Francisco. In 2002, she founded Yo Angel Foundation to assist the homeless.\nWriting style.\nSteel's novels, often described as \"formulaic,\" tend to involve the characters in a crisis that threatens their relationship. The novels sometimes explore the world of the rich and famous and frequently deal with serious life issues like illness, death, loss, family crises, and relationships. There are claims that her popular story lines are based on the events of her life. Despite a reputation among critics for writing \"fluff\", Steel often delves into the less savory aspects of human nature, including incest, suicide, divorce, war, and even the Holocaust. As time has progressed, Steel's writing has evolved. Her later heroines tend to be stronger and more authoritative, who, if they do not receive the level of respect and attention they desire from a man, move on to a new life. In recent years Steel has also been willing to take more risks with her plots. \"Ransom\" focuses more on suspense than romance, and follows three sets of seemingly unconnected characters as their lives begin to intersect. \"Toxic Bachelors\" departs from her usual style by telling the story through the eyes of the three title characters, men who are relationship phobic and ultimately discover their true loves.\nTo avoid comparisons to her previous novels, Steel does not write sequels. Although many of her earliest books were released with initial print runs of 1 million copies, by 2004 her publisher had decreased the number of books initially printed to 650,000 due to the decline in book purchasing. However, her fan base was still extremely strong at that time, with Steel's books selling out atop charts worldwide.\nAdaptations.\nTwenty-two of her books have been adapted for television, including two that have received Golden Globe nominations. One is \"Jewels\", the story of the survival of a woman and her children in World War II Europe, and the family's eventual rebirth as one of the greatest jewelry houses in Europe. Columbia Pictures was the first movie studio to make an offer for one of her novels, purchasing the rights to \"The Ghost\" in 1998. Steel also reached an agreement with New Line Home Entertainment in 2005 to sell the film rights to 30 of her novels for DVDs.\nWriting process.\nSteel spends two to three years on each book, juggling multiple projects at once. According to Steel, once she has an idea for a story, her first step is to make notes, which are mostly about the characters. She told \"The New York Times\" in 2018: \"I make notes for a while before I start work on the outline. The notes are usually more about the characters. I need to know the characters really well before I start \u2014 who they are, how they think, how they feel, what has happened to them, how they grew up.\" In a 2019 interview with \"The Guardian\", she reported often spending 20- to 30-hour periods on her typewriter, gaining her attention and criticism.\nSteel has written all of her novels on Olympia SG1 standard typewriters. She has two that she primarily writes on: one at her home in San Francisco and another at her home in Paris. Her typewriter at her home in San Francisco has been in her possession since she bought it while working on her first book. According to Steel, she bought it second hand for $20.\nBibliography.\nDanielle Steel has written more than 185 books, including over 141 novels. Her books have been translated into 43 languages and can be found in 69 countries across the globe.\nHer works consist of novels, non-fiction, picture books, and two series of children's books: the Max &amp; Martha series and the Freddie series.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62000", "revid": "105732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62000", "title": "Legal drama", "text": "Subgenre of dramatic fiction\nLegal drama, also called courtroom drama or law procedural, is a genre of film and television that generally focuses on narratives regarding legal practice and the justice system. The American Film Institute (AFI) defines \"courtroom drama\" as a genre of film in which a system of justice plays a critical role in the film's narrative. Legal dramas have also followed the lives of the fictional attorneys, defendants, plaintiffs, or other persons related to the practice of law present in television show or film. Legal drama is distinct from police crime drama or detective fiction, which typically focus on police officers or detectives investigating and solving crimes. The focal point of legal dramas, more often, are events occurring within a courtroom, but may include any phases of legal procedure, such as jury deliberations or work done at law firms. Some legal dramas fictionalize real cases which have been litigated, such as the play turned into a movie, \"Inherit the Wind\" fictionalizing the Scopes Monkey Trial. As a genre, the term \"legal drama\" is usually applied to television shows and films, whereas legal thrillers typically refer to novels and plays.\nThemes.\nLegal dramas typically portray moral dilemmas that occur with the practice of the law or participating in the justice system, many of which mirrors dilemmas in real life. The American Bar Association Journal has interpreted the public's enjoyment of legal dramas occur because \"stories about the legal system are laced with human vulnerability.\" Indeed, even though \"there are no car chases [and]... [g]uns are never drawn\", legal dramas retain strong followings because of their presentation of moral intrigue in a setting that actually reflects what occurs in the world.\nLegal dramas may present stories of the miscarriages of justice, such as persons wrongly convicted of a crime they did not commit. At times, stories may involve the moral implications of police misconduct, such as placing or tampering with evidence, such as in the 1993 film \"In the Name of the Father\". More often, legal dramas focus on the attorneys' point of view when faced with these difficulties. For instance, in \"The Practice\", a television legal drama series revolving around a firm of criminal defense attorneys, a common theme presented is the difficulty of defending clients known or believed to be guilty.\nFinally, many legal dramas present themes that reflect politicized issues. In the 1960 film, \"Inherit the Wind\", the politicized issue portrayed was the legality of a Tennessee statute that made it unlawful to teach the theory of evolution in a public school. As laws and public policy opinions change, so do the themes presented in legal dramas. The 1992 film \"A Few Good Men\" explored the psychology of superior orders, e.g. excusing criminal actions because they were only committed from 'following orders'. The film \"Philadelphia\" (1993) addressed homophobia, and the discrimination and public fear of HIV/AIDs carriers. In 1996, \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\" portrays the early years of \"Hustler Magazine\" and issues of obscenity and freedom of speech. \"You Don't Know Jack\" (2010) is a fictional biographic film about Dr. Jack Kevorkian and the legal actions he faced as a result of providing euthanasia services to terminal patients. Racial injustice remains a common theme from as far back as \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" in 1962 to the 2017 film \"Marshall\".\nHistory.\nLegal drama in American film has an extensive history stemming from as early as the 1908 film, \"Falsely Accused!\" The 1950s and 1960s presented a number of legal drama films including, \"12 Angry Men\" (1957), \"Witness for the Prosecution\" (1957), \"I Want to Live!\" (1958), \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959), \"The Young Philadelphians\" (1959), \"Compulsion\" (1959), \"Inherit the Wind\" (1960), \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (1961), and \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (1962). Arguably, \"12 Angry Men\" and \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" stand as the cornerstones of early legal dramas, garnering extensive acclaim, recognition, and awards. Despite underwhelming box office performance, \"12 Angry Men\" was nominated in three different categories at the 30th Academy Awards and appears on half of the AFI 100 Years... series lists of films, which celebrate the greatest films in American cinema. Likewise, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" received even more acclaim, garnering three academy awards out of eight total nominations at the 35th Academy Awards, appears on seven of the AFI's ten lists celebrating the greatest films, including ranking as the best courtroom drama, and selected for preservation United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Other countries also premiered legal dramas or courtrooms dramas in the early 1900s, such as the French silent film \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928).\nOther legal drama films have not focused on even the practice of law, such as \"Paper Chase\", a film presenting the difficulty and anxiety of entering law school.\nTelevision.\nEarly American television programs considered legal dramas include \"Perry Mason\", \"The Defenders\", \"Judd, for the Defense\", \"Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law\", \"\", \"Petrocelli\", and \"Matlock\". More recent examples of serious legal dramas are \"Murder One\", \"The Practice\", \"Law &amp; Order\", \"L.A. Law\", \"The Good Wife\" and \"Pearson\".\nThe examples of legal comedy dramas are \"Ally McBeal\" and \"Boston Legal\", both of which David E. Kelley created and produced, with \"Suits\" as one of the most popular legal drama during the 2010s. \"Better Call Saul\" also achieved popularity following its first season in 2015.\nLegal dramas are becoming more in demand from the public, more popular for many people to watch, and beginning to feature stronger female leads.\nThere are also the British television courtroom dramas, which consist of \"Rumpole of the Bailey\", \"Kavanagh QC\" and \"Judge John Deed\", broadcast by ITV and the BBC respectively.\nInaccurate portrayal of legal practice.\nIt is widely believed by most practicing lawyers that legal dramas result in the general public having misconceptions about the legal process. Many of these misconceptions result from the desire to create an interesting story. For example, because conflict between parties make for an interesting story, legal dramas emphasize the trial and ignore the fact that the vast majority of civil and criminal cases in the United States are settled out of court. Trials in legal dramas are often shown to be more emphatic by disregarding actual rules in trials that prevent prejudicing defendants from juries.\nBesides the actual practice of law, legal dramas may also misrepresent the character of lawyers in general. The lawyers in question fall under different variations, the character representations include the zealous heroic lawyers fighting to save their client's case, or putting criminals in jail, another is the sleazy distrustful attorney performing morally questionable acts to win the case, another may be the conflicted lawyer who is forced into a moral dilemma of having to defend a guilty client. These representations are not reflective of how lawyers act in real life as their job is to remain neutral to the law and ensure every person gets a fair and equal trial, regardless of their guilt.\nSpeaking at a screening of \"12 Angry Men\" during the 2010 Fordham University Law School Film festival, US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that seeing \"12 Angry Men\" while she was in college influenced her decision to pursue a career in law. She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11's monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film's example, because most of the jurors' conclusions are based on speculation, not fact. Sotomayor noted that events from the film such as entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt would not be allowed in a real-life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a mistrial (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a few exceptions (see \"Structure and Layout\"), it is situated along Paris's administrative limit.\nThe speed limit along the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique is 50\u00a0km/h (31 mph) as of 1 October 2024. Each ring generally has four traffic lanes, with no hard shoulder. Its major interchanges are called \"portes\". At junctions, vehicles in the rightmost lane (separated from other lanes in these areas by a continuous white line to the left) must yield to entering vehicles.\nWhen travelling at the legal speed limit, it takes approximately 40 minutes to complete a full circuit of the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique.\nHistory.\nIn 1846, the French War Ministry completed the defensive Thiers wall around Paris, including fortifications, a dry moat, a \"Rue Militaire\" and a large berm. In 1859, the military engineering department gave conditional control of the perimeter to the precursor of the current Paris city council. The expansion of Paris in 1860, achieved through annexation of bordering communities, created a situation where everything within the Thiers wall was Paris and everything outside was not. The Thiers wall led to a profound disruption of the synergistic relationship between Paris and its suburbs.\nIn 1861, the Paris city council started converting some sections of the \"Rue Militaire\" into boulevards. In the 1920s, the complete dismantling of the Thiers wall allowed further construction of what is today a series of over 20 connected boulevards encircling the city. This inner quasi-ring road came to be known as the Boulevards of the Marshals, as most of the boulevards bear the name of a marshal who served under Napoleon I. The road construction largely helped to reconnect Paris with its burgeoning suburbs. The Boulevards of the Marshals were almost fully completed by 1932, though the final three sections would not be added until 2005, closing the ring over 80 years after construction began. The Boulevards of the Marshals were built just inside the city limits, leaving a ring of vacant land just outside their perimeter.\nConstruction of the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique began in 1958 on the remaining area once occupied by the Thiers Wall; the space not already taken up by the Boulevards of the Marshals measured anywhere from a few meters to the width of a city block. Unlike the Boulevards of the Marshals, the road bears only a single name, Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique. In order to alleviate traffic congestion, the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique was built more like a motorway than a wide boulevard, and was completed on 25 April 1973 under the presidency of Georges Pompidou. Used in a quarter of all Parisian traffic movements, it quickly became the busiest road in France. The P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique became a victim of its own success, plagued by widespread congestion and blocked from expansion by dense surrounding urban areas.\nThe top speed of the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique was lowered multiple times in its history. while initially being of 90\u00a0km/h, it was lowered to 70\u00a0km/h in 2014 then 50\u00a0km/h in 2024.\nP\u00e9riph\u00e9rique int\u00e9rieur vs. ext\u00e9rieur.\nThe P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique consists of two concentric carriageways: the \"int\u00e9rieur\" (\"inner ring\") and the \"ext\u00e9rieur\" (\"outer ring\"). Vehicles travel clockwise on the inner ring and counterclockwise on the outer ring. Stretches of the road are sometimes referred to by cardinal direction. For example, in the southern half of the highway, the \"inner ring\" is designated as the \"P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique Ouest\" (\"Western Ring\"), as traffic there flows westbound, whereas the \"outer ring\" is designated as the \"P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique Est\" (\"Eastern Ring\"), as traffic flows eastbound. In the northern half, these designations are reversed.\nStructure and layout.\nThe structure of the Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique is similar to most French autoroutes, UK and Commonwealth nation motorways, and American freeways in the following ways:\nBut the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique is also different from some of its domestic and foreign counterparts:\nThere are generally four lanes in each of the two rings of the Boulevard. Variations exist:\nThe entire Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique is 35.04 kilometres long, as measured along the central median strip. The route closely follows the municipal boundaries of Paris, but diverges in the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes (where the roadway is cut and covered), and the Paris Heliport. Because the Boulevard was built over the old Thiers Wall, its entrance/exit ramps and interchanges coincide with locations of the wall's former city gates, or \"portes\". The road crosses the River Seine via bridges upstream at Charenton/Bercy and downstream at Saint-Cloud/Issy.\nSmall distance markers are distributed evenly alongside the roadway:\nThe roadway varies in elevation:\nThe Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique can carry the heaviest vehicles allowed by French regulations. There is a height restriction of 4.75 metres (15 feet, 8 inches).\nSpeed control.\nThe Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique is equipped with speed cameras to enforce the 50\u00a0km/h (31\u00a0mph) speed limit. The cameras are oriented to photograph vehicle plates from behind, and are reportedly located near the following interchanges:\nOn the inner ring, at:\nOn the outer ring, at:\nIn addition, the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique's exit ramps are often monitored with hand-held binocular-type radar devices; these are triggered when the 50\u00a0km/h (31\u00a0mph) exiting limit is exceeded.\nFinally, during rush hour, radar-equipped police vehicles are often positioned in hidden areas for further spot checks.\nNetwork monitoring and traffic management.\nApproximately one hundred traffic cameras are installed along the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, directly connected to the control room of its traffic management office. There are 166 emergency telephones, located every 500 metres along the ring road (every 250 metres underground), which handle 7,000 calls per year. The emergency phones are all numbered, with odd-numbered phones on the outer ring and even-numbered ones on the inner ring road.\nEight police vehicles continuously patrol the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique during the day; four do so at night.\n750 sensors embedded in the road surface record each passing vehicle, measuring flow rate, occupancy rate and/or traffic velocity on given portions of the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique. Variable-message signs provide information on the estimated journey time to the next major exit, automatically generating updates every minute via a computer system using data from the sensors. The system also displays general information on accidents, road closures and road work.\nOther ring roads.\nThe Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique is not the only means of bypassing the interior of the French capital:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is named after Mont Loz\u00e8re. With 76,604 inhabitants as of 2019, Loz\u00e8re is the least populous French department.\nHistory.\nLoz\u00e8re was created in 1790 during the French Revolution, when the whole of France was divided into departments, replacing the old provinces. Loz\u00e8re was formed from part of the old province of Languedoc.\nPliny's Natural History praised the cheese of Loz\u00e8re:\nThe kinds of cheese that are most esteemed at Rome, where the various good things of all nations are to be judged of by comparison, are those that come from the provinces of Nemausus, and more especially the area there of Lesura and Gabalis (Loz\u00e8re and G\u00e9vaudan); but its excellence is only very short-lived, and it must be eaten while it is fresh.\nBetween 1764 and 1767, the Beast of G\u00e9vaudan, a creature believed to be a large wolf or an exotic animal, terrorized the general area in the Margeride Mountains of the former province of G\u00e9vaudan (nearly identical with the modern Loz\u00e8re department).\nGeography.\nLoz\u00e8re has an area of . It is the northernmost department of the current Occitanie region and is surrounded by five departments belonging to two regions: Cantal, Haute-Loire and Ard\u00e8che departments of the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, and Gard and Aveyron departments of the Occitanie region.\nThe geography of Loz\u00e8re is complicated, covering four mountain ranges. In the north-west, the basalt plateau of Aubrac rises between , with a cold humid climate influenced by the Atlantic. The north and north-east of the department contains the Margeride mountains, which are formed of granite, and have peaks between . The climate here is also cold, but drier than in Aubrac, with less snow.\nThe Causses are a series of very dry limestone plateaus in the south-west, and the south-east contains the C\u00e9vennes, which include the highest point in the department, the granite Mont Loz\u00e8re at .\nThe department also contains numerous rivers, above and below ground, including the Tarn, whose source is on Mont Loz\u00e8re, and which flows through the Gorges du Tarn in the Causses.\nDemographics.\nPopulation development since 1801:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLoz\u00e8re is the least populated French department, and the least densely populated in Metropolitan France. Its 2019 population of 76,604 gives it a population density of inhabitants/km2. The department boasts a population similar in size to that of the country of Andorra, the neighbouring country that borders to the south. Since the end of the 19th century the department has seen its population decline due to negative migration, the last fifteen years have nevertheless shown a new upward trend. The reasons given for this trend are the quality of the living environment, the improvement of the road transport and communication network and to a lesser extent heliotropism. It is nevertheless an elderly population with high purchasing power. The inhabitants of Loz\u00e8re are known, in French, as \"Loz\u00e9riens\" and \"Loz\u00e9riennes\".\nThe population is concentrated in three main urban centers: Mende, Saint-Ch\u00e9ly-d'Apcher and Marvejols which together account for a third of the department's population. Some other small centers (Langogne, Florac, Aumont-Aubrac, La Canourgue, etc.) appear as small living areas but are unable to attract young people, including the exodus towards neighboring metropolises (Clermont-Ferrand in the north, Montpellier and N\u00eemes to the south) is increasingly important.\nBecause of its low population density, it is considered to fall within the empty diagonal.\nPrincipal towns.\nThe most populous commune is Mende, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 3 communes with more than 3,000 inhabitants:\nAdministration.\nThe d\u00e9partement is managed by the Departmental Council of Loz\u00e8re in Mende. As of 2015[ [update]], the President of the council is Sophie Pantel. Loz\u00e8re is part of the region of Occitanie.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThere are 2 arrondissements, 13 cantons and 152 communes in Loz\u00e8re.\nThe following is a list of the 13 cantons of the Loz\u00e8re department (with their INSEE codes), following the French canton reorganisation which came into effect in March 2015:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomy.\nThe main activities are cattle farming and tourism. There is barely any arable farming in Loz\u00e8re due to poor soil quality. The hardy Aubrac is the most commonly farmed cattle breed here.\nThe region has one of the lowest rates of unemployment in France, which may be attributed to the enforced long-standing tradition whereby young people emigrate to cities such as Lyon, Marseille, and Montpellier when they reach working age.\nLand use.\nLoz\u00e8re is a rural department, with relatively little land taken up by roads and buildings. Overall the land use is divided as follows:\nTourism.\nTourist activities include caving and a variety of sports, such as skiing and kayaking. Loz\u00e8re contains a part of the C\u00e9vennes National Park. Loz\u00e8re is considered one of the best areas in France for trout fishing. Rivers such as the Lot, Tarn and Truy\u00e8re are particularly noted for their trout populations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh), and raised in Oakland, California, Stein moved to Paris in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris salon, where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, Sherwood Anderson and Henri Matisse, would meet.\nIn 1933, Stein published a quasi-memoir of her Paris years, \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\", written in the voice of Alice B. Toklas, her life partner. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of the cult-literature scene into the limelight of mainstream attention. Two quotes from her works have become widely known: \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\", and \"there is no there there\", with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of Oakland.\nHer books include \"Q.E.D.\" (1903), about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of Stein's friends; \"Fernhurst\", a fictional story about a love triangle; \"Three Lives\" (1905\u201306); \"The Making of Americans\" (1902\u20131911); and \"Tender Buttons\" (1914).\nHer activities during World War II have been the subject of analysis and commentary. As a Jew living in Nazi-occupied France, Stein may have been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector, and indeed to ensure her physical safety, only through the protection of the powerful Vichy government official and Nazi collaborator Bernard Fa\u00ff. After the war ended, Stein expressed admiration for another Nazi collaborator, Vichy leader Marshal P\u00e9tain.\nEarly life.\nStein, the last of seven children, was born on February 3, 1874, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (which merged with Pittsburgh in 1907), to upper-middle-class Jewish parents, Daniel Stein and Amelia Stein, n\u00e9e Keyser. Her father was a wealthy businessman with real estate holdings. German and English were spoken in their home. Gertrude's surviving siblings, with whom she was raised, were: Michael (born in 1865), Simon (1868), Bertha (1870), and Leo (1872).\nWhen Stein was three years old, she and her family moved to Vienna, and then Paris. Accompanied by governesses and tutors, the Steins endeavored to imbue their children with the cultured sensibilities of European history and life. After a year-long sojourn abroad, they returned to America in 1878, settling in Oakland, California, where her father became director of San Francisco's streetcar lines, the Market Street Railway. Stein attended the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland's Sabbath school. During their residence in Oakland, they lived for four years on a 10-acre lot, experiencing California in ways that Stein would remember throughout her life. She would take frequent excursions with her brother Leo, with whom she developed a close relationship. Though Stein found formal schooling in Oakland unstimulating, she often immersed herself in the writings of Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Scott, Burns, Smollett, Fielding, and others.\nWhen Stein was 14 years old, their mother died. Three years later, they lost their father, as well. Stein's eldest brother, Michael, age 26, then took over the family business holdings, moved his four siblings to San Francisco, where he had become a director of the Market Street Cable Railway Company. In 1892, he arranged for Gertrude and their sister, Bertha, to live with their mother's family in Baltimore. \nThere, Gertrude lived with her uncle David Bachrach, who, in 1877, had married Fanny Keyser. In Baltimore, Stein also got to know Claribel and Etta Cone, who held Saturday evening salons that she would later emulate in Paris. The Cones shared an appreciation for art and conversation about it and modeled a domestic division of labor that Stein would replicate in her relationship with Alice B. Toklas.\nEducation.\nRadcliffe.\nStein attended Radcliffe College, then an annex of Harvard University, from 1893 to 1897 and was a student of psychologist William James. With James's supervision, Stein and another student, Leon Mendez Solomons, performed experiments on \"normal motor automatism\", a phenomenon hypothesized to occur in people when their attention is divided between two simultaneous intelligent activities such as writing and speaking.\nThese experiments yielded examples of writing that appeared to represent \"stream of consciousness\", a psychological theory often attributed to James and the style of modernist authors Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. In 1934, behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner interpreted Stein's difficult poem \"Tender Buttons\" as an example of \"normal motor automatism\". In a letter Stein wrote during the 1930s, she explained that she never accepted the theory of automatic writing: \"[T]here can be automatic movements, but not automatic writing. Writing for the normal person is too complicated an activity to be indulged in automatically.\" She did publish an article in a psychological journal on \"spontaneous automatic writing\" while at Radcliffe, but \"the unconscious and the intuition (even when James himself wrote about them) never concerned her\".\nAt Radcliffe, she began a lifelong friendship with Mabel Foote Weeks, whose correspondence traces much of the progression of Stein's life. In 1897, Stein spent the summer in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, studying embryology at the Marine Biological Laboratory. She received her A.B. (Bachelor of Arts) magna cum laude from Radcliffe in 1898.\nJohns Hopkins School of Medicine.\nWilliam James, who had become a committed mentor to Stein at Radcliffe, recognizing her intellectual potential, and declaring her his \"most brilliant woman student\", encouraged Stein to enroll in medical school. Although Stein professed no interest in either the theory or practice of medicine, she enrolled at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1897. In her fourth year, Stein failed an important course, lost interest, and left. Ultimately, medical school had bored her, and she had spent many of her evenings not applying herself to her studies, but taking long walks and attending the opera.\nStein's tenure at Johns Hopkins was marked by challenges and stress. Men dominated the medical field, and the inclusion of women in the profession was not unreservedly or unanimously welcomed. Writing of this period in her life (in \"Things As They Are\", 1903) Stein often revealed herself as a depressed young woman dealing with a paternalistic culture, struggling to find her own identity, which she realized could not conform to the conventional female role. Her uncorseted physical appearance and eccentric mode of dress aroused comment and she was described as \"Big and floppy and sandaled and not caring a damn.\" According to Linda Wagner-Martin, Stein's \"controversial stance on women's medicine caused problems with the male faculty\" and contributed to her decision to leave without finishing her degree.\nAsked to give a lecture to a group of Baltimore women in 1899, Stein gave a controversial speech titled \"The Value of College Education for Women\", undoubtedly designed to provoke the largely middle-class audience. In the lecture Stein maintained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;average middle class woman [supported by] some male relative, a husband or father or brother...[is] not worth her keep economically considered. [This economic dependence caused her to become] oversexed...adapting herself to the abnormal sex desire of the male...and becoming a creature that should have been first a human being and then a woman into one that is a woman first and always.\u2014\u200a\nWhile a student at Johns Hopkins and purportedly still na\u00efve about sexual matters, Stein experienced an awakening of her latent sexuality. Sometime in 1899 or 1900, she became infatuated with Mary Bookstaver who was involved in a relationship with a medical student, Mabel Haynes. Witnessing the relationship between the two women served for Stein as her \"erotic awakening\". The unhappy love triangle demoralized Stein, arguably contributing to her decision to abandon her medical studies. In 1902, Stein's brother Leo Stein left for London, and Gertrude followed. The following year the two relocated to Paris, where Leo hoped to pursue an art career.\nArt collection.\nFrom 1903 until 1914, when they dissolved their common household, Gertrude and her brother Leo shared living quarters near the Luxembourg Gardens on the Left Bank of Paris in a two-story apartment (with the adjacent studio) located on the interior courtyard at 27 rue de Fleurus, 6th arrondissement. Here they accumulated the works of art that formed a collection that became renowned for its prescience and historical importance.\nThe gallery space was furnished with imposing Renaissance-era furniture from Florence, Italy. The paintings lined the walls in tiers trailing many feet to the ceiling. Initially illuminated by gaslight, the artwork was later lit by electric light shortly prior to World War I.\nLeo Stein cultivated important art world connections, enabling the Stein holdings to grow over time. The art historian and collector Bernard Berenson hosted Gertrude and Leo in his English country house in 1902, facilitating their introduction to Paul C\u00e9zanne and the dealer Ambroise Vollard. Vollard was heavily involved in the C\u00e9zanne art market, and he was the first important contact in the Paris art world for both Leo and Gertrude.\nThe joint collection of Gertrude and Leo Stein began in late 1904 when Michael Stein announced that their trust account had accumulated a balance of 8,000 francs. They spent this at Vollard's Gallery, buying Gauguin's \"Sunflowers\" and \"Three Tahitians\", C\u00e9zanne's \"Bathers\", and two Renoirs.\nThe art collection increased and the walls at Rue de Fleurus were rearranged continually to make way for new acquisitions. In \"the first half of 1905\" the Steins acquired C\u00e9zanne's \"Portrait of Mme C\u00e9zanne\" and Delacroix's \"Perseus and Andromeda\". Shortly after the opening of the Salon d'Automne of 1905 (on October 18, 1905), the Steins acquired Matisse's \"Woman with a Hat\" and Picasso's \"Young Girl with a Flower Basket\". In 1906, Picasso completed \"Portrait of Gertrude Stein\", which remained in her collection until her death.\nHenry McBride (art critic for the \"New York Sun\") did much for Stein's reputation in the United States, publicizing her art acquisitions and her importance as a cultural figure. Of the art collection at 27 Rue de Fleurus, McBride commented: \"[I]n proportion to its size and quality... [it is] just about the most potent of any that I have ever heard of in history.\" McBride also observed that Gertrude \"collected geniuses rather than masterpieces. She recognized them a long way off.\"\nBy early 1906, Leo and Gertrude Stein's studio had many paintings by Henri Manguin, Pierre Bonnard, Pablo Picasso, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Honor\u00e9 Daumier, Henri Matisse, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Their collection was representative of two famous art exhibitions that took place during their residence together in Paris, and to which they contributed, either by lending their art or by patronizing the featured artists. The Steins' elder brother, Michael, and sister-in-law Sarah (Sally) acquired a large number of Henri Matisse paintings; Gertrude's friends from Baltimore, Claribel and Etta Cone, collected similarly, eventually donating their art collection, virtually intact, to the Baltimore Museum of Art.\nWhile numerous artists visited the Stein salon, many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at 27 Rue de Fleurus. Where Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, Matisse, and Picasso's works dominated Leo and Gertrude's collection, the collection of Michael and Sarah Stein emphasized Matisse. In April 1914 Leo relocated to Settignano, Italy, near Florence, and the art collection was divided. The division of the Steins' art collection was described in a letter by Leo:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The C\u00e9zanne apples have a unique importance to me that nothing can replace. The Picasso landscape is not important in any such sense. We are, as it seems to me on the whole, both so well off now that we needn't repine. The C\u00e9zannes had to be divided. I am willing to leave you the Picasso oeuvre, as you left me the Renoir, and you can have everything except that. I want to keep the few drawings that I have. This leaves no string for me, it is financially equable either way for estimates are only rough &amp; ready methods, &amp; I'm afraid you'll have to look upon the loss of the apples as an act of God. I have been anxious above all things that each should have in reason all that he wanted, and just as I was glad that Renoir was sufficiently indifferent to you so that you were ready to give them up, so I am glad that Pablo is sufficiently indifferent to me that I am willing to let you have all you want of it.\nLeo departed with sixteen Renoirs and, relinquishing the Picassos and most of Matisse to his sister, took only a portrait sketch Picasso had done of him. He remained dedicated to C\u00e9zanne, nonetheless, leaving all the artist's works with his sister, taking with him only a C\u00e9zanne painting of \"5 apples\". The split between brother and sister was acrimonious. Stein did not see Leo Stein again until after World War I, and then through only a brief greeting on the street in Paris. After this accidental encounter, they never saw or spoke to each other again. The Steins' holdings were dispersed eventually by various methods and for various reasons.\nAfter her and Leo's households separated in 1914, Stein continued to collect examples of Picasso's art, which had turned to Cubism, a style Leo did not appreciate. At her death, Gertrude's remaining collection emphasized the artwork of Picasso and Juan Gris, most of her other pictures having been sold.\nGertrude Stein's personality has dominated the provenance of the Stein art legacy. It was, however, her brother Leo who was the astute art appraiser. Alfred Barr Jr., the founding director of New York's Museum of Modern Art, said that between the years of 1905 and 1907, \"[Leo] was possibly the most discerning connoisseur and collector of 20th-century painting in the world.\" After the artworks were divided between the two Stein siblings, it was Gertrude who moved on to champion the works of what proved to be lesser talents in the 1930s. She concentrated on the work of Juan Gris, Andr\u00e9 Masson, and Sir Francis Rose. In 1932, Stein asserted: \"Painting now after its great period has come back to be a minor art.\"\nIn 1945, in a preface for the first exhibition of Spanish painter Francisco Riba Rovira (who painted a portrait of her), Stein wrote:I explained that for me, all modern painting is based on what C\u00e9zanne nearly made, instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make. When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed with the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and war, and Matisse concealed and insisted at the same time that C\u00e9zanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played, and tormented all these things.\nThe only one who wanted to insist on this problem was Juan Gris. He persisted by deepening the things which C\u00e9zanne wanted to do, but it was too hard a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what C\u00e9zanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.\n27 rue de Fleurus: The Stein salon.\nThe gatherings in the Stein home \"brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art\". Dedicated attendees included Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, Gavin Williamson, Thornton Wilder, Sherwood Anderson, Francis Cyril Rose, Bob Brown, Ren\u00e9 Crevel, \u00c9lisabeth de Gramont, Francis Picabia, Claribel Cone, Mildred Aldrich, Jane Peterson, Carl Van Vechten, Henri Matisse and Georges Braque. Saturday evenings had been set as the fixed day and time for formal congregation so Stein could work at her writing uninterrupted by impromptu visitors.\nIt was Stein's partner Alice who became the de facto hostess for the wives and girlfriends of the artists in attendance, who met in a separate room. From \"Alice Entertained the Wives\" (New York Times, 1977): \" 'I am a person acted upon, not a person who acts,' Alice told one of Gertrude's biographers (...) When guests showed up, Alice was called upon to entertain their wives. The ladies were, of course, 'second\u2010class citizens' \"\nGertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, as people began visiting to see his paintings and those of C\u00e9zanne: \"Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.\"\nAmong Picasso's acquaintances who frequented the Saturday evenings were: Fernande Olivier (an artists\u2019 model in a relationship with Picasso), Georges Braque (artist), Andr\u00e9 Derain (artist), Max Jacob (poet), Guillaume Apollinaire (poet and art critic), Marie Laurencin (artist, in a relationship with Apollinaire), Henri Rousseau (painter), and Joseph Stella (painter).\nHemingway frequented Stein's salon, but the two had an uneven relationship. They began as close friends, with Hemingway admiring Stein as a mentor, but they later grew apart, especially after Stein called Hemingway \"yellow\" in \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.\" Upon the birth of his son, Hemingway asked Stein to be the godmother of his child. While Stein has been credited with inventing the term \"Lost Generation\" for those whose defining moment in time and coming of age had been World War I and its aftermath, there are at least three versions of the story that led to the phrase, two by Hemingway and one by Stein.\nDuring the summer of 1931, Stein advised the young composer and writer Paul Bowles to go to Tangier, where she and Alice had vacationed.\nIn 1938, Stein and Toklas moved from the rue de Fleurus to 5 rue Christine in the 6th arrondissement. For much of the war they sheltered in a house they had rented for several years in the hamlet of Bilignin in the commune of Belley (Ain), which was initially outside the area of direct German occupation in the \"Zone libre\".\nLiterary style.\nStein's writing can be placed in three categories: \"hermetic\" works best illustrated by \"The Making of Americans: The Hersland Family\"; popularized writing such as \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\"; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which \"Brewsie and Willie\" is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, libretti, and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\"; \"Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle\"; about her childhood home in Oakland, \"There is no there there\"; and \"The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.\"\nA reader wrote to Stein in 1933 asking her to explain the rose quotation received a reply from Toklas as her secretary: \"The device rose is a rose is a rose is a rose means just that. Miss Stein is unfortunately too busy herself to be able to tell you herself, but trusts that you will eventually come to understand that each and every word that she writes means exactly what she says, for she says very exactly what she means, and really nothing more, but, of course, nothing less.\"\nThese stream-of-consciousness experiments, rhythmical essays or \"portraits\", were designed to evoke \"the excitingness of pure being\" and can be seen as literature's answer to visual art styles and forms such as Cubism, plasticity, and collage. Many of the experimental works such as \"Tender Buttons\" have since been interpreted by critics as a feminist reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein's work on \"automatic writing\" with William James, she did not see her work as automatic, but as an 'excess of consciousness'.\nThough Stein collected cubist paintings, especially those of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of C\u00e9zanne. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: \"the whole field of the canvas is important\". Rather than a figure/ground relationship, \"Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other.\" It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: \"[T]he important thing... is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality.\"\nHer use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the \"bottom nature\" of her characters, such as in \"The Making of Americans\" where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as \"As I was saying\" and \"There will be now a history of her.\" Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with \"too much association\". Social judgment is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear, and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative. Stein's work was included in the second issue of 0 to 9 magazine, a journal which explored language and meaning-making during the 1960s avant garde movement.\nStein predominantly used the present progressive tense, creating a continuous presence in her work, which Grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles, especially commonality and centeredness. Grahn describes \"play\" as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience: \"rather than the emotional manipulation that is a characteristic of linear writing, Stein uses \"play\".\" In addition, Stein's work is funny, and multilayered, allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements. Lastly, Grahn argues that one must \"\"inster\"stand... engage with the work, to mix with it in an active engagement, rather than 'figuring it out.' Figure it in.\" In 1932, using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience, she wrote \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\"; the book would become her first best-seller. Despite the title, it was actually Stein's autobiography. The style was quite similar to that of \"The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook\", which was written by Toklas. Many critics speculated that Toklas actually had written \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\", despite Toklas repeatedly denying authorship.\nSeveral of Stein's writings have been set to music by composers, including Virgil Thomson's operas \"Four Saints in Three Acts\" and \"The Mother of Us All\", and James Tenney's setting of \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\" as a canon dedicated to Philip Corner, beginning with \"a\" on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. \"a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose.\"\nLiterary career.\nWhile living in Paris, Stein began submitting her writing for publication. Her earliest writings were mainly retellings of her college experiences. Her first critically acclaimed publication was \"Three Lives\". In 1911, Mildred Aldrich introduced Stein to Mabel Dodge Luhan and they began a short-lived but fruitful friendship during which the wealthy Mabel Dodge promoted Gertrude's legend in the United States.\nMabel was enthusiastic about Stein's sprawling publication \"The Makings of Americans\" and, at a time when Stein had much difficulty selling her writing to publishers, privately published 300 copies of \"Portrait of Mabel Dodge at Villa Curonia\". Dodge was also involved in the publicity and planning of the 69th Regiment Armory Show in 1913, \"the first avant-garde art exhibition in America\".\nIn addition, she wrote the first critical analysis of Stein's writing to appear in America, in \"Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose\", published in a special March 1913 publication of \"Arts and Decoration\". Foreshadowing Stein's later critical reception, Dodge wrote in \"Speculations\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In Gertrude Stein's writing every word lives and, apart from concept, it is so exquisitely rhythmical and cadenced that if we read it aloud and receive it as pure sound, it is like a kind of sensuous music. Just as one may stop, for once, in a way, before a canvas of Picasso, and, letting one's reason sleep for an instant, may exclaim: \"It \"is\" a fine pattern!\" so, listening to Gertrude Stein's words and forgetting to try to understand what they mean, one submits to their gradual charm.\nStein and Carl Van Vechten, the noted critic and photographer, became acquainted in Paris in 1913. The two became lifelong friends, devising pet names for each other: Van Vechten was \"Papa Woojums\", and Stein, \"Baby Woojums\". Van Vechten served as an enthusiastic champion of Stein's literary work in the United States, in effect becoming her American agent.\nAmerica (1934\u20131935).\nIn October 1934, Stein arrived in America after a 30-year absence. Disembarking from the ocean liner in New York, she encountered a throng of reporters. Front-page articles on Stein appeared in almost every New York City newspaper. As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able to get a sense of the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An electric sign in Times Square announced to all that \"Gertrude Stein Has Arrived.\" Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Among other sites, Stein visited Civil War battlefields, toured Chicago with homicide detectives, saw a football game in New Haven, dined in New Orleans, visited Scott Fitzergald and Zelda Sayre in Baltimore, and returned to her childhood home in Oakland.\nStein's tour was partly to give public lectures, and she prepared each individually; the audiences were limited to five hundred attendees. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.\nStein's effectiveness as a lecture speaker received varying evaluations. At the time, some maintained that \"Stein's audiences by and large did not understand her lectures.\" Some of those in the psychiatric community weighed in, judging that Stein suffered from a speech disorder, palilalia, which caused her \"to stutter over words and phrases\". The predominant feeling, however, was that Stein was a compelling presence, a fascinating personality who could hold listeners with the \"musicality of her language\".\nIn Washington, D.C. Stein was invited to have tea with the President's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. In Beverly Hills, California, she visited actor and filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, who reportedly discussed the future of cinema with her. Stein left America in May 1935, a newly minted American celebrity with a commitment from Random House, who had agreed to become the American publisher for all of her future works. The \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" wrote after Stein's return to Paris: \"No writer in years has been so widely discussed, so much caricatured, so passionately championed.\"\nBooks.\n\"Q.E.D\"..\nStein completed \"Q.E.D.\", her first novel, on October 24, 1903. One of the earliest coming out stories, it is about a romantic affair involving Stein and her friends Mabel Haynes, Grace Lounsbury and Mary Bookstaver, and occurred between 1897 and 1901 while she was studying at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. \n\"Fernhurst\" (1904).\nIn 1904, Stein began \"Fernhurst\", a fictional account of a scandalous three-person romantic affair involving a dean (M. Carey Thomas), a faculty member from Bryn Mawr College (Mary Gwinn) and a Harvard graduate (Alfred Hodder). Mellow asserts that \"Fernhurst\" \"is a decidedly minor and awkward piece of writing\". It includes some commentary that Gertrude mentioned in her autobiography when she discussed the \"fateful twenty-ninth year\" during which:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All the forces that have been engaged through the years of childhood, adolescence and youth in confused and ferocious combat range themselves in ordered ranks (and during which) the straight and narrow gateway of maturity, and life which was all uproar and confusion narrows down to form and purpose, and we exchange a great dim possibility for a small hard reality.\nAlso in our American life where there is no coercion in custom and it is our right to change our vocation so often as we have desire and opportunity, it is a common experience that our youth extends through the whole first twenty-nine years of our life and it is not till we reach thirty that we find at last that vocation for which we feel ourselves fit and to which we willingly devote continued labor.\nMellow observes that, in 1904, 30-year-old Gertrude \"had evidently determined that the 'small hard reality' of her life would be writing\".\n\"Three Lives\" (1905\u20131906).\nStein attributed the inception of \"Three Lives\" to the inspiration she received from a portrait C\u00e9zanne had painted of his wife and which was in the Stein collection. She credited this as a revelatory moment in the evolution of her writing style. Stein described:\nShe began \"Three Lives\" during the spring of 1905 and finished it the following year.\n\"The Making of Americans\" (1902\u20131911).\nGertrude Stein stated the date for her writing of \"The Making of Americans\" was 1906\u20131908. Her biographer has uncovered evidence that it actually began in 1902 and did not end until 1911. Stein compared her work to James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and to Marcel Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\". Her critics were less enthusiastic about it. Stein wrote the bulk of the novel between 1903 and 1911, and evidence from her manuscripts suggests three major periods of revision during that time. The manuscript remained mostly hidden from public view until 1924 when, at the urging of Ernest Hemingway, Ford Madox Ford agreed to publish excerpts in the \"Transatlantic Review\". In 1925, the Paris-based Contact Press published a limited run of the novel consisting of 500 copies. A much-abridged edition was published by Harcourt Brace in 1934, but the full version remained out of print until Something Else Press republished it in 1966. In 1995, a new, definitive edition was published by Dalkey Archive Press with a foreword by William Gass.\nGertrude's \"Matisse\" and \"Picasso\" descriptive essays appeared in Alfred Stieglitz's August 1912 edition of \"Camera Work\", a special edition devoted to Picasso and Matisse, and represented her first publication. Of this publication, Gertrude said, \"[h]e was the first one that ever printed anything that I had done. And you can imagine what that meant to me or to any one.\"\nWord Portraits (1908\u20131913).\nStein's descriptive essays apparently began with her essay of Alice B. Toklas, \"a little prose vignette, a kind of happy inspiration that had detached itself from the torrential prose of \"The Making of Americans\"\". Stein's early efforts at word portraits are catalogued by Mellow and under individual's names in Kellner, 1988. Matisse and Picasso were subjects of early essays, later collected and published in \"Geography and Plays\" and \"Portraits and Prayers\".\nHer subjects included several ultimately famous personages, and her subjects provided a description of what she observed in her Saturday salons at 27 Rue de Fleurus: \"Ada\" (Alice B. Toklas), \"Two Women\" (The Cone sisters, Claribel Cone and Etta Cone), \"Miss Furr and Miss Skeene\" (Ethel Mars and Maud Hunt Squire), \"Men\" (Hutchins Hapgood, Peter David Edstrom, Maurice Sterne), \"Matisse\" (1909, Henri Matisse), \"Picasso\" (1909, Pablo Picasso), \"Portrait of Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia\" (1911, Mabel Dodge Luhan), and \"Guillaume Apollinaire\" (1913).\n\"Tender Buttons\" (1912).\n\"Tender Buttons\" is the best known of Stein's \"hermetic\" works. It is a small book separated into three sections\u2014\"Food\", \"Objects\" and \"Rooms\", each containing prose under subtitles. Its publication in 1914 caused a great dispute between Mabel Dodge Luhan and Stein, because Mabel had been working to have it published by another publisher. Mabel wrote at length about what she viewed as the bad choice of publishing it with the press Gertrude selected. Evans wrote Gertrude:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Claire Marie Press... is absolutely third rate, &amp; in bad odor here, being called for the most part 'decadent\" and Broadwayish and that sort of thing... I think it would be a pity to publish with [Claire Marie Press] \"if\" it will emphasize the idea in the opinion of the public, that there is something degenerate &amp; effete &amp; decadent about the whole of the cubist movement which they \"all\" connect you with, because, hang it all, as long as they don't understand a thing they think all sorts of things. My feeling in this is quite strong.\nStein ignored Mabel's exhortations and published 1,000 copies of the book in 1914. An antiquarian copy was valued at over $1,200 in 2007. It is currently in print, and was re-released as \"Tender Buttons: The Corrected Centennial Edition\" by City Lights Publishers in March 2014.\nIn an interview with in \"A Transatlantic Interview \u2013 1946\", Stein insisted that this work was completely \"realistic\" in the tradition of Gustave Flaubert, stating the following: \"I used to take objects on a table, like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen.\" Commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the \"reference\" of objects remained central to her work, although the \"representation\" of them had not. Scholar Marjorie Perloff had said of Stein that \"[u]nlike her contemporaries (Eliot, Pound, Moore), she does not give us an image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know.\"\n\"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\" (1933).\nThe publication of \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\" lifted Gertrude Stein from literary obscurity to almost immediate celebrity in the United States. Although popular with the American public, Stein received considerable backlash from individuals portrayed in her book. Eugene Jolas, editor of the avant-garde journal \"Transition\", published a pamphlet titled \"Testimony against Gertrude Stein\" in which artists such as Henri Matisse and Georges Braque expressed their objections to Stein's portrayal of the Parisian community of artists and intellectuals. Braque, in his response, criticized, \"she had entirely misunderstood cubism which she sees simply in terms of personalities\".\n\"Four in America\" (1947).\nPublished posthumously by Yale University Press in 1947, with an introduction by Thornton Wilder, \"Four in America\" creates alternative biographies of Ulysses S. Grant as a religious leader, Wilbur Wright as a painter, George Washington as a novelist, and Henry James as a military general.\nAlice B. Toklas.\nStein met her life partner Alice B. Toklas on September 8, 1907, on Toklas's first day in Paris, at Sarah and Michael Stein's apartment. On meeting Stein, Toklas wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;She was a golden brown presence, burned by the Tuscan sun and with a golden glint in her warm brown hair. She was dressed in a warm brown corduroy suit. She wore a large round coral brooch and when she talked, very little, or laughed, a good deal, I thought her voice came from this brooch. It was unlike anyone else's voice\u2014deep, full, velvety, like a great contralto's, like two voices.\nSoon thereafter, Stein introduced Toklas to Pablo Picasso at his Bateau-Lavoir studio, where he was at work on \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\".\nIn 1908, they summered in Fiesole, Italy, Toklas staying with Harriet Lane Levy, the companion of her trip from the United States, and her housemate until Alice moved in with Stein and Leo in 1910. That summer, Stein stayed with Michael and Sarah Stein, their son Allan, and Leo in a nearby villa. Gertrude and Alice's summer of 1908 is memorialized in images of the two of them in Venice, at the piazza in front of Saint Mark's.\nToklas arrived in 1907 with Harriet Levy, with Toklas maintaining living arrangements with Levy until she moved to 27 Rue de Fleurus in 1910. In an essay written at the time, Stein humorously discussed the complex efforts, involving much letter-writing and Victorian niceties, to extricate Levy from Toklas's living arrangements. In \"Harriet\", Stein considers Levy's nonexistent plans for the summer, following her nonexistent plans for the winter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;She said she did not have any plans for the summer. No one was interested in this thing in whether she had any plans for the summer. That is not the complete history of this thing, some were interested in this thing in her not having any plans for the summer... Some who were not interested in her not having made plans for the summer were interested in her not having made plans for the following winter. She had not made plans for the summer and she had not made plans for the following winter... There was then coming to be the end of the summer and she was then not answering anything when any one asked her what were her plans for the winter.\nDuring the early summer of 1914, Stein bought three paintings by Juan Gris: \"Roses\", \"Glass and Bottle\", and \"Book and Glasses\". Soon after she purchased them from Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's gallery, the Great War began, Kahnweiler's stock was confiscated and he was not allowed to return to Paris. Gris, who before the war had entered a binding contract with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Stein attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of \"Three Lives\", to spend a few weeks there, and then journey to Spain. They left Paris on July 6, 1914, and returned on October 17. When Britain declared war on Germany, Stein and Toklas were visiting Alfred North Whitehead in England. After a supposed three-week trip to England that stretched to three months due to the War, they returned to France, where they spent the first winter of the war.\nWith money acquired from the sale of Stein's last Matisse \"Woman with a Hat\" to her brother Michael, she and Toklas vacationed in Spain from May 1915 through the spring of 1916. During their interlude in Majorca, Spain, Gertrude continued her correspondence with Mildred Aldrich who kept her apprised of the War's progression, and eventually inspired Gertrude and Alice to return to France to join the war effort.\nToklas and Stein returned to Paris in June 1916, and acquired a Ford automobile with the help of associates in the United States; Gertrude learned to drive it with the help of her friend William Edwards Cook. Gertrude and Alice then volunteered to drive supplies to French hospitals, in the Ford they named \"Auntie\", \"after Gertrude's aunt Pauline, 'who always behaved admirably in emergencies and behaved fairly well most times if she was flattered.'\"\nDuring the 1930s, Stein and Toklas became famous with the 1933 mass-market publication of \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\". She and Alice had an extended lecture tour in the United States during this decade. They also spent several summers in the town of Bilignin, in the Ain district of eastern France situated in the picturesque region of the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes. The two women doted on their beloved poodle named \"Basket\" whose successor, \"Basket II\", comforted Alice in the years after Gertrude's death.\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Stein and Toklas relocated to a country home that they had rented for many years previously in Bilignin, Ain, in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region. Stein and Alice, who were both Jewish, escaped persecution probably because of their friendship to Bernard Fa\u00ff who was a collaborator with the Vichy regime and had connections to the Gestapo, or possibly because Stein was an American and a famous author. Stein's book \"Wars I Have Seen\" written before the German surrender and before the liberation of German concentration camps, likened the German army to Keystone Cops. When Fa\u00ff was sentenced to hard labor for life after the war, Stein and Alice campaigned for his release. Several years later, Toklas would contribute money to Fa\u00ff's escape from prison. After the war, Stein was visited by many young American soldiers. The August 6, 1945, issue of \"Life\" magazine featured a photo of Stein and American soldiers posing in front of Hitler's bunker in Berchtesgaden. They are all giving the Nazi salute and Stein is wearing the traditional Alpine cap, accompanied by the text: \"Off We All Went To See Germany.\"\nIn the 1980s, a cabinet in the Yale University Beinecke Library, which had been locked for an indeterminate number of years, was opened and found to contain some 300 love letters written by Stein and Toklas. They were made public for the first time, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Stein's endearment for Toklas was \"Baby Precious\", in turn Stein was for Toklas, \"Mr. Cuddle-Wuddle\".\nLesbian relationships.\nStein is the author of one of the earliest coming out stories, \"Q.E.D.\" (published in 1950 as \"Things as They Are\"), written in 1903 and suppressed by the author. The story, written during travels after leaving college, is based on a three-person romantic affair in which she became involved while studying at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. The affair was complicated, as Stein was less experienced with the social dynamics of romantic friendship as well as her own sexuality and any moral dilemmas regarding it. Stein maintained at the time that she detested \"passion in its many disguised forms\". The relationships of Stein's acquaintances Mabel Haynes and Grace Lounsbury ended as Haynes started one with Mary Bookstaver (also known as May Bookstaver). Stein became enamored of Bookstaver but was unsuccessful in advancing their relationship. Bookstaver, Haynes, and Lounsbury all later married men.\nStein began to accept and define her pseudo-masculinity through the ideas of Otto Weininger's \"Sex and Character\" (1906). Weininger, though Jewish by birth, considered Jewish men effeminate and women as incapable of selfhood and genius, except for female homosexuals who may approximate masculinity. As Stein equated genius with masculinity, her position as a female and an intellectual becomes difficult to synthesize and modern feminist interpretations of her work have been called into question.\nMore positive affirmations of Stein's sexuality began with her relationship with Alice B. Toklas. Ernest Hemingway describes how Alice was Gertrude's \"wife\" in that Stein rarely addressed his (Hemingway's) wife, and he treated Alice the same, leaving the two \"wives\" to chat.\nThe more affirming essay \"Miss Furr and Miss Skeene\" is one of the first homosexual revelation stories to be published. The work, like \"Q.E.D.\", is informed by Stein's growing involvement with a homosexual community, though it is based on lesbian partners Maud Hunt Squire and Ethel Mars. The work contains the word \"gay\" over 100 times, perhaps the first published use of the word \"gay\" in reference to same-sex relationships and those who have them. A similar essay of gay men begins more obviously with the line \"Sometimes men are kissing\" but is less well known.\nIn \"\" Stein comments on lesbian sexuality and the work abounds with \"highly condensed layers of public and private meanings\" created by wordplay including puns on the words \"box\", \"cow\", and in titles such as \"tender buttons\".\n\"There is no there there\".\nAlong with Stein's widely known \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\" quotation, \"there is no there there\" is one of her most famous. It appears in her work \"Everybody's Autobiography\" (Random House 1937, p.\u00a0289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated what she really meant when she said this in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the farmland had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue).\nStein wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;She took us to see her granddaughter who was teaching in the Dominican convent in San Raphael, we went across the bay on a ferry, that had not changed but Goat Island might just as well not have been there, anyway what was the use of my having come from Oakland it was not natural to have come from there yes write about it if I like or anything if I like but not there, there is no there there.\n... but not there, there is no there there. ... Ah Thirteenth Avenue was the same it was shabby and overgrown. ... Not of course the house, the house the big house and the big garden and the eucalyptus trees and the rose hedge naturally were not there any longer existing, what was the use ...\nIt is a funny thing about addresses where you live. When you live there you know it so well that it is like an identity a thing that is so much a thing that it could not ever be any other thing and then you live somewhere else and years later, the address that was so much an address that it was like your name and you said it as if it was not an address but something that was living and then years after you do not know what the address was and when you say it is not a name anymore but something you cannot remember. That is what makes your identity not a thing that exists but something you do or do not remember.\nPolitical views.\nStein was a vocal critic of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal.\nSome have stressed Stein's lesbian, feminist, pro-immigration, and democratic politics, although her statements on immigration need to be seen in context of the time and world events. In a 1934 interview published in \"The New York Times\", she stated: That is the reason why I do not approve of the stringent immigration laws in America today. We need the stimulation of new blood. It is best to favor healthy competition. There is no reason why we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance. But if we shut down on immigration completely we shall become stagnant. The French may not like the competition of foreigners, but they let them in. They accept the challenge and derive the stimulus. I am surprised that there is not more discussion of immigration in the United States than there is. We have got rid of prohibition restrictions, and it seems to me the next thing we should do is to relax the severity of immigration restrictions. \nStein expressed admiration for Vichy leader Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain. Some have argued for a more nuanced view of Stein's collaborationist activity, arguing that it was rooted in her wartime predicament and status as a Jew in Nazi-occupied France. Similarly, Stein commented in 1938 on Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky: \"There is too much fathering going on just now and there is no doubt about it fathers are depressing.\"\nA poem entitled \"The Reverie of the Zionist\" appears in Stein's posthumous collection \"Painted Lace and Other Pieces\". The scholar Barbara Will has described \"The Reverie of the Zionist\" as \"an obscure and fragmentary modernist dialogue.\" The poem includes the following lines:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;While identified with the modernist movements in art and literature, Stein's political affiliations were a mix of reactionary and progressive ideas. She was outspoken in her hostility to some liberal reforms of progressive politics. To Stein, the Industrial Revolution had acted as a negative societal force, disrupting stability, degrading values, and subsequently affecting cultural decline. Stein idealized the 18th century as the golden age of civilization, epitomized in America as the era of its founding fathers and what was in France, the glory of its pre-revolutionary Ancien R\u00e9gime. At the same time, she was pro-immigrant, pro-democratic, and anti-patriarchal. Her last major work was the libretto of the feminist opera \"The Mother of Us All\" (1947) about the socially progressive suffragette movement and another work from this time, \"Brewsie and Willie\" (1946), expressed strong support for American G.I.s.\nWorld War II activities.\nA compendium of source material confirms that Stein may have been able to save her life and sustain her lifestyle through the protection of powerful Vichy government official Bernard Fa\u00ff. Stein had met Fa\u00ff in 1926, and he became her \"dearest friend during her life\", according to Alice B. Toklas. Fa\u00ff had been the primary translator of Stein's work into French and subsequently masterminded her 1933\u201334 American book tour, which gave Stein celebrity status and proved to be a highly successful promotion of her memoir, \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\". Fa\u00ff's influence was instrumental in avoiding Nazi confiscation of Stein's historically significant and monetarily valuable collection of artwork, which throughout the war years was housed in Stein's Paris rue Christine apartment, under locked safeguard.\nIn 1941, at Fa\u00ff's suggestion, Stein consented to translate into English some 180 pages of speeches made by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain. In her introduction, Stein crafts an analogy between George Washington and P\u00e9tain. She writes of the high esteem in which P\u00e9tain is held by his countrymen; France respected and admired the man who had struck an armistice with Hitler. Conceived and targeted for an American readership, Stein's translations were ultimately never published in the United States. Random House publisher Bennett Cerf had read the introduction Stein had written for the translations and was horrified by what she had produced.\nAlthough Jewish, Stein collaborated with Vichy France, a regime that deported more than 75,000 Jews to Nazi concentration camps, of whom only three percent survived the Holocaust. In 1944, Stein wrote that P\u00e9tain's policies were \"really wonderful so simple so natural so extraordinary\". This was Stein's contention in the year when the town of Culoz, where she and Toklas resided, saw the removal of its Jewish children to Auschwitz. It is difficult to say, however, how aware Stein was of these events. As she wrote in \"Wars I Have Seen\", \"However near a war is it is always not very near. Even when it is here.\" Stein had stopped translating Petain's speeches three years previously, in 1941.\nStein was able to condemn the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor while simultaneously maintaining the dissonant acceptance of Hitler as conqueror of Europe. Journalist Lanning Warren interviewed Stein in her Paris apartment in a piece published in \"The New York Times Magazine\" on May 6, 1934. Stein, seemingly ironically, proclaimed that Hitler merited the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThe Saxon element is always destined to be dominated. The Germans have no gift at organizing. They can only obey. And obedience is not organization. Organization comes from community of will as well as community of action. And in America, our democracy has been based on community of will and effort... I say Hitler ought to have the peace prize ... because he is removing all elements of contest and struggle from Germany. By driving out the Jews and the democratic Left elements, he is driving out everything that conduces to activity. That means peace.\nGiven that after the war Stein commented that the only way to ensure world peace was to teach the Germans disobedience, this 1934 Stein interview has come to be interpreted as an ironic jest made by a practiced iconoclast hoping to gain attention and provoke controversy. In an effort to correct popular mainstream misrepresentations of Stein's wartime activity, a dossier of articles by critics and historians has been gathered for the online journal \"Jacket2\".\nHow much of Stein's wartime activities were motivated by the real exigencies of self-preservation in a dangerous environment can only be speculated upon. However, her loyalty to P\u00e9tain may have gone beyond expedience. She had been urged to leave France by American embassy officials, friends and family when that possibility still existed, but declined to do so. In an essay written for the \"Atlantic Monthly\" in November 1940, Stein wrote about her decision not to leave France: \"it would be awfully uncomfortable and I am fussy about my food.\" Stein continued to praise P\u00e9tain after the war ended, this at a time when P\u00e9tain had been sentenced to death by a French court for treason.\nAuthor Djuna Barnes provided a caustic assessment of Stein's book, \"Wars I Have Seen\": \"You do not feel that she [Stein] is ever really worried about the sorrows of the people. Her concerns at its highest pitch is a well-fed apprehension.\"\nOthers have argued that some of the accounts of Stein's wartime activities have amounted to a \"witch hunt\".\nDeath.\nStein died on July 27, 1946, at the age of 72 after surgery for stomach cancer at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. She was interred in Paris in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. Later Alice B. Toklas was buried alongside her. Famously, one version of her last moments reports that, before having been taken into surgery, Stein asked her partner Toklas: \"What is the answer?\" After Toklas replied to Stein that there was no answer, Stein countered by sinking back into her bed, murmuring: \"Then, there is no question!\"\nHer companion Toklas, however, has given two other versions of the encounter\u2014neither of which agrees with the \"canonical\" version above. Writing in the June 2005 edition of \"The New Yorker\", Janet Malcolm describes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Stein named writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten as her literary executor, and he helped to publish works of hers that remained unpublished at the time of her death.\nCritical reception.\nSherwood Anderson in his public introduction to Stein's 1922 publication of \"Geography and Plays\" wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For me the work of Gertrude Stein consists in a rebuilding, an entirely new recasting of life, in the city of words. Here is one artist who has been able to accept ridicule, who has even forgone the privilege of writing the great American novel, uplifting our English speaking stage, and wearing the bays of the great poets to go live among the little housekeeping words, the swaggering bullying street-corner words, the honest working, money-saving words and all the other forgotten and neglected citizens of the sacred and half-forgotten city.\nIn a private letter to his brother Karl, Anderson said, \"As for Stein, I do not think her too important. I do think she had an important thing to do, not for the public, but for the artist who happens to work with words as his material.\nJames Thurber wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Anyone who reads at all diversely during these bizarre 1920s cannot escape the conclusion that a number of crazy men and women are writing stuff which remarkably passes for important composition among certain persons who should know better. Stuart P. Sherman, however, refused to be numbered among those who stand in awe and admiration of one of the most eminent of the idiots, Gertrude Stein. He reviews her \"Geography and Plays\" in the August 11 issue of the \"Literary Review\" of the \"New York Evening Post\" and arrives at the conviction that it is a marvellous and painstaking achievement in setting down approximately 80,000 words which mean nothing at all.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The interesting writer is where there is an adversary, a problem. Why Stein is not, finally, a good or helpful writer. There is no problem. It's all affirmation. A rose is a rose is a rose.\"\nSusan Sontag , \"Journals and Notebooks, 1964\u20131980\"\nIn his 1938 biographical novel \"The Green Fool,\" Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh describes the works of Gertrude Stein fondly as being \"like whisky to me; her strange rhythms broke up the clich\u00e9 formation of my thought\".\nLegacy and commemoration.\nStein has been the subject of many artistic works.\nIn 1982 on PBS, Stein was portrayed by Pat Carroll in the one-woman play \"Gertrude Stein, Gertrude Stein, Gertrude Stein\" by Marty Martin.\nIn Bryant Park, in New York City, there is cast replica of sculptor Jo Davidson's bronze bust of Stein. The original, created in 1923, is now in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art.\nComposers Florence Wickham and Marvin Schwartz used Stein's text for their operetta \"Look and Long\".\nIn 2005, playwright/actor Jade Esteban Estrada portrayed Stein in the solo musical \"ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 1\" at Princeton University. In 2006, theatre director/actor Luiz P\u00e4etow created his solo, \"Plays\", portraying Stein's 1934 homonymous lecture, and toured Brazil for several years. \"Loving Repeating\" is a musical by Stephen Flaherty based on the writings of Gertrude Stein. Stein and Toklas are both characters in the eight-person show. Stein is a central character in Nick Bertozzi's 2007 graphic novel \"The Salon\".\nThe posthumously published \"Journals of Ayn Rand\" contain several highly hostile references to Stein. From Rand's working notes for her novel \"The Fountainhead\", it is clear that the character Lois Cook in that book was intended as a caricature of Stein.\nStein (played by Bernard Cribbins) and Toklas (played by Wilfrid Brambell) were depicted in the Swedish 1978 absurdist fiction film \"Picassos \u00e4ventyr\" \"(The Adventures of Picasso)\" by director Tage Danielsson, with G\u00f6sta Ekman as Picasso.\nStein was portrayed in the 2011 Woody Allen film \"Midnight in Paris\" by Kathy Bates, and by Tracee Chimo in the 2018 season of the television series \"Genius\" which focuses on the life and career of Pablo Picasso.\n\"Waiting for the Moon\", a movie starring Linda Bassett that was released in 1987. \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\", a TV series starring Alice Dvor\u00e1kov\u00e1 that was released in 1993.\nStein is added to a list of great artists and notables in the popular Broadway musical \"Rent\" in the song \"La Vie Boheme\".\nShe is also mentioned in the Fred Astaire\u2013Ginger Rogers 1935 film \"Top Hat\" and in the song \"Roseability\" by the Scottish rock group Idlewild.\nComposer Ricky Ian Gordon and librettist Royce Vavrek's opera \"27\" about Stein and Toklas premiered at Opera Theatre of St. Louis in June 2014 with Stephanie Blythe as Stein.\nIn 2014 Stein was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields\".\nEdward Einhorn wrote the play \"The Marriage of Alice B. Toklas by Gertrude Stein\", a farce about their fantasy marriage that also told the story of their life. It premiered in May 2017 at HERE Arts Center in New York.\nThe 2018 artwork \"Words Doing As They Want to Do\" by Eve Fowler involved recording trans and lesbian Californians reading Stein's 1922 work called \"Miss Furr and Miss Skeene\".\nThe Gertrude Stein Society (GSS) at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, an organization for LGBTQ+ students at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, is named after her.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In a career spanning more than four decades, he also wrote poetry, plays, lectures, book reviews, editorials, and magazine sketches.\nHarte moved from California to the eastern U.S. and later to Europe. He incorporated new subjects and characters into his stories, but his Gold Rush tales have been those most often reprinted, adapted, and admired.\nEarly life.\nHarte was born in 1836 in Albany, New York. He was named after his great-grandfather, Francis Brett. When he was young, his father, Henry, changed the spelling of the family name from Hart to Harte. Henry's father was Bernard Hart, an Orthodox Jewish immigrant who flourished as a merchant, becoming one of the founders of the New York Stock Exchange. Bret's mother, Elizabeth Rebecca Ostrander Hart, was from the English and Dutch culture and raised her child in a Dutch Reformed church. Later, Francis preferred to be known by his middle name, but he spelled it with only one \"t\", becoming Bret Harte. Harte was of French Huguenot and Dutch ancestry and descended from prominent New York landowner Francis Rombouts.\nAn avid reader as a boy, Harte published his first work at age 11, a satirical poem titled \"Autumn Musings\", now lost. Rather than attracting praise, the poem garnered ridicule from his family. As an adult, he recalled to a friend, \"Such a shock was their ridicule to me that I wonder that I ever wrote another line of verse.\"\nHarte's formal schooling ended when he was 13, in 1849.\nCareer in California.\nHarte moved to California in 1853, later working there in a number of capacities, including miner, teacher, messenger, and journalist; he was also secretary of the San Francisco Mint. He spent part of his life in the northern California coastal town of Union (now Arcata), a settlement on Humboldt Bay, as a tutor and school teacher, then a printer's devil on \"The Northern Californian\",&lt;ref name=\"humboldt/SusieBakerFountain\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to reporting news, writing poems, and occasionally, acting editor. He left after three years, due to receiving lynching threats for writing an editorial about the 26 February 1860 Wiyot massacre.&lt;ref name=\"humboldthistory/harte\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nUnion was established as a provisioning center for mining camps in the interior.\nThe \"Wells Fargo Messenger\" of July 1916 relates that after an unsuccessful attempt to make a living in the gold camps, Harte signed on as a messenger with Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Express. He guarded treasure boxes on stagecoaches for a few months, then gave it up to become the schoolmaster at a school near the town of Sonora, in the Sierra foothills. He created his character Yuba Bill from his memory of an old stagecoach driver.\nAmong Harte's first literary efforts was a poem published in \"The Golden Era\" in 1857 and, in October of that same year, his first prose piece on \"A Trip Up the Coast\". In the spring of 1860 he was hired as editor of \"The Golden Era\", which he attempted to make into a more literary publication. Mark Twain later recalled that, as an editor, Harte struck \"a new and fresh and spirited note\" which \"rose above that orchestra's mumbling confusion and was recognizable as music\".\nThe 1860 massacre of between 80 and 200 Wiyot Indians at the village of Tuluwat (near Eureka in Humboldt County, California) was reported by Harte in San Francisco and New York. While serving as assistant editor of the \"Northern Californian\",&lt;ref name=\"britannica/Bret-Harte\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harte was left in charge of the paper during the temporary absence of his boss, Stephen G. Whipple. Harte published a detailed account condemning the slayings, writing: \n[A] more shocking and revolting spectacle was never exhibited to the eyes of a Christian and civilized people. Old women, wrinkled and decrepit, lay weltering in blood, their brains dashed out and dabbled with their long gray hair. Infants scarce a span long, with their faces cloven with hatchets and their bodies ghastly with wounds.\nAfter he published the editorial, Harte's life was threatened, and he was forced to flee one month later. Harte quit his job and moved to San Francisco, where an anonymous letter published in a city paper describing widespread community approval of the massacre was attributed to him. In addition, no one was ever brought to trial, despite the evidence of a planned attack and of references to specific individuals, including a rancher named Larabee and other members of the unofficial militia called the Humboldt Volunteers.\nHarte married Anna Griswold on August 11, 1862, in San Rafael, California. From the start, the marriage was rocky. Some suggested that she was consumed by extreme jealousy, while early Harte biographer Henry C. Merwin privately concluded that she was \"almost impossible to live with\".\nThe well-known minister Thomas Starr King recommended Harte to James T. Fields, editor of the prestigious magazine \"The Atlantic Monthly\", which published Harte's first short story in October 1863. In 1864, Harte joined with Charles Henry Webb in starting a new literary journal called \"The Californian\". He became friends with and mentored poet Ina Coolbrith.\nIn 1865, Harte was asked by bookseller Anton Roman to edit a book of California poetry; it was to be a showcase of the finest California writers. When the book, called \"Outcroppings\", was published, it contained only 19 poets, many of them Harte's friends (including Ina Coolbrith and Charles Warren Stoddard). The book caused some controversy, as Harte used the preface as a vehicle to attack California's literature, blaming the state's \"monotonous climate\" for its bad poetry. While the book was widely praised in the East, many newspapers and poets in the West took umbrage at his remarks.\nIn 1868, Harte became editor of \"The Overland Monthly\", another new literary magazine, published by Roman Anton with the intention of highlighting local writings. The \"Overland Monthly\" was more in tune with the pioneering spirit of excitement in California. Harte's short story \"The Luck of Roaring Camp\" appeared in the magazine's second issue, propelling him to fame nationwide and in Europe.\nWhen word of Charles Dickens's death reached Harte in July 1870, he immediately sent a dispatch across the bay to San Francisco to hold back the forthcoming issue of the \"Overland Monthly\" for 24 hours so that he could compose the poetic tribute \"Dickens in Camp\".\nHarte's fame increased with the publication of his satirical poem \"Plain Language from Truthful James\" in the September 1870 issue of the \"Overland Monthly\". The poem became better known by its alternate title \"The Heathen Chinee\" after being republished in a Boston newspaper in 1871. It was also quickly republished in a number of other newspapers and journals, including the \"New York Evening Post\", the \"New York Tribune\", the \"Boston Evening Transcript\", the \"Providence Journal\", the \"Hartford Courant\", \"Prairie Farmer\", and \"The Saturday Evening Post\". The poem was a fictional representation of attacks on Chinese immigrants and Harte intended to the reader to sympathize with the victim, the character Ah Sin. Instead, readers identified with the attacker, the character William Nye.24 Harte later referred to the piece as \"the worst poem I ever wrote, possibly the worst poem anyone ever wrote.\"24\nLike \"Plain Language from Truthful James\", Harte's 1874 short story \"Wan Lee, the Pagan\" also sought to undermine stereotypes about Chinese immigrants and to portray white Americans as the true savages.24\nMove east.\nHarte was determined to pursue his literary career and traveled back east with his family in 1871 to New York and eventually to Boston, where he contracted with the publisher of \"The Atlantic Monthly\" for an annual salary of $10,000, \"an unprecedented sum at the time\". His popularity waned and, by the end of 1872, he was without a publishing contract and increasingly desperate. He spent the next few years struggling to publish new work or republish old and delivering lectures about the gold rush. The winter of 1877\u201378 was particularly hard for him and his family. He recalled it as a \"hand-to-mouth life\" and wrote to his wife Anna, \"I don't know\u2014looking back\u2014what ever kept me from going down, in \"every way\", during that awful December and January\".\nSome time between 1872 and 1881, Harte rented the Willows, a Morristown, New Jersey mansion then owned by Union general and author Joseph Warren Revere. Harte's time in Morristown inspired him to write an 1877 historical romance novel, \"Thankful Blossom.\"\nAfter months of soliciting for such a role, Harte accepted the position of United States Consul in the town of Krefeld, Germany, in May 1878. Mark Twain had been a friend and supporter of Harte's until a substantial falling out, and he had previously tried to block any appointment for Harte. In a letter to William Dean Howells, he complained that Harte would be an embarrassment to the United States because, as he wrote, \"Harte is a liar, a thief, a swindler, a snob, a sot, a sponge, a coward, a Jeremy Diddler, he is brim full of treachery... To send this nasty creature to puke upon the American name in a foreign land is too much\". Eventually, Harte was given a similar role in Glasgow in 1880. In 1885 he settled in London. Throughout his time in Europe, he regularly wrote to his wife and children and sent monthly financial contributions. He declined to invite them to join him, nor did he return to the United States to visit them. His excuses were usually related to money. During the 24 years that he spent in Europe, he never abandoned writing and maintained a prodigious output of stories that retained the freshness of his earlier work. Among his writings of this time were parodies and satires of other writers, including \"The Stolen Cigar-Case\" featuring ace detective \"Hemlock Jones\", which Ellery Queen praised as \"probably the best parody of Sherlock Holmes ever written\".\nHe died in Camberley, England, in 1902 of throat cancer and is buried at Frimley. His wife Anna (n\u00e9e Griswold) Harte died on August 2, 1920. The couple lived together only 16 of the 40 years that they were married.\nReception.\nIn 1878, Andrew Carnegie praised Harte in \"Round the World\" as uniquely American, likely alluding to his regionalism:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"A whispering pine of the Sierras transplanted to Fifth Avenue! How could it grow? Although it shows some faint signs of life, how sickly are the leaves! As for fruit, there is none. America had in Bret Harte its most distinctively national poet.\"\nRudyard Kipling also showed himself to be an admirer of Harte's writing. In \"From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel\", while in San Francisco Kipling wrote:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"A reporter asked me what I thought of the city, and I made answer suavely that it was hallowed ground to me because of Bret Harte. That was true: 'Well,' said the reporter, 'Bret Harte claims California, but California don't claim Bret Harte...' He could not understand that to the outside world the city was worth a great deal less than the man.\"\nMark Twain characterized him and his writing as insincere. Writing in his autobiography four years after Harte's death, Twain criticized the miners' dialect used by Harte, claiming that it never existed outside of his imagination. Additionally, Twain accused Harte of \"borrowing\" money from his friends with no intention of repaying it and of financially abandoning his wife and children. He referred repeatedly to Harte as \"The Immortal Bilk\".\nSelected works.\nParodies.\nHarte's short story collections \"Condensed Novels (1867)\" and \"Condensed Novels: Second Series New Burlesques (1902)\" are parodies of contemporaneous writers and novels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n The Outcasts of Poker Flat"}

Initially, separate award categories were established for black-and-white films and color films. Since the merger of the two categories in 1967, the Academy has traditionally avoided giving out the award to films with a contemporary setting.\nAward.\nThe Academy Award for Best Costume Design is given out annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences for the best achievement of film costume design of the previous year. Films that are eligible for the award must meet a series of criteria, including the requirement that the costumes must have been \"conceived\" by a costume designer. For this particular criteria, each submission is reviewed by the costume designer members of the Art Directors Branch prior to the ballot process. Further rules include that the nominee(s) be only the principal costume designer(s), that the five films that receive the highest number of votes will become the ceremony's nominations for final voting, and that the final voting will only be undertaken by active and life members of the academy.\nHistory.\nThe Academy Award for Best Costume Design was first given out at the 21st Academy Awards, held on March 24, 1949. The award had two subcategories, one for films in black and white and one for films in color. At the 30th Academy Awards, held on March 26, 1958, these two subcategories were merged into one, which was the result of the academy reducing the number of competitive categories from 30 to 24. The 32nd Academy Awards saw the category again be split into two for recognition of both black and white and color film. Eight years later, the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, along with two other awards, were each combined into their own single category recognizing achievement in film.\nFrom 1949 to 1966, most Academy Awards for Best Costume Design in Black and White were given to a contemporary movie. On the other hand, epics, fantasies, and musicals dominated the color category. Since the merger into one singular category for color films in 1967, films set in modern times have won only three times. The three contemporary-set winners have been \"Travels with My Aunt\", \"All That Jazz\", and \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\". All other winners during this period have been set in the past or in a science-fiction or fantasy setting.\nWinners and nominees.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0indicates the winner\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nShortlisted finalists.\nFinalists for Best Costume Design were selected by branch members, who voted for ten finalists which were screened to determine the five nominees.\nMultiple wins and nominations.\nThe following 96 designers have received multiple nominations for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design.

It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.\nThe 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into \"Dramatic\" and \"Comedy\" categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for \"7th Heaven\" and \"Two Arabian Knights\", respectively. However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies. Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the academy.\nFor the first eleven years of the Academy Awards, directors were allowed to be nominated for multiple films in the same year. However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" and \"Four Daughters\", at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony. That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for \"Erin Brockovich\" and \"Traffic\" in 2000, winning the award for the latter.\nThe Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 91 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 70 won the award. The award has been criticised in recent years for failing to recognise female directors. Of the 257 individual directors nominated in the history of the award, only 9 have been women; and only 3 of the 76 winners have been women.\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 74 different directors or directing teams. As of the 97th Academy Awards ceremony, American filmmaker Sean Baker is the most recent winner in this category for his work on \"Anora\".\nWinners and nominees.\nIn the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County, California; the ceremonies are always held the following year. For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned twelve months from August 1 to July 31. For the 6th ceremony held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933. Since the 7th ceremony held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In current U.S. naval thinking, such a ship would initially be controlled manually by an Aegis Cruiser, although plans that have long since been scrapped included control by AEW&amp;C aircraft such as the E-2 Hawkeye and E-3 Sentry.\nHistory.\nOriginally proposed by VADM Joseph Metcalf, DCNO Surface Warfare, as a component of the \"Surface Combatants of the 21st Century\" initiative in the mid-1980's. Later, proposed by the U.S. Navy in 1996, the arsenal ship had funding problems, with the United States Congress canceling some funding, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) providing some funding to individual contractors for prototypes. Some concept artwork of the Arsenal Ship was produced, with some images bearing the number \"72\", possibly hinting at an intent to classify the arsenal ships as a battleship, since the last battleship ordered (but never built) was USS \"Louisiana\" (BB-71).\nThe arsenal ship would have a small crew and as many as 500 vertical launch tubes for missiles to provide ship-to-shore bombardment for invading troops. The Navy calculated a $450 million price for the arsenal ship, but Congress scrapped funding for the project in 1998.\nThe U.S. Navy has since modified the four oldest Trident submarines to SSGN configuration, allowing them to carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles using vertical launching systems installed in the tubes which previously held strategic ballistic missiles, creating a vessel roughly equivalent to the arsenal ship concept.\nIn 2013, Huntington Ingalls Industries revived the idea when it proposed a Flight II version of the LPD-17 hull with a variant carrying up to 288 VLS cells for the ballistic missile defense and precision strike missions.\nChina has conducted studies and tested models of partially and completely submersible arsenal ship concepts. South Korea is also planning to deploy three arsenal ships by the late 2020s. These South Korean arsenal ships are designated \"Joint Strike Ships\", or \"JSS\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62013", "revid": "50663144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62013", "title": "Guillaume Apollinaire", "text": "French poet and writer (1880\u20131918)\nGuillaume Apollinaire (; ; born Kostrowicki; 26 August 1880 \u2013 9 November 1918) was a Polish-French poet, playwright, short story writer, novelist and art critic of Polish, Swiss and Italian descent.\nApollinaire is considered one of the foremost poets of the early 20th century, as well as one of the most impassioned defenders of Cubism and a forefather of Surrealism. He is credited with coining the term \"Cubism\" in 1911 to describe the emerging art movement, the term Orphism in 1912, and the term \"Surrealism\" in 1917 to describe the works of Erik Satie. He wrote poems without punctuation, in his attempt to be resolutely modern in both form and subject. Apollinaire wrote one of the earliest Surrealist literary works, the play \"The Breasts of Tiresias\" (1917), which became the basis for Francis Poulenc's 1947 opera \"Les mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias\".\nInfluenced by Symbolist poetry in his youth, he was admired during his lifetime by the young poets who later formed the nucleus of the Surrealist group (Breton, Aragon, Soupault). He revealed very early on an originality that freed him from any school of influence and made him one of the precursors of the literary revolution of the first half of the 20th century. His art is not based on any theory, but on a simple principle: the act of creating must come from the imagination, from intuition, because it must be as close as possible to life, to nature, to the environment, and to the human being.\nApollinaire was also active as a journalist and art critic for \"Le Matin\", \"L'Intransigeant\", \"L'Esprit nouveau\", \"Mercure de France\", and \"Paris Journal\". In 1912 Apollinaire cofounded \"Les Soir\u00e9es de Paris\", an artistic and literary magazine.\nTwo years after being wounded in World War I, Apollinaire died during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and was recognized as \"Fallen for France\" (\"Mort pour la France\") because of his commitment during the war.\nLife.\nFamily and early life.\nWilhelm Albert W\u0142odzimierz Apolinary Kostrowicki was born in Rome, Italy, and was raised speaking French, Italian, and Polish. He emigrated to France in his late teens and adopted the name Guillaume Apollinaire. His mother, born Angelika Kostrowicka, was a Polish-Lithuanian noblewoman born near Navahrudak, Grodno Governorate (former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, present-day Belarus). His maternal grandfather participated in the 1863 uprising against occupying Russia and had to emigrate when the uprising failed. Apollinaire's father is unknown but may have been Francesco Costantino Camillo Flugi d'Aspermont (born 1835), a Graub\u00fcnden aristocrat who disappeared early from Apollinaire's life. Francesco Flugi d'Aspermont was a nephew of Conradin Flugi d'Aspermont (1787\u20131874), a poet who wrote in Ladin Put\u00e8r (an official language dialect of Switzerland spoken in Upper Engadin), and perhaps also descendant of the Minnes\u00e4nger Oswald von Wolkenstein (born c. 1377, died 2 August 1445; see \"Les anc\u00eatres Grisons du po\u00e8te Guillaume Apollinaire\" at Geneanet).\nParis.\nApollinaire eventually moved from Rome to Paris in 1900 and became one of the most popular members of the artistic community of Paris (both in Montmartre and Montparnasse). His friends and collaborators in that period included Pablo Picasso, Henri Rousseau, Gertrude Stein, Max Jacob, Andr\u00e9 Salmon, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Faik Konitza, Blaise Cendrars, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Pierre Reverdy, Alexandra Exter, Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie, Ossip Zadkine, Marc Chagall, Marcel Duchamp and Jean Metzinger. He became romantically involved with Marie Laurencin, who is often identified as his muse. While there, he dabbled in anarchism and spoke out as a Dreyfusard in defense of Dreyfus's innocence.\nMetzinger painted the first Cubist portrait of Apollinaire. In his \"Vie anecdotique\" (16 October 1911), the poet proudly writes: \"I am honoured to be the first model of a Cubist painter, Jean Metzinger, for a portrait exhibited in 1910 at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants.\" It was not only the first Cubist portrait, according to Apollinaire, but it was also the first great portrait of the poet exhibited in public, prior to others by Louis Marcoussis, Amedeo Modigliani, Mikhail Larionov and Picasso.\nIn 1911 Apollinaire joined the Puteaux Group, a branch of the Cubist movement soon to be known as the Section d'Or. He delivered the opening address of the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or \u2014 the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition.\nOn 7 September 1911, police arrested and jailed Apollinaire on suspicion of aiding and abetting the theft of the \"Mona Lisa\" and a number of Egyptian statuettes from the Louvre, but released him a week later. The theft of the statues had been committed in 1907 by a former secretary of Apollinaire, Honor\u00e9 Joseph G\u00e9ry Pieret, who had recently returned one of the stolen statues to the French newspaper the \"Paris-Journal\". Apollinaire implicated his friend Picasso, who had bought Iberian statues from Pieret, and who was also brought in for questioning in the theft of the \"Mona Lisa\", but he was also exonerated. In fact, the theft of the \"Mona Lisa\" was perpetrated by Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian house painter who acted alone and was only caught two years later when he tried to sell the painting in Florence.\nCubism.\nApollinaire wrote the preface for the first Cubist exposition outside of Paris; \"VIII Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants\", Brussels, 1911. In an open-handed preface to the catalogue of the Brussels Ind\u00e9pendants show, Apollinaire stated that these 'new painters' accepted the name of Cubists which has been given to them. He described Cubism as a new manifestation and high art [\"manifestation nouvelle et tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e de l'art\"], not a system that constrains talent [\"non-point un syst\u00e8me contraignant les talents\"], and the differences which characterize not only the talents but even the styles of these artists are an obvious proof of this. The artists involved with this new movement, according to Apollinaire, included Pablo Picasso (who represented Apollinaire in his \"Three Musicians\" painting), Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Fernand L\u00e9ger, and Henri Le Fauconnier. By 1912 others had joined the Cubists: Jacques Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Francis Picabia, Juan Gris, and Roger de La Fresnaye, among them. Apollinaire prophesized that Marcel Duchamp could reconcile art and the people.\nOrphism.\nThe term Orphism was coined by Apollinaire at the Salon de la Section d'Or in 1912, referring to the works of Robert Delaunay and Franti\u0161ek Kupka. During his lecture at the Section d'Or exhibit Apollinaire presented three of Kupka's abstract works as perfect examples of \"pure painting\", as anti-figurative as music.\nIn \"Les Peintres Cubistes, M\u00e9ditations Esth\u00e9tiques\" (1913) Apollinaire described Orphism as \"the art of painting new totalities with elements that the artist does not take from visual reality, but creates entirely by himself. [...] An Orphic painter's works should convey an \"untroubled aesthetic pleasure\", but at the same time a \"meaningful structure and sublime significance\". According to Apollinaire Orphism represented a move towards a completely new art-form, much as music was to literature. In 2025, New York's Guggenheim Museum mounted a major retrospective on Orphism, an oft-overlooked artistic movement.\nSurrealism.\nThe term Surrealism was first used by Apollinaire concerning the ballet \"Parade\" in 1917. The poet Arthur Rimbaud wanted to be a visionary, to perceive the hidden side of things within the realm of another reality. In continuity with Rimbaud, Apollinaire went in search of a hidden and mysterious reality. The term \"surrealism\" appeared for the first time in March 1917 (Chronologie de Dada et du surr\u00e9alisme, 1917) in a letter by Apollinaire to Paul Derm\u00e9e: \"All things considered, I think in fact it is better to adopt surrealism than supernaturalism, which I first used\" [\"Tout bien examin\u00e9, je crois en effet qu'il vaut mieux adopter surr\u00e9alisme que surnaturalisme que j'avais d'abord employ\u00e9\"].\nHe described \"Parade\" as \"a kind of surrealism\" (\"une sorte de surr\u00e9alisme\") when he wrote the program note the following week, thus coining the word three years before Surrealism emerged as an art movement in Paris.\nWorld War I and death.\nApollinaire served as an infantry officer in World War I and, in 1916, received a serious shrapnel wound to the temple, from which he would never fully recover. He wrote \"Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias\" while recovering from this wound. During this period he coined the word \"Surrealism\" in the programme notes for Jean Cocteau and Erik Satie's ballet \"Parade\", first performed on 18 May 1917. He also published an artistic manifesto, \"L'Esprit nouveau et les po\u00e8tes\". Apollinaire's status as a literary critic is most famous and influential in his recognition of the Marquis de Sade, whose works were for a long time obscure, yet arising in popularity as an influence upon the Dada and Surrealist art movements going on in Montparnasse at the beginning of the twentieth century as, \"The freest spirit that ever existed.\" \nThe war-weakened Apollinaire died at the age of 38 on 9 November 1918 of influenza during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 ravaging Europe at the time, two years after being wounded in World War I. Due to his military service for the duration of the war, he was declared to have \"Died for France\" (\"Mort pour la France\") by the French government. He was interred in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.\nWorks.\nIn 1900 he wrote his first novel \"Mirely, ou le petit trou pas cher\" (pornographic), which was eventually lost. Apollinaire's first collection of poetry was \"L'enchanteur pourrissant\" (1909), but \"Alcools\" (1913) established his reputation. The poems, influenced in part by the Symbolists, juxtapose the old and the new, combining traditional poetic forms with modern imagery. In 1913, Apollinaire published the essay \"Les Peintres Cubistes, M\u00e9ditations Esth\u00e9tiques\" on the Cubist painters, a movement which he helped to define. He also coined the term \"orphism\" to describe a tendency towards absolute abstraction in the paintings of Robert Delaunay and others. In 1917, Apollinaire produced \"Peintures de L\u00e9opold Survage; Dessins et aquarelles d\u2019Ir\u00e8ne Lagut (Paintings by L\u00e9opold Survage; Drawings and Watercolors by Ir\u00e8ne Lagut),\" which is included in the permanent collection of P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami, in the United States. \nIn 1907 Apollinaire published the well-known erotic novel, \"The Eleven Thousand Rods\" (\"Les Onze Mille Verges\"). Officially banned in France until 1970, various printings of it circulated widely for many years. Apollinaire never publicly acknowledged authorship of the novel. Another erotic novel attributed to him was \"The Exploits of a Young Don Juan (Les exploits d'un jeune Don Juan)\", in which the 15-year-old hero fathers three children with various members of his entourage, including his aunt. Apollinaire's gift to Picasso of the original 1907 manuscript was one of the artist's most prized possessions. The book was made into a movie in 1986.\nShortly after his death, Mercure de France published \"Calligrammes\", a collection of his concrete poetry (poetry in which typography and layout adds to the overall effect), and more orthodox, though still modernist poems informed by Apollinaire's experiences in the First World War and in which he often used the technique of automatic writing.\nIn his youth Apollinaire lived for a short while in Belgium, mastering the Walloon dialect sufficiently to write poetry, some of which has survived.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences and sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for portraits and nudes in a modern style characterised by a surreal elongation of faces, necks, and figures \u2014 works that were not received well during his lifetime, but later became much sought after. Modigliani was born and spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1906, he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as Pablo Picasso and Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. By 1912, Modigliani was exhibiting highly stylised sculptures with Cubists of the Section d'Or group at the Salon d'Automne.\nModigliani's oeuvre includes paintings and drawings. From 1909 to 1914, he devoted himself mainly to sculpture. His main subjects were portraits and full figures, both in images and in the sculpture. Modigliani had little success while alive but after his death achieved great popularity. He died of tubercular meningitis, at the age of 35, in Paris.\nFamily and early life.\nModigliani was born into a Sephardic Jewish family in Livorno, Italy. A port city, Livorno had long served as a refuge for those persecuted for their religion, and was home to a large Jewish community. His maternal great-great-grandfather, Solomon Garsin, had immigrated to Livorno in the 18th century as a refugee.\nModigliani's mother, Eug\u00e9nie Garsin, born and raised in Marseille, was descended from an intellectual, scholarly family of Sephardic ancestry that for generations had lived along the Mediterranean coastline. Fluent in many languages, her ancestors were authorities on sacred Jewish texts and had founded a school of Talmudic studies. Family legend traced the family lineage to the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, but this is indeed a legend, since the philosopher had no children. The family business was money lending, with branches in Livorno, Marseille, Tunis, and London, though their fortunes ebbed and flowed.\nModigliani's father, Flaminio, was a member of an Italian Jewish family of successful businessmen and entrepreneurs. While not as culturally sophisticated as the Garsins, they knew how to invest in and develop thriving business endeavours. When the Garsin and Modigliani families announced the engagement of their children, Flaminio was a wealthy young mining engineer. He managed the mine in Sardinia and also managed the almost of timberland the family owned.\nA reversal in fortune occurred to this prosperous family in 1883. An economic downturn in the price of metal plunged the Modiglianis into bankruptcy. Ever resourceful, Modigliani's mother used her social contacts to establish a school and, along with her two sisters, made the school into a successful enterprise.\nAmedeo Modigliani was the fourth child, whose birth coincided with the disastrous financial collapse of his father's business interests. Amedeo's birth saved the family from ruin; according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or a mother with a newborn child. The bailiffs entered the family's home just as Eug\u00e9nie went into labour; the family protected their most valuable assets by piling them on top of her.\nModigliani had a close relationship with his mother, who taught him at home until he was 10. Beset with health problems after an attack of pleurisy when he was about 11, a few years later he developed a case of typhoid fever. When he was 16 he was taken ill again and contracted the tuberculosis that would later claim his life. After Modigliani recovered from the second bout of pleurisy, his mother took him on a tour of southern Italy: Naples, Capri, Rome and Amalfi, then north to Florence and Venice.\nHis mother was, in many ways, instrumental in his ability to pursue art as a vocation. When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: \"The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall have to wait and see what is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?\"\nArt student years.\nModigliani is known to have drawn and painted from a very early age, and thought himself \"already a painter\", his mother wrote, even before beginning formal studies. Despite her misgivings that launching him on a course of studying art would impinge upon his other studies, his mother indulged the young Modigliani's passion for the subject.\nAt the age of fourteen, while sick with typhoid fever, he raved in his delirium that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the Palazzo Pitti and the Uffizi in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the Italian Renaissance masters, the tales he had heard about the great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might never get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, Guglielmo Micheli.\nMicheli and the Macchiaioli.\nModigliani worked in Micheli's Art School from 1898 to 1900. Among his colleagues in that studio would have been Llewelyn Lloyd, Giulio Cesare Vinzio, Manlio Martinelli, Gino Romiti, Renato Natali, and Oscar Ghiglia. Here, his earliest formal artistic instruction took place in an atmosphere steeped in a study of the styles and themes of 19th-century Italian art. In his earliest Parisian work, traces of this influence, and that of his studies of Renaissance art, can still be seen. His nascent work was influenced by such Parisian artists as Giovanni Boldini and Toulouse-Lautrec.\nModigliani showed great promise while with Micheli, and ceased his studies only when he was forced to, by the onset of tuberculosis.\nIn 1901, whilst in Rome, Modigliani admired the work of Domenico Morelli, a painter of dramatic religious and literary scenes. Morelli had served as an inspiration for a group of iconoclasts who were known by the title \"the Macchiaioli\" (from \"macchia\"\u00a0\u2014\"dash of colour\", or, more derogatively, \"stain\"), and Modigliani had already been exposed to the influences of the Macchiaioli. This localised landscape movement reacted against the bourgeois stylings of the academic genre painters. While sympathetically connected to (and actually pre-dating) the French Impressionists, the Macchiaioli did not make the same impact upon international art culture as did the contemporaries and followers of Monet, and are today largely forgotten outside Italy.\nModigliani's connection with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli was not only a Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous Giovanni Fattori, a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterised the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint \"en plein air\", but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in caf\u00e9s, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist), Modigliani chose a proto-Cubist palette more akin to C\u00e9zanne than to the Macchiaioli.\nWhile with Micheli, Modigliani studied not only landscape, but also portraiture, still life, and the nude. His fellow students recall that the last was where he displayed his greatest talent, and apparently, this was not an entirely academic pursuit for the teenager: when not painting nudes, he was occupied with seducing the household maid.\nDespite his rejection of the Macchiaioli approach, Modigliani nonetheless found favour with his teacher, who referred to him as \"Superman\", a pet name reflecting the fact that Modigliani was not only quite adept at his art, but also that he regularly quoted from Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\". Fattori himself would often visit the studio and approve of the young artist's innovations.\nIn 1902, Modigliani continued what was to be a lifelong infatuation with life drawing, enrolling in the Scuola Libera di Nudo, or \"Free School of Nude Studies\", of the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. A year later, while still suffering from tuberculosis, he moved to Venice, where he registered to study at the Regia Accademia ed Istituto di Belle Arti. It is in Venice that he first smoked hashish and, rather than studying, began to spend time frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these lifestyle choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices do seem to be more than simple teenage rebellion, or the clich\u00e9d hedonism and bohemianism that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of Nietzsche.\nEarly literary influences.\nHaving been exposed to erudite philosophical literature as a young boy under the tutelage of Isaco Garsin, his maternal grandfather, he continued to read and be influenced through his art studies by the writings of Nietzsche, Baudelaire, Carducci, Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont, and others, and developed the belief that the only route to true creativity was through defiance and disorder.\nLetters that he wrote from his 'sabbatical' in Capri in 1901 clearly indicate that he is being more and more influenced by the thinking of Nietzsche. In these letters, he advised his friend Oscar Ghiglia;\n(hold sacred all) which can exalt and excite your intelligence... (and) ... seek to provoke ... and to perpetuate ... these fertile stimuli, because they can push the intelligence to its maximum creative power.\nThe work of Lautr\u00e9amont was equally influential at this time. This doomed poet's \"Les Chants de Maldoror\" became the seminal work for the Parisian Surrealists of Modigliani's generation, and the book became Modigliani's favourite to the extent that he learnt it by heart. The poetry of Lautr\u00e9amont is characterised by the juxtaposition of fantastical elements, and by sadistic imagery; the fact that Modigliani was so taken by this text in his early teens gives a good indication of his developing tastes. Baudelaire and D'Annunzio similarly appealed to the young artist, with their interest in corrupted beauty, and the expression of that insight through Symbolist imagery.\nModigliani wrote to Ghiglia extensively from Capri, where his mother had taken him to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani's mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, and it is likely that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like many precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.\nDear friend, I write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself. I am the prey of great powers that surge forth and then disintegrate ... A bourgeois told me today\u2013insulted me\u2013that I or at least my brain was lazy. It did me good. I should like such a warning every morning upon awakening: but they cannot understand us nor can they understand life...\nParis.\nArrival.\nIn 1906, Modigliani moved to Paris, then the focal point of the avant-garde. In fact, his arrival at the centre of artistic experimentation coincided with the arrival of two other foreigners who were also to leave their marks upon the art world: Gino Severini and Juan Gris.\nHe later befriended Jacob Epstein, with whom he aimed to set up a studio or Temple of Beauty to be enjoyed by all. Modigliani himself intended to create the drawings and paintings of the stone caryatids for 'The Pillars of Tenderness', which would support the imagined temple.\nModigliani squatted in the Bateau-Lavoir, a commune for penniless artists in Montmartre, renting himself a studio in Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists' quarter of Montmartre was characterized by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented\u2014initially, at least\u2014as one would expect the son of a family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to someone with a finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in his brown corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.\nWhen he first arrived in Paris, he wrote home regularly to his mother, sketched his nudes at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi, and drank wine in moderation. At that time, he was considered, by those who knew him, to be a bit reserved, verging on the asocial, and is noted to have commented, upon meeting Picasso, who at the time was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.\nTransformation.\nWithin a year of arriving in Paris, however, his demeanour and reputation had changed dramatically. He transformed himself from a dapper academician artist into a sort of prince of vagabonds.\nThe poet and journalist Louis Latourette, upon visiting the artist's previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered the place in upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked his life and his training up to that point.\nNot only did he remove all the trappings of his bourgeois heritage from his studio, but he also set about destroying practically all of his own early work, which he described as \"Childish baubles, done when I was a dirty bourgeois\".\nThe motivation for this violent rejection of his earlier self is the subject of considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition. Tuberculosis\u2014the leading cause of death in France by 1900\u2014was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.\nModigliani's use of drink and drugs intensified from about 1914 onward. After years of remission and recurrence, this was the period during which the symptoms of his tuberculosis worsened, signalling that the disease had reached an advanced stage.\nHe sought the company of artists such as Utrillo and Soutine, seeking acceptance and validation for his work from his colleagues. Modigliani's behavior stood out even in these Bohemian surroundings: he carried on frequent affairs, drank heavily, and used absinthe and hashish. While drunk, he would sometimes strip himself naked at social gatherings. He died in Paris, aged 35. He became the epitome of the tragic artist, creating a posthumous legend almost as well known as that of Vincent van Gogh.\nDuring the 1920s, in the wake of Modigliani's career and spurred on by comments by Andr\u00e9 Salmon crediting hashish and absinthe with the genesis of Modigliani's style, many hopefuls tried to emulate his \"success\" by embarking on a path of substance abuse and bohemian excess. Salmon claimed that whereas Modigliani was a totally pedestrian artist when sober, \"...from the day that he abandoned himself to certain forms of debauchery, an unexpected light came upon him, transforming his art. From that day on, he became one who must be counted among the masters of living art.\"\nSome art historians suggest that it is entirely possible that Modigliani would have achieved even greater artistic heights had he not been immured in, and destroyed by, his own self-indulgences.\nOutput.\nDuring his early years in Paris, Modigliani worked at a furious pace. He was constantly sketching, making as many as a hundred drawings a day. However, many of his works were lost\u2014destroyed by him as inferior, left behind in his frequent changes of address, or given to girlfriends who did not keep them.\nHe was first influenced by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, but around 1907 he became fascinated with the work of Paul C\u00e9zanne. Eventually, he developed his own unique style, one that cannot be adequately categorised with those of other artists.\nHe met the first serious love of his life, Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and although 21-year-old Anna had recently married, they began an affair. Anna was tall with dark hair, pale skin and grey-green eyes: she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other. After a year, however, Anna returned to her husband.\nMontparnasse, Paris.\nSculpture.\nIn 1909, Modigliani returned home to Livorno, sickly and tired from his wild lifestyle. But soon he was back in Paris, this time renting a studio in Montparnasse. He originally saw himself as a sculptor rather than a painter, and was encouraged to continue after Paul Guillaume, an ambitious young art dealer, took an interest in his work and introduced him to sculptor Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. He was Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i's disciple for one year.\nAlthough a series of Modigliani's sculptures were exhibited in the Salon d'Automne of 1912, by 1914 he abandoned sculpting and focused solely on his painting, a move precipitated by the difficulty in acquiring sculptural materials due to the outbreak of war, and by Modigliani's physical debilitation.\nIn June 2010, Modigliani's \"T\u00eate\", a limestone carving of a woman's head, became the third most expensive sculpture ever sold.\nFriends and influences.\nModigliani painted a series of portraits of contemporary artists and friends in Montparnasse: Cha\u00efm Soutine, Mo\u00efse Kisling, Pablo Picasso, Diego Rivera, Marie \"Marevna\" Vorobyev-Stebeslka, Juan Gris, Max Jacob, Jacques Lipchitz, Blaise Cendrars, and Jean Cocteau, all sat for stylized renditions. Modigliani painted Soutine's portrait several times when they lived together in the Cit\u00e9 Falgui\u00e8re around 1916.\nWar years.\nAt the outset of World War I, Modigliani tried to enlist in the army but was refused because of his poor health.\nKnown as \"Mod\u00ec\" (which plays on the French word 'maudit', meaning 'cursed') by many Parisians, but as \"Dedo\" to his family and friends, Modigliani was a handsome man and attracted much female attention. Women came and went until Beatrice Hastings entered his life. She stayed with him for almost two years, was the subject of several of his portraits, including \"Madame Pompadour\", and the object of much of his drunken wrath.\nWhen the British painter Nina Hamnett arrived in Montparnasse in 1914, on her first evening there the smiling man at the next table in the caf\u00e9 introduced himself as \"Modigliani, painter and Jew\". They became great friends.\nIn 1916, Modigliani befriended the Polish poet and art dealer L\u00e9opold Zborowski and his wife Anna. Zborowski became Modigliani's primary art dealer and friend during the artist's final years, helping him financially, and also organizing his show in Paris in 1917.\nPatronage of L\u00e9opold Zborowski.\n1917 Paris Show.\nThe several dozen nudes Modigliani painted between 1916 and 1919 constitute many of his best-known works. This series of nudes was commissioned by Modigliani's dealer and friend L\u00e9opold Zborowski, who lent the artist use of his apartment, supplied models and painting materials, and paid him between fifteen and twenty francs each day for his work.\nThe paintings from this arrangement were thus different from his previous depictions of friends and lovers in that they were funded by Zborowski either for his own collection, as a favour to his friend, or with an eye to their \"commercial potential\", rather than originating from the artist's personal circle of acquaintances.\nThe Paris show of 1917 was Modigliani's only solo exhibition during his life, and is \"notorious\" in modern art history for its sensational public reception and the attendant issues of obscenity. The show was closed by police on its opening day, but continued thereafter, most likely after the removal of paintings from the gallery's streetfront window.\n\"Nude Sitting on a Divan\" is one of a series of nudes painted by Modigliani in 1917 that created a sensation when exhibited in Paris that year. According to the catalogue description from the 2010 sale of the painting at Sotheby's, seven nudes were exhibited in the 1917 show.\n\"Nu couch\u00e9\" realized $170,405,000 at a Christie's, New York, sale on 9 November 2015, a record for a Modigliani painting and placing it high among the most expensive paintings ever sold.\nNice.\nOn a trip to Nice, which had been conceived and organised by Zborowski, Modigliani, Foujita, and other artists tried to sell their works to rich tourists. Modigliani managed to sell a few pictures, but only for a few francs each. Despite this, during this time he produced most of the paintings that later became his most popular and valued works.\nDuring his lifetime, he sold a number of his works, but never for any great amount of money. What funds he did receive soon vanished for his habits.\nJeanne H\u00e9buterne.\nIn the spring of 1917, the Ukrainian sculptor Chana Orloff introduced him to a 19-year-old art student named Jeanne H\u00e9buterne who had posed for Tsuguharu Foujita. From a conservative bourgeois background, H\u00e9buterne was renounced by her devout Roman Catholic family for her liaison with Jewish Modigliani, whom they saw as little more than a debauched derelict. Despite her family's objections, soon they were living together.\nModigliani ended his relationship with the English poet and art critic Beatrice Hastings. A short time later, H\u00e9buterne and Modigliani moved together into a studio on the Rue de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re. Jeanne began to pose for him and appears in several of his paintings. Jeanne H\u00e9buterne became a principal subject for Modigliani's art. Modigliani was known to be abusive towards his lovers. H\u00e9buterne was suffering from depression after becoming pregnant for the second time.\nTowards the end of the First World War, early in 1918, Modigliani left Paris with H\u00e9buterne to escape from the war and travelled to Nice and Cagnes-sur-Mer. They would spend a year in France. During that time, they had a busy social life with many friends, including Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pablo Picasso, Giorgio de Chirico and Andr\u00e9 Derain. After he and H\u00e9buterne moved to Nice on 29 November 1918, she gave birth to a daughter whom they named Jeanne (1918\u20131984). Modigliani already had a son from his relationship with Simone Thiroux, G\u00e9rard Thiroux (1917\u20132004), and at least two other extramarital children. In May 1919, they returned to Paris with their infant daughter and moved into an apartment on the rue de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re. \nH\u00e9buterne became pregnant again. Modigliani then got engaged to her, but Jeanne's parents were against the marriage, especially because of Modigliani's reputation as an alcoholic and drug user. However, Modigliani officially recognised her daughter as his child. The wedding plans were shattered independently of Jeanne's parents' resistance when Modigliani discovered he had a severe form of tuberculosis.\nDeath and funeral.\nAlthough he continued to paint, Modigliani's health deteriorated rapidly, and his alcohol-induced blackouts became more frequent.\nIn 1920, after not hearing from him for several days, a neighbour checked on the family and found Modigliani in bed, delirious and holding onto H\u00e9buterne. A doctor was summoned, but little could be done because Modigliani was in the final stage of his disease, tubercular meningitis. He died on 24 January 1920, at the H\u00f4pital de la Charit\u00e9.\nThere was an enormous funeral, attended by many from the artistic communities in Montmartre and Montparnasse. When Modigliani died, 21-year-old H\u00e9buterne was eight months pregnant with their second child. The day after Modigliani's death, H\u00e9buterne was taken to her parents' home. There, inconsolable, she threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, killing herself and her unborn child.\nModigliani was buried in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. H\u00e9buterne was buried at the Cimeti\u00e8re de Bagneux near Paris, and it was not until 1930 that her embittered family allowed her body to be moved to rest beside Modigliani. A single tombstone honours them both. His epitaph reads: \"Struck down by death at the moment of glory\". Hers reads: \"Devoted companion to the extreme sacrifice\".\nManaging only one solo exhibition in his life and giving his work away in exchange for meals in restaurants, Modigliani died destitute.\nLegacy.\nInfluences.\nThe linear form of African sculpture and the depictive humanism of the figurative Renaissance painters informed his work. Working during that fertile period of \"isms\", Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Modigliani did not choose to be categorised within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas and creating works not to shock and outrage, but to say, \"This is what I see.\"\nMore appreciated over the years by collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual avant-garde of the art world. One can say he recognised the merit of Jean Cocteau's proclamation: \"Ne t'attardes pas avec l'avant-garde\" (\"Don't wait with the avant-garde\"). Pseudo-goitre, a medical condition, is also known as Modigliani syndrome. This name was derived from the curved neck of women in Modigliani's paintings, which appeared like pseudogoitre.\nSince his death, Modigliani's reputation has soared. Nine novels, a play, a documentary, and three feature films have been devoted to his life. Modigliani's sister in Florence adopted his daughter, Jeanne (1918\u20131984). As an adult, she wrote a biography of her father titled \"Modigliani: Man and Myth\".\nCatalogues raisonn\u00e9s.\nThe Modigliani estate is one of the most problematic in the art world. There are at least five catalogues raisonn\u00e9s of the artist's work, including two volumes by Ambrogio Ceroni, last updated in 1972. Arthur Pfannstiel (1929 and 1956) and Joseph Lanthemann's (1970) books are widely dismissed today. Milanese scholar Osvaldo Patani produced three volumes: paintings (1991), drawings (1992) and one on the Paul Alexandre period (1994), while Christian Parisot has published Volumes I, II and IV (in 1970, 1971 and 1996) of a catalogue raisonn\u00e9.\nIn 2006, about 6,000 documents from the estate\u2014believed to be the only ones existing\u2014were moved permanently from France to Italy. Parisot, as president of the Modigliani Institut Archives L\u00e9gales in Rome, had the legal right to authenticate Modigliani's work. In 2013, Parisot was arrested by the Italian Art forgery unit after a two-year investigation (following a largely advertised exhibition in Catania, presenting original artworks); the police seized works attributed to the artist, along with suspect authenticity certificates.\nThe French art historian Marc Restellini is preparing Modigliani's catalogue raisonn\u00e9.\nThe Modigliani Project, headed by Dr. Kenneth Wayne, was founded in 2012 to aid in the researching of Modigliani artworks. As part of this endeavor the organization is preparing a new catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Modigliani's artwork.\nArt market.\nIn November 2010, a painting of a nude by Amedeo Modigliani, part of a series of nudes he created around 1917, sold for more than $68.9m (\u00a342.7m) at an auction in New York\u2014a record for the artist's work. Bidding for \"La Belle Romaine\" pushed its price well past its $40m (\u00a324.8m) estimate. Modigliani's previous auction record was 43.2m euros (\u00a335.8m), set earlier in 2010 in Paris. Another painting by the artist\u2014Jeanne H\u00e9buterne (au chapeau), one of the first portraits he painted of his lover\u2014sold for $19.1m (\u00a311.8m), much higher than its pre-sale estimate of $9\u201312m (\u00a35.6\u20137.4m).\nOn 9 November 2015 the 1917 painting \"Nu couch\u00e9\", sold at Christie's in New York for US$170.4 million. On 14 May 2018 the 1917 painting \"Nu couch\u00e9 (sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche)\" sold at Sotheby's in New York for $157.2 million. This was the highest auction price in Sotheby's history.\nForgeries.\nModigliani is one of the most faked artists in the world. Rising prices for works attributed to him as well as the legend surrounding his short life have fueled a market for forgeries of both paintings and sculptures. In 1984, students carved three stone heads in a Modigliani style, causing a sensation when they were \"discovered\" in a canal in Livorno, Italy. Experts claimed they were authentic until the students released a video they had filmed of themselves making the heads with a Black and Decker drill. In 2018 twenty fake Modiglianis were seized at an exhibition in Genoa. Famous art forgers such as Elmyr de Hory admitted to creating many fake Modiglianis. Experienced art dealers such as Klaus Perls were tricked into purchasing fake Modigliani statues. It has been estimated that most artworks attributed to Modigliani are actually forgeries.\nCinema.\nThree films have been made about Modigliani: \"Les Amants de Montparnasse\" (1958), directed by Jacques Becker and starring G\u00e9rard Philipe as Modigliani; and \"Modigliani\" (2004), directed by Mick Davis and starring Andy Garc\u00eda as Modigliani. In August 2022, Johnny Depp directed \"Mod\u00ec, Three Days on the Wing of Madness\", which he co-produced alongside Al Pacino and Barry Navidi, from a screenplay by Jerzy and Mary Kromolowski. Principal photography commenced in September 2023; the movie was released in 2024. In February 2025, it was announced that https:// is set to be released later in 2025. Directed by Diana Ringo and starring Edward Pishiyski, the film presents a modernised take on Modigliani\u2019s life.\nCritical reactions.\nIn 2011, Peter Schjeldahl, reviewing Meryle Secrest's book \"Modigliani: A Life\", wrote:\nI recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, to one of his long-necked women, with their piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the succulent color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever since I have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.\nSchjeldahl reports Secrest's speculation that Modigliani was happy to let people consider him an alcoholic and drug addict, \"and thus to mistake the symptoms of his tuberculosis, which he kept a secret. Drunks were tolerated; carriers of infectious diseases were not.\"\n \"See at Wikidata\"\nSelected works.\nSculptures.\nTwenty-seven sculptures by Modigliani are known to exist.\nReferences.\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62017", "revid": "38355222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62017", "title": "Pierre-Augustin de Beaumarchais", "text": "French playwright and diplomat (1732\u20131799)\nPierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais (; n\u00e9\u00a0Caron; 24 January 1732 \u2013 18 May 1799) was a French playwright and diplomat of the Age of Enlightenment. Best known for his three Figaro plays, at various times in his life he was also a watchmaker, inventor, musician, spy, publisher, arms dealer, and revolutionary (both French and American).\nBorn a Parisian watchmaker's son, Beaumarchais rose in French society and became influential in the court of Louis XV as an inventor and music teacher. He made a number of important business and social contacts, played various roles as a diplomat and spy, and had earned a considerable fortune before a series of costly court battles jeopardized his reputation.\nAn early French supporter of American independence, Beaumarchais lobbied the French government on behalf of the American rebels during the American War of Independence. Beaumarchais oversaw covert aid from the French and Spanish governments to supply arms and financial assistance to the rebels in the years before France's formal entry into the war in 1778. He later struggled to recover money he had personally invested in the scheme. Beaumarchais was also a participant in the early stages of the 1789 French Revolution.\nEarly life.\nBeaumarchais was born Pierre-Augustin Caron in the Rue Saint-Denis, Paris, on 24 January 1732, to Andr\u00e9-Charles Caron, a watchmaker from Meaux. The family had previously been Huguenot, but had converted to Roman Catholicism in the wake of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and the increased persecution of Protestants that followed. The family was comfortably middle-class and Beaumarchais had a peaceful and happy childhood. As the only son, he was spoiled by his parents and five sisters. He took an interest in music and played several instruments. In spite of his faith, Beaumarchais retained a sympathy for Protestants and would campaign throughout his life for their civil rights. \nOne of his sisters, Marie-Jos\u00e8phe Caron, became an artist; their cousin was the artist Suzanne Caron.\nFrom the age of ten, Beaumarchais had some education at a \"country school\", where he learned some Latin. At twelve, he left school to apprentice under his father in the craft of watchmaking. He may have used his own experiences during these years as the inspiration for the character of Cherubin when he wrote the \"Marriage of Figaro\". He generally neglected his work, and at one point was evicted by his father, only to be later allowed back after apologising for his poor behaviour.\nAt the time, pocket watches were commonly unreliable for timekeeping and were worn more as fashion accessories. Beaumarchais spent nearly a year researching improvements. In July 1753, at the age of twenty-one, he invented a watch escapement that made them substantially more accurate and compact.\nThe first man to take an interest in this new invention was Jean-Andr\u00e9 Lepaute, the royal clockmaker in France, whose work could be found in the Palais du Luxembourg, Tuileries Palace, the Palais-Royal, and the Jardin des plantes. Lepaute had become a mentor to Beaumarchais after discovering the boy's talent in a chance encounter in the Caron family shop. He encouraged him as he worked on the new invention, earned his trust, and promptly stole the idea for himself, writing a letter to the French Academy of Sciences describing the \"Lepaute system\". Beaumarchais was outraged when he read in the September issue of \"Le Mercure de France\" that M. Lepaute had just invented a wonderful mechanism for manufacturing a more portable clock, and wrote a strongly-worded letter to that same newspaper defending the invention as his own and urging the French Academy of Sciences to see the proof for themselves. \"In the interests of truth and my reputation,\" he says, \"I cannot let such an infidelity go by in silence and must claim as mine the invention of this device.\" Lepaute defended himself with a statement by three Jesuits maintaining he had shown them such a mechanism in May 1753.\nThe following February, the Academy indeed ruled in favor of Beaumarchais, catapulting him to stardom and relegating Lepaute to infamy, as \"l'affaire Lepaute\" became the talk of Paris. Soon afterwards, Beaumarchais was asked by King Louis XV to create a watch mounted on a ring for his mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Louis was so impressed by the result that he named Beaumarchais \"Purveyor to the King\", and the Caron family business prospered.\nRise to influence.\nMarriage and new name.\nIn 1755 Beaumarchais met Madeleine-Catherine Aubertin, a widow, and married her the following year. She helped him secure a royal office, and he gave up watchmaking. Shortly after his marriage, he adopted the name \"Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais\", which he derived from \"le Bois Marchais\", the name of a piece of land belonging to his wife. He believed the name sounded grander and more aristocratic, and adopted at the same time an elaborate coat of arms. Catherine died less than a year later, which plunged him into financial problems, and he ran up large debts.\nRoyal patronage.\nBeaumarchais' problems were eased when he was appointed to teach Louis XV's four daughters the harp. His role soon grew and he became a musical advisor for the royal family. In 1759, Caron met Joseph Paris Duverney, an older and wealthy entrepreneur. Beaumarchais assisted him in gaining the King's approval for the new military academy he was building, the \u00c9cole Royale Militaire, and in turn Duverney promised to help make him rich. The two became very close friends and collaborated on many business ventures. Assisted by Duverney, Beaumarchais acquired the title of Secretary-Councillor to the King in 1760\u201361, thereby gaining access to French nobility. This was followed by the purchase in 1763 of a second title, the office of Lieutenant General of Hunting, a position which oversaw the royal parks. Around this time, he became engaged to Pauline Le Breton, who came from a plantation-owning family from Saint-Domingue, but broke it off when he discovered she was not as wealthy as he had been led to believe.\nVisit to Madrid.\nIn April 1764, Beaumarchais began a ten-month sojourn in Madrid, ostensibly to help his sister, Lisette, who had been abandoned by her fianc\u00e9, Jos\u00e9 Clavijo y Fajardo, an official at the Ministry of War. While in Spain, he was mostly concerned with striking business deals for Duverney. They sought exclusive contracts for Spain\u2019s newly acquired colony of Spanish Louisiana, and attempted to gain the right to import slaves to the Spanish colonies in the Americas. Beaumarchais went to Madrid with a letter of introduction from the \u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul, who was now his political patron. Hoping to secure Clavijo's support for his business deals by binding him by marriage, Beaumarchais initially shamed Clavijo into agreeing to marry Lisette, but when further details emerged about Clavijo's conduct, the marriage was called off.\nBeaumarchais's business deals dragged on, and he spent much of his time soaking up the atmosphere of Spain, which would become a major influence on his later writings. Although he befriended important figures such as the foreign minister Jer\u00f3nimo Grimaldi, 1st Duke of Grimaldi, his attempts to secure the contracts for Duverney eventually came to nothing and he went home in March 1765. Although Beaumarchais returned to France with little profit, he had managed to acquire new experience, musical ideas, and ideas for theatrical characters. Beaumarchais considered turning the affair into a play, but decided to leave it to others\u2014including Goethe, who wrote \"Clavigo\" in 1774.\nPlaywright.\nBeaumarchais hoped to be made consul to Spain, but his application was rejected. Instead he concentrated on developing his business affairs and began to show an interest in writing plays. He had already experimented in writing short farces for private audiences, but he now had ambitions to write for the theatre.\nHis name as a writer was established with his first dramatic play, \"Eug\u00e9nie\", which premiered at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in 1767. This was followed in 1770 by another drama, \"Les Deux amis\".\nFigaro plays.\nBeaumarchais's Figaro plays are \"Le Barbier de S\u00e9ville, Le Mariage de Figaro\", and \"La M\u00e8re coupable\". Figaro and Count Almaviva, the two characters Beaumarchais most likely conceived in his travels in Spain, are (with Rosine, later the Countess Almaviva) the only ones present in all three plays. They are indicative of the change in social attitudes before, during, and after the French Revolution. Prototypes of Almaviva and Rosine first appeared under the names Lindor and Pauline in the short and incomplete play \"Le Sacristain\", in which Lindor disguises himself as a monk and music teacher in order to meet Pauline under the watchful eyes of her elderly husband. Beaumarchais wrote it around 1765 and dubbed it \"an interlude, imitating the Spanish style.\" Naturally, the thinly veiled satirization of the aristocracy did not go without opposition. Upon first reading a manuscript of Beaumarchais's play, King Louis XVI stated that \"this man mocks everything that must be respected in a government\" and refused to let it be performed.\nTo a lesser degree, the Figaro plays are semi-autobiographical. Don Guzman Brid'oison (\"Le Mariage\") and B\u00e9gearss (\"La M\u00e8re\") were caricatures of two of Beaumarchais's real-life adversaries, Goezman and Bergasse. The page Ch\u00e9rubin (\"Le Mariage\") resembled the youthful Beaumarchais, who did contemplate suicide when his love was to marry another. Suzanne, the heroine of \"Le Mariage\" and \"La M\u00e8re\", was modelled after Beaumarchais's third wife, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Willer-Mawlaz. Meanwhile, some of the Count's monologues reflect on the playwright's remorse over his numerous sexual exploits.\n\"Le Barbier\" premiered in Paris in 1775. An English translation premiered in London a year later, and that was followed by performances in other European countries.\nThe sequel, \"Le Mariage\", was initially passed by the censor in 1781, but was soon banned from performance by Louis XVI after a private reading. Queen Marie Antoinette lamented the ban, as did various influential members of her entourage. Nonetheless, the King was unhappy with the play's satire on the aristocracy and overruled the Queen's entreaties to allow its performance. Over the next three years, Beaumarchais gave many private readings of the play, as well as making revisions to try to pass the censor. The King finally relented and lifted the ban in 1784. The play premiered that year and was enormously popular, even with aristocratic audiences. Mozart's opera based on the play, \"Le Nozze di Figaro\" premiered just two years later in Vienna.\nBeaumarchais's final play, \"La M\u00e8re coupable\", premiered in 1792 in Paris. In homage to the great French playwright Moli\u00e8re, Beaumarchais also dubbed \"La M\u00e8re coupable\" \"The Other \"Tartuffe\"\".\nAll three Figaro plays enjoyed great success, and are still frequently performed today, as are Mozart's two operas.\nCourt battles.\nThe death of Duverney on 17 July 1770 triggered a decade of turmoil for Beaumarchais. A few months earlier, the two had signed a statement cancelling all debts that Beaumarchais owed Duverney (about 75,000 pounds), and granting Beaumarchais the modest sum of 15,000 pounds. Duverney's sole heir, Count de la Blache, took Beaumarchais to court, claiming the signed statement was a forgery. Although the 1772 verdict favoured Beaumarchais, it was unjustly overturned on appeal the following year by a judge, a magistrate named Goezman, whom Beaumarchais had tried in vain to bribe through Mme. Goezman. \nAt the same time, Beaumarchais was also involved in a dispute with the Duke de Chaulnes over the Duke's mistress, with the result that Beaumarchais was thrown in jail from February to May 1773. La Blache took advantage of Beaumarchais' court absence and persuaded Goezman to order Beaumarchais to repay all his debts to Duverney, plus interest and all legal expenses.\nTo garner public support, Beaumarchais published a four-part pamphlet entitled \"M\u00e9moires contre Goezman\". The action made Beaumarchais an instant celebrity, for the public at the time saw him as a champion for social justice and liberty. Goezman countered Beaumarchais's accusations by launching a lawsuit of his own. \nOn 26 February 1774, Goezman's verdict in the La Blache case was overturned, and he was removed from his post. However, both Beaumarchais and Mme. Goezman were sentenced to \"bl\u00e2me\", meaning they were nominally deprived of their civil rights. \nThe case was so sensational that the judges left the courtroom through a back door to avoid the large, angry mob waiting in front of the court house.\nNaturally, Beaumarchais followed few of the restrictions placed upon him.\nAmerican Revolution.\nTo restore his civil rights following the Goezman case, Beaumarchais pledged his services to Louis XV. He traveled to London, Amsterdam, and Vienna on various secret missions. His first mission was to destroy a pamphlet in Britain, \"Les m\u00e9moires secrets d'une femme publique\", which Louis XV considered a libel of one of his mistresses, Madame du Barry. Beaumarchais was sent to persuade the French spy Chevalier d'\u00c9on to return home, but while in London he began gathering information on British politics and society. Britain's colonial situation was deteriorating and in 1775 fighting broke out between British troops and American rebels. Beaumarchais became a major source of information about the rebellion for the French government and sent a regular stream of reports with exaggerated rumours of the size of the success of the rebel forces blockading Boston.\nOnce back in France, Beaumarchais began work on a new operation. Louis XVI, who did not want to break openly with Britain, allowed Beaumarchais to found a commercial enterprise, Roderigue Hortalez and Company, supported by the French and Spanish crowns, that supplied the American rebels with weapons, munitions, clothes and provisions, all of which the rebels accepted, but refused to pay for. In an August 18, 1776, letter to the Committee of Secret Correspondence of the Second Continental Congress, he wrote under the signature of Roderique Hortales &amp; Co., &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Your deputies, gentlemen, will find in me a sure friend, an asylum in my house, money in my coffers, and every means of facilitating their operations, whether of a public or a secret nature. I will, if possible, remove all obstacles that may oppose your wishes from the politics of Europe. At this very time, and without waiting for any answer from you, I have procured for you about 200 pieces of brass cannon, four pounders, which will be sent to you by the nearest way; 20,000 lbs. of cannon powder, 20,000 of excellent fusils, some brass mortars, bombs, cannon balls, bayonets, platines, clothes, linens, &amp;c. for the clothing of your toops; and lead for musket balls. This policy came to fruition in 1777 when John Burgoyne's army capitulated at Saratoga to a rebel force largely clothed and armed by the supplies Beaumarchais had been sending; it marked a personal triumph for him. Beaumarchais was injured in a carriage accident while racing into Paris with news of Saratoga. In April 1777, Beaumarchais purchased the old 50-gun ship of the line \"Hippopotame\", and used her, renamed to \"Fier Rodrigue\", to ferry arms to the insurgents.\nFor his services to France, its Parliament reinstated Beaumarchais's civil rights in 1776. In 1778, his hopes were fulfilled when the French government agreed to the Treaty of Amity and Commerce and the Treaty of Alliance. France officially entered the American War of Independence soon after, followed by Spain in 1779 and the Dutch Republic in 1780.\nThe Voltaire revival.\nShortly after the death of Voltaire in 1778, Beaumarchais set out to publish Voltaire's complete works, many of which were banned in France. He bought the rights to most of Voltaire's many manuscripts from the publisher Charles-Joseph Panckoucke in February 1779. To evade French censorship, he set up the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 litt\u00e9raire typographique de Kehl in Kehl, Margraviate of Baden, on the nearby border with Germany. \nThe company, at its peak, became the largest printing works in Europe. He bought the complete foundry of the famous English type designer John Baskerville from his widow, and purchased three paper mills. Seventy volumes were published between 1783 and 1790. While the venture proved a financial failure, Beaumarchais was instrumental in preserving many of Voltaire's later works which otherwise might have been lost.\nMore court battles and the French Revolution.\nIt was not long before Beaumarchais crossed paths again with the French legal system. In 1787, he became acquainted with Mme. Kornmann, who was implicated and imprisoned in an adultery suit filed by her husband to expropriate her dowry. The matter went to court, with Beaumarchais siding with Mme. Kornmann, and M. Kornmann assisted by a celebrity lawyer, Nicolas Bergasse. On 2 April 1790, M. Kornmann and Bergasse were found guilty of calumny (slander), but Beaumarchais's reputation was also tarnished.\nMeanwhile, the French Revolution broke out. Beaumarchais was no longer quite the idol of the masses he had been a few years before, as he thought the excesses of the revolution were endangering liberty. He was financially successful again, mainly from supplying drinking water to Paris, and had acquired ranks in the French nobility. In 1791, he took up a lavish residence across from where the Bastille had stood. He spent under a week in prison during August 1792 for criticising the government, and was released only three days before a massacre took place there.\nNevertheless, he pledged his services to the new republic. He attempted to purchase 60,000 rifles for the French Revolutionary army from Holland, but was unable to complete the deal.\nExile and death.\nWhile he was out of the country, Beaumarchais was falsely declared an \"\u00e9migr\u00e9\" (a loyalist of the old regime) by his enemies. He spent two and a half years in exile, mostly in Germany, before his name was removed from the list of proscribed \u00e9migr\u00e9s. He returned to Paris in 1796, where he lived out the remainder of his life in relative peace. He is buried in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\nBoulevard Beaumarchais in Paris is named after him.\nOperas.\nIn 1786, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed an opera, \"Le nozze di Figaro\", based on \"The Marriage of Figaro\", with a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte based on the play. Several composers, including Paisiello in 1782, wrote operas based on \"The Barber of Seville\". Although not received well at first, Rossini's 1816 version of \"Barber\" is his most successful work and still often performed. In 1966, Darius Milhaud composed an opera, \"La m\u00e8re coupable\", based on \"The Guilty Mother\".\nBeaumarchais was also the librettist for Antonio Salieri's opera \"Tarare\", which premiered in Paris in 1787.\nPrivate life.\nBeaumarchais married three times. He wed Madeleine-Catherine Franquet (n\u00e9e Aubertin) on 22 November 1756; she died under mysterious circumstances 10 months later. He married Genevi\u00e8ve-Madeleine L\u00e9v\u00eaque (n\u00e9e Wattebled) in 1768. She died under mysterious circumstances two years later (though most scholars believed she actually suffered from tuberculosis). She bore a son, August, who died in 1772. Beaumarchais lived with his lover, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Willer-Mawlaz, for 12 years before they married in 1786. She bore a daughter, Eug\u00e9nie.\nWhile having no shortage of lovers throughout his life, Beaumarchais was known to care deeply for both his family and close friends. He was accused by his enemies of poisoning his first two wives in order to claim inheritances they had previously married into, though no evidence was ever produced.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A good can be produced at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade. Comparative advantage describes the economic reality of the gains from trade for individuals, firms, or nations, which arise from differences in their factor endowments or technological progress.\nDavid Ricardo developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in international trade even when one country's workers are more efficient at producing \"every\" single good than workers in other countries. He demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the free market (albeit with the assumption that the capital and labour do not move internationally), then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good, provided that there exist differences in labor productivity between both countries. Widely regarded as one of the most powerful yet counter-intuitive insights in economics, Ricardo's theory implies that comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage is responsible for much of international trade.\nClassical theory and David Ricardo's formulation.\nAdam Smith first alluded to the concept of \"absolute advantage\" as the basis for international trade in 1776, in \"The Wealth of Nations\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it off them with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage. The general industry of the country, being always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby be diminished [...] but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest advantage.\nWriting two decades after Smith in 1808, Robert Torrens articulated a preliminary definition of comparative advantage as the loss from the closing of trade:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[I]f I wish to know the extent of the advantage, which arises to England, from her giving France a hundred pounds of broadcloth, in exchange for a hundred pounds of lace, I take the quantity of lace which she has acquired by this transaction, and compare it with the quantity which she might, at the same expense of labour and capital, have acquired by manufacturing it at home. The lace that remains, beyond what the labour and capital employed on the cloth, might have fabricated at home, is the amount of the advantage which England derives from the exchange. In 1814 the anonymously published pamphlet \"Considerations on the Importation of Foreign Corn\" featured the earliest recorded formulation of the concept of comparative advantage. Torrens would later publish his work \"External Corn Trade\" in 1815 acknowledging this pamphlet author's priority.\nIn 1817, David Ricardo published what has since become known as the theory of comparative advantage in his book \"On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\".\nRicardo's example.\nIn a famous example, Ricardo considers a world economy consisting of two countries, Portugal and England, each producing two goods of identical quality. In Portugal, the \"a priori\" more efficient country, it is possible to produce wine and cloth with less labor than it would take to produce the same quantities in England. However, the relative costs or ranking of cost of producing those two goods differ between the countries.\nIn this illustration, England could commit 100 hours of labor to produce one unit of cloth, or produce units of wine. Meanwhile, in comparison, Portugal could commit 100 hours of labor to produce units of cloth, or produce units of wine. Portugal possesses an \"absolute advantage\" in producing both cloth and wine due to more produced per hour (since &gt; 1). If the capital and labour were mobile, both wine and cloth should be made in Portugal, with the capital and labour of England removed there. If they were not mobile, as Ricardo believed them to be generally, then England's \"comparative advantage\" (due to lower opportunity cost) in producing cloth means that it has an incentive to produce more of that good which is relatively cheaper for them to produce than the other\u2014assuming they have an advantageous opportunity to trade in the marketplace for the other more difficult to produce good.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the absence of trade, England requires 220 hours of work to both produce and consume one unit each of cloth and wine while Portugal requires 170 hours of work to produce and consume the same quantities. England is more efficient at producing cloth than wine, and Portugal is more efficient at producing wine than cloth. So, if each country specializes in the good for which it has a comparative advantage, then the global production of both goods increases, for England can spend 220 labor hours to produce 2.2 units of cloth while Portugal can spend 170 hours to produce 2.125 units of wine. Moreover, if both countries specialize in the above manner and England trades a unit of its cloth for to units of Portugal's wine, then both countries can consume at least a unit each of cloth and wine, with 0 to 0.2 units of cloth and 0 to 0.125 units of wine remaining in each respective country to be consumed or exported. Consequently, both England and Portugal can consume more wine and cloth under free trade than in autarky.\nRicardian model.\nThe Ricardian model is a general equilibrium mathematical model of international trade. Although the idea of the Ricardian model was first presented in the \"Essay on Profits\" (a single-commodity version) and then in the \"Principles\" (a multi-commodity version) by David Ricardo, the first mathematical Ricardian model was published by William Whewell in 1833. The earliest test of the Ricardian model was performed by G. D. A. MacDougall, which was published in \"The Economic Journal\" of 1951 and 1952. In the Ricardian model, trade patterns depend on productivity differences.\nThe following is a typical modern interpretation of the classical Ricardian model. In the interest of simplicity, it uses notation and definitions, such as opportunity cost, unavailable to Ricardo.\nThe world economy consists of two countries, Home and Foreign, which produce wine and cloth. Labor, the only factor of production, is mobile domestically but not internationally; there may be migration between sectors but not between countries. We denote the labor force in Home by formula_1, the amount of labor required to produce one unit of wine in Home by formula_2, and the amount of labor required to produce one unit of cloth in Home by formula_3. The total amount of wine and cloth produced in Home are formula_4 and formula_5 respectively. We denote the same variables for Foreign by appending a prime. For instance, formula_6 is the amount of labor needed to produce a unit of wine in Foreign.\nWe do not know if Home can produce cloth using fewer hours of work than Foreign. That is, we do not know if formula_7\nEquivalently, we may assume that Home has a comparative advantage in cloth in the sense that it has a lower opportunity cost for cloth in terms of wine than Foreign:\nformula_8 in Home and formula_9 in Foreign. With free trade, the price of cloth or wine in either country is the world price formula_10 orformula_11.\nInstead of considering the world demand (or supply) for cloth and wine, we are interested in the world \"relative demand\" (or \"relative supply\") for cloth and wine, which we define as the ratio of the world demand (or supply) for cloth to the world demand (or supply) for wine. In general equilibrium, the world relative price formula_12 will be determined uniquely by the intersection of world relative demand formula_13 and world relative supply formula_14 curves.\nWe assume that the relative demand curve reflects substitution effects and is decreasing with respect to relative price. The behavior of the relative supply curve, however, warrants closer study. Recalling our original assumption that Home has a comparative advantage in cloth, we consider five possibilities for the relative quantity of cloth supplied at a given price.\nIn autarky, Home faces a production constraint of the form\nformula_20\nfrom which it follows that Home's cloth consumption at the production possibilities frontier is\nformula_21.\nWith free trade, Home produces cloth exclusively, an amount of which it exports in exchange for wine at the prevailing rate. Thus Home's overall consumption is now subject to the constraint\nformula_22\nwhile its cloth consumption at the \"consumption possibilities\" frontier is given by\nformula_23.\nA symmetric argument holds for Foreign. Therefore, by trading and specializing in a good for which it has a comparative advantage, each country can expand its consumption possibilities. Consumers can choose from bundles of wine and cloth that they could not have produced themselves in closed economies.\nThere is another way to prove the theory of comparative advantage, which requires less assumption than the above-detailed proof, and in particular does not require for the hourly wages to be equal in both industries, nor requires any equilibrium between offer and demand on the market. Such a proof can be extended to situations with many goods and many countries, non constant returns and more than one factor of production.\nTerms of trade.\nTerms of trade is the rate at which one good could be traded for another. If both countries specialize in the good for which they have a comparative advantage then trade, the terms of trade for a good (that benefit both entities) will fall between each entities opportunity costs. In the example above one unit of cloth would trade for between formula_24 units of wine and formula_25 units of wine.\nHaberler's opportunity costs formulation.\nIn 1930 Austrian-American economist Gottfried Haberler detached the doctrine of comparative advantage from Ricardo's labor theory of value and provided a modern opportunity cost formulation. Haberler's reformulation of comparative advantage revolutionized the theory of international trade and laid the conceptual groundwork of modern trade theories.\nHaberler's innovation was to reformulate the theory of comparative advantage such that the value of good X is measured in terms of the forgone units of production of good Y rather than the labor units necessary to produce good X, as in the Ricardian formulation. Haberler implemented this opportunity-cost formulation of comparative advantage by introducing the concept of a production possibility curve into international trade theory.\nModern theories.\nSince 1817, economists have attempted to generalize the Ricardian model and derive the principle of comparative advantage in broader settings, most notably in the neoclassical specific factors Ricardo\u2013Viner (which allows for the model to include more factors than just labour) and factor proportions Heckscher\u2013Ohlin models. Subsequent developments in the new trade theory, motivated in part by the empirical shortcomings of the H\u2013O model and its inability to explain intra-industry trade, have provided an explanation for aspects of trade that are not accounted for by comparative advantage. Nonetheless, economists like Alan Deardorff, Avinash Dixit, Victor D. Norman, and Gottfried Haberler have responded with weaker generalizations of the principle of comparative advantage, in which countries will only \"tend\" to export goods for which they have a comparative advantage.\nDornbusch et al.'s continuum of goods formulation.\nIn both the Ricardian and H\u2013O models, the comparative advantage theory is formulated for a 2 countries/2 commodities case. It can be extended to a 2 countries/many commodities case, or a many countries/2 commodities case. Adding commodities in order to have a smooth continuum of goods is the major insight of the seminal paper by Dornbusch, Fisher, and Samuelson. In fact, inserting an increasing number of goods into the chain of comparative advantage makes the gaps between the ratios of the labor requirements negligible, in which case the three types of equilibria around any good in the original model collapse to the same outcome. It notably allows for transportation costs to be incorporated, although the framework remains restricted to two countries. But in the case with many countries (more than 3 countries) and many commodities (more than 3 commodities), the notion of comparative advantage requires a substantially more complex formulation.\nDeardorff's general law of comparative advantage.\nSkeptics of comparative advantage have underlined that its theoretical implications hardly hold when applied to individual commodities or pairs of commodities in a world of multiple commodities. Deardorff argues that the insights of comparative advantage remain valid if the theory is restated in terms of averages across all commodities. His models provide multiple insights on the correlations between vectors of trade and vectors with relative-autarky-price measures of comparative advantage. \"Deardorff's general law of comparative advantage\" is a model incorporating multiple goods which takes into account tariffs, transportation costs, and other obstacles to trade.\nAlternative approaches.\nRecently, Y. Shiozawa succeeded in constructing a theory of international value in the tradition of Ricardo's cost-of-production theory of value. This was based on a wide range of assumptions: Many countries; Many commodities; Several production techniques for a product in a country; Input trade (intermediate goods are freely traded); Durable capital goods with constant efficiency during a predetermined lifetime; No transportation cost (extendable to positive cost cases).\nIn a famous comment, McKenzie pointed that \"A moment's consideration will convince one that Lancashire would be unlikely to produce cotton cloth if the cotton had to be grown in England.\" However, McKenzie and later researchers could not produce a general theory which includes traded input goods because of the mathematical difficulty. As John Chipman points it, McKenzie found that \"introduction of trade in intermediate product necessitates a fundamental alteration in classical analysis.\" Durable capital goods such as machines and installations are inputs to the productions in the same title as part and ingredients.\nIn view of the new theory, no physical criterion exists. Deardorff examines 10 versions of definitions in two groups but could not give a general formula for the case with intermediate goods. The competitive patterns are determined by the traders trials to find cheapest products in a world. The search of cheapest product is achieved by world optimal procurement. Thus the new theory explains how the global supply chains are formed.\nEmpirical approach to comparative advantage.\nComparative advantage is a theory about the benefits that specialization and trade would bring, rather than a strict prediction about actual behavior. (In practice, governments restrict international trade for a variety of reasons; under Ulysses S. Grant, the US postponed opening up to free trade until its industries were up to strength, following the example set earlier by Britain.) Nonetheless there is a large amount of empirical work testing the predictions of comparative advantage. The empirical works usually involve testing predictions of a particular model. For example, the Ricardian model predicts that technological differences in countries result in differences in labor productivity. The differences in labor productivity in turn determine the comparative advantages across different countries. Testing the Ricardian model for instance involves looking at the relationship between relative labor productivity and international trade patterns. A country that is relatively efficient in producing shoes tends to export shoes.\nDirect test: natural experiment of Japan.\nAssessing the validity of comparative advantage on a global scale with the examples of contemporary economies is analytically challenging because of the multiple factors driving globalization: indeed, investment, migration, and technological change play a role in addition to trade. Even if we could isolate the workings of open trade from other processes, establishing its causal impact also remains complicated: it would require a comparison with a counterfactual world without open trade. Considering the durability of different aspects of globalization, it is hard to assess the sole impact of open trade on a particular economy.\nDaniel Bernhofen and John Brown have attempted to address this issue, by using a natural experiment of a sudden transition to open trade in a market economy. They focus on the case of Japan. The Japanese economy indeed developed over several centuries under autarky and a quasi-isolation from international trade but was, by the mid-19th century, a sophisticated market economy with a population of 30 million. Under Western military pressure, Japan opened its economy to foreign trade through a series of unequal treaties.\nIn 1859, the treaties limited tariffs to 5% and opened trade to Westerners. Considering that the transition from autarky, or self-sufficiency, to open trade was brutal, few changes to the fundamentals of the economy occurred in the first 20 years of trade. The general law of comparative advantage theorizes that an economy should, on average, export goods with low self-sufficiency prices and import goods with high self-sufficiency prices. Bernhofen and Brown found that by 1869, the price of Japan's main export, silk and derivatives, saw a 100% increase in real terms, while the prices of numerous imported goods declined of 30-75%. In the next decade, the ratio of imports to gross domestic product reached 4%.\nStructural estimation.\nAnother important way of demonstrating the validity of comparative advantage has consisted in 'structural estimation' approaches. These approaches have built on the Ricardian formulation of two goods for two countries and subsequent models with many goods or many countries. The aim has been to reach a formulation accounting for both multiple goods and multiple countries, in order to reflect real-world conditions more accurately. Jonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum underlined that a convincing model needed to incorporate the idea of a 'continuum of goods' developed by Dornbusch et al. for both goods and countries. They were able to do so by allowing for an arbitrary (integer) number i of countries, and dealing exclusively with unit labor requirements for each good (one for each point on the unit interval) in each country (of which there are i).\nEarlier empirical work.\nTwo of the first tests of comparative advantage were by MacDougall (1951, 1952). A prediction of a two-country Ricardian comparative advantage model is that countries will export goods where output per worker (i.e. productivity) is higher. That is, we expect a positive relationship between output per worker and the number of exports. MacDougall tested this relationship with data from the US and UK, and did indeed find a positive relationship. The statistical test of this positive relationship was replicated with new data by Stern (1962) and Balassa (1963).\nDosi et al. (1988) conducted a book-length empirical examination that suggests that international trade in manufactured goods is largely driven by differences in national technological competencies.\nOne critique of the textbook model of comparative advantage is that there are only two goods. The results of the model are robust to this assumption. generalized the theory to allow for such a large number of goods as to form a smooth continuum. Based in part on these generalizations of the model, provides a more recent view of the Ricardian approach to explain trade between countries with similar resources.\nMore recently, Golub and Hsieh (2000) presents modern statistical analysis of the relationship between relative productivity and trade patterns, which finds reasonably strong correlations, and Nunn (2007) finds that countries that have greater enforcement of contracts specialize in goods that require relationship-specific investments.\nTaking a broader perspective, there has been work about the benefits of international trade. Zimring &amp; Etkes (2014) find that the blockade of the Gaza Strip, which substantially restricted the availability of imports to Gaza, saw labor productivity fall by 20% in three years. Markusen et al. (1994) reports the effects of moving away from autarky to free trade during the Meiji Restoration, with the result that national income increased by up to 65% in 15 years.\nCriticism.\nSeveral arguments have been advanced against using comparative advantage as a justification for advocating free trade, and they have gained an audience among economists. James Brander and Barbara J. Spencer demonstrated how, in a strategic setting where a few firms compete for the world market, export subsidies and import restrictions can keep foreign firms from competing with national firms, increasing welfare in the country implementing these so-called strategic trade policies.\nThere are some economists who dispute the claims of the benefit of comparative advantage. James K. Galbraith has stated that \"free trade has attained the status of a god\" and that \"... none of the world's most successful trading regions, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and now mainland China, reached their current status by adopting neoliberal trading rules.\" He argues that comparative advantage relies on the assumption of constant returns, which he states is not generally the case. According to Galbraith, nations trapped into specializing in agriculture are condemned to perpetual poverty, as agriculture is dependent on land, a finite non-increasing natural resource.\n21st century.\nIn the 21st century, Ricardo's comparative advantage theory has faced new challenges due to the development of global value chains. Unlike Ricardo's model of trade between anonymous parties with equal bargaining power, modern global value chains operate between connected firms with unequal power, with nations specializing in particular production stages rather than complete goods.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic further challenged the theory when disruptions to globally distributed supply chains prompted nations to reconsider their reliance on foreign production, particularly for critical goods like medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. In response, some countries have begun reinforcing supplier relationships or diversifying trade networks to mitigate future disruptions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

He served as the first President of the National Council of the Resistance from 27 May 1943 until his death less than two months later.\nA prefect in the Aveyron (1937\u20131939) and Eure-et-Loir (1939\u20131940) departments, he is remembered today as one of the main heroes of the French Resistance and for his efforts to unify it under Charles de Gaulle. He was tortured by German officer Klaus Barbie while in Gestapo custody. His death was registered at Metz railway station.\nEarly life.\nJean Moulin was born at 6 Rue d'Alsace in B\u00e9ziers, H\u00e9rault, son of Antoine-\u00c9mile Moulin and Blanche \u00c9lisabeth P\u00e8gue. He was the grandson of an insurgent opposing the coup d'\u00e9tat of 2 December 1851. His father was a lay teacher at the Universit\u00e9 Populaire and a Freemason at the lodge Action Sociale.\nMoulin was baptised on 6 August 1899 in the church of Saint-Vincentin in Saint-Andiol (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne), the village his parents came from. He spent an uneventful childhood in the company of his brother, Joseph, and his sister, Laure. Joseph died of acute peritonitis in 1907.:27 Throughout his early years, Moulin was an average student, including at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV in B\u00e9ziers. One of his report cards states that \"he would be an excellent student, if he were ever to start working.\":33\nIn 1917, he enrolled at the Faculty of Law of Montpellier, where he was not a brilliant student though he did finish his legal studies with a diploma.:33 However, thanks to the influence of his father, he was appointed as attach\u00e9 to the cabinet of the prefect of H\u00e9rault under the presidency of Raymond Poincar\u00e9.\nMilitary service during World War I.\nMoulin was mobilised on 17 April 1918 as part of the age class of 1919, the last class to be mobilised in France. He was assigned to the 2nd Engineer Regiment of Montpellier. At the beginning of September, after an accelerated training, he headed with his regiment to the front in the Vosges, where he was posted in the village of Socourt.:43\nHis regiment was preparing to go to the front lines as part of the attack planned by Foch for 13 November, but the Armistice was signed on 11 November.:43\nAlthough Moulin did not fight directly on the front lines, he was nevertheless in a position to observe the horrors of war. He saw its aftermath on the battle fields and the devastation of villages. He helped to bury the war dead in the region around Metz.:47 He wrote home expressing his shock at seeing the starved state of British prisoners of war who had just been freed. Nevertheless, nothing in the documented history of Jean Moulin's experience during World War I hinted at what his role would be during World War II.:34\u201335\nWhile still enlisted after the War, he was posted successively to Seine-et-Oise, Verdun and Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. He worked as a carpenter, a digger and later a telephonist for the 7th and 9th Engineer Regiments.\nHe was de-mobilised in November and, on 4 November 1919, resumed his post as attach\u00e9 at the pr\u00e9fecture of H\u00e9rault, in Montpellier.:52\nInterwar years.\nAfter World War I, Moulin resumed his studies of law. His position as attach\u00e9 at the pr\u00e9fecture of H\u00e9rault allowed him to finance his university studies while also providing a useful apprenticeship in politics and government. He obtained his law degree in July 1921:52. He then entered the prefectural administration as chief of staff to the deputy of Savoie in 1922 and then \"sous-pr\u00e9fet\" of Albertville from 1925 to 1930.\nAfter his proposal of marriage to Jeanette Auran was rejected, Moulin, then aged 27, married a 19-year-old professional singer, Marguerite Cerruti, in the town of Betton-Bettonet in September 1926. The marriage did not last long. Cerruti quickly became bored and Moulin responded by offering her further singing lessons in Paris, where she disappeared for two days. Biographer Patrick Marnham cites one of the causes of the divorce being Moulin's mother-in-law, who had wanted to prevent her estate passing into Moulin's control upon Cerruti's 21st birthday. Moulin attempted to hide this rejection by excusing his wife's disappearances and not informing his family until after his divorce.\nMoulin was appointed \"sous-pr\u00e9fet\" of Ch\u00e2teaulin, Brittany in 1930. At the same time, he published political cartoons in the newspaper \"Le Rire\" under the pseudonym \"Romanin\". He also illustrated books by the Breton poet Tristan Corbi\u00e8re, including an etching for \"La Pastorale de Conlie\", Corbi\u00e8re's poem about Camp Conlie where many Boon soldiers died in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. He also made friends with the Breton poets Saint-Pol-Roux in Camaret and Max Jacob in Quimper.\nIn 1932, Pierre Cot, a Radical-Socialist politician, named Moulin his second in command or \"chef adjoint\" when he was serving as Foreign Minister under Paul Doumer's presidency. In 1933, Moulin was appointed \"sous-pr\u00e9fet\" of Thonon-les-Bains, parallel to his function of head of Cot's cabinet in the Air Ministry under President Albert Lebrun. On 19 January 1934, Moulin was appointed \"sous-pr\u00e9fet\" of Montargis, but he did not assume the office and chose to remain under Cot. In the first half of April, Moulin was appointed to the Seine \"pr\u00e9fecture\" and, on 1 July, he took his place as secretary general in Somme, in Amiens. In 1936, he was once more named chief of cabinet of Cot's Air Ministry of the Popular Front. In that capacity, Moulin was involved in Cot's efforts to assist the Second Spanish Republic by sending it planes and pilots. For the Istres-Damas-Le Bourget race, he presented the winners with their prize; Benito Mussolini's son was one of those winners. He became France's youngest \"pr\u00e9fet\" in the Aveyron \"d\u00e9partement\", based in the commune of Rodez, in January 1937. It has been claimed that during the Spanish Civil War, Moulin assisted with the shipment of arms from the Soviet Union to Spain. A more commonly accepted version of events is that he used his position in the French air ministry to deliver planes to the Spanish Republican forces.\nExperience as prefect during the early part of World War II.\nIn January 1939, Moulin was appointed prefect of the Eure-et-Loir department, based in Chartres. After war against Germany was declared, he asked multiple times to be demoted because \"[his] place is not at the rear, at the head of a rural departement\". Against the advice of the Minister of the Interior, he asked to be transferred to the military school of Issy-Les-Moulineaux, near Paris. The minister forced him to return to Chartres, where the War quickly made its way to him in the form of German air strikes and columns of distressed and sometimes wounded refugees. As the Germans approached Chartres, he wrote to his parents, \"If the Germans \u2013 who are capable of anything \u2013 make me say dishonorable words, you already know, it is not the truth\". In mid-June, German troops entered Chartres.\nMoulin was arrested by the Germans on 17 June 1940 because he refused to sign a false declaration that three Senegalese \"tirailleurs\" had committed atrocities, killing civilians in La Taye. In fact, those civilians had been killed by German bombings.\nBeaten and imprisoned because he refused to comply, Moulin attempted suicide by cutting his own throat with a piece of broken glass. This act left him with a scar he would often hide with a scarf, giving us the image of Jean Moulin by which he often is remembered today. The suicide attempt did not succeed because he was discovered by a guard and taken to a hospital for treatment.\nBecause he was a Radical, he was dismissed by the Vichy regime, led by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain on 2 November 1940, along with other left-wing pr\u00e9fets. He then began writing his diary, First Battle, in which he relates his resistance against the Nazis in Chartres, which was later published at the Liberation and prefaced by de Gaulle.\nThe Resistance.\nHaving decided not to collaborate, Moulin left Chartres for his parents' home town, Saint-Andiol, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, and joined the French Resistance, specifically, the organisation Free France. Under the name \"Joseph Jean Mercier\", he went to Marseille, where he met other r\u00e9sistants, including Henri Frenay and Antoine Sachs.\nMoulin travelled to London in September 1941 after passing through Spain and Portugal. He was received on 24 October by Charles de Gaulle, who wrote about Moulin, \"A great man. Great in every way\".\nMoulin summarised the state of the French Resistance to de Gaulle. Part of the Resistance considered him too ambitious, but de Gaulle had confidence in his network and skills. He gave Moulin the assignment of co-ordinating and unifying the various Resistance groups, a difficult mission that would take time and effort to accomplish. On 1 January 1942, Moulin parachuted into the Alpilles and met with the leaders of the resistance groups, under the codenames \"Rex\" and \"Max\":\nHe succeeded to the extent that the first three of these resistance leaders and their groups came together to form the United Resistance Movement (Mouvements Unis de la R\u00e9sistance, MUR) in January 1943. The next month, Moulin returned to London, accompanied by Charles Delestraint, who led the new \"Arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te\", which grouped together the MUR's military wings. Moulin left London on 21 March 1943, with orders to unify the French resistance by forming the National Resistance Council (Conseil national de la R\u00e9sistance); CNR). Again, this was a difficult task since the other resistance movements, besides the three already in the MUR, wanted to retain their independence.\nCreation of the Conseil National de la R\u00e9sistance.\nMoulin succeeded in this task by obtaining unanimous adoption of a unified \u2018Program\u2019 and recognition of Charles de Gaulle as their leader by disparate elements of the French resistance, including by various resistance units as well as by outlawed labour unions and political parties. Because he was known as a left-wing republican, he also succeeded in obtaining the cooperation of the Communist resistance groups, which had been reluctant to accept de Gaulle as their leader. The unifying Program was set forth in a document called the 'Program of the National Council of the Resistance.'\nAdopted on March 15, 1944,:62\u201363 the Program is a text of fewer than ten pages. It consists of two parts: an \"immediate action plan\", which concerns resistance action prior to the Liberation of France. The second part describes \"measures to be applied after the territory is liberated\", a kind of government program describing how Nazi influence should be purged from French society as well as longer-term measures, such as the restoration of universal suffrage, liberty of the press, the right to unionise and social security. The first meeting of the CNR took place in Paris on 27 May 1943. The meeting was attended by representatives of eight resistance movements, two major labour unions and the six most important political parties of the Third Republic.\nThis show of unity consolidated the position of de Gaulle vis-\u00e0-vis the allied forces, who were considering a plan to administer post-War France themselves. The Conseil National de la R\u00e9sistance \u2013 by bringing together (both symbolically and as a context for meetings) major resistance units, labour unions and political parties \u2013 enhanced the credibility of the French Resistance as a unified movement. With Charles de Gaulle as its recognised head, it also fortified de Gaulle\u2019s position as a national leader who could govern France after the war. Thus, while it is not clear that the CNR actually managed to create a unified military force from the various resistance movements, it did play a role in consolidating the role of France as a politically and militarily viable force within post-War French society and as ally of the Allied Forces.\nIn his work in shepherding the Resistance, Moulin was aided by his private administrative assistant, Laure Diebold.\nBetrayal and death.\nOn 21 June 1943, Moulin was arrested by the Sicherheitsdienst (a branch of the Nazi Secret Service) while holding a meeting with fellow Resistance leaders in the home of Dr. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dugoujon in Caluire-et-Cuire, a suburb of Lyon, as were Dugoujon, Henri Aubry (alias Avricourt and Thomas), Raymond Aubrac, , Andr\u00e9 Lassagne (alias Lombard), Colonel Albert Lacaze and Colonel (alias Blumstein). Ren\u00e9 Hardy (alias Didot), a member of the resistance movement \"Combat\" and a specialist in railroads, was also present for reasons that are not clear and in what appears to have been a breach of good security practice.:157\nMoulin and the other Resistance leaders were sent to Montluc Prison in Lyon (but not Ren\u00e9 Hardy, who either escaped or was allowed to flee). They were detained there until the beginning of July. While there, he was tortured by Klaus Barbie, head of the Gestapo in Lyon and, later, briefly in Paris. According to witnesses, Moulin and his men had their fingernails removed using hot needles as spatulas. In addition, his fingers were placed in the door frame of the interrogation cell, with the door then repeatedly closed until his knuckles were shattered. They increasingly tightened his handcuffs until they penetrated the skin, breaking the bones in his wrists. He was beaten until his face was unrecognizable and he fell into a coma.\nAfter the torture sessions, Barbie ordered that Moulin be displayed as an object lesson to other imprisoned members of the Resistance. The last time he was seen alive he was still in a coma, his head swollen and yellow from bruising and wrapped in bandages, according to the description given by Christian Pineau, fellow prisoner and member of the Resistance. There is some uncertainty surrounding the exact circumstances of Moulin's death, including about the view that he died while being transported by train to Germany. According to his death certificate (established by the occupying force), he died near or in the train station of Metz, but there are conflicting reports as to when and where he died.:429, \nTheories about who betrayed Moulin.\nThe question of who betrayed Jean Moulin has attracted a great deal of research, speculation, judicial scrutiny and media coverage. Many members of the French Resistance who could have provided a first-hand account of what happened died during the War. Furthermore, internecine tensions within the Resistance movement are well documented and have left fertile ground for speculation about who within the movement might have provided the information to the Nazis. \nRegarding Moulin's arrest, suspicions have focused on Resistance member Ren\u00e9 Hardy, who, prior to accusations that he betrayed Moulin, was known to be a reliable Resistance fighter. Hardy was arrested on 7 June 1943 by the Sicherheitsdienst on the Paris-Lyon night train. This arrest took place in the context of a wave of arrests of resistance fighters, including Resistance leader General Charles Delestraint. After his arrest, Hardy was subjected to torture or threats of torture. It is suspected, and some Nazi documentation supports this, that he became a Nazi agent after his arrest. In any case, at the insistence of many of his colleagues in the Resistance, Hardy was present at the house in Caluire-et-Cuire at the time of Moulin's arrest.:404\u2013409 However, either Hardy escaped or was allowed to flee. He was injured during the escape (though some suspected that the wound was self-inflicted), and he also managed to escape from his hospital, scaling a high wall despite having his arm in a cast. In two post-war trials that examined his alleged role in the arrest, Hardy was acquitted for lack of evidence.:404\u2013409\nCommunists have also been the target of allegations, though no hard evidence has ever backed up that claim. Marnham looked into these assertions but found no evidence to support them (although Communist Party members could easily have seen Moulin as a \"fellow traveller\" because he had communist friends and supported the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War). As \"pr\u00e9fet\", Moulin even ordered the repression of communist 'agitators' and went so far as to have police keep some of them under surveillance. At the trial of Klaus Barbie in 1987, his lawyer, Jacques Verg\u00e8s, made much out of speculation that Moulin was betrayed by either Communists and/or Gaullists as part of an attempt to distract attention away from the actions of his client, by making the true authors of Moulin's arrest his fellow \"r\u00e9sistants\", rather than Barbie. Verg\u00e8s failed in his effort to acquit Barbie but succeeded in creating a vast industry of various conspiracy theories, many very fanciful, about who betrayed Moulin. Leading historians, such as Henri Nogu\u00e8res and Jean-Pierre Az\u00e9ma, rejected Verg\u00e8s's conspiracy theories under which Barbie was somehow less culpable than the supposed traitors who tipped him off.\nThe British intelligence officer Peter Wright, in his 1987 book \"Spy Catcher\", wrote that Pierre Cot was an \"active Russian agent\" and called his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Moulin a \"dedicated Communist\". Clinton wrote that Wright based his allegations against Moulin entirely on secret documents that he claimed to have seen but which no historian has ever seen, and on conversations that he is supposed to have had decades ago with others long dead, which made his case against Moulin very \"dubious\". Henri-Christian Giraud, the grandson of General Henri Giraud (who had been outmaneuvered by de Gaulle for the leadership of the Free French movement), hit back in his two-volume work \"De Gaulle et les communistes\", published in 1988 and 1989, which outlined a conspiracy theory suggesting that de Gaulle had been \"manipulated\" by the \"Soviet agent\" Moulin into following the PCF's line of \"national insurrection\" and thereby eclipsed his grandfather, who, he maintained, should have been the rightful leader of Free France. Taking up Giraud's theories, the lawyer Charles Benfredj argued in his 1990 book \"L'Affaire Jean Moulin: Le contre-enqu\u00eate\" that Moulin was a Soviet agent who had not been killed by Barbie but allowed by the German government to go to the Soviet Union in 1943, where Moulin supposedly died sometime after the war. Benfredj's book was published with an introduction with Jacques Soustelle, the archaeologist of Mexico and wartime Gaullist whose commitment to \"Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise\" had made him a bitter enemy of de Gaulle by 1959. The essence of all theories about Moulin, the alleged Soviet agent, was that because de Gaulle had agreed to co-operate with the Communists during the war, all of which was Moulin's work, he had set France on the wrong course and led to him granting Algeria independence in 1962, instead of keeping Algeria in France.\nIt has also been suggested, principally in Marnham's biography, that Moulin was betrayed by communists. Marnham points the finger specifically at Raymond Aubrac and possibly his wife, Lucie. He alleges that communists at times betrayed non-communists to the Gestapo and that Aubrac was linked to harsh actions during the purge of collaborators after the war. In 1990, Barbie, by then \"a bitter dying Nazi\", named Aubrac as the traitor. To counteract the accusations levelled at Moulin, Daniel Cordier, his personal secretary during the war, wrote a biography of his former leader. In April 1997, Verg\u00e8s produced a \"Barbie Testament\", which he claimed that Barbie had given him ten years earlier and purported to show the Aubracs had tipped off Barbie. It was timed for the publication of the book \"Aubrac Lyon 1943\" by G\u00e9rard Chauvy, who meant to prove that the Aubracs were the ones who informed Barbie about the fateful meeting at Caluire on 21 June 1943. On 2 April 1998, following a civil suit launched by the Aubracs, a Paris court fined Chauvy and his publisher, Albin Michel, for \"public defamation\". In 1998, the French historian Jacques Baynac, in his book \"Les Secrets de l'affaire Jean Moulin\", claimed that Moulin was planning to break with de Gaulle to recognise General Giraud, which led the Gaullists to tip off Barbie before that could happen.\nLegacy.\nAshes that are thought to be those of Jean Moulin were buried in Le P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and later transferred to the Panth\u00e9on on 19 December 1964. The speech given at the transfer site by Andr\u00e9 Malraux, a writer and cabinet minister, is one of the most famous speeches in French history.\nFrance's French education curriculum commemorates Moulin as a symbol of the French resistance and a model of civic virtue, moral rectitude and patriotism. As of 2015, Jean Moulin was the fifth most popular name for a French school, and as of 2016 his is the third most popular French street name. Lyon 3 university and a Paris tramway station have also been named after him.\nThe photograph with a fedora and scarf has become a popular representation of Jean Moulin and more generally the Resistance movement; in it, Jean Moulin seems to hide from onlookers to protect his clandestine life. However, the photograph itself was taken in Montpellier in February 1940 during a family visit, before his first arrest in June 1940 and subsequent decision to join the Resistance.\nIn 1967, the Centre national Jean-Moulin de Bordeaux was created in Bordeaux. Its archives contain documents on the Second World War and the Resistance. The Centre provides pedagogical supports and research material on the involvement of Jean Moulin in the Resistance. Another member of the resistance, Antoinette Sasse, created a bequest in her will to found The Mus\u00e9e Jean Moulin in 1994.\nThe 1969 Jean Pierre Melville fictional film \"Army of Shadows\", based on a book of the same name, depicts, through the character of Luc Jardie, played by Paul Meurisse, several events in Moulin's war experience but with some inaccuracy; in the film, his homosexual male secretary is replaced by a female assistant. Two French made-for-television films deal with Jean Moulin: in 2002, \"Jean Moulin\", directed by Yves Boisset and starring Charles Berling and, in 2003, \"Jean Moulin, une affaire fran\u00e7aise\", directed by Pierre Aknine and starring Francis Huster. Moulin is also a supporting character in the 1997 film \"Lucie Aubrac\", directed by Claude Berri, where he is portrayed by Patrice Ch\u00e9reau.\nIn 1993, commemorative French 2, 100 and 500 franc coins were issued, showing a partial image of Moulin against the Croix de Lorraine and using a fedora-and-scarf photograph, which is well recognised in France.\nIn popular culture.\nMoulin is the subject of an eponymous 2026 feature film directed by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ricketts\nThe \"Colonel Bogey March\" is a British march composed in 1914 by Lieutenant Kenneth J. Alford (1881\u20131945), a British Army bandmaster who later became the Director of Music of the Royal Marines at Plymouth. The melody is often whistled. During the Second World War, British soldiers sang the lyrics \"Hitler Has Only Got One Ball\" to accompany the tune.\nThe march first appeared in film in 1938 when it was hummed by Michael Redgrave in Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Lady Vanishes\". For David Lean's 1957 film \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", set during World War II, English composer Malcolm Arnold added an orchestral march, which he titled \"The River Kwai March\", to accompany the Colonel Bogey march. \"Empire\" magazine included the melody in its list of 25 of Cinema's Catchiest Earworms.\nHistory.\nIn 1914, at a time in which service personnel were encouraged not to have professional lives outside the armed forces, British Army bandmaster F. J. Ricketts published \"Colonel Bogey\" and his other compositions under the pseudonym Kenneth J. Alford. One supposition is that the tune was inspired by a British military officer who \"preferred to whistle a descending minor third\" rather than shout \"Fore!\" when playing golf. It is this descending interval that begins each line of the melody. \nThe name \"Colonel Bogey\" was adopted by golfers in the late 19th century as an imaginary \"standard opponent\" in assessing a player's performance. By Edwardian times Colonel Bogey had been adopted by the as the presiding spirit of the course. Edwardian golfers on both sides of the Atlantic often played matches against \"Colonel Bogey\". Bogey is now a golfing term meaning \"one over par\".\nLegacy.\nAt the start of World War II, \"Colonel Bogey\" became a British institution when a popular song was set to the tune: \"Hitler Has Only Got One Ball\" (originally \"G\u00f6ring Has Only Got One Ball\" after the Luftwaffe leader suffered a groin injury), essentially exalting rudeness.\nIn 1951, during the first computer conference held in Australia, the \"Colonel Bogey March\" was the first music played by a computer, by CSIRAC, a computer developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.\nThe march first appeared in the film \"No Lady\" (1931), then when it was hummed by Michael Redgrave (playing the cad Gilbert in his film debut) in Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Lady Vanishes\" in 1938. \nThe 1957 David Lean epic film \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" popularized \"The River Kwai March\", an orchestral march to accompany the Colonel Bogey March. \nIn the 1961 film \"The Parent Trap\", the campers at an all-girls summer camp whistle the \"Colonel Bogey March\" as they march through camp, mirroring the scene from \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\".\nIn episode 28 of \"The Benny Hill Show\" from 1976, the march was used in the Sale of the Half-Century game show sketch during a \"Name That Tune\"-style question. One of the contestants' answers was \"After the Ball\" after which the host (Benny Hill) responded with, \"well, you're sort of half-right\" referring to the anti-Hitler slur.\nIn \"Doctor Who\", the fourth incarnation of the Time Lord whistled the tune in \"The Face of Evil\", \"The Talons of Weng-Chiang\", \"The Invasion of Time\" and \"Destiny of the Daleks\". Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart also whistled it in \"The Mind of Evil\".\nIn the 1985 film \"The Breakfast Club\", all the teenage main characters are whistling the tune during their Saturday detention when Principal Vernon (played by Paul Gleason) walks into the room. It was also used in \"Caveman\", \"Short Circuit\" and \"Spaceballs\".\nIn \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Stark Raving Dad\", Bart initially writes a verse to a birthday song for Lisa to the tune of \"Colonel Bogey March\" albeit with jokey lyrics.\nIn \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" episode \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Screams\", the fictional ULA Peacocks have a fight song to the tune of the \"Colonel Bogey March\". \nIn 2019, the Colonel Bogey March was used in the TV series \"The Man in the High Castle\", in episode 8 of season 4. The song was featured in episode 5 of season 6 of \"Outlander\", revealing a returning character from season 5. The song also continued through the credits. The Colonel Bogey March was used in the 2024 neo-noir television series \"Monsieur Spade\" from AMC and Canal+. Perhaps coincidentally, the main character, Sam Spade, was previously played by Humphrey Bogart, often called \"Bogie\".\nAt the end of the \"ChuckleVision\" episode \"On the Hoof\", Paul and Barry have to put on a marching band for a pompous government minister at an MI7 camp only for it to go awry. The latter brother plays the tune on a kazoo while the former just hits a tambourine.\nThe march has been used in German commercials for Underberg digestif bitter since the 1970s, and has become a classic jingle there. A parody titled \"Comet\" is a humorous song about the ill effects of consuming the cleaning product of the same name. In Indonesia this march became the jingle tune for a medicine brand called .\n\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\".\nEnglish composer Malcolm Arnold added a counter-march, which he titled \"The River Kwai March\", for the 1957 dramatic film \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", set during World War II. The two marches were recorded together by Mitch Miller as \"March from the River Kwai \u2013 Colonel Bogey\" and it reached #20 in the US in 1958. The Arnold march forms part of the orchestral concert suite made of the Arnold film score by Christopher Palmer published by Novello &amp; Co in London.\nOn account of the movie, the \"Colonel Bogey March\" is often miscredited as the \"River Kwai March\". While Arnold did use \"Colonel Bogey\" in his score for the movie, it was only the first theme and a bit of the second theme of \"Colonel Bogey\", whistled unaccompanied by the British prisoners several times as they marched into the prison camp. The British actor Percy Herbert, who appeared in \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", suggested the use of the song in the movie. According to Kevin Brownlow's interviews with the film's director David Lean, it was actually Lean who knew of the song and fought during the screenwriting process to have it whistled by the troops. He realized it had to be whistled rather than sung because the World War II-era lyrics (see \"Hitler Has Only Got One Ball\") were racy and would not get past the censors. Percy Herbert was used as a consultant on the film because he had first-hand experience of Japanese POW camps; he was paid an extra \u00a35 per week by Lean.\nSince the movie depicted prisoners of war held under inhumane conditions by the Japanese, Canadian officials were embarrassed in May 1980, when a military band played \"Colonel Bogey\" during a visit to Ottawa by Japanese prime minister Masayoshi \u014chira.\n\"Jewel Thief\" (1967).\nS. D. Burman used this composition in the 1967 film \"Jewel Thief\". The opening lines of \"Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechaara\" draw inspiration from the marching song.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62022", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62022", "title": "Imre Nagy", "text": "Hungarian politician and leader of the 1956 revolution (1896\u20131958)\nImre Nagy ( ; ; 7 June 1896 \u2013 16 June 1958) was a Hungarian communist politician who served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (\"de facto\" Prime Minister) of the Hungarian People's Republic from 1953 to 1955. In 1956 Nagy became leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 against the Soviet-backed government, for which he was sentenced to death and executed two years later. He was not related to previous agrarianist Prime Minister Ferenc Nagy.\nBorn to a peasant family, Nagy was apprenticed as a locksmith before being drafted in World War I. Nagy was a committed communist from soon after the Russian Revolution, and through the 1920s he engaged in underground party activity in Hungary. Living in the Soviet Union from 1930, he served the Soviet NKVD secret police as an informer from 1933 to 1941. Nagy returned to Hungary shortly before the end of World War II, and served in various offices as the Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP) took control of Hungary in the late 1940s and the country entered the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1944 and 1945, he was Hungary's Minister of Agriculture, where he carried out land divisions that won him widespread popularity among the peasantry. He served as Interior Minister of Hungary from 1945 to 1946. Nagy became prime minister in 1953 and attempted to relax some of the harshest aspects of M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi's Stalinist regime, but was subverted and eventually forced out of the government in 1955 by R\u00e1kosi's continuing influence as General Secretary of the MDP. Nagy remained popular with writers, intellectuals, and the common people, who saw him as an icon of reform against the hard-line elements in the Soviet-backed regime.\nThe outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution on 23 October 1956 saw Nagy elevated to the position of Prime Minister on 24 October as a central demand of the revolutionaries and common people. Nagy's reformist faction gained full control of the government, admitted non-communist politicians, dissolved the \u00c1VH secret police, promised democratic reforms, and unilaterally withdrew Hungary from the Warsaw Pact on 1 November. The Soviet Union launched a massive military invasion of Hungary on 4 November, forcibly deposing Nagy, who fled to the Embassy of Yugoslavia in Budapest. Nagy was lured out of the embassy under false promises on 22 November and was arrested and deported to Romania. On 16 June 1958, Nagy was tried and executed for treason alongside his closest allies, and his body was buried in an unmarked grave.\nIn June 1989, Nagy and other prominent figures of the 1956 Revolution were rehabilitated and reburied with full honours, an event that played a key role in the collapse of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party regime.\nBiography.\nEarly life and World War I.\nImre Nagy was born prematurely on 7 June 1896 in the town of Kaposv\u00e1r in the Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary, to a small-town family of peasant origin. His father, J\u00f3zsef Nagy (1869\u20131929), was a Lutheran and a carriage driver for the lieutenant-general of Somogy county. His mother, Roz\u00e1lia Szab\u00f3 (1877\u20131969), served as a maid for the lieutenant-general's wife. They both had left the countryside in their youth to work in Kaposv\u00e1r. Nagy and Szab\u00f3 married in January 1896. In 1902, J\u00f3zsef became a postal worker and began building a house for the family in 1907 but lost his job in 1911 and had to sell the house. He was an unskilled worker for the rest of his life.\nIn 1904 Nagy's family moved to P\u00e9cs before returning to Kaposv\u00e1r the following year. Nagy attended a gymnasium in Kaposv\u00e1r from 1907 to 1912, performing poorly. The gymnasium cancelled his tuition due to his lack of accomplishment and funding. He apprenticed as a locksmith in a small metalworking firm in Kaposv\u00e1r, before moving to a factory for agricultural machinery in Losonc in northern Hungary in 1912. He returned to Kaposv\u00e1r in 1913 and was given a journeyman's certificate as a metal fitter in 1914. He abandoned the job in the summer of 1914 and became a clerk at a lawyer's office, while simultaneously attending a commercial high school in Kaposv\u00e1r, where his student performance was good.\nAfter the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914, Nagy was called up for military service in the Austro-Hungarian Army in December 1914 and found fit for service. He reported for duty at the 17th Royal Hungarian Honv\u00e9d Infantry Regiment in May 1915, after the end of the school year and before he had graduated. After three months of basic training in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, his unit was sent to the Italian Front in August 1915, where he was wounded in his leg at the Third Battle of the Isonzo. After convalescing in a field hospital, he was trained as a machine gunner in the 19th Machine Gun Battalion, promoted to corporal and sent to the Eastern Front in the summer of 1916.\nNagy was wounded in the leg by shrapnel and taken prisoner by the Imperial Russian Army during the Brusilov Offensive in Galicia on 29 July 1916. After healing his leg wound in a field hospital, he was taken first to Darnitsa, then to Ryazan and finally on a train transport to Siberia.\nEarly political career.\nIn captivity in Camp Berezovka near Lake Baikal in Siberia he participated in a Marxist discussion group until 1917. In 1918, he joined the Communist (Social Democratic) Party of the Foreign Workers of Siberia, a sub-group of the Russian Communist Party. He fought in the ranks of the Red Army from February to September 1918 during the Russian Civil War. Some sources, including the so-called \"Yurovsky Document\" allege Nagy and his unit were tasked with guarding the former Russian Imperial Family in Yekaterinburg. Though some historians have speculated Nagy himself was among the men in the firing squad that executed the Romanovs, Ivan Plotnikov, history professor at the Ural State University, stated per his research that the executioners were Yakov Yurovsky, Grigory Nikulin, Mikhail Medvedev (Kudrin), Peter Ermakov, Stepan Vaganov, Alexey Kabanov, Pavel Medvedev, V. N. Netrebin, and Y. M. Tselms. The White Army investigator Nikolai Sokolov claimed that the execution of the Imperial Family was carried out by a group of \"Latvians led by a Jew\". However, in light of Plotnikov's research, the group that carried out the execution consisted almost entirely of ethnic Russians (Nikulin, Kudrin, Ermakov, Vaganov, Kabanov, Medvedev and Netrebin) with the participation of one Jew (Yurovsky) and possibly, one Latvian (Tselms). Allegations of Nagy's presence at the Ipatiev House remains a controversial matter among biographers, and has contributed to his divisive legacy in modern Hungary.\nNagy and his unit were later encircled and he was ultimately taken prisoner by the Czechoslovak Legion in early September 1918. He escaped captivity and spent the period until February 1920 holding odd jobs in White-controlled territory near Lake Baikal. The Red Army reached Irkutsk on 7 February 1920, ending Nagy's participation in the Civil War. On 12 February 1920 he became a candidate member of the Russian Communist Party and a full-time member on 10 May. He served the rest of 1920 as a clerk for the communist Cheka secret police on matters related to prisoners of war.\nAfter a month of training by the Cheka in subversive activities, the Hungarian Communist Party (KMP) sent Nagy along with 277 other Hungarian communists to Hungary in April 1921 to build up an underground conspiratorial network in a country where the Communist Party had been banned since 1919. Nagy reached Kaposv\u00e1r in late May 1921. Upon arrival, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Hungary (MSZDP). After working temporary jobs in the rest of 1921 and early 1922, he joined the First Hungarian Insurance Company and became an office worker in Kaposv\u00e1r. He became severely overweight around this time. He helped to build up the socialist movement in his hometown, to his parents' disapproval. He became secretary of the MSZDP's local branch in 1924. He was expelled from the party for advocating revolution and was placed under police surveillance. He married M\u00e1ria \u00c9get\u0151 on November 28, 1925.\nIn January 1926, Nagy and Istv\u00e1n Sinkovics established the Kaposv\u00e1r office of the Socialist Workers\u2019 Party of Hungary (MSZMP), a semi-communist left-wing splinter group from the MSZDP. Nagy was successful in gaining 700 voters for the MSZMP Kaposv\u00e1r parliamentary candidate, one of the party's few successes in the countryside west of Budapest. By this time Nagy had begun to prioritize his interest in agriculture over political leadership and rejected an offer from communist cadres from Vienna to build up the illegal KMP in western Hungary. The MSZMP in Kaposv\u00e1r was prohibited and Nagy was fired from his insurance job in February 1927 and arrested on 27 February. He was released after two months in prison. While under police surveillance, Nagy found a job as an agent for the Phoenix Insurance Company. He was arrested again in December 1927 for three days and was called to Vienna by the KMP, arriving in March 1928. He became head of the KMP's agrarian section and was sent back to Hungary in September 1928 under a false identity to build up underground communist networks. His efforts were largely a failure, his largest successes being the publishing of three issues of a small journal and his avoidance of arrest. His advocacy of legal political activity over the party's preference for largely impotent clandestine work in villages was dismissed as \"right-deviancy\" by the ultra-left KMP leadership.\nYears in Moscow.\nIn December 1929, he traveled to the Soviet Union, arriving in Moscow in February 1930 to participate in the KMP's second congress. He rejoined the Communist Party, also becoming a Soviet citizen. He was engaged in agricultural research at the International Agrarian Institute for six years, but also worked in the Hungarian section of the Comintern. He was expelled from the party on 8 January 1936 and worked for the Soviet Statistical Service from the summer of 1936 onward. Under the codename \"Volodia\", Nagy served the NKVD secret police as an informer from 1933 to 1941. The NKVD praised him as a \"qualified agent, who shows great initiative and an ability to approach people\". The support that Nagy received from the Soviet leadership after the Second World War was to some extent a result of his loyal service as a foreigner and denouncer to the NKVD.\nMinister in Communist Hungary.\nAfter the Second World War, Nagy returned to Hungary. He was the Minister of Agriculture in the government of B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s de D\u00e1lnok, delegated by the Hungarian Communist Party. He distributed land among the peasant population. In the next government, led by Tildy, he was the Minister of Interior. At this period he played an active role in the expulsion of the Hungarian Germans.\nIn the communist government, he served as Minister of Agriculture and in other posts. He was also Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary from 1947 to 1949, a largely ceremonial position. In 1951, he signed, with the rest of the Politburo, the note ordering J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r's arrest, resulting in K\u00e1d\u00e1r's sentencing to life in prison after a show trial.\nAfter two years as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic (1953\u20131955), during which he promoted his \"New Course\" in Socialism, Nagy fell out of favour with the Soviet Politburo. He was deprived of his Hungarian Central Committee, Politburo, and all other Party functions and, on 18 April 1955, he was sacked as Chairman of the Council of Ministers.\n1956 Revolution.\nFollowing Nikita Khrushchev's \"Secret Speech\" denouncing the crimes of Stalin on 25 February 1956, dissent began to grow in Eastern Bloc against the ruling Stalinist-era party leaders. In Hungary, M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi\u2014who self-styled as \"Stalin's greatest disciple\"\u2014came under increasingly intense criticism for his policies from both the Party and general populace, with more and more prominent voices calling for his resignation. This public criticism often took the form of the Pet\u0151fi Circle\u2014a debating club established by the DISZ student youth union to discuss Communist policy\u2014which soon became one of the foremost outlets of dissent against the regime. While Nagy himself never attended a Pet\u0151fi Circle meeting, he was kept well informed of events by his close associates Mikl\u00f3s V\u00e1s\u00e1rhelyi and G\u00e9za Losonczy, who informed him of the vast popular support expressed for him at the meetings and the widespread desire for his restoration to the leadership.\nIn the face of widespread public pressure on R\u00e1kosi, the Soviets forced the unpopular leader to resign from power on 18 July 1956 and leave for the Soviet Union. However, they replaced him with his equally hard-line second in command Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151, a change which did little to mollify public dissent. Nagy was a prominent guest at the 6 October reburial of former secret police chief L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk, who had been purged by the R\u00e1kosi regime and later rehabilitated. He was readmitted to the Party on 13 October in the midst of growing revolutionary fervor. On 22 October, students from the Technical University in Budapest compiled a list of sixteen national policy demands, the third of which was Nagy's restoration to the premiership.\nIn the afternoon of 23 October, students and workers gathered in Budapest for a massive opposition demonstration arranged by the Technical University students, chanting\u2014among other things\u2014slogans of support for Imre Nagy. While the ex-premier sympathized with their reformist demands, he was hesitant to support the movement, believing it to be too radical in its demands. While he was in favor of changes to the system, he preferred those to be made within the framework of his \"New Course\" of 1953\u201355 and not a revolutionary upheaval. He also feared that the demonstration was a provocation by Ger\u0151 and Heged\u00fcs to frame him as inciting rebellion and to crack down on the opposition.\nHis associates ultimately convinced him to travel to the Parliament Building and give a speech to the demonstrators to calm the unrest. While no accurate record of this speech exists, it did not have its intended effect; Nagy essentially told the protesters to go home and let the Party handle things. The demonstrations soon escalated into a full-scale revolt as \u00c1VH secret policemen opened fire on the protesting citizens. Hungarian soldiers sent to crush the demonstrators instead sided with them, and Ger\u0151 soon called in Soviet intervention.\nEarly in the morning of 24 October, Nagy was renamed as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic again, in an attempt to appease the populace. However, he was initially isolated within the government, and powerless to stop the Soviet invasion of the capital that day. The decision to call in Soviet forces had already been made by Ger\u0151 and outgoing Prime Minister Andr\u00e1s Heged\u00fcs the previous night, but many suspected that Nagy had signed the order. This perception was not helped by the fact that Nagy declared martial law on that same day and offered an \"amnesty\" to all rebels who laid down their arms, weakening the public's trust in him. The next day (25 October) he announced he would begin negotiations on the withdrawal of Soviet troops after order was restored. On 26 October, he began to meet with delegations from the Writers' Union and student groups, as well as from the Borsod Workers' Council in Miskolc.\nOn 27 October, Nagy announced a major reformation of his government, to include several non-communist politicians including former president Zolt\u00e1n Tildy as a Minister of State. At negotiations with Soviet representatives Anastas Mikoyan and Mikhail Suslov, Nagy and the Hungarian government delegation pushed for a ceasefire and political solution.\nIn the morning of 28 October, Nagy successfully prevented a massive attack on the main rebel strongholds at the Corvin Cinema and Kili\u00e1n Barracks by Soviet troops and pro-regime Hungarian units. He negotiated a ceasefire with the Soviets, which came into effect at 12:15 and fighting began to die down across the city and country. Later that day, he gave a speech on the radio assessing the events as a \"national democratic movement,\" proclaiming his full support of the Revolution and agreeing to fulfill some of the public's demands. He announced the dissolution of the \u00c1VH and his intention to negotiate the full withdrawal of Soviet troops from the city. Nagy also supported the creation of a National Guard, a force of combined soldiers and armed civilians to maintain order amidst the chaos of the Revolution.\nOn 29 October, as fighting died down across Budapest and Soviet troops began to withdraw, Nagy moved his office from the Party headquarters to the Parliament Building. He also began to meet and negotiated with several representatives of the armed groups that day, as well as the representatives of the workers' councils that had been formed over the course of the previous week.\nBy 30 October, Nagy's reformist faction had gained full control of the Hungarian government. Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151 and the other Stalinist hard-liners had left for the Soviet Union, and Nagy's government announced its intent to restore a multi-party system based on the coalition parties from 1945. Throughout this period, Nagy remained steadfastly committed to Marxism; but his conception of Marxism was as \"a science that cannot remain static\", and he railed against the \"rigid dogmatism\" of \"the Stalinist monopoly\". He did not intend a full return to multi-party liberal democracy but a limited one within a socialist framework, and was willing to allow the function of the pre-1948 coalition parties.\nNagy was appointed to the temporary leadership committee of the newly formed Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, which replaced the disintegrated Hungarian Working People's Party on 31 October. This was originally intended as a \"national communist\" party that would preserve the gains of the Revolution. However, at a meeting of the Soviet Politburo that day, the Kremlin leaders decided that the Revolution had gone too far and needed to be crushed. On the night of 31 October \u2013 1 November, Soviet troops began crossing back into Hungary, contrary to their declaration of 30 October expressing willingness to withdraw from the country entirely. Nagy protested this action to Soviet Ambassador Yuri Andropov; the latter replied that the new troops were only there to cover the full withdrawal and protect Soviet citizens living in Hungary. This likely prompted Nagy to make his most controversial decision. In response to a major demand of the revolutionaries, he announced Hungary's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and appealed through the UN for the great powers, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, to recognise Hungary's status as a neutral state. Late that night, General Secretary J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r went to the Soviet embassy, and the next day he was taken to Moscow.\nBetween 1\u20133 November, Nikita Khrushchev traveled to various Warsaw Pact countries as well as to Yugoslavia to inform them of his plans to attack Hungary. On the advice of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, he selected the then-Party General Secretary J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r as the country's new leader on 2 November, and was willing to let Nagy remain in the government if he cooperated. On 3 November, Nagy formed a new government, this time with a Communist minority. It included members of the Communists, Independent Smallholders' Party, Peasants' Party, and Social Democrats. However, it would only be in office for less than a day.\nIn the early morning hours of 4 November, the USSR launched \"Operation Whirlwind,\" a massive military attack on Budapest and on rebel strongholds throughout the country. Nagy made a dramatic announcement to the country and the world about this operation. However, to minimize damage he ordered the Hungarian Army not to resist the invaders. Soon after, he fled to the Yugoslav Embassy, where he and many of his followers were given sanctuary.\nIn spite of a written safe conduct of free passage by J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r, on 22 November, Nagy was arrested by the Soviet forces as he was leaving the Yugoslav Embassy and taken to Snagov, Romania.\nSecret trial and execution.\nSubsequently, the Soviets returned Nagy to Hungary, where he was secretly charged with organizing the overthrow of the Hungarian People's Republic and with treason. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. His trial and execution were made public only after the sentence had been carried out. According to Fedor Burlatsky, a Kremlin insider, Nikita Khrushchev had Nagy executed, \"as a lesson to all other leaders in socialist countries\". American journalist John Gunther described the events leading to Nagy's death as \"an episode of unparalleled infamy\".\nNagy was buried, along with his co-defendants, in the prison yard where the executions were carried out and years later was removed to a distant corner (section 301) of the New Public Cemetery, Budapest, face-down, and with his hands and feet tied with barbed wire. Next to his grave stands a memorial bell inscribed in Latin, Hungarian, German and English. The Latin reads: \"Vivos voco / Mortuos plango / Fulgura frango\", which is translated as: \"I call the living, I mourn the dead, I break the thunderbolts\".\nMemorials and political rehabilitation.\nDuring the time when the Stalinist leadership of Hungary would not permit Nagy's death to be commemorated, or permit access to his burial place, a cenotaph in his honour was erected in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris on 16 June 1988.\nIn 1989, Imre Nagy was rehabilitated and his remains reburied on the 31st anniversary of his execution in the same plot after a funeral organised in part by the democratic opposition to the country's socialist regime. Over 200,000 people are estimated to have attended Nagy's reinterment. The occasion of Nagy's funeral was an important factor in the end of the communist government in Hungary.\nOn 28 December 2018, a popular statue of Nagy inaugurated in 1996 was removed from central Budapest to a less central location, in order to make way for a reconstructed memorial to the victims of the 1919 Red Terror that originally stood in the same place from 1934 to 1945, during Mikl\u00f3s Horthy's pro-Nazi regime. Opposition parties, mainly liberal, socialist and the remaining communists, accused Viktor Orb\u00e1n's right-wing government of historical revisionism; his supporters, however, argued that the initiative was taken as an attempt to restore the city landscape to its pre-World War II form and to \"erase the traces of the communist era\".\nWritings.\nNagy's collected writings, most of which he wrote after his dismissal as Chairman of the Council of Ministers in April 1955, were smuggled out of Hungary and published in the West in 1957 under the title \"On Communism: In Defense of the New Course\".\nFamily.\nNagy was married to M\u00e1ria \u00c9get\u0151. The couple had one daughter, Erzs\u00e9bet Nagy (1927\u20132008), a Hungarian writer and translator. Erzs\u00e9bet Nagy married Ferenc J\u00e1nosi. Imre Nagy did not object to his daughter's romance and eventual marriage to a Protestant minister, attending their religious wedding ceremony in 1946 without Politburo permission. In 1982, Erzs\u00e9bet Nagy married J\u00e1nos V\u00e9szi.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Finkelstein for ABC. It premiered on September 26, 1990, and broadcast eleven episodes before concluding on December 26. It was both a critical and commercial failure.\nPremise.\nFollowing the Los Angeles Police Department, \"Cop Rock\" features an ensemble cast of police officers and detectives as they solve crimes across the city, with the series mixing musical and choreography throughout storylines and to introduce new characters. In its main storyline, Captain John Hollander (Larry Joshua) investigates the involvement of Detective Vincent LaRusso (Peter Onorati) in the execution of murder suspect Tyrone Weeks (Art Kimbro). Subplots include Detective Ralph Ruskin's (Ron McLarty) growing jealousy of his wife Officer Vicki Quinn (Anne Bobby), and her friendship with Officer Andy Campo (David Gianopoulos); Quinn helping drug addict Patricia Spence (Kathleen Wilhoite) recover her baby which Spence had sold for $200; and the relationship between corrupt Mayor Louise Plank (Barbara Bosson) and Chief Roger Kendrick (Ronny Cox).\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn the early 1980s, a Broadway producer offered Steven Bochco a proposal to convert his series \"Hill Street Blues\" into a musical. As the plan was not practical, the proposal was declined, but Bochco kept the idea in mind and thought about doing the opposite instead, converting a Broadway show into a police procedural television series. In 1987, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) gave Bochco a production commitment for ten of his future shows, and wanting to experiment, he developed \"Cop Rock\" as a \"bold and adventurous\" idea. The head of ABC Entertainment at the time, Bob Iger, was one of the only people willing to give him a chance, allowing the creation of the series. On the opportunity, James McDaniel stated that, \"the media said it was impossible and that it was ridiculous, but nothing's impossible and ridiculous if you have the right pieces in place.\"\nCasting.\nOver 200 people auditioned for \"Cop Rock\"; Peter Onorati, who portrays Detective Vincent LaRusso, was introduced to the series by his wife after she talked with Howard McGillin, who had also auditioned. Jokingly stating that he had experience singing at weddings, Onorati's agent, Kay Liberman, set up an audition, where Onorati performed Fats Domino's \"Blue Monday\".\nOne of the only actors with singing experience, Teri Austin graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts and performed \"Lover Man\" and \"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do\" at her audition. Kathleen Wilhoite, who portrays Patricia Spence, had a record deal at the time, and decided to audition with \"Easy to Be Hard\", finding her casting as a \"good gig for me, because singing is kind of my thing\". McDaniel, on the other hand, turned down an offer to join the series but changed his mind after finding out it was created by Bochco, who he had worked with on the last season of \"Hill Street Blues\".\nMick Murray was searching for an acting job in New York and was going through multiple pilots from ABC before hearing about \"Cop Rock\" and Bochco's involvement. At his audition, the casting director was Alexa Fogel, who was not of fan of his following a failed audition for the film \"Young Guns\". As a result, Murray decided to perform a cappella by Terence Trent D'Arby, which Fogel responded to with \"the warmest smile\". At night, Murray received a phone call from his agent and was told that the production crew had expanded a small role for him so he could join as a series regular.\nLarry Joshua brought his own guitar to his audition and performed \"When She Wants Good Lovin'\" and \"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\". During this time, David Gianopoulos heard about the series after running into Joshua near 42nd Street. Revealing to his agent that he had been secretly singing in several bands for over six years, Gianopoulos auditioned with Ben E. King's \"Stand by Me\" at Lincoln Center, where several other cast members also had their auditions. Originally, Gianopoulos had auditioned for the role of LaRusso before being told by Bochco to audition for the role of Officer Andy Campo. The following day, he performed Bruce Springsteen's \"Hungry Heart\" and received the part.\nRonny Cox was told by pilot director Gregory Hoblit that he would get the role of Chief Roger Kendrick whether or not he could sing. Broadway performer Anne Bobby, however, had to audition, doing so on a Saturday where she said she saw her friend Jane Krakowski. Furthermore, Paul McCrane was told by Hoblit and Bochco that they did not have a part for him at the moment and reassured him that they would write a new character once the show entered production; McCrane was later cast as Detective Bob McIntire.\nSeveral cast and guest stars had previously appeared on \"Hill Street Blues\", including Bochco's wife Barbara Bosson (Fay Furillo on \"Blues\", Mayor Plank on \"Cop Rock\"). \"Hill Street\" cast member Charles Haid was a producer and directed one episode. The seventh episode \"Cop-a-Feeliac\" opens with a roll call scene and musical number \"Let's Be Careful Out There,\" based on the \"Hill Street Blues\" catchphrase. At the end of the scene, James B. Sikking makes a cameo appearance, uncredited and without dialogue, as his \"Hill Street Blues\" character Howard Hunter.\nReception.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 53% based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 5.33/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"\"Cop Rock\"'s ambition to innovate the police procedural is admirable, but the contrast of grit and glam proves too jarring with unmemorable music throwing the series' more promising dramatic beats askew.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nThe show was a critical and commercial failure and was canceled by ABC after 11 episodes. The combination of a fusion of musical performances with serious police drama and dark humor with its high-powered production talent, made it infamous as one of the biggest television failures of the 1990s. \"TV Guide Magazine\" ranked it #8 on its List of the 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time list in 2002 and dubbed it \"the single most bizarre TV musical of all time\".\nDespite an overwhelmingly negative reception and short run, the series has been rebroadcast in later years, with VH1 and A&amp;E Network airing it on separate occasions later in the 1990s, and Trio in the 2000s.\nHome media.\nOn May 17, 2016, Shout! Factory released the complete series on DVD in Region 1.\nInternational broadcasts.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Cop Rock\" was televised on BBC1 and premiered on Monday 30 September 1991. The show premiered on Australian television via the Ten Network on Thursday 23 January 1992 at 11:00 PM.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62027", "revid": "26460455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62027", "title": "American Broadcasting Company", "text": "American broadcast television network\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) is an American commercial broadcast television and radio network that serves as the flagship property of the Disney Entertainment division of the Walt Disney Company. ABC is headquartered on Riverside Drive in Burbank, California, directly across the street from Walt Disney Studios and adjacent to the Team Disney \u2013 Roy E. Disney Animation Building. The network maintains secondary offices at 7 Hudson Square in New York City's Lower Manhattan neighborhood, which houses its broadcast center and the headquarters of its news division, ABC News. Until early 2025, the network's East Coast operations were based at 77 West 66th Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Since 2007, when ABC Radio (also known as Cumulus Media Networks) was sold to Citadel Broadcasting, ABC has reduced its broadcasting operations almost exclusively to television. The youngest of the \"Big Three\" American television networks, the network is sometimes referred to as the Alphabet Network, as its initialism also represents the first three letters of the English alphabet in order.\nABC launched as a radio network in 1943, as the successor to the NBC Blue Network, which had been purchased by Edward J. Noble. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks CBS and NBC, as well as the lesser-known DuMont. In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres (UPT), a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. Leonard Goldenson, who had been the head of UPT, made the then-new television network profitable by helping to develop and green-light many successful television series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80 percent interest in cable sports channel ESPN, the network's corporate parent, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., merged with Capital Cities Communications, owner of several television and radio stations and print publications, to form Capital Cities/ABC Inc., which in turn merged into Disney in 1996.\nABC has eight owned-and-operated and more than 230 affiliated television stations throughout the United States and its territories. Some ABC-affiliated stations can also be seen in Canada via pay-television providers, and certain other affiliates can also be received over-the-air in areas near the Canada\u2013United States border, although most of its prime time programming is subject to simultaneous substitution regulations for pay television providers imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to protect rights held by domestically based networks. ABC News provides news and feature content for select radio stations owned by Cumulus Media, as these stations were former ABC Radio properties.\nHistory.\nIn 1927, NBC operated a radio network called the NBC Blue Network. It became an independent radio (and eventually television) network known as the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1943. ABC later joined United Paramount Theatres forming American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres (later American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.). After its venture into radio and television throughout the 1960s and 1970s and the purchase of ESPN in 1982, the company was acquired and merged with Capital Cities, forming Capital Cities/ABC in 1986. The company was sold to the Walt Disney Company in 1996.\nProgramming.\nThe ABC television network provides an average of 89 hours of network programming each week. It also offers 22 hours of prime-time programming to affiliated stations from 8:00\u00a0p.m. to 11:00\u00a0p.m. Monday through Saturday (Eastern and Pacific Time) and 7:00\u00a0p.m. to 11:00\u00a0p.m. on Sundays.\nDaytime programming is also provided from 11:00\u00a0a.m. to 3:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern and Pacific weekdays (subtract 1 hour for all other time zones) (with a one-hour break at 12:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern/Pacific for stations to air newscasts, locally produced programming or syndicated programs) featuring the talk-lifestyle shows \"The View\" and \"\", and the soap opera \"General Hospital\". In addition, ABC News programming includes \"Good Morning America\" from 7:00\u00a0a.m. to 9:00\u00a0a.m. weekdays and Saturdays (along with one-hour Sunday editions), nightly editions of \"ABC World News Tonight\" (whose weekend editions are occasionally subject to abbreviation or preemption due to sports telecasts overrunning into the program's timeslot), the Sunday political talk show \"This Week\", early morning news programs \"World News Now\" and \"Good Morning America First Look\" and the late-night newsmagazine \"Nightline\". Late nights featured the weeknight talk show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\".\nThe network's three-hour Weekend morning children's programming timeslot is programmed by syndication distributor Litton Entertainment, which produces \"Litton's Weekend Adventure\" under an arrangement in which the programming block is syndicated exclusively to ABC owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, rather than being leased out directly by the network to Litton.\nDaytime.\nABC's daytime schedule features the talk show \"The View\", news show \"\", and the soap opera \"General Hospital\". Originally premiering in 1963, \"General Hospital\" is ABC's longest-running entertainment program. In addition to the long-running \"All My Children\" (1970\u20132011) and \"One Life to Live\" (1968\u20132012), notable past soap operas seen on the daytime lineup include \"Ryan's Hope\", \"Dark Shadows\", \"Loving\", \"The City\" and \"Port Charles\". ABC also aired the last nine years of the Procter &amp; Gamble-produced soap \"The Edge of Night\", following its cancellation by CBS in 1975. ABC Daytime has also aired several game shows, including \"The Dating Game\", \"The Newlywed Game\", \"Let's Make a Deal\", \"Password\", \"Split Second\", \"The $10,000/$20,000 Pyramid\", \"Family Feud\", \"The Better Sex\", \"Trivia Trap\", \"All-Star Blitz\" and \"Hot Streak\".\nSports.\nSports programming is provided on occasion, primarily on weekend afternoons and Saturday evenings. In 2006, the ABC Sports division was shut down, with all sports telecasts on ABC since then being produced in association with sister cable network ESPN under the branding ESPN on ABC. General industry trends and changes in rights have prompted reductions in sports on broadcast television, with Disney preferring to schedule the majority of its sports rights on the networks of ESPN (until 2020). Since 2020 ESPN has prioritized ABC with airings of its sports telecasts with occasional simulcasts and exclusive games of ESPN \"Monday Night Football\" broadcasts on ABC.\nSince 2006, ABC has at least aired ten weeks of primetime sports programming, and since 2020 has aired sports programming almost every week from September to May each year (with primetime encores and movies airing the remainder of the year). ABC is the broadcast television rightsholder of the National Basketball Association (NBA), with its package (under the \"NBA on ESPN\" branding) traditionally beginning with its Christmas Day games, followed by a series of Saturday night and Sunday afternoon games through the remainder of the season, weekend playoff games, and all games of the NBA Finals. ABC is also the broadcast television rightsholder of the National Hockey League (NHL), with its package (under the \"NHL on ESPN\" branding). In this deal, ABC broadcasts at least 10 regular season games (mostly afternoon), the NHL All-Star Game, the NHL Stadium Series, and four Stanley Cup Finals. During college football season, ABC typically carries an afternoon doubleheader on Saturdays, along with the primetime \"Saturday Night Football\". ABC also airs coverage of selected bowl games, ABC is also the secondary broadcast partner of Major League Baseball (MLB) with the network at least airing wild card series games since 2020 (except for 2021) and select Sunday Night Baseball games by sister network ESPN. Beginning in the 2015 NFL season, ESPN agreed to begin simulcasting/exclusively airing NFL games on ABC. Thus, ABC is the only major broadcast network that carries games from all of the traditional \"big four\" sports leagues (MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL) all at the same time.\nDuring the late winter months, ABC airs both men's and women's college basketball games on weekend afternoons. In the spring and summer months, ABC also airs games (usually on weekends) from the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), and is the broadcast home of the X Games and Little League World Series. In 2015, ESPN's annual ESPY Awards presentation moved to ABC from ESPN. Bolstered by Caitlyn Jenner accepting the inaugural Arthur Ashe Courage Award during the ceremony, the 2015 ESPY Awards' viewership was roughly tripled over the 2014 ceremony on ESPN. After the NFL signed a new contract with the Walt Disney Company, ABC will air Super Bowl LXI in 2027 and Super Bowl LXV in 2031. ABC has not aired a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XL in 2006.\nSpecials.\nABC holds the broadcast rights to the Academy Awards, Primetime Emmy Awards, and the Country Music Association Awards. ABC has also aired the Miss America competition from 1954 to 1956, 1997 to 2004, and 2011 to 2018.\nFrom February 2001 to February 14, 2020, ABC held the television rights to most of the \"Peanuts\" television specials, having acquired the broadcast rights from CBS, which originated the specials in 1965 with the debut of \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" (other \"Peanuts\" specials broadcast annually by ABC, in addition to \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", include \"Charlie Brown's All Stars!\", \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\", \"You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown\", \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\", \"It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown\", \"Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown\", \"She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown\", \"Happy New Year, Charlie Brown!\", \"The Mayflower Voyagers\", \"A Charlie Brown Valentine\", \"Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales\" and \"I Want a Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown\"). ABC also broadcasts the annual \"Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade\" special on Christmas morning.\nSince 1974, ABC has generally aired \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" \u2013 a New Year's Eve special featuring music performances and coverage of festivities in New York's Times Square. ABC is also among the broadcasters of the Tournament of Roses Parade (although as mentioned, the Rose Bowl Game now airs exclusively on ESPN as a College Football Playoff \"New Year's Six\" bowl).\nProgramming library.\nABC owns nearly all of its in-house television and theatrical productions made since the 1970s, except certain co-productions (for example, \"The Commish\" is now owned by the estate of its producer, Stephen Cannell). Worldwide video rights are owned by various companies, for example, Kino Lorber owns the North American home video rights to the ABC feature film library (along with some lesser-known live-action films from Disney's library, mostly from Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures and 20th Century Studios).\nWhen the FCC imposed its Financial Interest and Syndication Rules in 1970, ABC proactively created two companies: Worldvision Enterprises as a syndication distributor, and ABC Circle Films as a production company. However, between the publication and implementation of these regulations, the separation of the network's catalog was made in 1973. The broadcast rights to pre-1973 productions were transferred to Worldvision, which became independent in the same year. The company has been sold several times since Paramount Television acquired it in 1999, and has most recently been absorbed into CBS Media Ventures (formerly CBS Television Distribution), a unit of Paramount Skydance, which owns the competitor CBS. Nonetheless, Worldvision sold portions of its catalog, including the Ruby-Spears and Hanna-Barbera libraries, to Turner Broadcasting System (now a part of Warner Bros. parent company Warner Bros. Discovery) in 1991. With Disney's 1996 purchase of ABC, ABC Circle Films was absorbed into Touchstone Television, a Disney subsidiary which in turn was renamed ABC Studios in 2007.\nAlso part of the library are most films in the David O. Selznick library, productions from their previous motion picture divisions ABC Pictures International, Selmur Productions, and Palomar Pictures International (before its takeover by Bristol-Myers-Squibb) released by Cinerama Productions (films produced by the company themselves are now under the control of Pacific Theatres), their later theatrical division ABC Motion Pictures, and the in-house productions it continues to produce (such as \"America's Funniest Home Videos\", \"General Hospital\", ABC News productions, and series from Disney Television Studios (ABC Signature and 20th Television). Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television (formerly known as Buena Vista Television and 20th Television) handles domestic television distribution, while Disney\u2013ABC International Television (formerly known as Buena Vista International Television) handles international television distribution.\nStations.\nSince its inception, ABC has had over 300 television stations that have carried programming from the network at various times throughout its history, including its first two owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, founding O&amp;O WABC-TV and inaugural affiliate WPVI-TV. As of 2020[ [update]], ABC has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 236 additional television stations encompassing 50 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. possessions, Bermuda, and Saba. This makes ABC the largest U.S. broadcast television network by the total number of affiliates. The network has an estimated national reach of 97.72% of all households in the United States (or 305,347,338 Americans with at least one television set). New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Delaware are the only U.S. states where ABC does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&amp;O WABC-TV in the north half of the state and Philadelphia O&amp;O WPVI-TV in the south, Rhode Island is served by New Bedford, Massachusetts-licensed WLNE, though outside of the transmitter, all other operations for the station are based in Providence, and Delaware is served by WPVI in the northern two thirds and Salisbury, Maryland, affiliate WMDT in the southern third of the state).\nABC maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as Birmingham, Alabama (WBMA-LD), Lima, Ohio (WPNM-LD) and South Bend, Indiana (WBND-LD). In some markets, including Lima and South Bend, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. The network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned-and-operated affiliates which serve the same market in Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB), Boston, Massachusetts (WCVB-TV and WMUR-TV), Lincoln, Nebraska (KLKN and KHGI-TV), and Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV), with an analogous situation arising in Kansas City, Missouri (KMBC-TV and KQTV). KQTV is licensed to St. Joseph, which Nielsen designates as a separate market from Kansas City, despite a mere distance between the two cities and the Kansas City-based stations (including KMBC) providing better city-grade to Grade B coverage to the area compared to the signals of the primary ABC affiliates in the other aforementioned dual-affiliate markets. KQTV was St. Joseph's lone major network affiliate until 2011, when locally based News-Press &amp; Gazette Company began establishing low-power affiliates of ABC's four English-language competitors and Telemundo on three low-power stations to end St. Joseph's dependence on Kansas City. WWSB, KHGI, and WOTV serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market's primary ABC affiliate.\nABC initially affiliated with WWSB to cover southern portions of the Tampa\u2013St. Petersburg market\u2014including WWSB's city of license, Sarasota\u2014as the transmitters of WTSP, the market's former primary ABC affiliate from 1965 to 1994, and former Miami affiliate WPLG had been short-spaced to avoid interference between their respective analog-VHF channel 10 signals, WWSB remained an ABC affiliate after its Tampa affiliation moved from WTSP to WFTS in December 1994, even though WFTS's signal reaches Sarasota and some surrounding areas. WCVB-TV is licensed to Boston while WMUR-TV is licensed to Manchester, New Hampshire (which is officially part of the Boston market). WCVB is easily receivable in Manchester with a good antenna as well as having its news department that covers New Hampshire; it is the only station licensed to the state that does such. Both WCVB and WMUR are owned by Hearst Television.\nThe Sinclair Broadcast Group is the largest operator of ABC stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 28 full, primary ABC affiliates and two subchannel-only affiliates. Sinclair owns the largest ABC subchannel affiliate by market size, WABM-DT2/WDBB-DT2 in the Birmingham market, which serves as repeaters of WBMA-LD (which itself is also simulcast on a subchannel of former WBMA satellite WGWW, owned by Sinclair partner company Howard Stirk Holdings). The E. W. Scripps Company is the largest operator of ABC stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 ABC-affiliated stations including affiliates in larger markets such as Cleveland (WEWS-TV), Phoenix (KNXV-TV), Detroit (WXYZ-TV), and Denver (KMGH-TV). Through its ownership of Phoenix affiliate KNXV, Las Vegas affiliate KTNV-TV, and Tucson affiliate KGUN-TV, it is the only provider of ABC programming for the majority of Arizona (outside the Yuma\u2013El Centro market) and Southern Nevada. Scripps also owns and operates several ABC stations in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, including in Denver, San Diego (KGTV), Bakersfield, California (KERO-TV), and Boise, Idaho (KIVI-TV). When combined with the ABC Owned Television Stations in Los Angeles (KABC-TV), Fresno (KFSN-TV), and San Francisco (KGO-TV, the affiliations from the News-Press &amp; Gazette Company in Santa Barbara (KEYT-TV), Palm Springs (KESQ-TV), Yuma\u2013El Centro (KECY-TV), and Colorado Springs\u2013Pueblo (KRDO-TV), and Sinclair's affiliations in Seattle (KOMO-TV) and Portland, Oregon (KATU), these four entities control the access of ABC network programming in most of the Western United States, particularly in terms of audience reach.\nAt the time of Jimmy Kimmel's suspension in September 2025, among other properties owned by the two companies, Nexstar Media Group owned or provided services to 201 stations serving 116 markets, while Sinclair owned or provided services to 178 stations in 81 markets. Based on 2024\u201325 Nielsen Media Research market estimates, the ABC owned-and-operated station subsidiary ABC Owned Television Stations (whose eight stations are mostly clustered in major markets like New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Houston) was the largest owner of ABC stations by cumulative national market share, covering 21.87% of American households. Individually, Sinclair and Nexstar were respectively the second- and fourth-largest owners of ABC stations, reaching 14.56% and 9.28% of American households respectively (with The E. W. Scripps Company, with 17 affiliates covering 12.87% of the United States, being the third-largest).\nFacilities and studios.\nAll of ABC's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates have had their facilities and studios, but transverse entities have been created to produce national programming. As a result, television series were produced by ABC Circle Films beginning in 1962 and by Touchstone Television beginning in 1985, before Touchstone was reorganized as ABC Studios in February 2007 and later renamed to its current name ABC Signature in August 2020. Since the 1950s, ABC has had two main production facilities: the ABC Television Center (now The Prospect Studios) on Prospect Avenue in Hollywood, California, shared with the operations of KABC-TV until 1999, and the ABC Television Center, East, a set of studios located throughout New York City.\nIn addition to the headquarters building on Riverside Drive, other ABC facilities in Burbank include a building at 3800 West Alameda, known as 'Burbank Center', then moved to ABC Riverside which is primarily associated with Walt Disney Entertainment Television and functions as the headquarters and broadcast center for Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FX, National Geographic, and the former Radio Disney. Additionally, Disney Television Animation has a facility on Empire Avenue near the Hollywood Burbank Airport. In nearby Glendale, Disney/ABC also maintains the Grand Central Creative Campus, which houses other company subsidiaries, including the studios of KABC-TV and the Los Angeles bureau of ABC News.\nABC owned several facilities in New York, grouped mainly on West 66th Street, with the main set of facilities on the corner of Columbus Avenue. These facilities occupy a combined across two blocks with a total area of . This main set of buildings includes:\nABC also owns 7, 17 and 47 West 66th Street, three buildings on a plot. The block of West 66th Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue, which houses the ABC News building, was renamed Peter Jennings Way in 2006 in honor of the then-recently deceased news anchor. Disney formerly leased at 157 Columbus Avenue, on the northern side of 67th Street.\nABC owns the Times Square Studios at 1500 Broadway, on land owned by a development fund for the 42nd Street Project. Opened in September 1999, \"Good Morning America\" was broadcast from this facility until June 13, 2025. ABC News had premises on West 66th Street, in a six-story building occupying a plot at 121\u2013135 West End Avenue. On July 9, 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced that it was selling its two West 66th Street campuses (except for the National Guard Amory) to Silverstein Properties and purchasing one square block of property in lower Manhattan to build a new New York-based broadcast center. The building, known as 7 Hudson Square, opened in 2024 with The View being the first show to move to the new broadcast facility. The Tamron Hall Show, ABC News, WABC-TV, ESPN, and Good Morning America all moved their operations to the new facility separately from January\u2013June 2025.\nRelated services.\nVideo-on-demand services.\nABC maintains several video on demand (VOD) services for delayed viewing of the network's programming, including a traditional VOD service called ABC on Demand, which is carried on most traditional cable and IPTV providers. The Walt Disney Company is also a part-owner of Hulu, and has offered full-length episodes of most of ABC's programming through this streaming service since July 6, 2009.\nIn May 2013, ABC launched \"WatchABC\", a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network's existing streaming portal at ABC.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers. This service provides full-length episodes of ABC programs and live streams of local affiliates in select markets (this was the first such offering by a U.S. broadcast network). Live streams are only available to authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers. WABC-TV New York and WPVI-TV Philadelphia were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service, with the six remaining ABC O&amp;Os offering streams by the start of the 2013\u201314 season. Hearst Television also reached a deal to offer streams of its ABC affiliates on the service, though as of 2016[ [update]] these stations are only available for live-streaming for DirecTV subscribers.\nIn November 2015, it was reported that ABC had been developing a slate of original digital series for the WatchABC service, internally codenamed ABC3. In July 2016, ABC re-launched its streaming platforms, dropping the WatchABC brand, adding a streaming library of 38 classic ABC series, and introducing 7 original short-form series under the blanket branding ABCd.\nThe most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on the ABC app, Hulu, and ABC on Demand the day after their original broadcast. In addition, ABC on Demand disallows fast forwarding of accessed content. In 2021, ABC updated the app to allow app users to watch shows from ABC's sister networks: Freeform, FX, and National Geographic. Free ad-supported streaming television channels were added to the ABC app in 2022 and 2023, including a 24-hour version of ESPN8 The Ocho and a seasonal channel dedicated to Freeform's 25 Days of Christmas original content. On August 23, 2024, Disney began notifying its carriage partners that it would discontinue the mobile and digital media player apps for ABC, along with DisneyNow, Freeform, FX, and National Geographic, effective September 23. However, TV Everywhere content would still be available via their respective websites in order to funnel viewers towards Disney+ and Hulu.\nABC HD.\nABC's master feed is transmitted in 720p high-definition, the native resolution format for the Walt Disney Company's American television properties. However, most of Hearst Television's ABC-affiliated stations and some of Tegna's ABC affiliates transmit the network's programming in 1080i, while 11 other affiliates owned by various companies carry the network feed in 480i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry ABC programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed ABC affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD. Although ABC has not fully transitioned to 1080p or ultra HD, some stations such as ABC affiliate station KNXV-TV in Phoenix, Arizona, transmit the network's programming at 1080p via an ATSC 3.0 multiplex stations, such as KASW with KNXV-TV.\nABC began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed, ABC HD, on September 16, 2001, at the start of the 2001\u201302 season, with its scripted prime-time series becoming the first shows to upgrade to the format, the simulcast feed was launched first on ABC's owned television stations that same date with many major affiliates following after that. Both new and returning scripted series were broadcast in high definition. In 2011, \"\" was the last program on the network's schedule that was broadcast in standard definition. All of the network's new programming has been presented in HD since January 2012. The affiliate-syndicated Saturday morning educational and informative (E/I) block \"Litton's Weekend Adventure\" was the first children's program block on U.S. network television to feature programs available in HD upon its September 2011 debut. The HD programming is broadcast in 5.1 surround sound.\nOn September 1, 2016, ABC began to use framing for its most graphical imaging (primarily the network's bug, in-program promotions and generic closing credit sequences as well as sports telecasts, where the bottom line and scoreboard elements now extend outside the 4:3 frame), requiring its stations and pay television providers to display its programming in a compulsory widescreen format, either in high definition or standard definition. With this change, some programs also began positioning their main on-screen credits outside the 4:3 aspect ratio.\nVisual identity.\nThe ABC logo has evolved many times since the network's creation in 1943. The network's first logo, introduced in 1946, consisted of a television screen containing the letters \"T\" and \"V,\u201d with a vertical \"ABC\" microphone in the center, referencing the network's roots in radio. When the ABC-UPT merger was finalized in 1953, the network introduced a new logo based on the FCC seal, with the letters \"ABC\" enclosed in a circular shield surmounted by a bald eagle. In 1957, just before the television network began its first color broadcasts, the ABC logo consisted of a tiny lowercase \"abc\" in the center of a large lowercase letter \"a\", a design known as the ABC Circle A.\nIn 1962, graphic designer Paul Rand redesigned the ABC logo (nicknamed the \"ABC Circle\") into its current and best-known form, with the lowercase letters \"abc\" enclosed in a single black circle. The new logo debuted on-air on October 19 of the same year, but it was not until the following spring that it was fully adopted. The letters are strongly reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. The logo's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate, which was beneficial before the advent of computer graphics. A color version of the logo was also developed around 1963, and animated as a brief 10-second intro to be shown before the then-small handful of network programs broadcast in color (similar to the NBC \"Laramie\" peacock intro used during that era). The \"a\" was rendered in red, the \"b\" in blue, and the \"c\" in green, against the same single black circle. A variant of this color logo, with the colored letters against a white circle, was also commonly used throughout the 1960s.\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of many graphical imaging packages for the network which based the logo's setting mainly on special lighting effects then under development including white, blue, pink, rainbow neon, and glittering dotted lines. Among the ABC Circle logo's many variants was a 1977 ID sequence that featured a bubble on a black background representing the circle with glossy gold letters, and was the first ABC identification card to simulate a three-dimensional appearance.\nIn 1983, for the 40th anniversary of the network's founding, ID sequences had the logo appear in a gold CGI design on a blue background, accompanied by the slogan \"That Special Feeling\" in a script font. Ten years later, in 1993, the \"ABC Circle\" logo reverted to its classic white-on-black color scheme, but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters, and a bronze border surrounding the circle. The ABC logo first appeared as an on-screen bug in the 1993\u201394 season, appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment, then appearing throughout programs beginning in the 1995\u201396 season, the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011\u201312 season.\nDuring the 1997\u201398 season, the network began using a minimalist graphical identity with a yellow and black motif, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small black-and-white \"ABC Circle\" logo on a yellow background (promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night's prime time lineup). A new four-note theme tune (composed by Mad Bus Music) was introduced alongside the package, based around the network's then-new \"We Love TV\" image campaign from the 1998\u201399 season, creating an audio signature in comparative parlance to the NBC chimes, CBS's various sound marks (including the five-note version introduced in 2020) and the Fox fanfare (which was phased out by the Fox network in 2019). The four-note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter until the 2020\u201321 season.\nIn 1999, ABC launched a web-based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo, also called 'the dot', in which comic book character Little Dot prompted visitors to \"download the dot,\u201d a program which would cause the ABC logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom-right corner. The network hired the Troika Design Group to design and produce its 2001\u201302 identity, which continued using the black-and-yellow coloring of the logo and featured dots and stripes in various promotional and identification spots.\nOn June 10, 2007, ABC began to phase in a new imaging campaign for the upcoming 2007\u201308 season, \"Start Here,\u201d accompanied by a glassy version of the ABC logo. Also developed by Troika, marketing used a series of icons intended to emphasize the availability of ABC content across multiple platforms, and sought to \"simplify and bring a lot more consistency and continuity to the visual representation of ABC.\" On-air, the logo was accompanied by animated water and ribbon effects. Red ribbons were used to represent the entertainment division, while blue ribbons were used for ABC News.ABC introduced a revision to its logo and branding by Loyalkaspar for the 2013\u201314 season, the logo carried a simpler gloss design than the 2007 version, and had lettering closer-resembling Paul Rand's original version of the circle logo. A custom typeface inspired by the ABC logotype, ABC Modern, was also created for use in advertising and other promotional elements. The logo was used in various color schemes, with a gold version used primarily for ABC's entertainment divisions, a red version used primarily for ESPN on ABC, steel blue and dark grey versions used primarily by ABC News, and all four colors used interchangeably in promotions.\nUpon a reimaging by The New Blank for the 2018\u201319 season, the blue, red, and yellow variants were dropped, with the dark grey version becoming ABC's main logo. Surrounding promotional elements adopted a circular \"echo\" motif and the new slogan \"America's Network\".\nAnother revision to the logo was introduced on August 9, 2021, ahead of the 2021\u201322 season. Designed by Trollb\u00e4ck &amp; Company, it is designed to adhere to flat design trends, and returns to a solid, two-dimensional design with smaller and bolder lettering. The main logo is rendered in a dark, blue-gray color, outlined and black-on-red variations are also used, such as for the on-screen bug and promotional usage respectively. The 2021 rebrand also introduced a sonic logo that retains three out of the four notes of ABC's prior audio logo and was composed by YouTooCanWoo.\nThe Circle 7 logo, designed in 1962, is also commonly associated with ABC affiliates who broadcast on channel 7, including its flagship local stations WABC-TV (New York City), KABC-TV (Los Angeles), KGO-TV (San Francisco) and WLS-TV (Chicago). This logo was intended to be used somewhat interchangeably by these stations with the main circular network logo and has itself also become an iconic symbol of the ABC network. KGO was the first of the ABC-owned stations to use the Circle 7 logo, starting on August 27, 1962, by the end of the year, the other ABC-owned stations began using the logo, and have continued to do so since.\nInternational broadcasts.\nThe first attempts to internationalize the ABC television network dates to the 1950s, when Goldenson tried to use the same strategies he had in expanding UPT's theater operation to the international market. Goldenson said that ABC's first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953, CBS and NBC were delayed in covering the coronation due to flight delays. Goldenson tried international investing, having ABC invest in stations in the Latin American market, acquiring a 51% interest in a network covering Central America and in 1959 established program distributor Worldvision Enterprises. Goldenson also cited interest in Japan in the early 1950s, acquiring a 5% stake in two new domestic networks, the Mainichi Broadcasting System in 1951 and TV Asahi in 1957. Goldenson also invested in broadcasting properties in Beirut in the mid-1960s.\nThe goal was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels and affiliates to rebroadcast the network's programs. In 1959, this rerun activity was completed with program syndication, with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC. The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries, many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties. As a result, ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s; a partial stake in the Republic Broadcasting System in the Philippines was forcibly removed in 1974 after the declaration of martial law under Ferdinand Marcos in September 1972.\nThe second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the 1990s, and policies enacted in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks. These policies included the expansion of several of the company's U.S.-based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney and Jetix, although Disney also sold its 33% stake in European sports channel Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000. In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC broadcasts in the United States with programming syndicated in other countries. The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived and on September 27, 2004, ABC announced the launch of ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group. However, ABC1 could not attain sustainable viewership and was shut down in October 2007.\nPrior to the ABC1 closure, on October 10, 2006, Disney\u2013ABC Television Group entered into an agreement with satellite provider Dish TV to carry its ABC News Now channel in India. However, this operation was not put into effect.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the Nine Network maintained close ties with ABC and has used a majority of the U.S. network's image campaigns and slogans since the 1970s, in particular, \"Still the One\", ABC's slogan it adopted for the 1977\u201378 television season and again for the 1979\u201380 television season, was adopted by Nine for the 1978 Australian television season (before, Nine also used ABC's \"Let Us Be the One\" slogan), and lasted longer ever since it was re-adopted in 1980, it was Nine's main slogan until it was replaced in December 2006, only to be reintroduced in November 2021. ABC's other slogans were also adopted by Nine during the 1980\u20132006 period, as secondary slogans complementing the \"Still the One\" slogan.\nCanada.\nMost Canadians have access to at least one U.S.-based ABC affiliate, either over-the-air (in areas located within proximity of the Canada\u2013United States border) or through a cable, satellite or IPTV provider. Most ABC programs are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the CRTC, which require television service providers to replace an American station's signal with the feed of a Canadian broadcaster carrying the same syndicated program to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue.\nMexico.\nLike Canada, ABC programming is available in Mexico through free-to-air affiliates in markets located within proximity to the Mexico\u2013United States border whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air in border areas of northern Mexico.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines, ABC maintained close ties with GMA Network and the unrelated Philippine network whose sharing the same abbreviation and more commonly known as TV5 regarding the content agreement with these networks.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nhttps://\n* https:// \n* https://"}

Discovery (WBD). Founded on June 1, 1980, by American media proprietor Ted Turner and Reese Schonfeld as a 24-hour cable news channel and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, CNN is the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage and the first all-news television channel in the United States.\nAs of December 2023, CNN had 68,974,000 television households as subscribers in the United States. According to Nielsen, down from 80 million in March 2021. In June 2021, CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 580,000 viewers throughout the day, down 49% from a year earlier, amid sharp declines in viewers across all cable news networks. While CNN ranked 14th among all basic cable networks in 2019, then jumped to 7th during a major surge for the three largest cable news networks (completing a rankings streak of Fox News at number 5 and MSNBC at number 6 for that year), it settled back to number 11 in 2021 and had further declined to number 21 in 2022.\nGlobally, CNN programming has aired through CNN International, seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories. Since May 2019, however, the American domestic version has absorbed international news coverage in order to reduce programming costs. The American version, sometimes referred to as CNN (US), is also available in Canada, and some islands in the Caribbean. CNN also licenses its brand and content to other channels, such as CNN-News18 in India. In Japan it broadcasts CNNj which started in 2003, with simultaneous translation in Japanese.\nCNN has often been subjected to criticism from conservative media and other organizations for having a perceived left-wing bias; conversely, it has also been criticized for false balance in support of conservative positions. \nHistory.\nThe Cable News Network launched at 5:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time on June 1, 1980. After an introduction by Ted Turner, the husband and wife team of David Walker and Lois Hart anchored the channel's first newscast. Burt Reinhardt, the executive vice president of CNN, hired most of the channel's first 200 employees, including the network's first news anchor, former ABC News Capitol Hill senior correspondent Bernard Shaw.\nSince its debut, CNN has expanded its reach to several cable and satellite television providers, websites, and specialized closed-circuit channels (such as CNN Airport). The company has 42 bureaus (12 domestic, 31 international), more than 900 affiliated local stations (which also receive news and features content via the video newswire service CNN Newsource), and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world. The channel's success made a bona-fide mogul of founder Ted Turner and set the stage for conglomerate Time Warner's (later WarnerMedia which merged with Discovery Inc. forming Warner Bros. Discovery) eventual acquisition of the Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.\nProgramming.\nCurrent schedule.\nCNN's current weekday schedule consists mostly of rolling news programming during daytime hours, followed by in-depth news and information programs with a focus on political news and discussion during the evening and primetime hours. The network's morning programming consists of \"Early Start\", an early-morning news program now hosted by Rahel Solomon at 5:00 a.m. ET. This is followed by \"CNN This Morning\", hosted by Audie Cornish, at 6 a.m. ET. Since April 2023, \"CNN News Central\" has served as the network's rolling news block on weekdays, with a morning edition anchored by John Berman, Kate Bolduan, and Sara Sidner from 7 a.m\u201310 a.m., and an afternoon edition from 1\u20134 p.m. ET anchored by Brianna Keilar and Boris Sanchez. The gap between the two editions of \"News Central\" is filled by \"The Situation Room\" with Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown, and \"Inside Politics\" with Dana Bash in the noon hour. CNN's late afternoon and early evening lineup consists of \"The Arena with Kasie Hunt\" followed at 5 p.m. by \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\"\nThe network's evening and prime time lineup from at 7 p.m. onward is devoted towards personality-based discussion programs. including \"Erin Burnett OutFront\", \"Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0\", \"The Source with Kaitlan Collins\", \"CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip\", and \"Laura Coates Live.\" The East Coast late-night hours were previously filled by reruns of prime time programs; in October 2025, the network introduced a live program anchored from Los Angeles, \"The Story Is with Elex Michaelson\", which airs from 9\u201311 p.m. PT (12 a.m\u20132 a.m. ET).\nWeekend programming follows a different schedule, with the morning show \"CNN This Morning Weekend\" with Victor Blackwell, followed on Saturday mornings by \"Smerconish\" with Michael Smerconish, \"Table for Five, and\" \"The Amanpour Hour\" with Christine Amanpour. The Sunday morning lineup consists primarily of political talk shows, including \"Inside Politics\" with Manu Raju. \"State of the Union\" with Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, and the international affairs program \"Fareed Zakaria GPS.\" Weekend afternoons are filled by the rolling news block \"CNN Newsroom\" (which was formerly used on weekdays before its replacement with \"News Central\").\nThe prime time schedule on weekends is dedicated primarily to factual programming, such as documentary films, miniseries, and specials relating to current affairs, politics, and popular culture (some of which acquired and presented under the CNN Films banner), as well as reality-style docuseries.\nPast programming.\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, after canceling \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" (which, itself, replaced the long-running \"Larry King Live\"), CNN experimented with running factual and reality-style programming during the 9:00\u00a0p.m. ET hour, such as John Walsh's \"The Hunt\", \"This Is Life with Lisa Ling\", and Mike Rowe's \"Somebody's Gotta Do It\". Then-president Jeff Zucker explained that this new lineup was intended to shift CNN away from a reliance on pundit-oriented programs, and attract younger demographics to the network. Zucker stated that the 9:00\u00a0p.m. hour could be pre-empted during major news events for expanded coverage. These changes coincided with the introduction of a new imaging campaign for the network, featuring the slogan \"Go there\". In May 2014, CNN premiered \"The Sixties\", a documentary miniseries produced by Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman which chronicled the United States in the 1960s. Owing to its success, CNN commissioned follow-ups focusing on other decades. \"Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0\" was expanded to run two hours long, from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.\nBy 2019, CNN had produced at least 35 original series. Alongside the Hanks/Goetzman franchise (including the 2018 spin-off \"1968\"), CNN has aired other documentary miniseries relating to news and US policies, such as \"The Bush Years\", and \"American Dynasties: The Kennedys\"\u2014which saw the highest ratings of any CNN original series premiere to-date, with 1.7-million viewers. \"Parts Unknown\" concluded after the 2018 suicide of its host Anthony Bourdain; CNN announced several new miniseries and docuseries for 2019, including \"American Style\" (a miniseries produced by the digital media company Vox Media), \"The Redemption Project with Van Jones\", \"Chasing Life with Sanjay Gupta\", \"Tricky Dick\" (a miniseries chronicling Richard Nixon), \"The Movies\" (a spin-off of the Hanks/Goetzman decades miniseries), and \"Once in a Great City: Detroit 1962\u201364\".\nWith the takeover of CNN by Chris Licht and Warner Bros. Discovery, it was announced in October 2022 that CNN would cut back on acquisitions and commissions from third-parties as a cost-cutting measure, but Licht stressed that \"long-form content remains an important pillar of our programming\", while the network announced a slate for 2023 that would include commissions such as \"Giuliani: What Happened to America's Mayor?\", \"United States of Scandal\", and \"The 2010s\". In May 2024, CNN ordered an American version of the long-running British news comedy panel show \"Have I Got News for You\".\nOn-air presentation.\nCNN began broadcasting in the high-definition 1080i resolution format in September 2007. This format is now standard for CNN and is available on all major cable and satellite providers.\nCNN's political coverage in HD was first given mobility by the introduction of the CNN Election Express bus in October 2007. The Election Express vehicle, capable of five simultaneous HD feeds, was used for the channel's CNN-YouTube presidential debates and for presidential candidate interviews.\nIn December 2008, CNN introduced a comprehensive redesign of its on-air appearance, which replaced an existing style that had been used since 2004. On-air graphics took a rounded, flat look in a predominantly black, white, and red color scheme, and the introduction of a new box next to the CNN logo for displaying show logos and segment-specific graphics, rather than as a large banner above the lower third. The redesign also replaced the scrolling ticker with a static \"flipper\", which could either display a feed of news headlines (both manually inserted and taken from the RSS feeds of CNN.com), or \"topical\" details related to a story.\nCNN's next major redesign was introduced on January 10, 2011, replacing the dark, flat appearance of the 2008 look with a glossier, blue-and-white color scheme, moving the secondary logo box to the opposite end of the screen, and framing its graphics for the aspect ratio (which is downscaled to a letterboxed format for standard definition feeds). On February 18, 2013, following Jeff Zucker's arrival as head of the network, the \"flipper\" was dropped and reverted to a scrolling ticker.\nOn August 11, 2014, CNN introduced a new graphics package, dropping the glossy appearance for a flat, rectangular scheme incorporating red, white, and black colors, and the Gotham typeface. The ticker alternated between general headlines and financial news from CNN Business, and the secondary logo box was replaced with a smaller box below the CNN bug, which displayed either the title, hashtag, or Twitter handle for the show being aired or its anchor. In April 2016, CNN began to introduce a new corporate typeface, known as \"CNN Sans\", across all of its platforms. Inspired by Helvetica Neue and commissioned after consultations with Troika Design Group, the font family consists of 30 different versions with varying weights and widths to facilitate use across print, television, and digital mediums. CNN International would also adopt these graphics, but with the CNN logo bug having a white on red color scheme to differentiate it from the domestic network.\nIn August 2016, CNN announced the launch of CNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting (CNN AIR), a drone-based news collecting operation to integrate aerial imagery and reporting across all CNN branches and platforms, along with Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner entities.\nOn June 1, 2023, CNN refreshed its graphics to mark the 43rd anniversary of its launch, using gradients and rounded corners, thinner fonts, and a modified layout that moved the show title to a secondary tab on the lower third next to the segment title, and replaced the ticker with a static \"flipper\" for the first time since 2013, among other changes. Amid poor internal reception to the redesign and the firing of Chris Licht as head of CNN, elements of the prior graphics began to be reinstated later that month, including the bolder typography previously used for lower third headlines. Further changes were made on August 14, 2023, with the return of the scrolling ticker and the show title box to make it closer resemble the 2014\u201323 graphics, but maintaining most of the other visual changes.\nOn June 27, 2024, CNN hosted the first presidential debate for former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. CNN claimed that more people watched the CNN Presidential Debate than any other CNN program in history.\nStaff.\nOn July 27, 2012, CNN president Jim Walton announced he was resigning after 30 years at the network. Walton remained with CNN until the end of that year. In January 2013, former NBCUniversal President Jeff Zucker replaced Walton.\nOn January 29, 2013, longtime political analysts James Carville and Mary Matalin, and fellow political contributor Erick Erickson were let go by CNN.\nIn February 2022, Zucker was asked to resign by Jason Kilar, the chief executive of CNN's owner WarnerMedia, after Zucker's relationship with one of his lieutenants was discovered during the investigation into former CNN primetime host Chris Cuomo's efforts to control potentially damaging reporting regarding his brother Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York. Kilar announced that the interim co-heads would be executive vice presidents Michael Bass, Amy Entelis, and Ken Jautz. On February 26, 2022, it was announced that Chris Licht\u2014known for his work at MSNBC and CBS\u2014would be the next president of CNN; he was planned to be instated after the spin off and merger of WarnerMedia into Discovery Inc. Licht started his tenure in May 2022, and his tenure ended in June 2023. He expressed an intention to have more Republicans on the air and to cut down on opinion-related content.\nA trio of EVPs, Entelis, Virginia Moseley and Eric Sherling, formed an interim management group, until October 2023, when Mark Thompson, formerly of \"The New York Times,\" became CEO. In one of his first major moves, he kept the executive team under Chris Licht\u2014the \"Quad\", composed of David Leavy, COO, and three EVPs (Moseley for editorial, Entelis for talent, and Sherling for programming)\u2014 all in place, and expanded their responsibilities. Moseley became the network's first executive editor and would have both national and international news. Adding their ranks, Thompson made Alex MacCallum, who worked with Thompson at The New York Times, executive vice president of digital products. In highlighting these moves, Thompson emphasized existing staff would need to get used to change.\nIn July 2024, CNN announced that it was cutting one hundred jobs, or about 3% of its total workforce. The company also announced that it was consolidating three newsrooms into one, namely, its US news gathering, international news gathering and digital news gathering operations. CNN's global workforce, in July 2024, included roughly 3,500 people.\nOther platforms.\nWebsite.\nCNN launched its website, CNN.com (initially known as \"CNN Interactive\"), on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of blogs, social media and user-generated content have influenced the site, and blogs, in particular, have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN Pipeline in late 2005.\nIn April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the US, according to Nielsen/NetRatings; this is an increase of 11% over the previous year.\nCNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or \"pipes\"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up \"news alerts\" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running Microsoft Windows. There was also a browser-based \"web client\" that did not require installation. The service was discontinued in July 2007, and was replaced with a free streaming service.\nOn April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the 2008 Tibetan unrest. CNN reported that they took preventive measures after news broke of the impending attack.\nThe company was honored at the 2008 Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital news gathering (DNG) system. The first use of what would later win CNN this award was in April 2001 when CNN correspondent Lisa Rose Weaver covered, and was detained, for the release of the US Navy crew of a damaged electronic surveillance plane after the Hainan Island incident. The technology consisted of a videophone produced by 7E Communications Ltd of London, UK. This DNG workflow is used today by the network to receive material worldwide using an Apple MacBook Pro, various prosumer and professional digital cameras, software from Streambox Inc., and BGAN terminals from Hughes Network Systems.\nOn October 24, 2009, CNN launched a new version of the CNN.com website; the revamped site included the addition of a new \"sign up\" option, in which users can create their own username and profile, and a new \"CNN Pulse\" (beta) feature, along with a new red color theme. However, most of the news stories archived on the website were deleted.\nBlogs.\nThe topical news program \"Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics\" was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005. Blog coverage was expanded when \"Inside Politics\" was folded into \"The Situation Room\" (\"Inside Politics\" later returned to CNN in 2014, this time hosted by the network's chief national correspondent John King.). In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport, initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech shootings sent in first-hand photos of what was going on during the shootings.\nIn April 2010, CNN announced via Twitter that it would launch a food blog called \"Eatocracy\", which will \"cover all news related to food\u2014from recalls to health issues to culture\". CNN had an internet relay chat (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with Benjamin Netanyahu on the network in 1998.\nCNNHealth consists of expert doctors answering viewers' questions online at CNN's \"The Chart\" blog website. Contributors include Sanjay Gupta (Chief Medical Correspondent), Charles Raison (Mental Health Expert), Otis Brawley (Conditions Expert), Melina Jampolis (Diet and Fitness Expert), Jennifer Shu (Living Well Expert), and Elizabeth Cohen (Senior Medical Correspondent).\nOther digital offerings.\nIn early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to cable and satellite subscribers who receive CNN at home (a precursor to the TV Everywhere services that would become popularized by cable and satellite providers beginning with Time Warner's incorporation of the medium). CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the RealNetworks SuperPass subscription service outside the US. CNN also offers several RSS feeds and podcasts.\nCNN manages the YouTube channels \"CNN\" and \"CNN-News18\", which ranked among the 20 most subscribed news publishers in January 2025, with 17.4 million and 8.8 million subscribers respectively. In 2014, CNN launched a radio version of their television programming on TuneIn Radio.\nOn March 7, 2017, CNN announced the official launch of its virtual reality unit named CNNVR. It will produce 360 videos to its Android and iOS apps within CNN Digital. It is planning to cover major news events with the online, and digital news team in New York City, Atlanta, London, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Dubai, Johannesburg, Tokyo, and Beijing.\nCNN Newsource is a subscription-based affiliation video service that provides CNN content to television station affiliates with CNN, including terrestrial stations and international stations. Newsource allows affiliates to download videos from CNN, as well as from other affiliates who upload their video to Newsource.\nCNN also maintains a wire service known as CNN Wire.\nCNN's digital storefront, which sells branded merchandise, household goods, and software, is operated by StackCommerce via partnership.\nIn 2021, CNN Digital had an average of 144-million unique visitors in the United States according to Comscore, making it the most viewed digital news outlet, ahead of \"The New York Times\", NBC News, Fox News, \"The Washington Post\".\nCNN-10.\nThe network also hosts CNN-10, a daily 10-minute video show visible at the CNN website or YouTube. It replaced the long-running show CNN Student News which had been aired since 1989. It is aimed at a global audience of students, teachers, and adults, and was hosted by Carl Azuz. In the fall of 2022, Carl Azuz was replaced by Coy Wire as the host of CNN 10, after leaving CNN due to a \"personal decision\" according to a CNN spokesperson in a newsletter published on September 18, 2022.\nBeme.\nOn November 28, 2016, CNN announced the acquisition of Beme for a reported $. On November 29, 2016, Matt Hackett, co-founder of Beme, announced via an email to its users that the Beme app would be shutting down on January 31, 2017. Since the shutdown of the app, it was announced that CNN intended to use the current talent behind Beme to work on a separate start-up endeavor. Beme's current team will retain full creative control of the new project, which was slated to be released in the summer of 2017. Beme have also brought on other internet stars such as the host of Vsauce 3, Jake Roper, as head of production, who features prominently in Beme co-founder Casey Neistat's vlogs. Beme News has since begun uploading news related video on YouTube.\nFilms.\nIn October 2012, CNN formed a film division called CNN Films to distribute and produce made-for-TV and feature documentaries. Its first acquisition was a documentary entitled \"Girl Rising\", a documentary narrated by Meryl Streep that focused on the struggles of girls' education.\nRadio.\nIn July 2014, Cumulus Media announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate national and international news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015, including access to a wire service, and digital content for its station websites. The service was unbranded, allowing individual stations to integrate the content with their news brands. On July 9, 2020, citing \"extraordinary circumstances in the current marketplace\" and a need to prioritize the company's resources, Westwood One announced that the service would be discontinued on August 30.\nThe audio simulcast of CNN is distributed on Entercom's Radio.com website and app.\nOther channels.\nOver the years, CNN has launched spin-off networks in the United States and other countries. Channels that currently operate include:\nFormer channels.\nCNN has also launched television and online ventures that are no longer in operation, including:\nBureaus.\nCNN operates bureaus in the following cities as of \u00a02023[ [update]]:\nUnited States\nWorldwide.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn parts of the world without a CNN bureau, reports from local affiliate stations will be used to file a story.\nControversies and criticisms.\nCNN has been involved in various controversies, criticisms, and allegations since its inception in 1980. The channel is known for its dramatic live coverage of breaking news, some of which has drawn criticism as overly sensationalistic.\nCNN claims to be \"The Most Trusted Name in News\", but its efforts to be nonpartisan have led to accusations of both liberal bias and well as false balance in support of conservatives. One study measured airtime of guests on major news networks between 2010 and 2021 and compared that to the guests' campaign donations. It found guests on CNN to have a liberal bias (a \"campaign finance score\" of \u22129.7, where 0 is equal airtime, compared to \u221214.1 for MSNBC and 49.8 for Fox News), which became more pronounced during the Trump administration. The same study found that some popular primetime news shows on CNN, such as \"Anderson Cooper 360\" or \"CNN Tonight\", are more left-leaning than popular MSNBC shows such as \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" or \"The 11th Hour with Brian Williams\".\nIn January 2020, CNN settled a multi-million dollar defamation lawsuit from Nick Sandmann, a Covington Catholic High School student involved in an encounter with Omaha tribe elder Nathan Phillips at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\nAfter being fired in December 2021, former host Chris Cuomo was reported to be seeking $ in damages, alleging a breach of agreement. In April 2023, host Don Lemon announced that he had been fired.\nDuring the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, CNN has been accused by its own staff of producing biased coverage that privileges the Israeli point of view to such an extent that it ends up parroting pro-Israeli propaganda, and of applying tight restrictions on citing Hamas or Palestinian voices in general.\nAwards and honors.\n1998: CNN received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Speech.\n2017: CNN received the Prince Rainier III Special Prize at the Monte Carlo TV Festival for the documentary, \"Midway: A Plastic Island\" about sea pollution.\n2018: CNN received the Overseas Press Club of America David Kaplan Award for best TV or video spot news reporting from abroad for reporting on the fall of ISIS by Nick Paton Walsh and Arwa Damon.\n2018: CNN received the George Polk Award of Long Island University for Foreign Television Reporting for uncovering a hidden modern-day slave auction of African refugees in Libya.

{"id": "62031", "revid": "40234806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62031", "title": "Georges Seurat", "text": "French painter (1859\u20131891)\nGeorges Pierre Seurat ( , ; ; 2 December 1859 \u2013 29 March 1891) was a French post-Impressionist artist. He devised the painting techniques known as chromoluminarism and pointillism and used cont\u00e9 crayon for drawings on paper with a rough surface.\nSeurat's artistic personality combined qualities that are usually thought of as opposed and incompatible: on the one hand, his extreme and delicate sensibility, on the other, a passion for logical abstraction and an almost mathematical precision of mind. His large-scale work \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" (1884\u20131886) altered the direction of modern art by initiating Neo-Impressionism, and is one of the icons of late 19th-century painting.\nBiography.\nFamily and education.\nSeurat was born on 2 December 1859 in Paris, at 60 rue de Bondy (now rue Ren\u00e9 Boulanger). The Seurat family moved to 136 boulevard de Magenta (now 110 boulevard de Magenta) in 1862 or 1863. His father, Antoine Chrysostome Seurat, originally from Champagne, was a former legal official who had become wealthy from speculating in property, and his mother, Ernestine Faivre, was from Paris. Georges had a brother, \u00c9mile Augustin, and a sister, Marie-Berthe, both older. His father lived in Le Raincy and visited his wife and children once a week at boulevard de Magenta.\nGeorges Seurat first studied art at the \u00c9cole Municipale de Sculpture et Dessin, near his family's home in the boulevard Magenta, which was run by the sculptor Justin Lequien. In 1878, he moved on to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts where he was taught by Henri Lehmann, and followed a conventional academic training, drawing from casts of antique sculpture and copying drawings by old masters. Seurat's studies resulted in a well-considered and fertile theory of contrasts: a theory to which all his work was thereafter subjected. His formal artistic education came to an end in November 1879, when he left the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts for a year of military service.\nAfter a year at the Brest Military Academy, he returned to Paris where he shared a studio with his friend Aman-Jean, while also renting a small apartment at 16 rue de Chabrol. For the next two years, he worked at mastering the art of monochrome drawing. His first exhibited work, shown at the Salon, of 1883, was a Cont\u00e9 crayon drawing of Aman-Jean. He also studied the works of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix carefully, making notes on his use of color.\n\"Bathers at Asni\u00e8res\".\nHe spent 1883 working on his first major painting\u00a0\u2013 a large canvas titled \"Bathers at Asni\u00e8res\", a monumental work showing young men relaxing by the Seine in a working-class suburb of Paris. Although influenced in its use of color and light tone by Impressionism, the painting with its smooth, simplified textures and carefully outlined, rather sculptural figures, shows the continuing impact of his neoclassical training; the critic Paul Alexis described it as a \"faux Puvis de Chavannes\". Seurat also departed from the Impressionist ideal by preparing for the work with a number of drawings and oil sketches before starting on the canvas in his studio.\n\"Bathers at Asni\u00e8res\" was rejected by the Paris Salon, and instead he showed it at the Groupe des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants in May 1884. Soon, however, disillusioned by the poor organization of the Ind\u00e9pendants, Seurat and some other artists he had met through the group \u2013 including Charles Angrand, Henri-Edmond Cross, Albert Dubois-Pillet and Paul Signac \u2013 set up a new organization, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants. Seurat's new ideas on pointillism were to have an especially strong influence on Signac, who subsequently painted in the same idiom.\n\"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\".\nIn summer 1884, Seurat began work on \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\".\nThe painting shows members of each of the social classes participating in various park activities. The tiny juxtaposed dots of multi-colored paint allow the viewer's eye to blend colors optically, rather than having the colors physically blended on the canvas. It took Seurat two years to complete this painting, much of which he spent in the park sketching in preparation for the work. There are about 60 studies for the large painting, including a smaller version, \"Study for A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" (1884\u20131885), which is now in the collection of The Art Institute of Chicago. The full work is also part of the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.\nThe painting was the inspiration for James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim's musical \"Sunday in the Park with George\" and played a significant symbolic role in John Hughes' \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\".\nLater career and personal life.\nSeurat concealed his relationship with Madeleine Knobloch (or Madeleine Knoblock, 1868\u20131903), an artist's model whom he portrayed in his painting \"Jeune femme se poudrant\". In 1889, she moved in with Seurat in his studio on the seventh floor of 128 bis Boulevard de Clichy.\nWhen Madeleine became pregnant, the couple moved to a studio at 39 passage de l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e-des-Beaux-Arts (now rue Andr\u00e9 Antoine). There she gave birth to their son, who was named Pierre-Georges, on 16 February 1890.\nSeurat spent the summer of 1890 on the coast at Gravelines, where he painted four canvases including \"The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe\", as well as eight oil panels, and made a few drawings.\nDeath.\nSeurat died in Paris in his parents' home on 29 March 1891 at the age of 31. The cause of his death is uncertain, and has been variously attributed to a form of meningitis, pneumonia, infectious angina, and diphtheria. His son died two weeks later from the same disease. His last ambitious work, \"The Circus\", was left unfinished at the time of his death.\nOn 30 March 1891 a funeral Mass was held in the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul. Seurat was interred 31 March 1891 at Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re-Lachaise.\nAt the time of Seurat's death, Madeleine was pregnant with a second child who died during or shortly after birth.\nColour theory.\nContemporary ideas.\nDuring the 19th century, scientist-writers such as Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, Ogden Rood and David Sutter wrote treatises on colour, optical effects and perception. They adapted the scientific research of Hermann von Helmholtz and Isaac Newton into a form accessible to laypeople. Artists followed new discoveries in perception with great interest.\nChevreul was perhaps the most important influence on artists at the time; his great contribution was producing a colour wheel of primary and intermediary hues. Chevreul was a French chemist who restored tapestries. During his restorations he noticed that the only way to restore a section properly was to take into account the influence of the colours around the missing wool; he could not produce the right hue unless he recognized the surrounding dyes. Chevreul discovered that two colours juxtaposed, slightly overlapping or very close together, would have the effect of another colour when seen from a distance. The discovery of this phenomenon became the basis for the pointillist technique of the Neo-Impressionist painters.\nChevreul also realized that the \"halo\" that one sees after looking at a colour is the opposing colour (also known as complementary color). For example: After looking at a red object, one may see a cyan echo/halo of the original object. This complementary colour (as an example, cyan for red) is due to retinal persistence. Neo-Impressionist painters interested in the interplay of colours made extensive use of complementary colors in their paintings. In his works, Chevreul advised artists to think and paint not just the colour of the central object, but to add colours and make appropriate adjustments to achieve a harmony among colours. It seems that the harmony Chevreul wrote about is what Seurat came to call \"emotion\".\nIt is not clear whether Seurat read all of Chevreul's book on colour contrast, published in 1859, but he did copy out several paragraphs from the chapter on painting, and he had read Charles Blanc's \"Grammaire des arts du dessin\" (1867), which cites Chevreul's work. Blanc's book was directed at artists and art connoisseurs. Because of colour's emotional significance to him, he made explicit recommendations that were close to the theories later adopted by the Neo-Impressionists. He said that colour should not be based on the \"judgment of taste\", but rather it should be close to what we experience in reality. Blanc did not want artists to use equal intensities of colour, but to consciously plan and understand the role of each hue in creating a whole.\nWhile Chevreul based his theories on Newton's thoughts on the mixing of light, Ogden Rood based his writings on the work of Helmholtz. He analyzed the effects of mixing and juxtaposing material pigments. Rood valued as primary colors red, green and blue-violet. Like Chevreul, he said that if two colours are placed next to each other, from a distance they look like a third distinctive colour. He also pointed out that the juxtaposition of primary hues next to each other would create a far more intense and pleasing colour, when perceived by the eye and mind, than the corresponding color made simply by mixing paint. Rood advised artists to be aware of the difference between additive and subtractive qualities of colour, since material pigments and optical pigments (light) do not mix in the same way:\nSeurat was also influenced by Sutter's \"Phenomena of Vision\" (1880), in which he wrote that \"the laws of harmony can be learned as one learns the laws of harmony and music\". He heard lectures in the 1880s by the mathematician Charles Henry at the Sorbonne, who discussed the emotional properties and symbolic meaning of lines and colour. There remains controversy over the extent to which Henry's ideas were adopted by Seurat.\nLanguage of colour.\nSeurat took to heart the colour theorists' notion of a scientific approach to painting. He believed that a painter could use colour to create harmony and emotion in art in the same way that a musician uses counterpoint and variation to create harmony in music. He theorized that the scientific application of colour was like any other natural law, and he was driven to prove this conjecture. He thought that the knowledge of perception and optical laws could be used to create a new language of art based on its own set of heuristics and he set out to show this language using lines, colour intensity and colour schema. Seurat called this language Chromoluminarism.\nIn a letter to the writer Maurice Beaubourg in 1890 he wrote: \"Art is Harmony. Harmony is the analogy of the contrary and of similar elements of tone, of colour and of line. In tone, lighter against darker. In colour, the complementary, red-green, orange-blue, yellow-violet. In line, those that form a right-angle. The frame is in a harmony that opposes those of the tones, colours and lines of the picture, these aspects are considered according to their dominance and under the influence of light, in gay, calm or sad combinations\".\nSeurat's theories can be summarized as follows: The emotion of gaiety can be achieved by the domination of luminous hues, by the predominance of warm colours, and by the use of lines directed upward. Calm is achieved through an equivalence/balance of the use of the light and the dark, by the balance of warm and cold colours, and by lines that are horizontal. Sadness is achieved by using dark and cold colours and by lines pointing downward.\nInfluence.\nWhere the dialectic nature of Paul C\u00e9zanne's work had been greatly influential during the highly expressionistic phase of proto-Cubism, between 1908 and 1910, the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures, would capture the attention of the Cubists from 1911. Seurat in his few years of activity, was able, with his observations on irradiation and the effects of contrast, to create afresh without any guiding tradition, to complete an esthetic system with a new technical method perfectly adapted to its expression.\n\"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910\u20131911,\" writes art historian Robert Herbert, \"questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. Thanks to several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. \"The Chahut\" [Rijksmuseum Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller, Otterlo] was called by Andr\u00e9 Salmon 'one of the great icons of the new devotion', and both it and the \"Cirque (Circus)\", Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, according to Guillaume Apollinaire, 'almost belong to Synthetic Cubism'.\"\nThe concept was well established among the French artists that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form; and this mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling \"objective truth\", perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented.\nIndeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses both problems in \"Circus\" and \"Dancers\"). Soon, the Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics; Orphism would do so with color too.\nOn 2 December 2021, Google honored Seurat with a Google Doodle on his 162nd birthday.\nExhibitions.\nFrom 1883 until his death, Seurat exhibited his work at the Salon, the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, Les XX in Brussels, the eighth Impressionist exhibition, and other exhibitions in France and abroad.\nPosthumous exhibitions:\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She received various accolades, including an Academy Award, three BAFTA Awards, a C\u00e9sar Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress, in addition to nominations for two Golden Globe Awards.\nEarly life.\nSignoret was born Simone Henriette Charlotte Kaminker in Wiesbaden, Germany, to Georgette (n\u00e9e Signoret) and Andr\u00e9 Kaminker. She was the eldest of three children, with two younger brothers. Her father, a pioneering interpreter who worked in the League of Nations, was a French-born army officer from an assimilated and middle-class Polish-Jewish and Hungarian-Jewish family, who brought the family to Neuilly-sur-Seine on the outskirts of Paris. Her mother, Georgette, from whom she acquired her stage name, was a French Catholic.\nSignoret grew up in Paris in an intellectual atmosphere and studied English, German and Latin. After completing secondary school during the Nazi occupation, Simone was responsible for supporting her family and forced to take work as a typist for a French collaborationist newspaper \"Les nouveaux temps\", run by Jean Luchaire.\nCareer.\nDuring the occupation of France, Signoret mixed with an artistic group of writers and actors who met at the Caf\u00e9 de Flore in the Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s quarter. By this time, she had developed an interest in acting and was encouraged by her friends, including her lover Daniel G\u00e9lin to follow her ambition. In 1942, she began appearing in bit parts and was able to earn enough money to support her mother and two brothers as her father, who was a French patriot, had fled the country in 1940 to join General De Gaulle in England. She took her mother's maiden name for the screen to help hide her Jewish roots.\nSignoret's sensual features and earthy nature led to type-casting and she was often seen in roles as a prostitute. She won considerable attention in \"La Ronde\" (1950), a film which was banned briefly in New York City as immoral. She won further acclaim, including an acting award from the British Film Academy, for her portrayal of another prostitute, Am\u00e9lie \u00c9lie, in Jacques Becker's \"Casque d'or\" (1951), which in France became a signature role for her. She appeared in many French films during the 1950s, including \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin\" (1953), directed by Marcel Carn\u00e9, \"Les Diaboliques\" (1954), and \"The Crucible\" (\"Les Sorci\u00e8res de Salem\"; 1956), based on Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\".\nIn 1958, Signoret acted in the English independent film \"Room at the Top\" (1959), and her performance won numerous awards, including the Best Female Performance Prize at Cannes and the Academy Award for Best Actress. She was offered films in Hollywood, but for the next few years worked in Europe\u2014for example, with Laurence Olivier in \"Term of Trial\" (1962). She earned another Oscar nomination for her work on \"Ship of Fools\" (1965); was part of a cast of international stars recreating the liberation of Paris in Paramount's epic \"Is Paris Burning?\"; then, after working with Sidney Lumet on \"The Deadly Affair\" and \"The Sea Gull\", she returned permanently to France in 1969.\nIn November 1960, Signoret was interviewed by John Freeman, about her career and life for BBC television series \"Face to Face\". Signoret was one of only two women to be interviewed as part of the first iteration of the series, the other being renowned poet Dame Edith Sitwell. \nIn 1962, Signoret translated Lillian Hellman's play \"The Little Foxes\" into French for a production in Paris that ran for six months at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah-Bernhardt. She played the Regina role as well. Hellman was displeased with the production, although the translation was approved by scholars selected by Hellman. Signoret's one attempt at Shakespeare, performing Lady Macbeth with Alec Guinness at the Royal Court Theatre in London in 1966 proved to be ill-advised, with some harsh critics; one referred to her English as \"impossibly Gallic\".\nSignoret won acclaim for her portrayal of a weary madam in \"Madame Rosa\" (1977) and as an unmarried sister who unknowingly falls in love with her paralyzed brother via anonymous correspondence in \"I Sent a Letter to my Love\" (1980). She continued to act until her death, working on the miniseries \"Music-Hall\" while terminally ill.\nPersonal life.\nSignoret's memoirs, \"Nostalgia Isn't What It Used to Be\", were published in 1976. She also wrote the novel \"Adieu Volodya\", published in 1985, the year of her death: this was autobiographical in its depiction of Jewish immigrants in France between the wars. Both books were best-sellers in France.\nSignoret first married filmmaker Yves All\u00e9gret (1944\u20131949), with whom she had a son (Patrick) and a daughter Catherine All\u00e9gret. Patrick died nine days after his birth. Privately, Signoret blamed the hospital for his death as they had taken Patrick to a chapel for baptism and he shortly thereafter caught a cold and died. Signoret never spoke publicly about his death.\nHer second marriage was to the Italian-born French actor Yves Montand in 1951, a union which lasted until her death; the couple had no children. They were both active in left-wing and humanitarian causes, although as they grew older she gravitated towards the political centre and he to the right.\nSignoret died of colon cancer in Autheuil-Authouillet, France, aged 64. She was buried in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, and Yves Montand later was buried next to her.\nSignoret identified as Jewish. She was a supporter of a variety of Jewish causes, including the Zionist movement and the Soviet Jewry movement. She maintained relationships with many Israeli leaders and was critical of antisemitism in the French Communist Party. Because she was of patrilineal Jewish ancestry and was therefore not considered Jewish under traditional halakha, there was no religious ceremony at her funeral.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62034", "revid": "47189161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62034", "title": "Simone de Beauvoir", "text": "French philosopher, social theorist and activist (1908\u20131986)\nSimone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir (, ; ; 9 January 1908 \u2013 14 April 1986) was a French existentialist philosopher, writer, social theorist, and feminist activist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, nor was she considered one at the time of her death, she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory.\nBeauvoir wrote novels, essays, short stories, biographies, autobiographies, and monographs on philosophy, politics, and social issues. She was best known for her \"trailblazing work in feminist philosophy\", \"The Second Sex\" (1949), a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism. She was also known for her novels, the most famous of which were \"She Came to Stay\" (1943) and \"The Mandarins\" (1954). \nHer most enduring contribution to literature are her memoirs, notably the first volume, \"M\u00e9moires d'une jeune fille rang\u00e9e\" (1958). She received the 1954 Prix Goncourt, the 1975 Jerusalem Prize, and the 1978 Austrian State Prize for European Literature. She was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961, 1969 and 1973. However, Beauvoir generated controversy when she briefly lost her teaching job after being accused of sexually abusing some of her students.\nPersonal life.\nEarly years.\nBeauvoir was born on 9 January 1908, into a bourgeois Parisian family in the 6th arrondissement. Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir, a lawyer who once aspired to be an actor, and Fran\u00e7oise Beauvoir (n\u00e9e Brasseur), a wealthy banker's daughter and devout Catholic. Simone had a sister, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who was born two years later, on 6 June 1910. Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fueled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u201cSimone has a man's brain; she thinks like a man; she is a man.\u201d\u2014\u200aFran\u00e7oise Beauvoir (n\u00e9e Brasseur), in \nThe family struggled to remain bourgeois after they lost much of their fortune shortly after World War I and Fran\u00e7oise's insistence his daughters attend a prestigious convent school. Because of her family's straitened circumstances she could no longer rely on her dowry. This put her marriage opportunities at risk. She took this as an opportunity to work towards earning her own living.\nShe first worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in preparation for the \"agr\u00e9gation\" in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination that serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for it that she met \u00c9cole Normale students Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Nizan, and Ren\u00e9 Maheu (who gave her the lasting nickname \"Castor\", or \"Beaver\"). The jury for the \"agr\u00e9gation\" narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam. Additionally, Beauvoir finished an exam for the certificate of \"General Philosophy and Logic\" second to Simone Weil. Her success as the eighth woman to pass the \"agr\u00e9gation\" solidified her economic independence and furthered her feminist ideology.\nWriting of her youth in \"Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter,\" she said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual.\u2014\u200a\nEducation.\nBeauvoir pursued post-secondary education after completing her high school years at Cours Desir. After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy at the age of seventeen in 1925, she studied mathematics at the Institut Catholique de Paris and literature/languages at the Institut Sainte-Marie. She then studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and after completing her degree in 1928, wrote her \"Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es\" (roughly equivalent to an M.A. thesis) on Leibniz for L\u00e9on Brunschvicg in 1929 (the topic was \"Le concept chez Leibniz\" [\"The Concept in Leibniz\"]).\nReligious upbringing.\nBeauvoir was raised in a Catholic household. In her youth, she was sent to convent schools. She was deeply religious as a child, at one point intending to become a nun. At age 14, Beauvoir began to question her faith, consequently abandoning religion in her teens and remaining an atheist for the rest of her life. To explain her atheist beliefs, Beauvoir stated, \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Faith allows an evasion of those difficulties which the atheist confronts honestly. And to crown all, the believer derives a sense of great superiority from this very cowardice itself.\"\u2014\u200a\nMiddle years.\nFrom 1929 through 1943, Beauvoir taught at the lyc\u00e9e level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the Lyc\u00e9e Montgrand (Marseille), the Lyc\u00e9e Jeanne-d'Arc (Rouen), and the Lyc\u00e9e Moli\u00e8re (Paris) (1936\u201339).\nDuring the trial of Robert Brasillach Beauvoir was among a small number of prominent intellectuals advocating for his execution for 'intellectual crimes'. She defended this decision in her 1946 essay \"An Eye for an Eye\".\nJean-Paul Sartre.\nBeauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre met during her college years. Intrigued by her determination as an educator, he intended to make their relationship romantic. However, she had no interest in doing so. She later changed her mind, and in October 1929, Jean-Paul Sartre and Beauvoir became a couple for the next 51 years, until his death in 1980. After they were confronted by her father, Sartre asked her to marry him on a provisional basis. One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre, he said, \"Let's sign a two-year lease\". Though Beauvoir wrote, \"Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry\", scholars point out that her ideal relationships described in \"The Second Sex\" and elsewhere bore little resemblance to the marriage standards of the day.\nI think marriage is a very alienating institution, for men as well as for women. I think it's a very dangerous institution\u2014dangerous for men, who find themselves trapped, saddled with a wife and children to support; dangerous for women, who aren't financially independent and end up by depending on men who can throw them out when they are 40; and very dangerous for children, because their parents vent all their frustrations and mutual hatred on them. The very words 'conjugal rights' are dreadful. Any institution which solders one person to another, obliging people to sleep together who no longer want to is a bad one.\nInstead, she and Sartre entered into a lifelong \"soul partnership\", which was sexual but not exclusive, nor did it involve living together. She chose never to marry and never had children. This gave her the time to advance her education and engage in political causes, write and teach, and take lovers. Beauvoir's prominent open relationships at times overshadowed her academic reputation. A scholar who was lecturing with her chastised their \"distinguished [Harvard] audience [because] every question asked about Sartre concerned his work, while all those asked about Beauvoir concerned her personal life.\"\nSartre and Beauvoir always read each other's work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works, such as Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\" and Beauvoir's \"She Came to Stay\" and \"Phenomenology and Intent\". However, recent studies of Beauvoir's work focus on influences other than Sartre, including Hegel and Leibniz. The Neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve and Jean Hyppolite in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\". However, Beauvoir, reading Hegel in German during the war, produced an original critique of his dialectic of consciousness.\nAllegations of sexual abuse.\nBeauvoir was bisexual, and her relationships with young women were controversial. French author Bianca Lamblin (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book \"M\u00e9moires d'une jeune fille d\u00e9rang\u00e9e\" (Memoirs of a deranged young girl, published in English under the title \"A Disgraceful Affair\") that, while a student at Lyc\u00e9e Moli\u00e8re, she was sexually exploited by her teacher Beauvoir, who was in her 30s. Beauvoir groomed the 16-year-old girl before introducing her to Sartre. The three had a sexually exploitative relationship over the course of three years. Bianca wrote her \"M\u00e9moires\" in response to the posthumous 1990 publication of Jean-Paul Sartre's \"Lettres au Castor et \u00e0 quelques autres: 1926-1963\" (Letters to Castor and other friends), in which she noted that she was referred to by the pseudonym Louise V\u00e9drine. Bianca, upon learning that she was given a pseudonym, stated she felt \"nauseated and disgusted when [she] discovered the true personality of the woman [she] had loved all [her] life\".\nIn 1943, Beauvoir was suspended again from her teaching position when she was accused of seducing her 17-year-old lyc\u00e9e pupil Natalie Sorokine in 1939. Sorokine's parents laid formal charges against Beauvoir for debauching a minor (the age of consent in France at the time was 13 until 1945, when it became 15) and Beauvoir's licence to teach in France was revoked, although it was subsequently reinstated.\nBeauvoir described in \"La Force de l'\u00e2ge\" (\"The Prime of Life\") a relationship of simple friendship with Sorokine (in the book referred to as \"Lise Oblanoff\"). However, both Sorokine and Lamblin\u2014along with Olga Kosakiewicz\u2014stated later that their relationships with Beauvoir had damaged them psychologically.\nLater years.\nBeauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Her 1955 travels in China were the basis of her 1957 travelogue \"\", in which she praised the efforts of the Chinese communists to emancipate women.\nShe published several volumes of short stories, including \"The Woman Destroyed\", which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.\nShe lived with Claude Lanzmann from 1952 to 1959, but perhaps her most famous lover was American author Nelson Algren. Beauvoir met Algren in Chicago in 1947, while she was on a four-month \"exploration\" trip of the United States using various means of transport: automobile, train, and Greyhound. She kept a detailed diary of the trip, which was published in France in 1948 with the title \"America Day by Day\". She wrote to him across the Atlantic as \"my beloved husband.\" Algren won the National Book Award for \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" in 1950, and in 1954, Beauvoir won France's most prestigious literary prize for \"The Mandarins,\" in which Algren is the character Lewis Brogan. Algren vociferously objected to their intimacy becoming public. Years after they separated, she was buried wearing his gift of a silver ring.\nWhen Beauvoir visited Algren in Chicago, Art Shay took well-known nude and portrait photos of Beauvoir. Shay also wrote a play based on Algren, Beauvoir, and Sartre's triangular relationship. The play was stage read in 1999 in Chicago.\nBeauvoir also wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of \"Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter\", \"The Prime of Life\", \"Force of Circumstance\" (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: \"After the War\" and \"Hard Times\"), and \"All Said and Done\". In 1964 Beauvoir published a novella-length autobiography, \"A Very Easy Death\", covering the time she spent visiting her aging mother, who was dying of cancer. The novella brings up questions of ethical concerns with truth-telling in doctor-patient relationships.\nIn the 1970s Beauvoir became active in France's women's liberation movement. She wrote and signed the Manifesto of the 343 in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Signatories were diverse as Catherine Deneuve, Delphine Seyrig, and Beauvoir's sister H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. In 1974, abortion was legalized in France.\nWhen asked in a 1975 interview with Betty Friedan if she would support a minimum wage for women who do housework, Beauvoir answered: \"No, we don\u2019t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorized to stay at home and raise her children. Society should be different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction\", further stating that motherhood \"should be a choice, and not a result of conditioning\u201d.\nIn about 1976, Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the United States to visit Kate Millett on her farm.\nIn 1977, Beauvoir signed a petition along with other French intellectuals that supported the freeing of three arrested paedophiles. The petition explicitly addresses the 'Affaire de Versailles', where three adult men, Dejager (age 45), Gallien (age 43), and Burckhardt (age 39) had sexual relations with minors of both sexes aged 12\u201313.\n\"When Things of the Spirit Come First\", a set of short stories Beauvoir had written decades previously but had not considered worth publishing, was released in 1980.\nIn 1981 she wrote \"La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie des adieux\" (\"A Farewell to Sartre\"), a painful account of Sartre's last years. In the opening of \"Adieux\", Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.\nShe contributed the piece \"Feminism - Alive, Well, and in Constant Danger\" to the 1984 anthology \"\", edited by Robin Morgan.\nAfter Sartre died in 1980, Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elka\u00efm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir Sylvie Le Bon, unlike Elka\u00efm, published Beauvoir's unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.\nSylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir.\nSylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir and Simone de Beauvoir met in the 1960s, when Beauvoir was in her fifties and Sylvie was a teenager. In 1980, Beauvoir, 72, legally adopted Sylvie, who was in her late thirties, by which point they had already been in an intimate relationship for decades. Although Beauvoir rejected the institution of marriage her entire life, this adoption was like a marriage for her. Some scholars argue that this adoption was not to secure a literary heir for Beauvoir, but as a form of resistance to the bio-heteronormative family unit.\nDeath.\nBeauvoir died of pneumonia on 14 April 1986 in Paris, aged 78. She is buried next to Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. She was honored as a figure at the forefront of the struggle for women's rights around the time of her passing.\n\"The Second Sex\".\n\"The Second Sex\", first published in 1949 in French as \"Le Deuxi\u00e8me Sexe\", turns the existentialist mantra that \"existence precedes essence\" into a feminist one: \"One is not born but becomes a woman\" (French: \"On ne na\u00eet pas femme, on le devient\"). With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the sex-gender distinction, that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes. Beauvoir argues that \"the fundamental source of women's oppression is its [femininity's] historical and social construction as the quintessential\" Other.\nBeauvoir defines women as the \"second sex\" because women are defined as inferior to men. She pointed out that Aristotle argued women are \"female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities\", while Thomas Aquinas referred to women as \"imperfect men\" and the \"incidental\" being. She quotes \"In itself, homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality: the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man; either, a human being, without feeling fear, restraint, or obligation.\"\nBeauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the \"immanence\" to which they were previously resigned and reaching \"transcendence\", a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.\nChapters of \"The Second Sex\" were originally published in \"Les Temps modernes\", in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France. It was published soon after in America due to the quick translation by Howard Parshley, as prompted by Blanche Knopf, wife of publisher Alfred A. Knopf. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at Smith College), much of Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message. For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars.\nOnly in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.\nIn the chapter \"Woman: Myth and Reality\" of \"The Second Sex\", Beauvoir argued that men had made women the \"Other\" in society by the application of a false aura of \"mystery\" around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class, and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a patriarchy.\nDespite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French women's liberation movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist. However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be enough to bring about women's liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with \"Le Nouvel Observateur\".\nIn 2018, the manuscript pages of \"Le Deuxi\u00e8me Sexe\" were published.\nOther notable works.\n\"She Came to Stay\".\nBeauvoir published her first novel \"She Came to Stay\" in 1943. It has been assumed that it is inspired by her and Sartre's sexual relationship with Olga Kosakiewicz and Wanda Kosakiewicz. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married Jacques-Laurent Bost, a lover of Beauvoir. However, the main thrust of the novel is philosophical, a scene in which to situate Beauvoir's abiding philosophical pre-occupation \u2013 the relationship between the self and the other.\nIn the novel, set just before the outbreak of World War II, Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with the young woman. The novel also delves into Beauvoir and Sartre's complex relationship and how it was affected by the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois.\n\"She Came to Stay\" was followed by many others, including \"The Blood of Others\", which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the Resistance in World War II.\nExistentialist ethics.\nIn 1944, Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, \"Pyrrhus et Cin\u00e9as\", a discussion on existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay \"The Ethics of Ambiguity\" (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into French existentialism. In the essay, Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as \"Being and Nothingness\". In \"The Ethics of Ambiguity\", Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.\n\"Les Temps Modernes\".\nAt the end of World War II, Beauvoir and Sartre edited \"Les Temps Modernes\", a political journal that Sartre founded along with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others. Beauvoir used \"Les Temps Modernes\" to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. Beauvoir remained an editor until her death. However, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave \"Les Temps modernes\". Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In Beauvoir's later years, she hosted the journal's editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre, whom she often had to force to offer his opinions.\n\"The Mandarins\".\nPublished in 1954, \"The Mandarins\" won France's highest literary prize, the \"Prix Goncourt\". It is a roman \u00e0 clef set after the end of World War II and follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartre's and Beauvoir's intimate circle, including her relationship with American writer Nelson Algren, to whom the book is dedicated.\nAlgren was outraged by the frank way Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both \"The Mandarins\" and her autobiographies. Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of Beauvoir's work. Much material bearing on this episode in Beauvoir's life, including her love letters to Algren, entered the public domain only after her death.\n\"Les Ins\u00e9parables\".\nBeauvoir's early novel \"Les Ins\u00e9parables\", long suppressed, was published in French in 2020 and two different English translations in 2021, by Sandra Smith in the US and Lauren Elkin in the UK. Written in 1954, the book describes her first love, a classmate named Elisabeth Lacoin (\"Zaza\") who died before age 22 of viral encephalitis, and had as a teenager a \"passionate and tragic\" relationship with Beauvoir. According to Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir, Beauvoir never forgave Madame Lacoin for what happened, believing that Elisabeth-Zaza was murdered by the oppressive socio-cultural environment in which she had been raised. Disapproved by Sartre, the novel was deemed \"too intimate\" to be published during Beauvoir's lifetime.\nLegacy.\nBeauvoir's \"The Second Sex\" is considered a foundational work in the history of feminism. Beauvoir had denied being feminist multiple times but ultimately admitted that she was one after \"The Second Sex\" became crucial in the world of feminism. The work has had a profound influence, opening the way for second-wave feminism in the United States, Canada, Australia, and around the world. Although Beauvoir has been quoted as saying \"There is a certain unreasonable demand that I find a little stupid because it would enclose me, immobilize me completely in a sort of feminist concrete block,\" her works on feminism have paved the way for all future feminists. The founders of the second-wave read \"The Second Sex\" in translation, including Kate Millett, Shulamith Firestone, Juliet Mitchell, Ann Oakley and Germaine Greer. All acknowledged their profound debt to Beauvoir, including visiting her in France, consulting with her at crucial moments, and dedicating works to her. Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book \"The Feminine Mystique\" is often regarded as the opening salvo of second-wave feminism in the United States, later said that reading \"The Second Sex\" in the early 1950s \"led me to whatever original analysis of women's existence I have been able to contribute to the Women's movement and its unique politics. I looked to Simone de Beauvoir for a philosophical and intellectual authority.\"\nAt one point in the early 1970s, Beauvoir also aligned herself with the French League for Women's Rights as a means to campaign and fight against sexism in French society. Beauvoir's influence goes beyond just her impact on second-wave founders, and extends to numerous aspects of feminism, including literary criticism, history, philosophy, theology, criticism of scientific discourse, and psychotherapy. When Beauvoir first became involved with the feminism movement, one of her objectives was legalizing abortion. Donna Haraway wrote that, \"despite important differences, all the modern feminist meanings of gender have roots in Simone de Beauvoir's claim that 'one is not born a woman [one becomes one].'\" This \"most famous feminist sentence ever written\" is echoed in the title of Monique Wittig's 1981 essay \"One Is Not Born a Woman\". Judith Butler took the concept a step further, arguing that Beauvoir's choice of the verb \"to become\" suggests that gender is a process, constantly being renewed in an ongoing interaction between the surrounding culture and individual choice.\nIn Paris, Place Jean-Paul-Sartre-et-Simone-de-Beauvoir is a square where Beauvoir's legacy lives on. It is one of the few squares in Paris to be officially named after a couple. The pair lived close to the square at 42 rue Bonaparte.\nWorks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a significant contributor to the Dada and Surrealist movements, although his ties to each were informal. He produced major works in a variety of media but considered himself a painter above all. \nHe was a photography innovator as well as a fashion and portrait photographer, and is noted for his work with photograms, which he called \"rayographs\" in reference to himself.\nBiography.\nBackground and early life.\nDuring his career, Man Ray allowed few details of his early life or family background to be known to the public. He even refused to acknowledge that he even had a name other than Man Ray, and his 1963 autobiography \"Self-Portrait\" contains few dates.\nMan Ray was born Emmanuel Radnitzky in South Philadelphia on August 27, 1890. He was the eldest child of Russian Jewish immigrants Melach \"Max\" Radnitzky, a tailor, and Manya \"Minnie\" Radnitzky (n\u00e9e Lourie or Luria). He had a brother, Sam, and two sisters, Dorothy \"Dora\" and Essie (or Elsie), the youngest born in 1897 shortly after they settled at 372 Debevoise St. in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In early 1912, the Radnitzky family changed their surname to Ray; Sam chose this surname in reaction to the antisemitism prevalent at the time. Emmanuel, who was nicknamed \"Manny\", changed his first name to Man and gradually began to use Man Ray as his name.\nMan Ray's father worked in a garment factory and ran a small tailoring business out of the family home. He enlisted his children to assist him from an early age. Man Ray's mother enjoyed designing the family's clothes and inventing patchwork items from scraps of fabric. Man Ray wished to distance himself from his family background, but tailoring left an enduring mark on his art. Mannequins, flat irons, sewing machines, needles, pins, threads, swatches of fabric, and other items related to tailoring appear in much of his work, and art historians have noted similarities between Ray's collage and painting techniques and styles used for tailoring.\nMason Klein, curator of the exhibition \"Alias Man Ray: The Art of Reinvention\" at the Jewish Museum in New York, suggests that Man Ray may have been \"the first Jewish avant-garde artist.\"\nMan Ray was the uncle of the photographer Naomi Savage, who learned some of his techniques and incorporated them into her own work.\nFirst artistic endeavors.\nMan Ray displayed artistic and mechanical abilities during childhood. His education at Brooklyn's Boys' High School from 1904 to 1909 provided him with solid grounding in drafting and other basic art techniques. While he attended school, he educated himself with frequent visits to local art museums. After his graduation, Ray was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as an artist. Man Ray's parents were disappointed by his decision to pursue art, but they agreed to rearrange the family's modest living quarters so that Ray's room could be his studio. The artist remained in the family home over the next four years. During this time, he worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter. Man Ray earned money as a commercial artist and was a technical illustrator at several Manhattan companies.\nThe surviving examples of his work from this period indicate that he attempted mostly paintings and drawings in 19th-century styles. He was already an avid admirer of contemporary avant-garde art, such as the European modernists he saw at Alfred Stieglitz's 291 gallery and works by the Ashcan School. However, he was not yet able to integrate these trends into much of his own work. The art classes he sporadically attended, including stints at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League, were of little apparent benefit to him. When he enrolled at the Ferrer Centre in the autumn of 1912, he began a period of intense and rapid artistic development. The Centre, established and run by anarchists in memory of the executed Catalan anarchist educationalist Francisco Ferrer, provided classes in drawing and lectures on art-criticism. Anarchist writer Emma Goldman noted \"a spirit of freedom in the art class which probably did not exist anywhere else in New York at that time\" there. Man Ray exhibited works in the Centre's 1912-13 group exhibition, with his painting \"A Study in Nudes\" reproduced in a review of the show in the Centre's associated magazine \"The Modern School\". This may have been his first published art work, and the magazine would go on to print his first published poem (\"Travail\") in 1913. During this period he also contributed illustrations to radical publications, including providing the cover-art for two 1914 issues of Goldman's journal \"Mother Earth\".\nMan Ray's work at this time was influenced by the avant-garde practices of European contemporary artists he was introduced to at the 1913 Armory Show. His early paintings display facets of cubism. After befriending Marcel Duchamp, who was interested in showing movement in static paintings, his works began to depict movement of the figures. An example is the repetitive positions of the dancer's skirts in \"The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows\" (1916).\nIn 1915, Man Ray had his first solo show of paintings and drawings after taking up residence at an art colony in Grantwood, New Jersey. His first proto-Dada object, an assemblage titled \"Self-Portrait\", was exhibited the following year. He produced his first significant photographs in 1918, after initially picking up the camera to document his own artwork.\nMan Ray abandoned conventional painting to involve himself with the radical Dada movement. He published two Dadaist periodicals, that each only had one issue, \"The Ridgefield Gazook\" (1915) and \"TNT\" (1919), the latter co-edited by Adolf Wolff and Mitchell Dawson. He started making objects and developed unique mechanical and photographic methods of making images. For the 1918 version of \"Rope Dancer\", he combined a spray-gun technique with a pen drawing. Like Duchamp, he worked with readymades\u2014ordinary objects that are selected and modified. His readymade \"The Gift\" (1921) is a flatiron with metal tacks attached to the bottom, and \"Enigma of Isidore Ducasse\" is an unseen object (a sewing machine) wrapped in cloth and tied with cord. \"Aerograph\" (1919), another work from this period, was done with airbrush on glass.\nIn 1920, Man Ray helped Duchamp make his \"Rotary Glass Plates\", one of the earliest examples of kinetic art. It was composed of glass plates turned by a motor. That same year, Man Ray, Katherine Dreier, and Duchamp founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme, an itinerant collection that was the first museum of modern art in the U.S. In 1941 the collection was donated to Yale University Art Gallery.\nMan Ray teamed up with Duchamp to publish one issue of \"New York Dada\" in 1920. For Man Ray, Dada's experimentation was no match for the environment of New York; he wrote that \"Dada cannot live in New York. All New York is dada, and will not tolerate a rival.\"\nIn 1913, Man Ray met his first wife, the Belgian poet Adon Lacroix (Donna Lecoeur) (1887\u20131975), in New York. They married in 1914, separated in 1919, and formally divorced in 1937.\nParis.\nIn July 1921, Man Ray went to live and work in Paris, settling in the Montparnasse quarter favored by many artists. His accidental rediscovery of the cameraless photogram, which he called \"rayographs\", resulted in images hailed by Tristan Tzara as \"pure Dada creations\".\nShortly after arriving in Paris, he met and fell in love with Alice Prin (popularly known as \"Kiki de Montparnasse\"), an artists' model and celebrated character in Paris bohemian circles. Prin was Man Ray's companion for most of the 1920s, and became the subject of some of his most famous photographic images. She also starred in his experimental films \"Le Retour \u00e0 la raison\" and \"L'\u00c9toile de mer\".\nIn 1929, he began a love affair with the Surrealist photographer Lee Miller. She was also his photographic assistant and, together, they reinvented the photographic technique of solarization. Miller left him in 1932.\nFrom late 1934 until August 1940, Man Ray was in a relationship with Guadeloupean dancer Ady Fidelin, who appeared in many of his photographs. When Ray fled the Nazi occupation in France, Adrienne chose to stay behind to care for her family. Unlike the artist's other significant muses, Fidelin had until 2022 largely been written out of his life story.\nMan Ray was a pioneering photographer in Paris for two decades between the wars. Many significant members of the art world, including Pablo Picasso, Tristan Tzara, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Peggy Guggenheim, Alice Rahon, Bridget Bate Tichenor, Luisa Casati, and Antonin Artaud, posed for his camera. His international fame as a portrait photographer is reflected in a series of photographs of Maharajah Yashwant Rao Holkar II and his wife Sanyogita Devi from their visit to Europe in 1927. In the winter of 1933, surrealist artist M\u00e9ret Oppenheim, known for her fur-covered teacup, posed nude for Man Ray in a well-known series of photographs depicting her standing next to a printing press.\nHis practice of photographing African objects in the Paris collections of Paul Guillaume and Charles Ratton and others led to several iconic photographs, including \"Noire et blanche\". As Man Ray scholar Wendy A. Grossman has illustrated, \"no one was more influential in translating the vogue for African art into a Modernist photographic aesthetic than Man Ray.\"\nMan Ray was represented in the first Surrealist exhibition with Jean Arp, Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Georges Malkine, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Joan Mir\u00f3, and Pablo Picasso at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. Important works from this time were a metronome with an eye, originally titled \"Object to Be Destroyed\", and the \"Violon d'Ingres\", a photograph of Kiki de Montparnasse styled after the painter/musician Ingres. \"Violon d'Ingres\" is a popular example of how Man Ray could juxtapose disparate elements in his photography to generate meaning.\nMan Ray directed a number of influential avant-garde short films, known as \"Cin\u00e9ma Pur\". He directed \"Le Retour \u00e0 la Raison\" (2 mins, 1923); \"Emak-Bakia\" (16 mins, 1926); \"L'\u00c9toile de Mer\" (15 mins, 1928); and \"Les Myst\u00e8res du Ch\u00e2teau de D\u00e9\" (27 mins, 1929). Man Ray also assisted Marcel Duchamp with the cinematography of his film \"Anemic Cinema\" (1926), and Ray personally manned the camera on Fernand L\u00e9ger's \"Ballet M\u00e9canique\" (1924). In Ren\u00e9 Clair's film \"Entr'acte\" (1924), Man Ray appeared in a brief scene playing chess with Duchamp. Duchamp, Man Ray, and Francis Picabia were all friends and collaborators, connected by their experimental, entertaining, and innovative art.\nHollywood.\nThe Second World War forced Man Ray to return to the United States. He lived in Los Angeles from 1940 to 1951, where he focused his creative energy on painting. One of his residences was the Chateau des Fleurs, another was Villa Elaine Apartments, both in Hollywood. A few days after arriving in Los Angeles, he met Juliet Browner, a first-generation American of Romanian-Jewish lineage. She was a trained dancer who studied dance with Martha Graham, and an experienced artists' model. They married in 1946 in a double wedding with their friends Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning; Browner took the name \"Juliet Man Ray\". They were also close friends with Black Dahlia suspect George Hodel and his second wife Dorothy Harvey (also known as Dorero). George Hodel\u2019s son Steve Hodel even proposes that the staging of the murder was an homage to Man Ray\u2019s surrealist creations. In 1948 Ray had a solo exhibition at the Copley Galleries in Beverly Hills, which brought together a wide array of work and featured his newly painted canvases of the \"Shakespearean Equations\" series.\nLater life.\nMan Ray returned to Paris in 1951, and settled with Juliet into a studio at 2 bis rue F\u00e9rou near the Jardin du Luxembourg, where he continued his creative practice across mediums. During the last quarter century of his life, he returned to a number of his iconic earlier works, recreating them in new form. He also directed the production of limited-edition replicas of several of his objects, working first with Marcel Zerbib and later Arturo Schwarz.\nIn 1963, he published his autobiography, \"Self-Portrait\" (republished in 1999).\nRay continued to work on new paintings, photographs, collages and art objects until his death from a lung infection, in Paris, on November 18, 1976. He was interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse in Paris, his epitaph reads \"Unconcerned, but not indifferent\". When Juliet died in 1991, she was interred in the same tomb. Her epitaph reads \"Together again\". The grave site has now fallen into disrepair and the memorial stone is removed or missing. Juliet organized a trust for Ray's work and donated much of his work to museums. Her plans to restore the studio as a public museum proved too expensive; such was the structure's disrepair. Most of its contents were stored at the Centre Pompidou museum in Paris.\nInnovations.\nMan Ray was responsible for several technical innovations in modern art, filmmaking, and photography. These included his use of photograms to produce surrealist images he called \"rayographs\", and solarization (rediscovered with Lee Miller). His 1923 experimental film \"Le Retour \u00e0 la raison\" was the first 'cine-rayograph', a motion picture made without the use of a camera. Ray's 1935 \"Space Writing (Self-Portrait)\" was the first light painting, predating Picasso's 1949 light paintings, photographed by Gjon Mili, by fourteen years.\nAccolades.\nIn 1974, Man Ray received the Royal Photographic Society's Progress Medal and Honorary Fellowship \"in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense.\" In 1999, \"ARTnews\" magazine named Man Ray one of the 25 most influential artists of the 20th century. The publication cited his groundbreaking photography, \"his explorations of film, painting, sculpture, collage, assemblage and prototypes of what would eventually be called performance art and conceptual art.\" \"ARTnews\" further stated that \"Man Ray offered artists in all media an example of a creative intelligence that, in its 'pursuit of pleasure and liberty', unlocked every door it came to and walked freely where it would.\"\nArt market.\nMan Ray's \"Le Violon d'Ingres\" (1924), a famed photograph depicting a nude Alice Prin's back overlaid with a violin's f-holes, sold for $12.4 million on May 14, 2022, setting a new world record as the most expensive photograph ever to be sold at auction. The sale came after a drawn-out bidding period that lasted nearly ten minutes during Christie's New York's auction dedicated to Surrealist art.\nOn November 9, 2017, Man Ray's \"Noire et Blanche\" (1926), formerly in the collection of Jacques Doucet, was purchased at Christie's Paris for \u20ac2,688,750 (US$3,120,658), becoming (at that time) the 14th most expensive photograph to ever sell at auction. This was a record not only for Man Ray's work in the photographic medium but also for the sale at auction of any vintage photograph.\nOnly two other works by Man Ray in any medium have commanded more at auction than the price captured by the 2017 sale of \"Noire et blanche.\" His 1916 canvas \"Promenade\" sold for $5,877,000 on November 6, 2013, at the Sotheby's New York Impressionist &amp; Modern Art Sale. And on November 13, 2017, his assemblage titled \"Catherine Barometer\" (1920), sold for $3,252,500 at Christie's in New York.\nLegacy.\n\"Self-Portrait\" was republished in 1999.\nIn March 2013, Man Ray's photograph \"Noire et Blanche\" (1926) was featured in the US Postal Service's \"Modern Art in America\" series of stamps.\nIrish actor Frank Bourke is set to play Man Ray in the 2025 television series \"This Is Not A Murder Mystery\".\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

'the fish of M\u0101ui', historically New Ulster) is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the larger but less populous South Island by Cook Strait. With an area of , it is the world's 14th-largest island, constituting 43% of New Zealand's land area. It has a population of 4,067,400 (June 2025), which is % of New Zealand's residents, making it the most populous island in Polynesia and the 28th-most-populous island in the world.\nTwelve main urban areas are in the North Island. From north to south, they are Whang\u0101rei, Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Rotorua, Gisborne, New Plymouth, Napier, Hastings, Whanganui, Palmerston North, and New Zealand's capital city Wellington, which is located at the south-west tip of the island.\nNaming and usage.\nThe island has been known in English as the North Island for many years. The official M\u0101ori name for it, (\"the fish of M\u0101ui\"), also has official recognition but it remains seldom used by most residents. Other M\u0101ori names include \"Te Ahi no M\u0101ui\" (\"the fire of M\u0101ui\", as first recorded by Captain James Cook in 1770) and \"Aotearoa\" (\"land of the long white cloud\"), which is more frequently applied to New Zealand as a whole. On some 19th-century maps, the North Island was named New Ulster (named after Ulster province in northern Ireland), which was also a province of New Zealand that included the North Island.\nIn 2009 the New Zealand Geographic Board found that, along with the South Island, the North Island had no official name. After a public consultation, the board officially named it \"North Island or Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui\" in October 2013. The official M\u0101ori name was chosen on the basis that it was \"most common and consistent usage in oral tradition by M\u0101ori living on the island\".\nIn prose, the two main islands of New Zealand are called \"the North Island\" and \"the South Island\", including the definite article \"the.\" It is also normal to use the preposition \"in\" rather than \"on\", for example \"Hamilton is in the North Island\", \"my mother lives in the North Island\". Maps, headings, tables, and adjectival expressions use \"North Island\" without \"the\".\nM\u0101ori mythology.\nAccording to M\u0101ori mythology, the North and South Islands of New Zealand arose through the actions of the demigod M\u0101ui. M\u0101ui and his brothers were fishing from their canoe (the South Island) when he caught a great fish and pulled it right up from the sea. While he was not looking, his brothers fought over the fish and chopped it up. This great fish became the North Island, and thus a M\u0101ori name for the North Island is Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui (\"The Fish of M\u0101ui\"). The mountains and valleys are believed to have been formed as a result of M\u0101ui's brothers' hacking at the fish.\nDuring Captain James Cook's voyage between 1769 and 1770, Tahitian navigator Tupaia accompanied the circumnavigation of New Zealand. The maps described the North Island as \"Ea Heinom Auwe\" and \"Aeheinomowe\", which recognises the \"Fish of M\u0101ui\" element. Names of certain tribes like Mua\u016bpoko (\"mua upoko\" \"front of the head\") and Muriwhenua (\"muri whenua\", \"backland\") also reflect the locations of their settlement in this \"fish\" as well as levels of seniority between tribes.\nAnother M\u0101ori name that was given to the North Island, but is now used less commonly, is Aotearoa. Use of Aotearoa to describe the North Island fell out of favour in the early 20th century, and it is now a collective M\u0101ori name for New Zealand as a whole.\nGeography.\nDuring the Last Glacial Period when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, the North and South islands were connected by a vast coastal plain which formed at the South Taranaki Bight. During this period, most of the North Island was covered in thorn scrubland and forest, while the modern-day Northland Peninsula was a subtropical rainforest. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, eventually separating the islands and linking the Cook Strait to the Tasman Sea.\nDemographics.\nThe North Island has an estimated population of 4,067,400 as of June 2025.\nThe North Island had a population of 3,808,005 at the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 213,453 people (5.9%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 570,957 people (17.6%) since the 2013 census. Of the total population, 733,893 people (19.3%) were aged under 15 years, 743,154 (19.5%) were 15 to 29, 1,721,427 (45.2%) were 30 to 64, and 609,534 (16.0%) were 65 or older.\nEver since the conclusion of the Otago gold rush in the 1860s, New Zealand's European population growth has experienced a steady 'Northern drift' as population centres in the North Island have grown faster than those of New Zealand's South Island. This population trend has continued into the twenty-first century, but at a much slower rate. While the North Island's population continues to grow faster than the South Island, this is solely due to the North Island having higher natural increase (i.e. births minus deaths) and international migration; since the late 1980s, the internal migration flow has been from the North Island to the South Island. In the year to June 2020, the North Island gained 21,950 people from natural increase and 62,710 people from international migration, while losing 3,570 people from internal migration.\nCulture and identity.\nAt the 2023 census, 63.1% of North Islanders identified as European (P\u0101keh\u0101), 19.8% as M\u0101ori, 10.6% as Pacific peoples, 19.3% as Asian, 1.9% as Middle Eastern/Latin American/African, and 1.1% as other ethnicities. Percentages add to more than 100% as people can identify with more than one ethnicity.\nM\u0101ori form the majority in three districts of the North Island: Kawerau (63.2%), \u014cp\u014dtiki (66.2%) and Wairoa (68.5%). Europeans formed the plurality in the Auckland region (49.8%) and are the majority in the remaining 39 districts.\nThe proportion of North Islanders born overseas at the 2018 census were 29.3%. The most common foreign countries of birth were England (15.4% of overseas-born residents), Mainland China (11.3%), India (10.1%), South Africa (5.9%), Australia (5.5%) and Samoa (5.3%).\nCities and towns.\nThe North Island has a larger population than the South Island, with the country's largest city, Auckland, and the capital, Wellington, accounting for nearly half of it. The Golden Triangle enclosed by Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga contains nearly half New Zealand's population and a similar proportion of its economic activity.\nThere are 30 urban areas in the North Island with a population of 10,000 or more:\nEconomy.\nThe sub-national GDP of the North Island was estimated at NZ$ 282.355\u00a0billion in 2021 (78% of New Zealand's national GDP).\nGovernance.\nRegions.\nNine local government regions cover the North Island and its adjacent islands and territorial waters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It asks how to place two circles formula_1 and formula_2 of given radii in such a way that the lens formed by intersecting their two interiors has equal area to the symmetric difference of formula_1 and formula_2 (the area contained in any one but not both circles). It was named for an analogy between geometry and social dynamics enunciated by fictional character Mrs. Miniver, who \"saw every relationship as a pair of intersecting circles\". Its solution involves a transcendental equation.\nOrigin.\nThe problem derives from \"A Country House Visit\", one of Jan Struther's newspaper articles appearing in the \"Times of London\" between 1937 and 1939 featuring her character Mrs. Miniver. According to the story:\nShe saw every relationship as a pair of intersecting circles. It would seem at first glance that the more they overlapped the better the relationship; but this is not so. Beyond a certain point the law of diminishing returns sets in, and there are not enough private resources left on either side to enrich the life that is shared. Probably perfection is reached when the area of the two outer crescents, added together, is exactly equal to that of the leaf-shaped piece in the middle. On paper there must be some neat mathematical formula for arriving at this; in life, none.\nLouis A. Graham and Clifton Fadiman formalized the mathematics of the problem and popularized it among recreational mathematicians.\nSolution.\nThe problem can be solved by cutting the lune along the line segment between the two crossing points of the circles, into two circular segments, and using the formula for the area of a circular segment to relate the distance between the crossing points to the total area that the problem requires the lune to have. This gives a transcendental equation for the distance between crossing points but it can be solved numerically. There are two boundary conditions whose distances between centers can be readily solved: the farthest apart the centers can be is when the circles have equal radii, and the closest they can be is when one circle is contained completely within the other, which happens when the ratio between radii is formula_5. If the ratio of radii falls beyond these limiting cases, the circles cannot satisfy the problem's area constraint.\nIn the case of two circles of equal size, these equations can be simplified somewhat. The rhombus formed by the two circle centers and the two crossing points, with side lengths equal to the radius, has an angle formula_6 radians at the circle centers, found by solving the equation formula_7 from which it follows that the ratio of the distance between their centers to their radius is formula_8.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62049", "revid": "28564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62049", "title": "South Island", "text": "One of the two main New Zealand islands\nThe South Island ( , lit. 'the waters of Greenstone') is the larger of the two main islands of New Zealand by surface area, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, to the south by the Foveaux Strait and Southern Ocean, and to the east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers , making it the world's 12th-largest island, constituting 56% of New Zealand's land area. At low altitudes, it has an oceanic climate. The most populous cities are Christchurch, Dunedin, Nelson and Invercargill.\nPrior to European settlement, Te Waipounamu was sparsely populated by three major iwi \u2013 K\u0101i Tahu, K\u0101ti M\u0101moe, and the historical Waitaha \u2013 with major settlements including in Kaiapoi P\u0101 near modern-day Christchurch. During the Musket Wars expanding iwi colonised Te Tau Ihu, a region comprising parts of modern-day Tasman, Nelson and Marlborough, including Ng\u0101ti Kuia, Rangit\u0101ne, Ng\u0101ti Tama, and later Ng\u0101ti Toarangatira after Te Rauparaha's wars of conquest. British settlement began with expansive and cheap land purchases early on, and settlers quickly outnumbered M\u0101ori. As a result the Wairau Affray was the only conflict of the New Zealand Wars to occur in the South Island. The island became rich and prosperous and Dunedin boomed during the 1860s Otago gold rush, which was shaped by extensive Chinese immigration. After the gold rush the \"drift to the north\" meant the North Island displaced the South as the most populous.\nThe South Island is shaped by the Southern Alps, which run along the island from north to south. They include New Zealand's highest peak, Aoraki / Mount Cook, at . The high Kaik\u014dura Ranges lie to the northeast. The east side of the island is home to the Canterbury Plains, while the West Coast is renowned for its rough coastlines, such as Fiordland, a very high proportion of native bush and national parks, and the Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers.\nWith a population of 1,256,700 as of June 2025, the South Island is home to % of New Zealand's million inhabitants. After the 1860s gold rushes in the early stages of European settlement of the country, the South Island had the majority of the European population and wealth. The North Island's population overtook the South Island's in the early 20th century, with 56% of the New Zealand population living in the North Island in 1911. The drift north of people and businesses continued throughout the twentieth century.\nNaming and usage.\nThe island has been known in English as the 'South Island' for many years. The M\u0101ori language name for it, \", now also has official recognition. The name is most often translated to mean 'the water(s) of pounamu', but possibly evolved from \" ('the place of pounamu'). It was first recorded in English by Captain James Cook on his voyage to New Zealand in 1769. North Island iwi alternatively used the name \" ('the canoe of M\u0101ui') for the South Island.\nIn the 19th century, some maps identified the South Island as 'Middle Island' or 'New Munster' (named after Munster province in Southern Ireland), with the name 'South Island' or 'New Leinster' used for today's Stewart Island. In 1907, the Minister for Lands instructed the Land and Survey Department that the name 'Middle Island' was no longer to be used. \"South Island will be adhered to in all cases\".\nAlthough the island had been known as the 'South Island' for many years, in 2009 the New Zealand Geographic Board found that the South Island, along with the North Island, had no official name. After a public consultation, the board officially named the island 'South Island or Te Waipounamu' in October 2013.\nIn prose, the two main islands of New Zealand are called 'the North Island' and 'the South Island', with the definite article. It is also normal to use the preposition 'in' rather than 'on', for example \"Christchurch is in the South Island\", \"my mother lives in the South Island\". Maps, headings, tables, and adjectival expressions use 'South Island' without 'the'.\nAs it is 32% larger than the North Island but contains less than a quarter of the country's population, the South Island is sometimes humorously nicknamed the \"mainland\" of New Zealand by its residents.\nM\u0101ori mythology.\nThe island is also known as \"Te Waka a M\u0101ui\" which means \"M\u0101ui's Canoe\". In some modern alliterations of M\u0101ori legends, the South Island existed first, as the boat of M\u0101ui, while the North Island was the fish that he caught.\nVarious M\u0101ori iwi sometimes use different names, with some preferring to call the South Island \"Te Waka o Aoraki\", referring to another M\u0101ori legend called the story of Aoraki, as after the world was created, Aoraki and his three brothers came down in a waka to visit their mother, Papat\u016b\u0101nuku the earth mother, only to crash after failing to perform a karakia on their way back home to their father, Ranginui (also known as Raki) the sky father, in turn causing the waka to transform into an island and the four brothers into the mountain ranges on top of it.\nGovernment and politics.\nThe South Island has no separately represented country subdivision, but is guaranteed 16 of the electorates in the New Zealand House of Representatives. A two-tier structure constituted under the Local Government Act 2002 gives the South Island (and its adjacent islands) seven regional councils for the administration of regional environmental and transport matters and 25 territorial authorities that administer roads, sewerage, building consents, and other local matters. Four of the territorial councils (one city and three districts) also perform the functions of a regional council and are known as unitary authorities under the New Zealand government.\nWhen New Zealand was separated from the colony of New South Wales in 1841 and established as a Crown colony in its own right, the Royal Charter effecting this provided that \"the principal Islands, heretofore known as, or commonly called, the 'Northern Island', the Middle Island', and 'Stewart's Island', shall henceforward be designated and known respectively as 'New Ulster', 'New Munster', and 'New Leinster'\".\nThese divisions were of geographical significance only, not used as a basis for the government of the colony, which was centralised in Auckland. New Munster consisted of the South Island. The name New Munster was given by the Governor of New Zealand, Captain William Hobson, in honour of Munster, the Irish province in which he was born.\nThe situation was altered in 1846 when the New Zealand Constitution Act 1846 divided the colony into two provinces: New Ulster Province (the North Island north of the mouth of the Patea River), and New Munster Province (and the southern portion of the North Island, up to the mouth of the Patea River, the South Island, and Stewart Island). Each province had a Governor and Legislative and Executive Council, in addition to the Governor-in-Chief and Legislative and Executive Council for the whole colony. The 1846 Constitution Act was later suspended, and only the provincial government provisions were implemented. Early in 1848 Edward John Eyre was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of New Munster.\nThe Provincial Council of New Munster had only one legislative session, in 1849, before it succumbed to the virulent attacks of settlers from Wellington. Governor Sir George Grey, sensible to the pressures, inspired an ordinance of the General Legislative Council under which new Legislative Councils would be established in each province with two-thirds of their members elected on a generous franchise. Grey implemented the ordinance with such deliberation that neither Council met before advice was received that the United Kingdom Parliament had passed the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852.\nThis act dissolved these provinces in 1853, after only seven years' existence, and New Munster was divided into the provinces of Wellington Province, Canterbury, Nelson, and Otago. Each province had its own legislature known as a Provincial Council that elected its own Speaker and Superintendent.\nSecession movements have surfaced several times in the South Island. A Premier of New Zealand, Sir Julius Vogel, was amongst the first people to make this call, which was voted on by the New Zealand Parliament as early as 1865. The desire for the South Island to form a separate colony was one of the main factors in moving the capital of New Zealand from Auckland to Wellington that year.\nSeveral South Island nationalist groups emerged at the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st. The South Island Party fielded candidates in the 1999 general election but cancelled its registration in 2002. Several internet-based groups advocate their support for greater self-determination.\nOn 13 October 2010, South Island Mayors led by Bob Parker of Christchurch displayed united support for a Southern Mayoral Council. Supported by Waitaki Mayor Alex Familton and Invercargill Mayor Tim Shadbolt, Bob Parker said that increased cooperation and the forming of a new South Island-wide mayoral forum were essential to representing the island's interests in Wellington and countering the new Auckland Council.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThere are 23 territorial authorities within the South Island: 4 city councils and 19 district councils. Three territorial authorities (Nelson City Council, and the Tasman and Marlborough District Councils) also perform the functions of a regional council and thus are known as unitary authorities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPolitical parties.\nThis is a list of political parties, past and present, who have their headquarters in the South Island.\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCompared to the more populated and multi-ethnic North Island, the South Island has a smaller, more homogeneous resident population of 1,256,700 (June 2025).\nThe South Island had a population of 1,185,282 at the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 80,745 people (7.3%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 180,882 people (18.0%) since the 2013 census. Of the total population, 202,311 people (17.1%) were aged under 15 years, 225,048 (19.0%) were 15 to 29, 538,965 (45.5%) were 30 to 64, and 218,958 (18.5%) were 65 or older.\nAt the 2018 New Zealand census, there were 571,656 males and 577,914 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female.\nIn the early years of European settlement in New Zealand, the South Island's overall percentage of the New Zealand population was far higher, equalling or even exceeding the population of the North Island. This was exacerbated by the New Zealand Wars and the Otago gold rush of the 1860s. Since that time, the South Island's population as a percentage of the country's total population has steadily decreased, with the population of the South island now being less than that of the North Island's largest city, Auckland. This growing disparity has stabilised in recent years, with both the 2013 and 2018 censuses showing the South Island to have a very similar percentage of the national population (around 23%\u201324%).\nIn June 2025, Statistics New Zealand released new figures from the 2023 Census showing that 86,000 people moved from the North Island to the South Island between 2018 and 2023. During that same period, 30,000 people migrated from the South Island to the North Island.\nCulture and identity.\nAt the 2023 census, 82.8% of South Islanders identified as European (P\u0101keh\u0101), 11.3% as M\u0101ori, 3.4% as Pacific peoples, 10.5% as Asian, 1.6% as Middle Eastern/Latin American/African, 1.4% as other ethnicities. Percentages add to more than 100% as people can identify with more than one ethnicity.\nEuropeans form the majority in all districts of the South Island, ranging from 75.9% in Christchurch City to 92.1% in the Waimakariri district.\nThe proportion of South Islanders born overseas at the 2018 census was 21.4%. The most common foreign countries of birth are England (22.0% of overseas-born residents), Australia (8.8%), the Philippines (7.9%), Mainland China (6.5%) and India (5.4%).\nAround 48.6 percent of South Islanders affiliate with Christianity and 3.1 percent affiliate with non-Christian religions, while 45.8 percent are irreligious. Anglicanism is the largest Christian denomination in the South Island with 12.7 percent affiliating, closely followed by Catholicism at 12.1 percent and Presbyterianism at 11.7 percent. These figures are somewhat skewed between the regions of the south, due largely to the original settlement of southern cities (Dunedin, for example, was founded by Scottish Presbyterians, whereas Christchurch was founded by English Anglicans).\nUrbanisation.\nThe South Island is sparsely populated and still predominantly rural areas or nature reserves. However, there are 15 urban areas in the South Island with a population of 10,000 or more:\nEconomy.\nThe South Island economy is strongly focused on tourism and primary industries like agriculture. The other main industry groups are manufacturing, mining, construction, energy supply, education, health and community services.\nThe subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of the South Island was estimated at NZ$78.94 billion in the year to March 2022, 21.9% of New Zealand's national GDP. The subnational GDP per capita was estimated at $65,875 in the same period.\nEnergy.\nThe South Island is a major centre for electricity generation, especially in the southern half of the island, and especially from hydroelectricity. In 2010, the island generated of electricity, 41.5% of New Zealand's total electricity generation. Nearly all (98.7%) of the island's electricity is generated by hydroelectricity, primarily from the Waitaki, Clutha, and Manapouri schemes, with most of the remainder coming from wind generation. While the majority of electricity is consumed within the island, a significant percentage is exported to the North Island via the HVDC Inter-Island link.\nOffshore oil and gas is likely to become an increasingly important part of the South Island economy into the future. Origin Energy has formed a joint venture with Anadarko Petroleum, the second-largest independent U.S. natural gas producer, to begin drilling for oil in the Canterbury Basin off the coast of Dunedin. The 390\u00a0km2, Carrack/Caravel prospect has the potential to deliver more than the equivalent of of oil and gas. Market analyst, Greg Easton from Craigs Investment Partners commented that such a substantial find it could well turn Dunedin from the Edinburgh of the south to the Aberdeen of the south.\nThe Great South Basin off the coast of Otago and Southland at over (covering an area 1.5 times New Zealand's landmass) is one of New Zealand's largest undeveloped offshore petroleum basins with prospects for both oil and gas. In July 2007, the New Zealand Government awarded oil and gas exploration permits for four areas of the Great South Basin, situated in the volatile waters off the Southern Coast of New Zealand. The three successful permit holders are:\nStock exchanges.\nDue to the gold rushes of the 1860s, the South Island had regional stock exchanges in Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill \u2013 all of which were affiliated to the Stock Exchange Association of New Zealand. However, in 1974 these regional exchanges were amalgamated to form one national stock exchange, the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE). Separate trading floors operated in both Christchurch and Dunedin until the late 1980s. On 30 May 2003, New Zealand Stock Exchange Limited formally changed its name to New Zealand Exchange Limited, trading as NZX.\nToday, the Deloitte South Island Index is compiled quarterly from publicly available information provided by NZX, Unlisted and Bloomberg. It is a summary of the movements in market capitalisation of each South Island-based listed company. A company is included in the Index where either its registered office and/or a substantial portion of its operations are focused on the South Island.\nTrade unions.\nThere are several South Island-based trade union organisations. They are:\nTourism.\nTourism is a huge earner for the South Island. Popular tourist activities include sightseeing, adventure tourism, such as glacier climbing and Bungee jumping, tramping (hiking), kayaking, and camping. Numerous walking and hiking paths, including six of the New Zealand Great Walks, are located in the South Island and are renowned internationally.\nAn increase in direct international flights to Christchurch, Dunedin and Queenstown has boosted the number of overseas tourists.\nFiordland National Park, Abel Tasman National Park, Westland Tai Poutini National Park, Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park, Queenstown, Kaik\u014dura, and the Marlborough Sounds are regarded as the main tourism destinations in the South Island and amongst the Top 10 destinations in New Zealand.\nSki areas and resorts.\nThis is a list of ski areas and resorts in the South Island.\nTransport.\nRoad transport.\nThe South Island has a State Highway network of .\nRail transport.\nThe South Island's railway network has two main lines, two secondary lines, and a few branch lines. The Main North Line from Picton to Christchurch and the Main South Line from Lyttelton to Invercargill via Dunedin together constitute the South Island Main Trunk Railway. The secondary Midland Line branches from the Main South Line in Rolleston and passes through the Southern Alps via the Otira Tunnel to the West Coast and its terminus in Greymouth. In Stillwater, it meets the other secondary route, the Stillwater - Westport Line, which now includes the Ngakawau Branch.\nA number of other secondary routes are now closed, including the Otago Central Railway, the isolated Nelson Section, and the interdependent Waimea Plains Railway and Kingston Branch. An expansive network of branch lines once existed, especially in Canterbury, Otago, and Southland, but these are now almost completely closed. The branch lines that remain in operation serve ports (Bluff Branch and Port Chalmers Branch), coal mines (Ohai Branch and Rapahoe Branch), and a dairy factory (Hokitika Branch). The first 64\u00a0km of the Otago Central Railway remain in operation for tourist trains run by Dunedin Railways (formerly Taieri Gorge Railway). The most significant freight is coal from West Coast mines to the port of Lyttelton for export.\nPassenger services were once extensive. Commuter trains operated multiple routes around Christchurch and Dunedin, plus a service between Invercargill and Bluff. Due to substantial losses, these were cancelled between the late 1960s and early 1980s. The final services to operate ran between Dunedin's City Centre and the suburb of Mosgiel, and they ceased in 1982. Regional passenger trains were once extensive, but are now limited to the Coastal Pacific from Christchurch to Picton and the TranzAlpine from Christchurch to Greymouth.\nThe Southerner between Christchurch and Invercargill, once the flagship of the network, was cancelled on 10 February 2002. Subsequently, the architecturally significant Dunedin Railway Station has been used solely by the TGR's tourist trains, the Taieri Gorge Limited along the Otago Central Railway and the Seasider to Palmerston. Rural passenger services on branch lines were provided by mixed trains and Vulcan/88 seater railcars but the mixeds had largely ceased to exist by the 1950s and the railcars were withdrawn in the mid-1970s.\nThe South Island saw the final use of steam locomotives in New Zealand. Locomotives belonging to classes long withdrawn elsewhere continued to operate on West Coast branches until the very late 1960s, when they were displaced by DJ class diesels. In comparison to most countries, where steam locomotives were last used on insubstantial rural and industrial operations, the last services run by steam locomotives were the premier expresses between Christchurch and Invercargill: the South Island Limited until 1970 and the Friday and Sunday night services until 1971. This was due to the carriages being steam-heated. The final steam-hauled service in New Zealand, headed by a member of the JA class, ran on 26 October 1971.\nWater transport.\nThe South Island is separated from the North Island by Cook Strait, which is wide at its narrowest point, and requires a ferry trip to cross.\nDunedin was the headquarters of the Union Steam Ship Company, once the largest shipping company in the Southern Hemisphere.\nGeography.\nThe South Island, with an area of , is the largest landmass of New Zealand; it contains about one-quarter of the New Zealand population and is the world's 12th-largest island. It is divided along its length by the Southern Alps, the highest peak of which is Aoraki / Mount Cook at , making it 9th-highest island, with the high Kaik\u014dura Ranges to the northeast. There are eighteen peaks of more than in the South Island. The east side of the island is home to the Canterbury Plains while the West Coast is renowned for its rough coastlines such as Fiordland, a very high proportion of native bush, and Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers.\nThe dramatic landscape of the South Island has made it a popular location for the production of several films, including \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and \"\". It lies at similar latitudes to Tasmania (an island south of the Australian mainland), and parts of Patagonia in South America.\nGeology.\nOn 4 September 2010, the South Island was struck by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake, which caused extensive damage, several power outages, and many reports of aftershocks. Five and a half months later, 22 February Christchurch earthquake of 6.3 magnitude caused far more additional damage in Christchurch, resulting in 181 deaths. This quake struck at about lunchtime and was centred closer at Lyttelton, and shallower than the prior quake, consequently causing extensive damage.\nClimate.\nThe climate in the South Island is mostly temperate. The mean temperature for the South Island is . January and February are the warmest months, while July is the coldest. Historical maxima and minima are in Rangiora, Canterbury and in Ranfurly, Otago.\nConditions vary sharply across the regions, from extremely wet on the West Coast to semi-arid in the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury. Most areas have between of rainfall with the most rain along the West Coast and the least rain on the East Coast, predominantly on the Canterbury Plains. Christchurch is the driest city, receiving about of rain per year, while Invercargill is the wettest, receiving about . The southern and south-western parts of South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate, with around 1,400\u20131,600 hours of sunshine annually; the northern and north-eastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas and receive about 2,400\u20132,500 hours.\nNatural geographic features.\nFiords.\nThe South Island has 15 named maritime fiords which are all located in the southwest of the island in a mountainous area known as Fiordland. The spelling 'fiord' is used in New Zealand rather than 'fjord', although all the maritime fiords use the word Sound in their name instead.\nA number of lakes in the Fiordland and Otago regions also fill glacial valleys. Lake Te Anau has three western arms, which are fiords (and are named so). Lake McKerrow / Whakatipu Waitai to the north of Milford Sound / Piopiotahi is a fiord with a silted-up mouth. Lake Wakatipu fills a large glacial valley, as do lakes Hakapoua, Poteriteri, Monowai and Hauroko in the far south of Fiordland. Lake Manapouri has fiords as its west, north and south arms.\nThe Marlborough Sounds, a series of deep indentations in the coastline at the northern tip of the South Island, are in fact rias, drowned river valleys.\nGlaciers.\nMost of New Zealand's glaciers are in the South Island. They are generally found in the Southern Alps near the Main Divide.\nAn inventory of South Island glaciers during the 1980s indicated there were about 3,155 glaciers with an area of at least . About a sixth of these glaciers covered more than 10\u00a0hectares. These include the Fox and Franz Josef glaciers on the West Coast, and the Haupapa / Tasman, Hooker, Mueller and Murchison glaciers in the east.\nLakes.\nThere are some 3,820 lakes in New Zealand with a surface area larger than one hectare. Much of the higher country in the South Island was covered by ice during the glacial periods of the last two million years. Advancing glaciers eroded large steep-sided valleys, and often carried piles of moraine (rocks and soil) that acted as natural dams. When the glaciers retreated, they left basins that are now filled by lakes. The level of most glacial lakes in the upper parts of the Waitaki and Clutha / Mata-Au rivers are controlled for electricity generation. Hydroelectric reservoirs are common in South Canterbury and Central Otago, the largest of which is Lake Benmore, on the Waitaki River.\nThe South Island has 8 of New Zealand's 10 biggest lakes. They were formed by glaciers and include Lake Wakatipu, Lake Tekapo and Lake Manapouri. The deepest (462\u00a0m) is Lake Hauroko, in western Southland. It is the 16th deepest lake in the world. Millions of years ago, Central Otago had a huge lake \u2013 Lake Manuherikia. It was slowly filled in with mud, and fossils of fish and crocodiles have been found there.\nVolcanoes.\nThere are four extinct volcanoes in the South Island, all located on the east coast.\nBanks Peninsula forms the most prominent of these volcanic features. Geologically, the peninsula comprises the eroded remnants of two large shield volcanoes (Lyttelton formed first, then Akaroa). These formed due to intraplate volcanism between about eleven and eight million years ago (Miocene) on a continental crust. The peninsula formed as offshore islands, with the volcanoes reaching to about 1,500\u00a0m above sea level. Two dominant craters formed Lyttelton / Whakaraup\u014d and Akaroa Harbours.\nThe Canterbury Plains formed from the erosion of the Southern Alps (an extensive and high mountain range caused by the meeting of the Indo-Australian and Pacific tectonic plates) and from the alluvial fans created by large braided rivers. These plains reach their widest point where they meet the hilly sub-region of Banks Peninsula. A layer of loess, a rather unstable fine silt deposited by the foehn winds which bluster across the plains, covers the northern and western flanks of the peninsula. The portion of the crater rim lying between Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraup\u014d and Christchurch city forms the Port Hills.\nThe Otago Harbour was formed from the drowned remnants of a giant shield volcano, centred close to what is now the town of Port Chalmers. The remains of this violent origin can be seen in the basalt of the surrounding hills. The last eruptive phase ended some ten million years ago, leaving the prominent peak of Mount Cargill.\nTimaru was constructed on rolling hills created from the lava flows of the extinct Mount Horrible, which last erupted many thousands of years ago.\nTe W\u0101hipounamu World Heritage Site.\nTe W\u0101hipounamu (M\u0101ori for \"the place of greenstone\") is a World Heritage Site in the south-west corner of the South Island.\nInscribed on the World Heritage List in 1990, it covers and incorporates the Aoraki / Mount Cook, the Fiordland, the Mount Aspiring and the Westland Tai Poutini National Parks.\nIt is thought to contain some of the best modern representations of the original flora and fauna present in Gondwanaland, one of the reasons for listing as a World Heritage Site.\nProtected areas.\nForest parks.\nThere are six forest parks in the South Island that are on public land administered by the Department of Conservation.\nNational parks.\nThe South Island has ten national parks established under the National Parks Act 1980 and which are administered by the Department of Conservation.\nFrom north to south, the National Parks are:\nOther native reserves and parks\nNatural history.\nDuring the Last Glacial Period when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, the North and South Islands were connected by a vast coastal plain which formed at the South Taranaki Bight. Similarly, the South Island and Stewart Island were connected by coastal plains which covered modern-day Foveaux Strait. During this period, most of the South Island was covered in grassland and glaciers, compared to the woodlands and rainforest which grew in the more temperate North Island. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, eventually separating the islands and linking the Cook Strait to the Tasman Sea.\nBirds.\nThere are several bird species which are endemic to the South Island. They include the kea, great spotted kiwi, Okarito brown kiwi, South Island k\u014dkako, South Island pied oystercatcher, Malherbe's parakeet, king shag, takah\u0113, black-fronted tern, South Island robin, rock wren, wrybill, and yellowhead.\nMany South Island bird species are now extinct, mainly due to hunting by humans and predation by cats and rats introduced by humans. Extinct species include the South Island goose, South Island giant moa, Haast's eagle and South Island piopio.\nTertiary education.\nThe South Island has three universities, and five polytechnic schools. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSince 2020, the polytechnics are branches of the New Zealand Institute of Skills and Technology.\nHealthcare.\nThere are six major hospitals in the South Island: Christchurch Hospital, Dunedin Hospital, Grey Base Hospital (Greymouth), Nelson Hospital, Southland Hospital (Invercargill), and Timaru Hospital. Christchurch Hospital, Dunedin Hospital and Wellington Hospital (in the North Island) are the main tertiary hospitals serving the South Island.\nEmergency medical services.\nThere are several air ambulance and rescue helicopter services operating throughout the South Island.\nCulture.\nArt.\nThe South Island has contributed to the Arts in New Zealand and internationally through highly regarded artists such as Nigel Brown, Frances Hodgkins, Colin McCahon, Shona McFarlane, Peter McIntyre Grahame Sydney and Geoff Williams.\nThe University of Canterbury School of Fine Arts was founded in 1950.\nSouth Island Art Galleries include:\nLanguage.\nParts of the South Island, principally Southland and the very southernmost areas of Otago near the border with Southland, are renowned for its people speaking what is often referred to as the \"Southland burr\", a semi-rhotic, Scottish-influenced dialect of the English language.\nMedia.\nNewspapers.\nThe South Island has ten daily newspapers and many weekly community newspapers. Major daily newspapers include the \"Ashburton Guardian\", the \"Greymouth Star\", \"The Marlborough Express\", \"The Nelson Mail\", the \"Oamaru Mail\", the \"Otago Daily Times\", \"The Press\", the \"Southland Times\", \"The Timaru Herald\", and the \"West Coast Times\". \"The Press\" and the \"Otago Daily Times\", serving mainly Christchurch and Dunedin respectively, are the South Island's major newspapers.\nTelevision.\nThe South Island has a few regional stations (either non-commercial public service or privately owned) that broadcast only in one region or city: 45 South TV, Mainland Television, Shine TV, and Visitor TV. These stations mainly broadcast free to air on UHF frequencies; however, some are carried on subscription TV. Content ranges from local news, access broadcasts, satellite sourced news, tourist information and Christian programming to music videos.\nRadio stations.\nA large number of radio stations serve communities throughout the South Island; these include independent stations, but many are owned by organisations such as Radio New Zealand, New Zealand Media and Entertainment, and MediaWorks New Zealand.\nReligion.\nAnglicanism is strongest in Canterbury (the city of Christchurch having been founded as an Anglican settlement).\nCatholicism still has a noticeably strong presence on the West Coast, and in Kaik\u014dura. The territorial authorities with the highest proportion of Catholics are Kaik\u014dura (where they are 18.4% of the total population), Westland (18.3%), and Grey (17.8%).\nPresbyterianism is strong in the lower South Island \u2013 the city of Dunedin was founded as a Presbyterian settlement, and many of the early settlers in the region were Scottish Presbyterians. The territorial authorities with the highest proportion of Presbyterians are Gore (where they are 30.9% of the total population), Clutha District (30.7%), and Southland (29.8%).\nThe first Muslims in New Zealand were Chinese gold diggers working in the Dunstan gold fields of Otago in the 1860s. Dunedin's Al-Huda mosque is the world's southernmost, and the farthest from Mecca.\nLaw enforcement.\nPolice.\nThe New Zealand Police is the primary law enforcement agency of New Zealand, including the South Island. Three decentralised Police Districts cover the entire South Island, with each being commanded by a Superintendent and having a central station from which subsidiary and suburban stations are managed. The Christchurch Police Communications Centre handles all emergency and general calls within the South Island.\nThe Tasman Police District covers 70,000\u00a0kilometres of territory, encompassing the northern and most of the western portion of the South Island. The West Coast alone spans the distance between Wellington and Auckland. There are 22 police stations in the Tasman District, with 6 being sole-charge \u2013 or one-person \u2013 stations. The Tasman Police District has a total of 302 sworn police officers and 57 civilian or nonsworn staff. Organisationally, the district has its headquarters in Nelson and has three distinct Areas, each headed by an Inspector as its commander. The areas are Nelson Bays, West Coast and Marlborough.\nThe Canterbury Police District is based in Christchurch the largest city in the South Island and covers an area extending from the Conway River, (just south of Kaik\u014dura), to the Waitaki River, south of Timaru.\nThe Southern Police District with its headquarters in Dunedin spans from Oamaru in the North through to Stewart Island in the far South covers the largest geographical area of any of the 12 police districts in New Zealand. The Southern District has three distinct Areas headed by Inspectors; Otago Rural, Southland and Dunedin.\nCorrectional facilities.\nCorrectional facilities in the South Island are operated by the Department of Corrections as part of the South Island Prison Region. Christchurch Prison, also known as Paparua, is located in Templeton a satellite town of Christchurch. It accommodates up to 780 minimum, medium, and high-security male prisoners. It was built in 1925, and also includes a youth unit, a self-care unit and the \"Paparua Remand Centre\" (PRC), built in 1999 to replace the old \"Addington Prison\". Christchurch Women's Prison, also located in Templeton, is a facility for women of all security classifications. It has the only maximum/medium security accommodation for women prisoners in New Zealand. It can accommodate up to 98 prisoners.\nRolleston prison is located in Rolleston, another satellite town of Christchurch. It accommodates around 320 male prisoners of minimum to low-medium security classifications and includes \"Kia Marama\" a sixty-bed unit that provides an intensive 9-month treatment programme for male child sex offenders. Invercargill Prison, in Invercargill, accommodates up to 172 minimum to low-medium security prisoners. Otago Corrections Facility is located near Milton and houses up to 335 minimum to high-medium security male prisoners.\nCustoms service.\nThe New Zealand Customs Service whose role is to provide border control and protect the community from potential risks arising from international trade and travel, as well as collecting duties and taxes on imports to the country, has offices at Christchurch International Airport, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttelton and Nelson.\nSport.\nOf the professional sports teams based in the South Island, the major spectator sports of rugby union and cricket are particularly well represented. The Crusaders and Highlanders represent the upper and lower South Island respectively in rugby union's Super Rugby competition; and Canterbury, Otago, Southland Stags, Tasman Makos all participate in provincial rugby's ITM Cup. At cricket, the South Island is represented by the Canterbury Wizards, Central Stags, and Otago Volts in the Plunket Shield, one day domestic series, and the Super Smash.\nAs well as rugby union and cricket, the South Island also boasts representative teams in the domestic basketball, soccer, ice hockey, netball, and rugby league.\nThe North vs South match, sometimes known as the Interisland match, is a longstanding rugby union fixture in New Zealand. The first game was played in 1897, the most recent one in 2020.\nChristchurch hosted the 1974 Commonwealth Games.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Scholars prefer the terms \"sacred sex\" or \"sacred sexual rites\" in cases where payment for services is not involved.\nThe historicity of literal sacred prostitution, particularly in some places and periods, is a controversial topic within the academic world. Historically mainstream historiography has considered it a probable reality, based on the abundance of ancient sources and chroniclers detailing its practices, although it has proved harder to differentiate between true prostitution and sacred sex without remuneration. Beginning in the late 20th century, a number of scholars have challenged the veracity of sacred prostitution as a concept, suggesting that the claims are based on mistranslations, misunderstandings or outright inventions of ancient authors. Authors have also interpreted evidence as secular prostitution administered in the temple under the patronage of fertility deities, not as an act of religious worship by itself.\nDefinitions.\nSacred prostitution has many different characteristics depending on the region, class and the religious ideals of the period and the place, and consequently can have many different definitions. One definition that was developed was due to the common types of sacred prostitution that are recorded in Classical sources: sale of a woman's virginity or rinni in honor of a goddess or a once-in-a-lifetime prostitution, professional prostitutes or slaves owned by a temple or sanctuary, and temporary prostitution that occurs before a marriage or during certain rituals.\nAncient Near East.\nAncient Near Eastern societies along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers featured many shrines and temples or \"houses of heaven\" dedicated to various deities. The 5th-century BC historian Herodotus's account and some other testimony from the Hellenistic Period and Late Antiquity suggest that ancient societies encouraged the practice of sacred sexual rites not only in Babylonia and Cyprus, but throughout the Near East.\nThe work of gender researchers like Daniel Arnaud, Julia Assante and Stephanie Budin has cast the whole tradition of scholarship that defined the concept of sacred prostitution into doubt. Budin regards the concept of sacred prostitution as a myth, arguing that the practices described in the sources were misunderstandings of either non-remunerated ritual sex or non-sexual religious ceremonies, or possibly even invented as rhetorical devices.\nSumer.\nThrough the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of sacred marriage rite (\"hieros gamos\") was staged between the kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of Sumer and the high priestesses of Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, later called Ishtar. The king would have sex with the priestess to represent the union of Dumuzid with Inanna. According to the noted Assyriologist Samuel Noah Kramer, the kings would further establish their legitimacy by taking part in a ritual sexual act in the temple of the fertility goddess Ishtar every year on the tenth day of the New Year festival Akitu.\nHowever, no certain evidence has survived to prove that sexual intercourse was included, despite many popular descriptions of the habit. It is possible that these unions never occurred but were embellishments to the image of the king; hymns which praise Ancient Near Eastern kings for coupling with the goddess Ishtar often speak of them as running , offering sacrifices, feasting with the sun-god Utu, and receiving a royal crown from An, all in a single day. Some modern historians argue in the same direction, though their posture has been disputed.\nBabylonia.\nAccording to Herodotus, the rites performed at these temples included sexual intercourse, or what scholars later called sacred sexual rites:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The foulest Babylonian custom is that which compels every woman of the land to sit in the temple of Aphrodite (Ishtar) and have intercourse with some stranger at least once in her life. Many women who are rich and proud and disdain to mingle with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages drawn by teams, and stand there with a great retinue of attendants. But most sit down in the sacred plot of Aphrodite, with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the men pass and make their choice. Once a woman has taken her place there, she does not go away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap, and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, \"I invite you in the name of Mylitta\". It does not matter what sum the money is; the woman will never refuse, for that would be a sin, the money being by this act made sacred. So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects no one. After their intercourse, having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess, she goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her. So then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfil the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four. There is a custom like this in some parts of Cyprus.\nThe British anthropologist James Frazer accumulated citations to prove this in a chapter of his magnum opus \"The Golden Bough\" (1890\u20131915), and this has served as a starting point for several generations of scholars. Frazer and Henriques distinguished two major forms of sacred sexual rites: temporary rite of unwed girls (with variants such as dowry-sexual rite, or as public defloration of a bride), and lifelong sexual rite. However, Frazer took his sources mostly from authors of Late Antiquity (i.e. 150\u2013500 AD), not from the Classical or Hellenistic periods. This raises questions as to whether the phenomenon of temple sexual rites can be generalised to the whole of the ancient world, as earlier scholars typically did.\nIn Hammurabi's code of laws, the rights and good name of female sacred sexual priestesses were protected. The same legislation that protected married women from slander applied to them and their children. They could inherit property from their fathers, collect income from land worked by their brothers, and dispose of property. These rights have been described as extraordinary, taking into account the role of women at the time.\nTerms associated with temple prostitution in Sumer and Babylonia.\nAll translations are sourced from the Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary. Akkadian terms were used in the Akkadian Empire, Assyria, and Babylonia. The terms themselves come from lexical profession lists on tablets dating back to the Early Dynastic period.\nNotes on the cuneiform: by convention Akkadian is italicised, spoken Sumerian is lowercase and cuneiform sign transliteration is uppercase. In addition, a determinative sign is written as a superscript. Determinatives are only written and never spoken. In spoken Sumerian homophones are distinguished by a numerical subscript.\nHittites.\nThe Hittites practiced sacred prostitution as part of a cult of deities, including the worship of a mated pair of deities, a bull god and a lion goddess, while in later days it was the mother-goddess who became prominent, representing fertility, and (in Phoenicia) the goddess who presided over human birth.\nPhoenicia.\nIt has been argued that sacred prostitution, worked by both males and females, was a custom of ancient Phoenicians. It would be dedicated to the deities Astarte and Adonis, and sometimes performed as a festival or social rite in the cities of Byblos, Afqa and Baalbek (later named Heliopolis) as well as the nearby Syrian city of Palmyra.\nAt the Etruscan site of Pyrgi, a center of worship of the eastern goddess Astarte, archaeologists identified a temple consecrated to her and built with at least 17 small rooms that may have served as quarters for temple prostitutes. Similarly, a temple dedicated to her equated goddess Atargatis in Dura-Europos, was found with nearly a dozen small rooms with low benches, which might have used either for sacred meals or sacred services of women jailed in the temple for adultery. Pyrgi's sacred prostitutes were famous enough to be apparently mentioned in a lost fragment of Lucilius's works.\nIn northern Africa, the area of influence of the Phoenician colony of Carthage, this service was associated to the city of Sicca, a nearby city that received the name of \"Sicca Veneria\" for its temple of Astarte or Tanit (called Venus by Roman authors). Valerius Maximus describes how their women gained gifts by engaging in prostitution with visitors.\nPhoenicio-Punic settlements in Hispania, like Cancho Roano, Gadir, Castulo and La Qu\u00e9jola, have suggested this practice through their archaeology and iconography. In particular, Cancho Roano features a sanctuary built with multiple cells or rooms, which has been identified as a possible place of sacred prostitution in honor to Astarte. A similar institution might have been found in Gadir. Its posterior, renowned erotic dancers called \"puellae gaditanae\" in Roman sources (or \"cinaedi\" in the case of male dancers) might have been desecrated heirs of this practice, considering the role occupied by sex and dance on Phoenician culture.\nAnother center of cult to Astarte was Cyprus, whose main temples were located in Paphos, Amathus and Kition. The epigraphy of the Kition temple describes personal economic activity on the temple, as sacred prostitution would have been taxed as any other occupation, and names possible practitioners as \"grm\" (male) and \"lmt\" (female).\nAncient Israel.\nThe Hebrew Bible uses two different words for prostitute, \"zonah\" () and \"qedesha\" ( \"q\u0259\u1e0f\u0113\u0161\u0101\"). \"Zonah\" meant an ordinary prostitute or \"loose woman'\". \"Qedeshah\" literally means \"set apart\" (in feminine form), from the triliteral \"Q-D-\u0160\", meaning \"holy, consecrated, set apart\". \"Zonah\" and \"qedeshah\" are not interchangeable terms: the former occurs 93 times in the Bible, whereas the latter is only used in five places, conveying different connotations.\nThis double meaning has led to the belief that qedeshot (the plural of qedesha) were not ordinary prostitutes, but sacred ones who worked out of fertility temples. However, the lack of solid evidence has indicated that the word might refer to prostitutes who offered their services in the vicinity of temples, where they could attract a larger number of clients. The term might have originated as consecrated maidens employed in Canaanite and Phoenician temples, which became synonymous with harlotry for Biblical writers.\nIn any case, the translation of sacred prostitute has continued, however, because it explains how the word can mean such disparate concepts as \"sacred\" and \"prostitute\". As put by DeGrado, \"neither the interpretation of the as a 'priestess-not-prostitute' (according to Westenholz) nor as a 'prostitute-not-priestess' (according to Gruber) adequately represents the semantic range of Hebrew word in biblical and post-biblical Hebrew.\"\nMale prostitutes were called \"qadesh\". The Hebrew word \"kelev\" \"dog\" may also signify a male dancer or prostitute.\nThe Mosaic Law as outlined in the Book of Deuteronomy was not universally observed in Israelite culture under the Davidic line in the United Kingdom of Israel, as recorded in the Books of Kings. According to 2 Kings 22, the Kingdom of Judah had lost \"the Book of the Law\". During the reign of King Josiah, Hilkiah, the High Priest of Israel, discovered it in \"the House of the Lord\" and realized that the people have disobeyed, particularly regarding prostitution.\nAncient Greece and Hellenistic world.\nAncient Greece.\nThe Greek term \"hierodoulos\" or \"hierodule\" has sometimes been taken to mean \"sacred holy woman\", but it is more likely to refer to a former slave freed from slavery in order to be dedicated to a god.\nThere were different levels of prostitutes within Ancient Greek society, but two categories are specifically related to sacred or temple prostitution. The first category are \"hetaires\", also known as courtesans, typically more educated women that served within temples. The second category are known as \"hierodoules\", slave women or female priests who worked within temples and served the sexual requests of visitors to the temple.\nWhile there may not be a direct connection between temples and prostitution, many prostitutes and courtesans worshipped Aphrodite, the goddess of love. Prostitutes would use their earnings to pay for dedications and ritualistic celebrations in honour of Aphrodite. Some prostitutes also viewed the action of sexual service and sexual pleasure as an act of devotion to the goddess of love, worshipping Aphrodite through an act rather than a physical dedication.\nIn the temple of Apollo at Bulla Regia, a woman was found buried with an inscription reading: \"Adulteress. Prostitute. Seize [me], because I fled from Bulla Regia.\" It has been speculated she might have been a woman forced into sacred prostitution as a punishment for adultery.\nTemple(s) of Aphrodite.\nThe act of sacred prostitution within the Temples of Aphrodite in the city of Corinth was well-known and well-spread. Greek writer-philosopher Strabo comments, \"the Temple of Aphrodite was so rich that it owned a thousand temple-slaves, courtesans, whom both men and women had dedicated to the goddess\". Within the same work, Strabo compares Corinth to the city of Comana, confirming the belief that temple prostitution was a notable characteristic of Corinth.\nProstitutes performed sacred functions within the temple of Aphrodite. They would often burn incense in honor of Aphrodite. Chameleon of Heracleia recorded in his book, \"On Pindar\", that whenever the city of Corinth prayed to Aphrodite in manners of great importance, many prostitutes were invited to participate in the prayers and petitions.\nThe girls involved in temple prostitution were typically slaves owned by the temple. However, some of the girls were gifts to the temple from other members of society in return for success in particular endeavors. One example that shows the gifting of girls to the temple is the poem of Athenaeus, which explores the athlete Xenophon\u2019s actions of gifting a group of courtesans to Aphrodite as a thanks-offering for his victory in a competition.\nSpecifically in 464 BC, Xenophon was victorious in the Olympic Games and donated 100 slaves to Aphrodite\u2019s temple. Pindar, a famous Greek poet, was commissioned to write a poem that was to be performed at Xenophon\u2019s victory celebration in Corinth. The poet acknowledged that the slaves would serve Aphrodite as sacred prostitutes within her temple at Corinth.\nAnother temple of Aphrodite was named Aphrodite Melainis, located near the city gates in an area known as \u201cCraneion\u201d. It is the resting place of Lais, who was a famous prostitute in Greek history. This suggests that there was a connection with ritual prostitution within temples of Aphrodite.\nThere is a report that was found of an epigram of Simonides commemorating the prayer of the prostitutes of Corinth on behalf of the salvation of the Greeks from the invading Achaemenid Empire in the Greco-Persian Wars of the early fifth century BCE. Both temple prostitutes and priestesses prayed to Aphrodite for help, and were honoured for their potent prayers, which Greek citizens believed contributed to the repelling of the Persians.\nAthenaeus also alludes to the idea that many of Aphrodite\u2019s temples and sanctuaries were occupied by temple prostitutes. These prostitutes were known to practise sexual rituals in different cities which included Corinth, Magnesia, and Samos.\nSigns of sacred prostitution within Minoan Crete.\nSome evidence of sacred prostitution was evident in Minoan Crete. The building in question is known as the \"East Building\", but was also referred to as \"the House of the Ladies\" by the excavator of the building. Some believe that the architecture of this building seemed to reflect the grooming needs of women, but could also have been a brothel for high status individuals.\nThe structure of the interior of the building seemed to suggest that the building was used for prostitution. Large clay vats typically used for bathing were found within the building, along with successive doors within the corridors. The successive doors suggested privacy, and within the time period, was associated with two functions: storage of valuable goods and protection of the private moments of its residents. Because the ground floors were found practically empty, the possibility that the building was used for prostitution increases.\nThere were also religious embellishments found within the \"East Building\", such as vases and other vessels that seemed to be connected to religious rituals. The vessels were covered in motifs related to sacrilegious rituals, such as the sacral knot and the image of birds flying freely. The functions of the vessels would have been offering food or liquid in relation to the rituals. Combining these two factors, it is a possibility that sacred prostitution existed within this building.\nHellenistic world.\nIn the Greek-influenced and colonised world, \"sacred prostitution\" was known in Cyprus (Greek-settled since 1100 BC), Sicily (Hellenised since 750 BC), in the Kingdom of Pontus (8th century BC) and in Cappadocia (c. 330 BC hellenised). 2 Maccabees () describes sacred prostitution in the Second Temple under the reign of the Hellenistic ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes.\nCyprus.\nA passage in Herodotus explains a Babylonian custom where before marriage, girls had to offer themselves for sex, presumably within a temple, as required by rites of a goddess equivalent to Aphrodite in their culture. Herodotus records that a similar practice or custom took place within Cyprus, with girls offering themselves up for sex as required by the rites of Aphrodite. Ennius and Ovid corroborate each other on the idea that Aphrodite established the act of prostitution within the city of Cyprus.\nA temple of Kition also shows evidence of sacred prostitution. On a marble plaque, it lists sacred prostitutes among other professions (bakers, scribes, barbers) that were part of ritual personnel at some Cypriot temples.\nTemple of Aphaca.\nThe temple of Aphaca may be another source of evidence for temple prostitution. The process is similar to regular prostitution, where male customers paid two or three obol in the form of or in addition to dedications to Aphrodite in exchange for sex with a temple prostitute. In the temple of Aphaca specifically, the men would dedicate their payment to \"Cyprian Aphrodite\" before engaging in sex with a temple prostitute.\nAncient Rome and late antiquity.\nLate antiquity.\nThe Roman emperor Constantine closed down a number of temples to Venus or similar deities in the 4th century AD, as the Christian church historian Eusebius proudly noted. Eusebius also writes that the Phoenician cities of Aphaca and Heliopolis (Baalbek) continued to practice temple prostitution until the emperor Constantine put an end to the rite in the 4th century AD.\nAsia.\nIndia.\nPeople in some Indian states practice hierodulic prostitution, with similar customary forms such as basavi, and involves dedicating pre-pubescent and young adolescent girls from villages in a ritual marriage to a Hindu deity or a Hindu temple, who then work in the temple and function as spiritual guides, dancers, and prostitutes servicing male devotees in the temple. The Devadasis were originally seen as intercessors who allowed upper-caste men to have contact with the gods, though they did develop sexual relations with other men. Before Muslim rule in the 14th century, they could live an existence apart from the men, with inheritance rights, wealth and influence, as well as living outside of the dangers of marriage.\nThe system was criticised by British colonial government while defended by Brahmins, leading to a decline in support for the system and the devadasis soon turned to prostitution. Many scholars have stated that the Hindu scriptures do not mention the system. Human Rights Watch also reports claims that devadasis are forced into this service and, at least in some cases, to practise prostitution for upper-caste members. Various state governments in India enacted laws to ban this practice both prior to India's independence and more recently. They include Bombay Devdasi Act, 1934, Devdasi (Prevention of dedication) Madras Act, 1947, Karnataka Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1982, and Andhra Pradesh Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988. However, the tradition continues in certain regions of India, particularly the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.\nJapan.\nDuring the Kamakura period, many shrines and temples, which provided for , fell into bankruptcy. Some miko started travelling in search of livelihood and came to be known as (\u6b69\u304d\u5deb\u5973 lit. walking shrine-maiden). While aruki miko primarily provided religious services, they were also widely associated with prostitution. However, no religious reasons for miko prostitution are known, and hence the act might be unrelated to sacred prostitution.\nNepal.\nThe Deukis are temple prostitutes in Nepal. The practice is banned but still exists. Wealthier families from the Kanari, Thakuri and Bista buy girls from poorer families to be dedicated to a temple; they are not allowed to marry.\nMesoamerica and South America.\nMaya.\nThe Maya maintained several phallic religious cults, possibly involving homosexual temple prostitution.\nAztec.\nMuch evidence for the religious practices of the Aztec culture was destroyed during the Spanish conquest, and almost the only evidence for the practices of their religion is from Spanish accounts. The Franciscan Spanish Friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan learned their language and spent more than 50 years studying the culture. He wrote that they participated in religious festivals and rituals, as well as performing sexual acts as part of religious practice. This may be evidence for the existence of sacred prostitution in Mesoamerica, or it may be either confusion, or accusational polemic. He also speaks of kind of prostitutes named \"ahuianime\" (\"pleasure girls\"), whom he described as \"an evil woman who finds pleasure in her body... [A] dissolute woman of debauched life.\"\nIt is agreed that the Aztec god Xochipili (taken from both Toltec and Maya cultures) was both the patron of homosexuals and homosexual prostitutes. Xochiquetzal was worshiped as goddess of sexual power, patroness of prostitutes and artisans involved in the manufacture of luxury items.\nInca.\nThe Inca sometimes dedicated young boys as temple prostitutes. The boys were dressed in girl's clothing, and chiefs and head men would have ritual sexual intercourse with them during religious ceremonies and on holy days.\nRecent Western occurrences.\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, some religious cults practised sacred prostitution as an instrument to recruit new converts. Among them was the cult Children of God, also known as The Family, who called this practice \"Flirty Fishing\". They later abolished the practice due to the growing AIDS epidemic.\nIn Ventura County, California, Wilbur and Mary Ellen Tracy established their own temple, the \"Church Of The Most High Goddess\", in the wake of what they described as a divine revelation. Sexual acts played a fundamental role in the church's sacred rites, which were performed by Mary Ellen Tracy herself in her assumed role of High Priestess. Local newspaper articles about the Neopagan church quickly got the attention of local law enforcement officials, and in April 1989, the Tracys' house was searched and the couple arrested on charges of pimping, pandering and prostitution. They were subsequently convicted in a trial in state court and sentenced to jail terms: Wilbur Tracy for 180 days plus a $1,000.00 fine; Mary Ellen Tracy for 90 days plus mandatory screening for STDs.\nSome modern sacred prostitutes act as sexual surrogates as a form of therapy. In places where prostitution is illegal, sacred prostitutes may be paid as therapists, escorts, or performers.\nModern views.\nAccording to Avaren Ipsen, from University of California, Berkeley's Commission on the Status of Women, the myth of sacred prostitution works as \"an enormous source of self-esteem and as a model of sex positivity\" to many sex workers. She compared this situation to the figure of Mary Magdalene, whose status as a prostitute, though short-lived according to Christian texts and disputed among academics, has been celebrated by sex working collectives (among them Sex Workers Outreach Project USA) in an effort to de-stigmatize their job. Ipsen speculated that academic currents trying to deny sacred prostitution are ideologically motivated, attributing them to the \"desires of feminists, including myself, to be 'decent.'\"\nIn her book \"The Sacred Prostitute: Eternal Aspect of the Feminine\", psychoanalyst Nancy Qualls-Corbett praised sacred prostitution as an expression of female sexuality and a bridge between the latter and the divine, as well as a rupture from mundane sexual degradation. \"[The sacred prostitute] did not make love in order to obtain admiration or devotion from the man who came to her... She did not require a man to give her a sense of her own identity; rather this was rooted in her own womanliness.\" Qualls also equated censuring sacred prostitution to demonize female sexuality and vitality. \"In her temple, men and women came to find life and all that it had to offer in sensual pleasure and delight. But with the change in cultural values and the institutionalization of monotheism and patriarchy, the individual came to the House of God to prepare for death.\"\nThis opinion is shared by several schools of modern Paganism, among them Wicca, for whom sacred prostitution, independently from its historical backing, embodies the sacralization of sex and a celebration of the communion between female and male sexuality. This practice is associated to spiritual healing and sex magic. Within secular thinking, philosopher Antonio Escohotado is a popular adept of this current, favoring particularly the role of ancient sacred prostitutes and priestesses of Ishtar. In his seminal work \"Rameras y esposas\", he extols them and their cult as symbols of female empowerment and sexual freedom.\nActress Susie Lamb approached sacred prostitution in her 2014 performance \"Horae: Fragments of a Sacred History of Prostitution\", in which she points out its value to challenge gender roles. \"The idea of sacred prostitution is almost entirely incomprehensible to the modern imagination. It involved women having sex as an act of worship... The relationship between men and women in this ancient tradition is based on respect for the woman. She was seen as a powerful person.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62063", "revid": "6209078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62063", "title": "Cher Ami", "text": "Homing pigeon used by the U.S. Army Signal Corps\nCher Ami (French for \"dear friend\", in the masculine) was a male homing pigeon known for his military service during World War I, especially the Meuse-Argonne offensive in October 1918. According to popular legend, he delivered a message alerting American forces to the location of the Lost Battalion, despite sustaining injuries such as being shot in the breast, losing his right leg and being blinded in his left eye.\nBackground and early life.\nHoming pigeons have been used for millennia to carry messages due to their innate ability to navigate home. They were used extensively as messengers during World War I, with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom having established pigeon messenger services before World War I broke out. The United States Army experimented with pigeon messengers successfully in 1878, and unsuccessfully in 1916.649 \nWhen they arrived in France, the advantages of homing pigeons were reported to Colonel Edgar Russel, General John Pershing's chief signal officer, by the British and French. At the request of General John Pershing, the U.S. Army Signal Corps' Pigeon Service was established in November 1917. Cher Ami was one of 600 English-bred birds donated to the Pigeon Service on May 20, 1918.651 The 600 birds arrived in Langres, France on May 23, of which 245 were subsequently sent to the front.651 They were meant to be a communication method of last resort used by frontline troops. Messages would be written thrice on thin paper and placed in a canister attached to the bird. The pigeon would then fly back to its loft, where its message would be read.653\nIt is unknown exactly when Cher Ami hatched, though it was likely in late March or early April of 1918. Cher Ami's identification band is stamped with \"NURP 18 EAD 615,\" meaning he was a \"National Union Racing Pigeon\" and born in 1918. EAD refers to the registered breeder's loft, and may suggest he hatched at the loft of E. A. Davidson in Norfolk, England.652 \nWorld War I service.\nAfter arriving at the Pigeon Service's headquarters, Cher Ami was one of 60 pigeons assigned to Mobile Loft No. 11, managed by Ernest Kockler. On September 21, the loft was relocated to Rampont, France in preparation for the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The birds of Mobile Loft No. 11 supported the 77th Infantry Division into and through the Argonne Forest.\nOn October 2, 1918, the first and second battalions of the 77th Infantry Division, commanded by Major Charles W. Whittlesey and Captain George G. McMurtry, respectively, and two companies of the 306th Machine Gun Battalion entered the forest. Eight pigeons were brought with the group. The group reached the Charlevaux Ravine, where they stopped. The next day, they were joined by Company K of the 307th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Captain Nelson M. Holderman. All together, they totaled 554 men, though estimates vary.80 Around 9:00 AM, two pigeons were sent out requesting artillery support, one of which contained incorrect coordinates. Shortly after, his runners were completely cut off and they were trapped in the ravine. Two more pigeons were sent explaining the situation. They had no more rations, little medical supplies and lost a quarter of their force as casualties.657\nOn the morning of October 4, Whittlesey sent another pigeon requesting aid. Soon after, the Germans began harassing them with mortars and gunfire, and the sixth pigeon was dispatched.657 At 2:30, the 305th Field Artillery Regiment began firing on a slope near their location, and they were soon hit by friendly fire.658 The artillery batteries supporting Whittlesey's men attempted to provide a \"barrage of protection\" for Whittlesey's men on the northern slope of the Charlevaux Ravine, but believed Whittlesey was on the southern slope of the ravine, resulting in a barrage inadvertently targeting the battalion. Around 3:00, when the shelling continued, Whittlesey wrote a note reading,658 \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We are along the road paralell [\"sic\"] 276.4. Our artillery is dropping a barrage directly on us. For heavens sake stop it.\nHe gave the note to Private Omer Richards, who placed it in a capsule and took one of two remaining pigeons from his pigeon basket. A nearby shell surprised the two, and the pigeon escaped. Richards then took the last pigeon, purportedly Cher Ami, tied the message to his right leg, and released it. Cher Ami landed a short distance away on a branch. The Americans attempted to shoo the bird on, but he did not continue on until Richards climbed the tree and shook the branch. As Cher Ami tried to fly back home, the Germans saw him rising out of the brush and opened fire.659 He was shot down but managed to take flight again. He arrived back at his loft at division headquarters 25 miles (40\u00a0km) to the rear in just 25 minutes,665 about 5 minutes after the shelling had ceased. Only 194 men were able to walk out of the forest by the time they were rescued, and they became known as the Lost Battalion. Cher Ami became the hero of the 77th Infantry Division. Army medics worked to save his life. When he recovered enough to travel, the now one-legged bird was put on a boat to the United States, with General John J. Pershing seeing him off.\nInjuries and veracity.\nReports of Cher Ami's injuries vary. Some reports state that he lost an eye, though photographs from April 1919 show no evidence of this. A film made in 1919, \"The Lost Battalion\", which mentions Cher Ami as losing an eye and leg, may have helped perpetuate reports of an eye wound.663 An October 1918 report by Captain David C. Buscall of the Pigeon Service mentions a pigeon with a loft at Rampont, travelling 25 miles (40\u00a0km), who had been shot in the breast, with a leg amputated and the message hanging only by a ligament, possibly referring to Cher Ami. In 1919 he revises the story to mention a pigeon as arriving in 25 minutes from Grandpr\u00e9 on October 27, shot in the chest and with a leg amputated and the message hanging by a ligament.663 Which pigeon this refers to is unclear, though Cher Ami was sometimes credited with this as well as the Lost Battalion action.666 According to Signal Corps Captain C.C. Hungerford, \"Whether \u2018Cher Ami\u2019 did or did not carry the famous message from the Lost Battalion, the records show that he did return to his loft with a message dangling from the ligaments of the leg that had been ampitated [sic] by rifle or shell shot. He was shot through the breast and it was from effect of this wound that he died.\"672 \nThe first print mention of \"Cher Ami\", in 1919 for a caption of a photo, made no mention of the Lost Battalion action. Instead, it described Cher Ami as delivering twelve messages from Verdun to Rampont, covering the 30 kilometers in 24 minutes on average. It noted that on the bird's final flight, it flew from Grandpr\u00e9 to Rampont, covering the 25 miles (40 km) in 25 minutes, shot in the breast and a leg amputated, with the message handing by a ligament. Charlevaux Ravine, where the Lost Battalion was trapped, is 17 miles (27 km) from Rampont.663\nAccording to Frank A. Blazich Jr., the curator of modern military history at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of American History, where Cher Ami's body is located, \"There is nothing conclusive linking the pigeon to the actions of the Lost Battalion. Cher Ami did survive severe wounds transporting a message, but exactly where and when are uncertain. The U.S. Army chose to link Cher Ami with the Lost Battalion\u2019s story to promote the contributions of the Signal Corps\u2019 Pigeon Service.\"646 He further writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Several scenarios emerge from the surviving evidence. According to the official Signal Corps record, Cher Ami was wounded on 21 or 27 October flying from Grandpr\u00e9. If Cher Ami flew on 4 October supporting the Lost Battalion, the bird did not receive any wounds, certainly not the loss of a leg or a severe wound to the chest.\nIn his account of the Lost Battalion, historian Alan D. Gaff accepts Cher Ami as the bird who brought out Whittlesey\u2019s last message, but being wounded on 27 October. With the town and hills fully secure by the early morning of 27 October, however, the afternoon of 21 October is the more plausible date of wounding. As is the popular convention though, Cher Ami flew in support of the Lost Battalion, receiving grievous wounds on 4 October and did not fly again. Thus, the actions of a different pigeon, flying from Grandpr\u00e9, have been credited to Cher Ami. Another possibility is that Cher Ami was not involved in either incident, but nonetheless was credited with both.\nRetirement.\nOn April 16, 1919, Cher Ami arrived in the United States aboard the ship \"Ohioan\", staying in Captain John L. Carney's cabin. When he disembarked, Carney made some statements to the press, which are \"the most direct origin of the Cher Ami legend\", crediting the rescue of the Lost Battalion to Cher Ami.669, 665 Carney had likely read the summary of Cher Ami's combat actions, which described his actions at Grandpr\u00e9 and made no mention of the Lost Battalion, and may have merged it with a separate paragraph from Buscall describing the pigeon from the Lost Battalion. The story of Cher Ami was widely spread through the reporters, along with more dubious details and various stories of his actions.669 Contrary to various news reports and the 1919 film \"The Lost Battalion\", Cher Ami did not receive a Distinguished Service Cross from Pershing. Carney attended numerous press events with Cher Ami, after which he was housed at a loft in Potomac Park in Washington, D.C..670\nDeath and legacy.\nCher Ami died at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, on June 13, 1919, from the wounds he received in battle. Following his death, the U.S. Army Signal Corps donated his remains to the Smithsonian Institution. Taxidermist Nelson R. Wood at the National Museum of Natural History prepared Cher Ami for display.\nWhen the Smithsonian requested information about Cher Ami, the Signal Corps reported they could not find any war record of Cher Ami being the pigeon \"which carried the message from The Lost Battalion.\", though they noted the records did mention that Cher Ami had been shot in the breast, with a leg amputated and the message hanging by the ligaments.672 Listing the known details of the bird, the Army, without explanation, described Cher Ami as \"he\" and the Smithsonian's label reflected the bird's sex as a cock bird.\nIn 2021, the National Museum of American History, together with the Smithsonian's National Zoo, had DNA samples from Cher Ami analyzed which concluded the bird is a cock bird. \nSince 1921, Cher Ami has been on display at the Smithsonian Institution, then the United States National Museum. Today, he is on display in the National Museum of American History exhibit \"The Price of Freedom: Americans at War.\"\nAwards.\nThe pigeon was awarded the Croix de Guerre Medal with a palm Oak Leaf Cluster for his heroic service in delivering 12 important messages in Verdun and was later inducted into the Racing Pigeon Hall of Fame in 1931. He also received a gold medal from the Organized Bodies of American Racing Pigeon Fanciers in recognition of his service during World War I.\nIn November 2019, he became the second recipient of the Animals in War &amp; Peace Medal of Bravery, bestowed posthumously at a ceremony on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In other parts of the program, the name may refer to a different entity (it may have a different binding), or to nothing at all (it may be unbound). Scope helps prevent name collisions by allowing the same name to refer to different objects \u2013 as long as the names have separate scopes. The scope of a name binding is also known as the visibility of an entity, particularly in older or more technical literature\u2014this is in relation to the referenced entity, not the referencing name.\nThe term \"scope\" is also used to refer to the set of \"all\" name bindings that are valid within a part of a program or at a given point in a program, which is more correctly referred to as \"context\" or \"environment\".\nStrictly speaking and in practice for most programming languages, \"part of a program\" refers to a portion of source code (area of text), and is known as lexical scope. In some languages, however, \"part of a program\" refers to a portion of run time (period during execution), and is known as dynamic scope. Both of these terms are somewhat misleading\u2014they misuse technical terms, as discussed in the definition\u2014but the distinction itself is accurate and precise, and these are the standard respective terms. Lexical scope is the main focus of this article, with dynamic scope understood by contrast with lexical scope.\nIn most cases, name resolution based on lexical scope is relatively straightforward to use and to implement, as in use one can read backwards in the source code to determine to which entity a name refers, and in implementation one can maintain a list of names and contexts when compiling or interpreting a program. Difficulties arise in name masking, forward declarations, and hoisting, while considerably subtler ones arise with non-local variables, particularly in closures.\nDefinition.\nThe strict definition of the (lexical) \"scope\" of a name (identifier) is unambiguous: lexical scope is \"the portion of source code in which a binding of a name with an entity applies\". This is virtually unchanged from its 1960 definition in the specification of ALGOL 60. Representative language specifications follow:\n The following kinds of quantities are distinguished: simple variables, arrays, labels, switches, and procedures. The scope of a quantity is the set of statements and expressions in which the declaration of the identifier associated with that quantity is valid.\n An identifier can denote an object; a function; a tag or a member of a structure, union, or enumeration; a typedef name; a label name; a macro name; or a macro parameter. The same identifier can denote different entities at different points in the program. [...] For each different entity that an identifier designates, the identifier is \"visible\" (i.e., can be used) only within a region of program text called its \"scope.\"\n A declaration binds a non-blank identifier to a constant, type, variable, function, label, or package. [...] The scope of a declared identifier is the extent of source text in which the identifier denotes the specified constant, type, variable, function, label, or package.\nMost commonly \"scope\" refers to when a given name can refer to a given variable\u2014when a declaration has effect\u2014but can also apply to other entities, such as functions, types, classes, labels, constants, and enumerations.\nLexical scope vs. dynamic scope.\nA fundamental distinction in scope is what \"part of a program\" means. In languages with lexical scope (also called static scope), name resolution depends on the location in the source code and the \"lexical context\" (also called \"static context\"), which is defined by where the named variable or function is defined. In contrast, in languages with dynamic scope, the name resolution depends upon the program state when the name is encountered which is determined by the \"execution context\" (also called \"runtime context\", \"calling context\" or \"dynamic context\"). In practice, with lexical scope a name is resolved by searching the local lexical context, then if that fails, by searching the outer lexical context, and so on; whereas with dynamic scope, a name is resolved by searching the local execution context, then if that fails, by searching the outer execution context, and so on, progressing up the call stack.\nMost modern languages use lexical scope for variables and functions, though dynamic scope is used in some languages, notably some dialects of Lisp, some \"scripting\" languages, and some template languages. Perl 5 offers both lexical and dynamic scope. Functions that use lexically scoped variables are known as closures.\nLexical resolution can be determined at compile time, and is also known as \"early binding\", while dynamic resolution can in general only be determined at run time, and thus is known as \"late binding\".\nRelated concepts.\nIn object-oriented programming, dynamic dispatch selects an object method at runtime, though whether the actual name binding is done at compile time or run time depends on the language. De facto dynamic scope is common in macro languages, which do not directly do name resolution, but instead expand in place.\nSome programming frameworks like AngularJS use syntactically the term \"scope\" to mean \u2014 the semantics of word \u2014 something entirely different than how it is used in this article. In those frameworks, the scope is just an object of the programming language that they use (JavaScript in case of AngularJS) that is used in certain ways by the framework to emulate dynamic scope in a language that uses lexical scope for its variables. Those AngularJS scopes can themselves be in context or not in context (using the usual meaning of the term) in any given part of the program, following the usual rules of variable scope of the language like any other object, and using their own inheritance and transclusion rules. In the context of AngularJS, sometimes the term \"$scope\" (with a dollar sign) is used to avoid confusion, but using the dollar sign in variable names is often discouraged by the style guides.\nUse.\nScope is an important component of name resolution, which is in turn fundamental to language semantics. Name resolution (including scope) varies between programming languages, and within a programming language, varies by type of entity; the rules for scope are called scope rules (or scoping rules). Together with namespaces, scope rules are crucial in modular programming, so a change in one part of the program does not break an unrelated part.\nOverview.\nWhen discussing scope, there are three basic concepts: \"scope,\" \"extent,\" and \"context.\" \"Scope\" and \"context\" in particular are frequently confused: scope is a property of a name binding, while context is a property of a part of a program, that is either a portion of source code (\"lexical context\" or \"static context\") or a portion of run time (\"execution context,\" \"runtime context,\" \"calling context\" or \"dynamic context\"). Execution context consists of lexical context (at the current execution point) plus additional runtime state such as the call stack. Strictly speaking, during execution a program enters and exits various name bindings' scopes, and at a point in execution name bindings are \"in context\" or \"not in context\", hence name bindings \"come into context\" or \"go out of context\" as the program execution enters or exits the scope. However, in practice usage is much looser.\nScope is a source-code level concept, and a property of name bindings, particularly variable or function name bindings\u2014names in the source code are references to entities in the program\u2014and is part of the behavior of a compiler or interpreter of a language. As such, issues of scope are similar to pointers, which are a type of reference used in programs more generally. Using the value of a variable when the name is in context but the variable is uninitialized is analogous to dereferencing (accessing the value of) a wild pointer, as it is undefined. However, as variables are not destroyed until they go out of context, the analog of a dangling pointer does not exist.\nFor entities such as variables, scope is a subset of lifetime (also known as extent)\u2014a name can only refer to a variable that exists (possibly with undefined value), but variables that exist are not necessarily visible: a variable may exist but be inaccessible (the value is stored but not referred to within a given context), or accessible but not via the given name, in which case it is not in context (the program is \"out of the scope of the name\"). In other cases \"lifetime\" is irrelevant\u2014a label (named position in the source code) has lifetime identical with the program (for statically compiled languages), but may be in context or not at a given point in the program, and likewise for static variables\u2014a static global variable is in context for the entire program, while a static local variable is only in context within a function or other local context, but both have lifetime of the entire run of the program.\nDetermining which entity a name refers to is known as name resolution or name binding (particularly in object-oriented programming), and varies between languages. Given a name, the language (properly, the compiler or interpreter) checks all entities that are in context for matches; in case of ambiguity (two entities with the same name, such as a global and local variable with the same name), the name resolution rules are used to distinguish them. Most frequently, name resolution relies on an \"inner-to-outer context\" rule, such as the Python LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) rule: names implicitly resolve to the narrowest relevant context. In some cases name resolution can be explicitly specified, such as by the codice_1 and codice_2 keywords in Python; in other cases the default rules cannot be overridden.\nWhen two identical names are in context at the same time, referring to different entities, one says that \"name masking\" is occurring, where the higher-priority name (usually innermost) is \"masking\" the lower-priority name. At the level of variables, this is known as variable shadowing. Due to the potential for logic errors from masking, some languages disallow or discourage masking, raising an error or warning at compile time or run time.\nVarious programming languages have various different scope rules for different kinds of declarations and names. Such scope rules have a large effect on language semantics and, consequently, on the behavior and correctness of programs. In languages like C++, accessing an unbound variable does not have well-defined semantics and may result in undefined behavior, similar to referring to a dangling pointer; and declarations or names used outside their scope will generate syntax errors.\nScopes are frequently tied to other language constructs and determined implicitly, but many languages also offer constructs specifically for controlling scope.\nLevels of scope.\nScope can vary from as little as a single expression to as much as the entire program, with many possible gradations in between. The simplest scope rule is global scope\u2014all entities are visible throughout the entire program. The most basic modular scope rule is two-level scope, with a global scope anywhere in the program, and local scope within a function. More sophisticated modular programming allows a separate module scope, where names are visible within the module (private to the module) but not visible outside it. Within a function, some languages, such as C, allow block scope to restrict scope to a subset of a function; others, notably functional languages, allow expression scope, to restrict scope to a single expression. Other scopes include file scope (notably in C) which behaves similarly to module scope, and block scope outside of functions (notably in Perl).\nA subtle issue is exactly when a scope begins and ends. In some languages, such as C, a name's scope begins at the name declaration, and thus different names declared within a given block can have different scopes. This requires declaring functions before use, though not necessarily defining them, and requires forward declaration in some cases, notably for mutual recursion. In other languages, such as Python, a name's scope begins at the start of the relevant block where the name is declared (such as the start of a function), regardless of where it is defined, so all names within a given block have the same scope. In JavaScript, the scope of a name declared with codice_3 or codice_4 begins at the name declaration, and the scope of a name declared with codice_5 begins at the start of the function where the name is declared, which is known as \"variable hoisting\". Behavior of names in context that have undefined value differs: in Python use of undefined names yields a runtime error, while in JavaScript undefined names declared with codice_5 are usable throughout the function because they are implicitly bound to the value codice_7.\nExpression scope.\nThe scope of a name binding is an expression, which is known as expression scope. Expression scope is available in many languages, especially functional languages which offer a feature called \"let expressions\" allowing a declaration's scope to be a single expression. This is convenient if, for example, an intermediate value is needed for a computation. For example, in Standard ML, if codice_8 returns codice_9, then codice_10 is an expression that evaluates to codice_11, using a temporary variable named codice_12 to avoid calling codice_8 twice. Some languages with block scope approximate this functionality by offering syntax for a block to be embedded into an expression; for example, the aforementioned Standard ML expression could be written in Perl as do { my $x = f(); $x * $x }, or in GNU C as ({ int x = f(); x * x; }).\nIn Python, auxiliary variables in generator expressions and list comprehensions (in Python 3) have expression scope.\nIn C, variable names in a function prototype have expression scope, known in this context as function protocol scope. As the variable names in the prototype are not referred to (they may be different in the actual definition)\u2014they are just dummies\u2014these are often omitted, though they may be used for generating documentation, for instance.\nBlock scope.\nThe scope of a name binding is a block, which is known as block scope. Block scope is available in many, but not all, block-structured programming languages. This began with ALGOL 60, where \"[e]very declaration ... is valid only for that block.\", and today is particularly associated with languages in the Pascal and C families and traditions. Most often this block is contained within a function, thus restricting the scope to a part of a function, but in some cases, such as Perl, the block may not be within a function.\nint sum_of_squares(int m) {\n int result = 0;\n for (int n = 1; n &lt;= m; ++n) {\n const int n_squared = n * n;\n result += n_squared;\n return result;\nA representative example of the use of block scope is the C code shown here, where two variables are scoped to the loop: the loop variable n, which is initialized once and incremented on each iteration of the loop, and the auxiliary variable n_squared, which is initialized at each iteration. The purpose is to avoid adding variables to the function scope that are only relevant to a particular block\u2014for example, this prevents errors where the generic loop variable i has accidentally already been set to another value. In this example the expression codice_14 would generally not be assigned to an auxiliary variable, and the body of the loop would simply be written codice_15 but in more complicated examples auxiliary variables are useful.\nBlocks are primarily used for control flow, such as with if, while, and for loops, and in these cases block scope means the scope of variable depends on the structure of a function's flow of execution. However, languages with block scope typically also allow the use of \"naked\" blocks, whose sole purpose is to allow fine-grained control of variable scope. For example, an auxiliary variable may be defined in a block, then used (say, added to a variable with function scope) and discarded when the block ends, or a while loop might be enclosed in a block that initializes variables used inside the loop that should only be initialized once.\nA subtlety of several programming languages, such as Algol 68 and C (demonstrated in this example and standardized since C99), is that block-scope variables can be declared not only within the body of the block, but also within the control statement, if any. This is analogous to function parameters, which are declared in the function declaration (before the block of the function body starts), and in scope for the whole function body. This is primarily used in for loops, which have an initialization statement separate from the loop condition, unlike while loops, and is a common idiom.\nBlock scope can be used for shadowing. In this example, inside the block the auxiliary variable could also have been called n, shadowing the parameter name, but this is considered poor style due to the potential for errors. Furthermore, some descendants of C, such as Java and C#, despite having support for block scope (in that a local variable can be made to go out of context before the end of a function), do not allow one local variable to hide another. In such languages, the attempted declaration of the second n would result in a syntax error, and one of the n variables would have to be renamed.\nIf a block is used to set the value of a variable, block scope requires that the variable be declared outside of the block. This complicates the use of conditional statements with single assignment. For example, in Python, which does not use block scope, one may initialize a variable as such:\nif c:\n a = \"foo\"\nelse:\n a = \"\"\nwhere codice_16 is accessible after the codice_17 statement.\nIn Perl, which has block scope, this instead requires declaring the variable prior to the block:\nmy $a;\nif (c) {\n $a = 'foo';\n} else {\n $a = \";\nOften this is instead rewritten using multiple assignment, initializing the variable to a default value. In Python (where it is not necessary) this would be:\na = \"\"\nif c:\n a = \"foo\"\nwhile in Perl this would be:\nmy $a = \";\nif (c) {\n $a = 'foo';\nIn case of a single variable assignment, an alternative is to use the ternary operator to avoid a block, but this is not in general possible for multiple variable assignments, and is difficult to read for complex logic.\nThis is a more significant issue in C, notably for string assignment, as string initialization can automatically allocate memory, while string assignment to an already initialized variable requires allocating memory, a string copy, and checking that these are successful.\n my $counter = 0;\n sub increment_counter {\n return ++$counter;\nSome languages allow the concept of block scope to be applied, to varying extents, outside of a function. For example, in the Perl snippet at right, codice_18 is a variable name with block scope (due to the use of the codice_19 keyword), while codice_20 is a function name with global scope. Each call to codice_20 will increase the value of codice_18 by one, and return the new value. Code outside of this block can call codice_20, but cannot otherwise obtain or alter the value of codice_18. This idiom allows one to define closures in Perl.\nFunction scope.\nWhen the scope of variables declared within a function does not extend beyond that function, this is known as function scope. Function scope is available in most programming languages which offer a way to create a \"local variable\" in a function or subroutine: a variable whose scope ends (that goes out of context) when the function returns. In most cases the lifetime of the variable is the duration of the function call\u2014it is an automatic variable, created when the function starts (or the variable is declared), destroyed when the function returns\u2014while the scope of the variable is within the function, though the meaning of \"within\" depends on whether scope is lexical or dynamic. However, some languages, such as C, also provide for static local variables, where the lifetime of the variable is the entire lifetime of the program, but the variable is only in context when inside the function. In the case of static local variables, the variable is created when the program initializes, and destroyed only when the program terminates, as with a static global variable, but is only in context within a function, like an automatic local variable.\nImportantly, in lexical scope a variable with function scope has scope only within the \"lexical context\" of the function: it goes out of context when another function is called within the function, and comes back into context when the function returns\u2014called functions have no access to the local variables of calling functions, and local variables are only in context within the body of the function in which they are declared. By contrast, in dynamic scope, the scope extends to the \"execution context\" of the function: local variables \"stay in context\" when another function is called, only going out of context when the defining function ends, and thus local variables are in context of the function in which they are defined \"and all called functions\". In languages with lexical scope and nested functions, local variables are in context for nested functions, since these are within the same lexical context, but not for other functions that are not lexically nested. A local variable of an enclosing function is known as a non-local variable for the nested function. Function scope is also applicable to anonymous functions.\ndef square(n: int) -&gt; int:\n return n * n\ndef sum_of_squares(n: int) -&gt; int:\n total: int = 0 \n i: int = 0\n while i &lt;= n:\n total += square(i)\n i += 1\n return total\nFor example, in the snippet of Python code on the right, two functions are defined: codice_25 and codice_26. codice_25 computes the square of a number; codice_26 computes the sum of all squares up to a number. (For example, codice_29 is 42\u00a0=\u00a0codice_30, and codice_31 is 02\u00a0+\u00a012\u00a0+\u00a022\u00a0+\u00a032\u00a0+\u00a042\u00a0=\u00a0codice_32.)\nEach of these functions has a variable named n that represents the argument to the function. These two n variables are completely separate and unrelated, despite having the same name, because they are lexically scoped local variables with function scope: each one's scope is its own, lexically separate function and thus, they don't overlap. Therefore, codice_26 can call codice_25 without its own n being altered. Similarly, codice_26 has variables named total and i; these variables, because of their limited scope, will not interfere with any variables named total or i that might belong to any other function. In other words, there is no risk of a \"name collision\" between these names and any unrelated names, even if they are identical.\nNo name masking is occurring: only one variable named n is in context at any given time, as the scopes do not overlap. By contrast, were a similar fragment to be written in a language with dynamic scope, the n in the calling function would remain in context in the called function\u2014the scopes would overlap\u2014and would be masked (\"shadowed\") by the new n in the called function.\nFunction scope is significantly more complicated if functions are first-class objects and can be created locally by a function and then returned. In this case any variables in the nested function that are not local to it (unbound variables in the function definition, that resolve to variables in an enclosing context) create a closure, as not only the function itself, but also its context (of variables) must be returned, and then potentially called in a different context. This requires significantly more support from the compiler, and can complicate program analysis.\nFile scope.\nThe scope of a name binding is a file, which is known as file scope. File scope is largely particular to C (and C++), where scope of variables and functions declared at the top level of a file (not within any function) is for the entire file\u2014or rather for C, from the declaration until the end of the source file, or more precisely translation unit (internal linking). This can be seen as a form of module scope, where modules are identified with files, and in more modern languages is replaced by an explicit module scope. Due to the presence of include statements, which add variables and functions to the internal context and may themselves call further include statements, it can be difficult to determine what is in context in the body of a file.\nIn the C code snippet above, the function name codice_26 has global scope (in C, extern linkage). Adding static to the function signature would result in file scope (internal linkage).\nModule scope.\nThe scope of a name binding is a module, which is known as module scope. Module scope is available in modular programming languages where modules (which may span various files) are the basic unit of a complex program, as they allow information hiding and exposing a limited interface. Module scope was pioneered in the Modula family of languages, and Python (which was influenced by Modula) is a representative contemporary example.\nIn some object-oriented programming languages that lack direct support for modules, such as C++ before C++20, a similar structure is instead provided by the class hierarchy, where classes are the basic unit of the program, and a class can have private methods. This is properly understood in the context of dynamic dispatch rather than name resolution and scope, though they often play analogous roles. In some cases both these facilities are available, such as in Python, which has both modules and classes, and code organization (as a module-level function or a conventionally private method) is a choice of the programmer.\nGlobal scope.\nThe scope of a name binding is an entire program, which is known as global scope. Variable names with global scope\u2014called \"global variables\"\u2014are frequently considered bad practice, at least in some languages, due to the possibility of name collisions and unintentional masking, together with poor modularity, and function scope or block scope are considered preferable. However, global scope is typically used (depending on the language) for various other sorts of names, such as names of functions, names of classes and names of other data types. In these cases mechanisms such as namespaces are used to avoid collisions.\nLexical scope vs. dynamic scope.\nThe use of local variables \u2014 of variable names with limited scope, that only exist within a specific function \u2014 helps avoid the risk of a name collision between two identically named variables. However, there are two very different approaches to answering this question: What does it mean to be \"within\" a function?\nIn lexical scope (or lexical scoping; also called static scope or static scoping), if a variable name's scope is a certain function, then its scope is the program text of the function definition: within that text, the variable name exists, and is bound to the variable's value, but outside that text, the variable name does not exist. By contrast, in dynamic scope (or dynamic scoping), if a variable name's scope is a certain function, then its scope is the time-period during which the function is executing: while the function is running, the variable name exists, and is bound to its value, but after the function returns, the variable name does not exist. This means that if function codice_37 invokes a separately defined function codice_38, then under lexical scope, function codice_38 does \"not\" have access to codice_37's local variables (assuming the text of codice_38 is not inside the text of codice_37), while under dynamic scope, function codice_38 \"does\" have access to codice_37's local variables (since codice_38 is invoked during the invocation of codice_37).\n$ # bash language\n$ x=1\n$ f # does this print 1, or 3?\n3\n$ echo $x # does this print 1, or 2?\n1\nConsider, for example, the program on the right. The first line, x=1, creates a global variable codice_12 and initializes it to codice_48. The second line, function g() { echo $x ; x=2 ; }, defines a function codice_38 that prints out (\"echoes\") the current value of codice_12, and then sets codice_12 to codice_52 (overwriting the previous value). The third line, function f() { local x=3 ; g ; } defines a function codice_37 that creates a local variable codice_12 (hiding the identically named global variable) and initializes it to codice_55, and then calls codice_38. The fourth line, f, calls codice_37. The fifth line, echo $x, prints out the current value of codice_12.\nThe scope rules determine what this program prints. If the language of this program is one that uses lexical scope, then codice_38 prints and modifies the global variable codice_12 (because codice_38 is defined outside codice_37), so the program prints codice_48 and then codice_52. By contrast, if this language uses dynamic scope, then codice_38 prints and modifies codice_37's local variable codice_12 (because codice_38 is called from within codice_37), so the program prints codice_55 and then codice_48. (As it happens, the language of the program is Bash, which uses dynamic scope; so the program prints codice_55 and then codice_48. If the same code was run with ksh93 which uses lexical scope, the results would be different.)\nLexical scope.\nWith lexical scope, a name always refers to its lexical context. This is a property of the program text and is made independent of the runtime call stack by the language implementation. Because this matching only requires analysis of the static program text, this type of scope is also called static scope. Lexical scope is standard in all ALGOL-based languages such as Pascal, Modula-2 and Ada as well as in modern functional languages such as ML and Haskell. It is also used in the C language and its syntactic and semantic relatives, although with different kinds of limitations. Static scope allows the programmer to reason about object references such as parameters, variables, constants, types, functions, etc., as simple name substitutions. This makes it much easier to make modular code and reason about it, since the local naming structure can be understood in isolation. In contrast, dynamic scope forces the programmer to anticipate all possible execution contexts in which the module's code may be invoked.\nprogram P;\nvar I:integer;\n K:char;\n procedure A;\n var K:real;\n L:integer;\n procedure B;\n var M:real;\n begin\n (*scope P+A+B*)\n end;\n (*scope P+A*)\n end;\n (*scope P*)\nend.\nFor example, Pascal is lexically scoped. Consider the Pascal program fragment at right. The variable codice_74 is visible at all points, because it is never hidden by another variable of the same name. The codice_75 variable codice_76 is visible only in the main program because it is hidden by the codice_77 variable codice_76 visible only in procedures codice_79 and codice_80. Variable codice_81 is also visible only in procedure codice_79 and codice_80 but it does not hide any other variable. Variable codice_84 is only visible in procedure codice_80 and therefore not accessible either from procedure codice_79 or the main program. Also, procedure codice_80 is visible only in procedure codice_79 and can therefore not be called from the main program. There could have been another procedure named codice_80 declared in the program outside of procedure codice_80. The place in the program where \"codice_80\" is mentioned then determines which of the two procedures named codice_80 it represents, analogous with the scope of variables.\nCorrect implementation of lexical scope in languages with first-class nested functions is not trivial, as it requires each function value to carry with it a record of the values of the variables that it depends on (the pair of the function and this context is called a closure). Depending on implementation and computer architecture, variable lookup \"may\" become slightly inefficient when very deeply lexically nested functions are used, although there are well-known techniques to mitigate this. Also, for nested functions that only refer to their own arguments and (immediately) local variables, all relative locations can be known at compile time. No overhead at all is therefore incurred when using that type of nested function. The same applies to particular parts of a program where nested functions are not used, and, naturally, to programs written in a language where nested functions are not available (such as in the C language).\nHistory.\nLexical scope was first used in the early 1960s for the imperative language ALGOL 60 and has been picked up in most other imperative languages since then.\nLanguages like Pascal and C have always had lexical scope, since they are both influenced by the ideas that went into ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68 (although C did not include lexically nested functions).\nPerl is a language with dynamic scope that added static scope afterwards.\nThe original Lisp interpreter (1960) used dynamic scope. \"Deep binding\", which approximates static (lexical) scope, was introduced around 1962 in LISP 1.5 (via the Funarg device developed by Steve Russell, working under John McCarthy).\nAll early Lisps used dynamic scope, when based on interpreters. In 1982, Guy L. Steele Jr. and the Common LISP Group published \"An overview of Common LISP\", a short review of the history and the divergent implementations of Lisp up to that moment and a review of the features that a \"Common Lisp\" implementation should have. On page 102, we read:\nMost LISP implementations are internally inconsistent in that by default the interpreter and compiler may assign different semantics to correct programs; this stems primarily from the fact that the interpreter assumes all variables to be dynamically scoped, while the compiler assumes all variables to be local unless forced to assume otherwise. This has been done for the sake of convenience and efficiency, but can lead to very subtle bugs. The definition of Common LISP avoids such anomalies by explicitly requiring the interpreter and compiler to impose identical semantics on correct programs.\nImplementations of Common LISP were thus required to have lexical scope. Again, from \"An overview of Common LISP\":\nIn addition, Common LISP offers the following facilities (most of which are borrowed from MacLisp, InterLisp or Lisp Machines Lisp): (...) Fully lexically scoped variables. The so-called \"FUNARG problem\" is completely solved, in both the downward and upward cases.\nBy the same year in which \"An overview of Common LISP\" was published (1982), initial designs (also by Guy L. Steele Jr.) of a compiled, lexically scoped Lisp, called \"Scheme\" had been published and compiler implementations were being attempted. At that time, lexical scope in Lisp was commonly feared to be inefficient to implement. In \"A History of T\", Olin Shivers writes:\n\"All\" serious Lisps in production use at that time were dynamically scoped. No one who hadn't carefully read the Rabbit thesis (written by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. in 1978) believed lexical scope would fly; even the few people who \"had\" read it were taking a bit of a leap of faith that this was going to work in serious production use.\nThe term \"lexical scope\" dates at least to 1967, while the term \"lexical scoping\" dates at least to 1970, where it was used in Project MAC to describe the scope rules of the Lisp dialect MDL (then known as \"Muddle\").\nDynamic scope.\nWith dynamic scope, a name refers to execution context. In technical terms, this means that each name has a global stack of bindings. Introducing a local variable with name codice_12 pushes a binding onto the global codice_12 stack (which may have been empty), which is popped off when the control flow leaves the scope. Evaluating codice_12 in any context always yields the top binding. Note that this cannot be done at compile-time because the binding stack only exists at run-time, which is why this type of scope is called \"dynamic\" scope.\nDynamic scope is uncommon in modern languages.\nGenerally, certain blocks are defined to create bindings whose lifetime is the execution time of the block; this adds some features of static scope to the dynamic scope process. However, since a section of code can be called from many different locations and situations, it can be difficult to determine at the outset what bindings will apply when a variable is used (or if one exists at all). This can be beneficial; application of the principle of least knowledge suggests that code avoid depending on the \"reasons\" for (or circumstances of) a variable's value, but simply use the value according to the variable's definition. This narrow interpretation of shared data can provide a very flexible system for adapting the behavior of a function to the current state (or policy) of the system. However, this benefit relies on careful documentation of all variables used this way as well as on careful avoidance of assumptions about a variable's behavior, and does not provide any mechanism to detect interference between different parts of a program. Some languages, like Perl and Common Lisp, allow the programmer to choose static or dynamic scope when defining or redefining a variable. Examples of languages that use dynamic scope include Logo, Emacs Lisp, LaTeX and the shell languages bash, dash, and PowerShell.\nDynamic scope is fairly easy to implement. To find a name's value, the program could traverse the runtime stack, checking each activation record (each function's stack frame) for a value for the name. In practice, this is made more efficient via the use of an association list, which is a stack of name/value pairs. Pairs are pushed onto this stack whenever declarations are made, and popped whenever variables go out of context. \"Shallow binding\" is an alternative strategy that is considerably faster, making use of a \"central reference table\", which associates each name with its own stack of meanings. This avoids a linear search during run-time to find a particular name, but care should be taken to properly maintain this table. Note that both of these strategies assume a last-in-first-out (LIFO) ordering to bindings for any one variable; in practice all bindings are so ordered.\nAn even simpler implementation is the representation of dynamic variables with simple global variables. The local binding is performed by saving the original value in an anonymous location on the stack that is invisible to the program. When that binding scope terminates, the original value is restored from this location. In fact, dynamic scope originated in this manner. Early implementations of Lisp used this obvious strategy for implementing local variables, and the practice survives in some dialects which are still in use, such as GNU Emacs Lisp. Lexical scope was introduced into Lisp later. This is equivalent to the above shallow binding scheme, except that the central reference table is simply the global variable binding context, in which the current meaning of the variable is its global value. Maintaining global variables isn't complex. For instance, a symbol object can have a dedicated slot for its global value.\nDynamic scope provides an excellent abstraction for thread-local storage, but if it is used that way it cannot be based on saving and restoring a global variable. A possible implementation strategy is for each variable to have a thread-local key. When the variable is accessed, the thread-local key is used to access the thread-local memory location (by code generated by the compiler, which knows which variables are dynamic and which are lexical). If the thread-local key does not exist for the calling thread, then the global location is used. When a variable is locally bound, the prior value is stored in a hidden location on the stack. The thread-local storage is created under the variable's key, and the new value is stored there. Further nested overrides of the variable within that thread simply save and restore this thread-local location. When the initial, outermost override's context terminates, the thread-local key is deleted, exposing the global version of the variable once again to that thread.\nWith referential transparency the dynamic scope is restricted to the argument stack of the current function only, and coincides with the lexical scope.\nMacro expansion.\nIn modern languages, macro expansion in a preprocessor is a key example of de facto dynamic scope. The macro language itself only transforms the source code, without resolving names, but since the expansion is done in place, when the names in the expanded text are then resolved (notably free variables), they are resolved based on where they are expanded (loosely \"called\"), as if dynamic scope were occurring.\nThe C preprocessor, used for macro expansion, has de facto dynamic scope, as it does not do name resolution by itself and it is independent of where the macro is defined. For example, the macro:\nwill expand to add codice_16 to the passed variable, with this name only later resolved by the compiler based on where the macro codice_97 is \"called\" (properly, expanded). Properly, the C preprocessor only does lexical analysis, expanding the macro during the tokenization stage, but not parsing into a syntax tree or doing name resolution.\nFor example, in the following code, the name codice_16 in the macro is resolved (after expansion) to the local variable at the expansion site:\nvoid add_one(int* x) {\n const int a = 1;\n *x = ADD_A(*x);\nvoid add_two(int* x) {\n const int a = 2;\n *x = ADD_A(*x);\nQualified names.\nAs we have seen, one of the key reasons for scope is that it helps prevent name collisions, by allowing identical names to refer to distinct things, with the restriction that the names must have separate scopes. Sometimes this restriction is inconvenient; when many different things need to be accessible throughout a program, they generally all need names with global scope, so different techniques are required to avoid name collisions.\nTo address this, many languages offer mechanisms for organizing global names. The details of these mechanisms, and the terms used, depend on the language; but the general idea is that a group of names can itself be given a name \u2014 a prefix \u2014 and, when necessary, an entity can be referred to by a \"qualified name\" consisting of the name plus the prefix. Normally such names will have, in a sense, two sets of scopes: a scope (usually the global scope) in which the qualified name is visible, and one or more narrower scopes in which the \"unqualified name\" (without the prefix) is visible as well. And normally these groups can themselves be organized into groups; that is, they can be \"nested\".\nAlthough many languages support this concept, the details vary greatly. Some languages have mechanisms, such as \"namespaces\" in C++ and C#, that serve almost exclusively to enable global names to be organized into groups. Other languages have mechanisms, such as \"packages\" in Ada and \"structures\" in Standard ML, that combine this with the additional purpose of allowing some names to be visible only to other members of their group. And object-oriented languages often allow classes or singleton objects to fulfill this purpose (whether or not they \"also\" have a mechanism for which this is the primary purpose). Furthermore, languages often meld these approaches; for example, Perl's packages are largely similar to C++'s namespaces, but optionally double as classes for object-oriented programming; and Java organizes its variables and functions into classes, but then organizes those classes into Ada-like packages.\nBy language.\nScope rules for representative languages follow.\nC.\nIn C, scope is traditionally known as linkage or visibility, particularly for variables. C is a lexically scoped language with global scope (known as \"external linkage\"), a form of module scope or file scope (known as \"internal linkage\"), and local scope (within a function); within a function scopes can further be nested via block scope. However, standard C does not support nested functions.\nThe lifetime and visibility of a variable are determined by its storage class. There are three types of lifetimes in C: static (program execution), automatic (block execution, allocated on the stack), and manual (allocated on the heap). Only static and automatic are supported for variables and handled by the compiler, while manually allocated memory must be tracked manually across different variables. There are three levels of visibility in C: external linkage (global), internal linkage (roughly file), and block scope (which includes functions); block scopes can be nested, and different levels of internal linkage is possible by use of includes. Internal linkage in C is visibility at the translation unit level, namely a source file after being processed by the C preprocessor, notably including all relevant includes.\nC programs are compiled as separate object files, which are then linked into an executable or library via a linker. Thus name resolution is split across the compiler, which resolves names within a translation unit (more loosely, \"compilation unit\", but this is properly a different concept), and the linker, which resolves names across translation units; see linkage for further discussion.\nIn C, variables with block scope enter context when they are declared (not at the top of the block), go out of context if any (non-nested) function is called within the block, come back into context when the function returns, and go out of context at the end of the block. In the case of automatic local variables, they are also allocated on declaration and deallocated at the end of the block, while for static local variables, they are allocated at program initialization and deallocated at program termination.\nThe following program demonstrates a variable with block scope coming into context partway through the block, then exiting context (and in fact being deallocated) when the block ends:\nint main(void) {\n char x = 'm';\n printf(\"%c\\n\", x);\n printf(\"%c\\n\", x);\n char x = 'b';\n printf(\"%c\\n\", x);\n printf(\"%c\\n\", x);\nThe program outputs:\nThere are other levels of scope in C. Variable names used in a function prototype have function prototype visibility, and exit context at the end of the function prototype. Since the name is not used, this is not useful for compilation, but may be useful for documentation. Label names for GOTO statement have function scope.\nC++.\nAll the variables that we intend to use in a program must have been declared with its type specifier in an earlier\npoint in the code, like we did in the previous code at the beginning of the body of the function main when we\ndeclared that a, b, and result were of type int.\nA variable can be either of global or local scope. A global variable is a variable declared in the main body of the\nsource code, outside all functions, while a local variable is one declared within the body of a function or a block.\nModern versions allow nested lexical scope.\nSwift.\nSwift has a similar rule for scopes with C++, but contains different access modifiers.\nGo.\nGo is lexically scoped using blocks.\nJava.\nJava is lexically scoped.\nA Java class has several kinds of variables:\nIn general, a set of brackets defines a particular scope, but variables at top level within a class can differ in their behavior depending on the modifier keywords used in their definition.\nThe following table shows the access to members permitted by each modifier.\nJavaScript.\nJavaScript has simple \"scope rules\", but variable initialization and name resolution rules can cause problems, and the widespread use of closures for callbacks means the lexical context of a function when defined (which is used for name resolution) can be very different from the lexical context when it is called (which is irrelevant for name resolution). JavaScript objects have name resolution for properties, but this is a separate topic.\nJavaScript has lexical scope nested at the function level, with the global context being the outermost context. This scope is used for both variables and for functions (meaning function declarations, as opposed to variables of function type). Block scope with the codice_3 and codice_4 keywords is standard since ECMAScript 6. Block scope can be produced by wrapping the entire block in a function and then executing it; this is known as the immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) pattern.\nWhile JavaScript scope is simple\u2014lexical, function-level\u2014the associated initialization and name resolution rules are a cause of confusion. Firstly, assignment to a name not in scope defaults to creating a new global variable, not a local one. Secondly, to create a new local variable one must use the codice_5 keyword; the variable is then created at the top of the function, with value codice_7 and the variable is assigned its value when the assignment expression is reached:\nA variable with an \"Initialiser\" is assigned the value of its \"AssignmentExpression\" when the \"VariableStatement\" is executed, not when the variable is created.\nThis is known as \"variable hoisting\"\u2014the declaration, but not the initialization, is hoisted to the top of the function. Thirdly, accessing variables before initialization yields codice_7, rather than a syntax error. Fourthly, for function declarations, the declaration and the initialization are both hoisted to the top of the function, unlike for variable initialization. For example, the following code produces a dialog with output &lt;samp&gt;undefined&lt;/samp&gt;, as the local variable declaration is hoisted, shadowing the global variable, but the initialization is not, so the variable is undefined when used:\na = 1;\nfunction f() {\n alert(a);\n var a = 2;\nf();\nFurther, as functions are first-class objects in JavaScript and are frequently assigned as callbacks or returned from functions, when a function is executed, the name resolution depends on where it was originally defined (the lexical context of the definition), not the lexical context or execution context where it is called. The nested scopes of a particular function (from most global to most local) in JavaScript, particularly of a closure, used as a callback, are sometimes referred to as the scope chain, by analogy with the prototype chain of an object.\nClosures can be produced in JavaScript by using nested functions, as functions are first-class objects. Returning a nested function from an enclosing function includes the local variables of the enclosing function as the (non-local) lexical context of the returned function, yielding a closure. For example:\nfunction newCounter() {\n // return a counter that is incremented on call (starting at 0)\n // and which returns its new value\n var a = 0;\n var b = function() { a++; return a; };\n return b;\nc = newCounter();\nalert(c() + ' ' + c()); // outputs \"1 2\"\nClosures are frequently used in JavaScript, due to being used for callbacks. Indeed, any hooking of a function in the local context as a callback or returning it from a function creates a closure if there are any unbound variables in the function body (with the context of the closure based on the nested scopes of the current lexical context, or \"scope chain\"); this may be accidental. When creating a callback based on parameters, the parameters must be stored in a closure, otherwise it will accidentally create a closure that refers to the variables in the enclosing context, which may change.\nName resolution of properties of JavaScript objects is based on inheritance in the prototype tree\u2014a path to the root in the tree is called a \"prototype chain\"\u2014and is separate from name resolution of variables and functions.\nLisp.\nLisp dialects have various rules for scope.\nThe original Lisp used dynamic scope; it was Scheme, inspired by ALGOL, that introduced static (lexical) scope to the Lisp family.\nMaclisp used dynamic scope by default in the interpreter and lexical scope by default in compiled code, though compiled code could access dynamic bindings by use of codice_104 declarations for particular variables. However, Maclisp treated lexical binding more as an optimization than one would expect in modern languages, and it did not come with the closure feature one might expect of lexical scope in modern Lisps. A separate operation, codice_105, was available to somewhat clumsily work around some of that issue.\nCommon Lisp adopted lexical scope from Scheme, as did Clojure.\nISLISP has lexical scope for ordinary variables. It also has dynamic variables, but they are in all cases explicitly marked; they must be defined by a codice_106 special form, bound by a codice_107 special form, and accessed by an explicit codice_108 special form.\nSome other dialects of Lisp, like Emacs Lisp, still use dynamic scope by default. Emacs Lisp now has lexical scope available on a per-buffer basis.\nPython.\nFor variables, Python has function scope, module scope, and global scope. Names enter context at the start of a scope (function, module, or global scope), and exit context when a non-nested function is called or the scope ends. If a name is used prior to variable initialization, this raises a runtime exception. If a variable is simply accessed (not assigned to), name resolution follows the LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) rule which resolves names to the narrowest relevant context. However, if a variable is assigned to, it defaults to declaring a variable whose scope starts at the start of the level (function, module, or global), not at the assignment. Both these rules can be overridden with a codice_1 or codice_2 (in Python 3) declaration prior to use, which allows accessing global variables even if there is a masking nonlocal variable, and assigning to global or nonlocal variables.\nAs a simple example, a function resolves a variable to the global scope:\ndef f() -&gt; None:\n print(x)\nx: str = \"global\"\nf()\nNote that codice_12 is defined before codice_37 is called, so no error is raised, even though it is defined after its reference in the definition of codice_37. Lexically this is a forward reference, which is allowed in Python.\nHere assignment creates a new local variable, which does not change the value of the global variable:\ndef f() -&gt; None:\n x: str = \"f\"\n print(x)\nx: str = \"global\"\nprint(x)\nf()\nprint(x)\nAssignment to a variable within a function causes it to be declared local to the function, hence its scope is the entire function, and thus using it prior to this assignment raises an error. This differs from C, where the scope of the local variable start at its declaration. This code raises an error:\ndef f() -&gt; None:\n print(x)\n x: str = \"f\"\nx: str = \"global\"\nf()\nThe default name resolution rules can be overridden with the codice_1 or codice_2 (in Python 3) keywords. In the below code, the codice_116 declaration in codice_38 means that codice_12 resolves to the global variable. It thus can be accessed (as it has already been defined), and assignment assigns to the global variable, rather than declaring a new local variable. Note that no codice_1 declaration is needed in codice_37\u2014since it does not assign to the variable, it defaults to resolving to the global variable.\ndef f() -&gt; None:\n print(x)\ndef g() -&gt; None:\n global x\n print(x)\n x = \"g\"\nx: str = \"global\"\nf()\ng()\nf()\ncodice_1 can also be used for nested functions. In addition to allowing assignment to a global variable, as in an unnested function, this can also be used to access the global variable in the presence of a nonlocal variable:\ndef f() -&gt; None:\n def g() -&gt; None:\n global x\n print(x)\n x: str = \"f\"\n g()\nx: str = \"global\"\nf()\nFor nested functions, there is also the codice_2 declaration, for assigning to a nonlocal variable, similar to using codice_1 in an unnested function:\ndef f() -&gt; None:\n def g() -&gt; None:\n nonlocal x # Python 3 only\n x = \"g\"\n x: str = \"f\"\n g()\n print(x)\nx: str = \"global\"\nf()\nprint(x)\nR.\nR is a lexically scoped language, unlike other implementations of S where the values of free variables are determined by a set of global variables, while in R they are determined by the context in which the function was created. The scope contexts may be accessed using a variety of features (such as codice_124) which can simulate the experience of dynamic scope should the programmer desire.\nThere is no block scope:\na &lt;- 1\n a &lt;- 2\nmessage(a)\nFunctions have access to scope they were created in:\na &lt;- 1\nf &lt;- function() {\n message(a)\nf()\nVariables created or modified within a function stay there:\na &lt;- 1\nf &lt;- function() {\n message(a)\n a &lt;- 2\n message(a)\nf()\nmessage(a)\nVariables created or modified within a function stay there unless assignment to enclosing scope is explicitly requested:\na &lt;- 1\nf &lt;- function() {\n message(a)\n a \u00ab- 2\n message(a)\nf()\nmessage(a)\nAlthough R has lexical scope by default, function scopes can be changed:\na &lt;- 1\nf &lt;- function() {\n message(a)\nmy_env &lt;- new.env()\nmy_env$a &lt;- 2\nf()\nenvironment(f) &lt;- my_env\nf()\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stands in the Latin Quarter (Quartier Latin), on the , in the centre of the , which was named after it. The edifice was built between 1758 and 1790, from designs by , at the behest of King Louis XV; the king intended it as a church dedicated to Saint Genevieve, Paris's patron saint, whose relics were to be housed in the church. Neither Soufflot nor Louis XV lived to see the church completed.\nBy the time the construction was finished, the French Revolution had started; the National Constituent Assembly voted in 1791 to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a mausoleum for the remains of distinguished French citizens, modelled on the Pantheon in Rome which had been used in this way since the 17th century. The first was , although his remains were removed from the building a few years later. The Panth\u00e9on was twice restored to church usage in the course of the 19th century\u2014although Soufflot's remains were transferred inside it in 1829\u2014until the French Third Republic finally decreed the building's exclusive use as a mausoleum in 1881. The placement of Victor Hugo's remains in the crypt in 1885 was its first entombment in over 50 years.\nThe successive changes in the Panth\u00e9on's purpose resulted in modifications of the pedimental sculptures and the capping of the dome by a cross or a flag; some of the originally existing windows were blocked up with masonry in order to give the interior a darker and more funereal atmosphere, which compromised somewhat Soufflot's initial attempt at combining the lightness and brightness of the Gothic cathedral with classical principles. The architecture of the Panth\u00e9on is an early example of Neoclassicism, surmounted by a dome that owes some of its character to Bramante's .\nIn 1851, L\u00e9on Foucault conducted a demonstration of diurnal motion at the Panth\u00e9on by suspending a pendulum from the ceiling, a copy of which is still visible today. As of December 2021 the remains of 81 people (75 men and six women) had been transferred to the Panth\u00e9on. More than half of all the were made under Napoleon's rule during the First Empire.\nHistory.\nSite and earlier buildings.\nThe site of the Panth\u00e9on had great significance in Paris history, and was occupied by a series of monuments. It was on Mount Lucotitius, a height on the Left Bank where the forum of the Roman town of Lutetia was located. It was also the original burial site of Saint Genevieve, who had led the resistance to the Huns when they threatened Paris in 451. In 508, Clovis, King of the Franks, constructed a church there, where he and his wife were later buried in 511 and 545. The church, originally dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, was rededicated to Saint Genevieve, who became the patron saint of Paris. It was at the centre of the Abbey of Saint Genevieve, a centre of religious scholarship in the Middle Ages. Her relics were kept in the church, and were brought out for solemn processions when dangers threatened the city.\nConstruction.\nKing Louis XV vowed in 1744 that if he recovered from his illness he would replace the dilapidated church of the Abbey of St Genevieve with a grander building worthy of the patron saint of Paris. He did recover, but ten years passed before the reconstruction and enlargement of the church was begun. In 1755 the director of the King's public works, Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Poisson, marquis de Marigny, chose Jacques-Germain Soufflot to design the church. Soufflot (1713\u20131780) had studied classical architecture in Rome over 1731\u201338. Most of his early work was done in Lyon. Saint Genevieve became his life's work; it was not finished until after his death.\nHis first design was completed in 1755, and was clearly influenced by the work of Bramante, which he had studied in Italy. It took form of a Greek cross, with four naves of equal length, and monumental dome over the crossing in the centre, and a classical portico with Corinthian columns and a peristyle with a triangular pediment on the main fa\u00e7ade. The design was modified five times over the following years, with the addition of a narthex, a choir, and two towers. The design was not finalised until 1777.\nThe foundations were laid in 1758, but due to economic problems work proceeded slowly. In 1780, Soufflot died and was replaced by his student Jean-Baptiste Rondelet. The re-modelled Abbey of St. Genevieve was finally completed in 1790, shortly after the beginning of the French Revolution.\nThe building is 110 metres long by 84 metres wide, and 83 metres high, with the crypt beneath of the same size. The ceiling was supported by isolated columns, which supported an array of barrel vaults and transverse arches. The massive dome was supported by pendentives rested upon four massive pillars. Critics of the plan contended that the pillars could not support such a large dome. Soufflot strengthened the stone structure with a system of iron rods, a predecessor of modern reinforced buildings. The bars had deteriorated by the 21st century, and a major restoration project to replace them was carried out between 2010 and 2020.\nThe dome is actually three domes, fitting within each other. The first, lowest dome, has a coffered ceiling with rosettes, and is open in the centre. Looking through this dome, the second dome is visible, decorated with the fresco \"The Apotheosis of Saint Genevieve\" by Antoine Gros. The outermost dome, visible from the outside, is built of stone bound together with iron cramps and covered with lead sheathing, rather than of carpentry construction, as was the common French practice of the period. Concealed buttresses inside the walls give additional support to the dome.\nThe Revolution \u2013 The \"Temple of the Nation\".\nThe Church of Saint Genevieve was nearly complete, with only the interior decoration unfinished, when the French Revolution began in 1789. In 1790, the Marquis de Vilette proposed that it be made a temple devoted to liberty, on the model of the Pantheon in Rome. \"Let us install statues of our great men and lay their ashes to rest in its underground recesses.\" The idea was formally adopted in April, 1791, after the death of the prominent revolutionary figure, The Comte de Mirabeau, the President of the National Constituent Assembly on April 2, 1791. On April 4, 1791, the Assembly decreed \"that this religious church become a temple of the nation, that the tomb of a great man become the altar of liberty.\" They also approved a new text over the entrance: \"A grateful nation honors its great men.\" On the same day the declaration was approved, the funeral of Mirabeau was held in the church.\nThe ashes of Voltaire were placed in the Panth\u00e9on in a lavish ceremony on 11 July 1791, followed by the remains of several revolutionaries, including Jean-Paul Marat, replacing Mirabeau, and of the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In the rapid shifts of power of the Revolutionary period, two of the first men honored in Pantheon, Mirabeau and Marat, were declared enemies of the Revolution, and their remains were removed. Finally, the new government of the French Convention decreed in February, 1795, that no one should be placed in the Pantheon who had not been dead at least ten years.\nSoon after the church was transformed into a mausoleum, the Assembly approved architectural changes to make the interior darker and more solemn. The architect Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy bricked up the lower windows and frosted the glass of the upper windows to reduce the light, and removed most of the ornament from the exterior. The architectural lanterns and bells were removed from the fa\u00e7ade. All of the religious friezes and statues were destroyed in 1791; it was replaced by statuary and murals on patriotic themes.\nTemple to church and back to temple (1806\u20131830).\nNapoleon Bonaparte, when he became First Consul in 1801, signed a Concordat with the Pope, agreeing to restore former church properties, including the Panth\u00e9on. The Panth\u00e9on was under the jurisdiction of the canons of the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. Celebrations of important events, such as the victory of Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz, were held there. However, the crypt of the church kept its official function as the resting place for illustrious Frenchmen. A new entrance directly to the crypt was created via the eastern porch (1809\u20131811). The artist Antoine-Jean Gros was commissioned to decorate the interior of the cupola. It combined the secular and religious aspects of the church; it showed The Apotheosis of Saint Genevieve, conducted to heaven by angels, in the presence of great leaders of France, from Clovis I and Charlemagne to Napoleon and the Empress Josephine.\nDuring the reign of Napoleon, the remains of forty-one illustrious Frenchmen were placed in the crypt. They were mostly military officers, senators and other high officials of the Empire, but also included the explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville and the painter Joseph-Marie Vien, the teacher of Napoleon's official painter, Jacques-Louis David.\nDuring the Bourbon Restoration which followed the fall of Napoleon, in 1816 Louis XVIII restored the entire Panth\u00e9on, including the crypt, to the Catholic Church. The church was also at last officially consecrated in the presence of the King, a ceremony which had been omitted during the Revolution. The sculpture on the pediment by Jean Guillaume Moitte, called \"The Fatherland crowning the heroic and civic virtues\" was replaced by a religious-themed work by David d'Angers. The reliquary of Saint Genevieve had been destroyed during the Revolution, but a few relics were found and restored to the church (They are now in the neighboring Church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont). In 1822 Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard was commissioned to decorate the pendentives of the dome with new works representing Justice, Death, the Nation, and Fame. Jean-Antoine Gros was commissioned to redo his fresco on the inner dome, replacing Napoleon with Louis XVIII, as well as figures of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The new version of the cupola was inaugurated in 1824 by Charles X. As to the crypt where the tombs were located, it was locked and closed to visitors.\nUnder Louis Philippe I, the Second Republic and Napoleon III (1830\u20131871).\nThe French Revolution of 1830 placed Louis Philippe I on the throne. He expressed sympathy for Revolutionary values, and on 26 August 1830, the church once again became the Pantheon. However, the crypt remained closed to the public, and no new remains were added. The only change made was to the main pediment, which had been remade with a radiant cross; it was remade again by D'Angers with a patriotic work called \"The Nation Distributing Crowns Handed to Her by Liberty, to Great Men, Civil and Military, While History Inscribes Their Names.\"\nLouis Philippe was overthrown in 1848 and replaced by the elected government of the Second French Republic, which valued revolutionary themes. The new government designated the Pantheon \"The Temple of Humanity\", and proposed to decorate it with sixty new murals honouring human progress in all fields. In 1851 the Foucault Pendulum of astronomer L\u00e9on Foucault was hung beneath the dome to illustrate the rotation of the earth. However, on complaints from the Church, it was removed in December of the same year.\nLouis Napol\u00e9on, nephew of the Emperor, was elected President of France in December 1848, and in 1852 staged a coup-d'\u00e9tat and made himself Emperor. Once again the Pantheon was returned to the church, with the title of \"National Basilica\". The remaining relics of Saint Genevieve were restored to the church, and two groups of sculpture commemorating events in the life of the Saint were added. The crypt remained closed.\nThe Third Republic (1871\u20131939).\nThe Basilica suffered damage from German shelling during the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. During the brief reign of the Paris Commune in May 1871, it suffered more damage during fighting between the Commune soldiers and the French Army. During the early years of the Third Republic, under conservative governments, it functioned as a church, but the interior walls were largely bare. Beginning in 1874, the interior was redecorated with new murals and sculptural groups linking French history and the history of the church, by notable artists including Puvis de Chavannes and Alexandre Cabanel, and the artist Antoine-Auguste-Ernest H\u00e9bert, who made a mosaic under the vault of the apsidal chapel called \"Christ Showing the Angel of France the Destiny of Her People\".\nIn 1881, a decree was passed to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a mausoleum again. Victor Hugo was the first to be placed in the crypt afterwards. The subsequent governments approved the entry of literary figures, including the writer \u00c9mile Zola (1908), and, after World War I, leaders of the French socialist movement, including L\u00e9on Gambetta (1920) and Jean Jaur\u00e8s (1924). The Third Republic governments also decreed that the building should be decorated with sculpture representing \"the golden ages and great men of France.\" The principal works remaining from this period include the sculptural group called \"The National Assembly\", commemorating the French Revolution; a statue of Mirabeau, the first man interred in the Pantheon, by Jean-Antoine Ingabert; (1889\u20131920); and two patriotic murals in the apse \"Victory Leading the Armies of the Republic\" to \"Towards Glory\" by \u00c9douard Detaille, and \"Glory Entering the Temple, Followed by Poets, Philosophers, Scientists and Warriors\", by Marie-D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Hector d'Espouy (1906).\n1945\u2013present.\nThe short-lived Fourth Republic (1948\u20131958) following World War II pantheonized two physicists, Paul Langevin and Jean Perrin; a leader of the abolitionist movement, Victor Sch\u0153lcher; early leader of Free France and colonial administrator F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9; and Louis Braille, inventor of the Braille writing system, in 1952.\nUnder the Fifth Republic of President Charles de Gaulle, the first person to be buried in the Panth\u00e9on was the Resistance leader Jean Moulin. Modern figures buried in recent years include Nobel Peace Prize winner Ren\u00e9 Cassin (1987) known for drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Jean Monnet (1988) who was a moving force in the creation of the ECSC, the forerunner of the EU, was interred in the 100th anniversary of his birth; Nobel laureates physicists and chemists Marie Curie and Pierre Curie (1995); the writer and culture minister Andr\u00e9 Malraux (1996); and the lawyer, politician Simone Veil (2018). In 2021, Josephine Baker was inducted into the Pantheon.\nArchitecture and art.\nDome.\nThe final plan of the dome was accepted in 1777, and it was completed in 1790. It was designed to rival those of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and St Paul's Cathedral in London. Unlike the dome of in Paris, which has a wooden framework, the dome is constructed entirely of stone. It is actually three domes, one within the other, with the painted ceiling, visible from below, on the second dome. The dome is 83.0 metres (272\u00a0ft) high, compared with the tallest dome in the world, St. Peter's Basilica at 136.57 metres (448.1\u00a0ft).\nThe dome is capped by a cross. However, a statue of Saint Genevieve was initially supposed to sit at the top of the dome. A cross was put temporarily in 1790. After the transformation into a mausoleum in 1791, it was planned that the cross would be replaced by a statue representing Fame. The project was however abandoned. Between 1830 and 1851, a flag was put instead. The cross returned after Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte restored the building to church use. The cross was replaced with a red flag during the Paris Commune in 1871. A cross returned subsequently.\nLooking up from the crossing of the transept beneath the dome, the painting by Jean-Antoine Gros, the \"Apotheosis of Saint Genevieve\" (1811\u20131834), is visible through the opening in the lowest cupola. The triangle in the center symbolizes the Trinity, surrounded by a halo of light. The Hebrew characters spell the name of God. The only character seen in full is Saint Genevieve herself, seated on a rocky promontory. The groups around the painting, made during the Restoration of the Monarchy, represent Kings of France who played an important role in protecting the church. To the left of Saint Genevieve is a group including Clovis, the first King to convert to Christianity. The second group is centred around Charlemagne, who created the first universities. The third group is centred around Louis IX of France, or Saint Louis, with the Crown of Thorns which he brought back from the Holy Land to place in the church of Sainte-Chapelle. The last group is centred around Louis XVIII, the last King of the Restoration, and his niece, looking up into the clouds at the martyred Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. The angels in the scene are carrying the \"Chartre\", the document by which Louis XVIII re-established the church after the French Revolution.\nThe four pendentives, or arches, which support the dome are decorated with paintings from the same period by Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard depicting \"Glory\", \"Death\", \"The Nation\" and \"Justice\" (1821\u201337).\nFa\u00e7ade, peristyle and entrance.\nThe fa\u00e7ade and peristyle on the east side, modeled after a Greek temple, features Corinthian columns and pedimental sculpture by David d'Angers, completed in 1837. The sculpture on this pediment, replacing an early pediment with religious themes, represents \"The Nation distributing crowns handed to her by Liberty to great men, civil and military, while history inscribes their names\". To the left are figures of distinguished scientists, philosophers, and statesmen, including Rousseau, Voltaire, Lafayette, and Bichat. To the right is Napoleon Bonaparte, along with soldiers from each military service and students in uniform from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. Below is the inscription: \"To the great men, from a grateful nation\" (\"Aux grands hommes la patrie reconnaissante\"). This was added in 1791, when the Panth\u00e9on was created. It was removed during the Restoration of the monarchy, then put back in 1830.\nBelow the peristyle are five sculpted bas-reliefs; the two reliefs over the main doors, commissioned during the Revolution, represent the two main purposes of the building: \"Public Education\" (left) and \"Patriotic Devotion\" (right).\nThe fa\u00e7ade originally had large windows, but they were replaced when the church became a mausoleum, to make the interior darker and more somber.\nNarthex and naves.\nThe primary decoration of the Western Nave is a series of paintings, beginning in the Narthex, depicting the lives of Saint Denis, the patron saint of Paris, and longer series on the life of Saint Genevieve, by Puvis de Chavannes, Alexandre Cabanel, Jules Eug\u00e8ne Lenepveu and other notable history painters of the 19th century. The paintings of the Southern nave and Northern Nave continue this series on the Christian heroes of France, including scenes from the lives of Charlemagne, Clovis, Louis IX of France and Joan of Arc. From 1906 to 1922 the Panth\u00e9on was the site of Auguste Rodin's famous sculpture \"The Thinker\".\nFoucault pendulum.\nIn 1851, physicist L\u00e9on Foucault demonstrated the rotation of the Earth by constructing a pendulum beneath the central dome. The original sphere from the pendulum was temporarily displayed at the Panth\u00e9on in the 1990s (starting in 1995) during renovations at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers. The original pendulum was later returned to the Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, and a copy is now displayed at the Panth\u00e9on. It has been listed since 1920 as a \"monument historique\" by the French Ministry of Culture.\nInterment in the crypt.\nInterment in the crypt of the Panth\u00e9on is severely restricted and is allowed only by a parliamentary act for \"National Heroes\". Similar high honours exist in for historical military leaders such as Napoleon, Turenne and Vauban.\nAmong those buried in its necropolis are Voltaire, Rousseau, Victor Hugo, \u00c9mile Zola, Jean Moulin, Louis Braille, Jean Jaur\u00e8s and Soufflot, its architect. In 1907 Marcellin Berthelot was buried with his wife Mme Sophie Berthelot. Marie Curie was interred in 1995, the first woman interred on merit. Genevi\u00e8ve de Gaulle-Anthonioz and Germaine Tillion, heroines of the French resistance, were interred in 2015. Simone Veil was interred in 2018, and her husband Antoine Veil was interred alongside her so that they would not be separated.\nThe widely repeated story that the remains of Voltaire were stolen by religious fanatics in 1814 and thrown into a garbage heap is false. Such rumours resulted in the coffin being opened in 1897, which confirmed that his remains were still present.\nOn 30 November 2002, in an elaborate but solemn procession, six Republican Guards carried the coffin of Alexandre Dumas (1802\u20131870), the author of \"The Three Musketeers\" and other famous novels, to the Panth\u00e9on. Draped in a blue-velvet cloth inscribed with the Musketeers' motto \"Un pour tous, tous pour un\" (\"One for all, all for one\"), the remains had been transported from their original interment site in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Villers-Cotter\u00eats in Aisne, France. In his speech, President Jacques Chirac stated that an injustice was being corrected with the proper honouring of one of France's greatest authors.\nIn January 2007, President Jacques Chirac unveiled a plaque in the Panth\u00e9on to more than 2,600 people recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem memorial in Israel for saving the lives of Jews who would otherwise have been deported to concentration camps. The tribute in the Panth\u00e9on underlines the fact that around three-quarters of the country's Jewish population survived the war, often thanks to ordinary people who provided help at the risk of their own life.\nThis plaque says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were the second married couple, after her parents, to win the Nobel Prize, adding to the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. This made the Curies the family with the most Nobel laureates to date.\nHer mother Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie and she also form the only mother\u2013daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes whilst Pierre and Ir\u00e8ne Curie form the only father-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes by the same occasion, whilst six father-son pairs have won Nobel Prizes by comparison.\nShe was also one of the first three women to be a member of a French government, becoming undersecretary for Scientific Research under the Popular Front in 1936. Both children of the Joliot-Curies, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Pierre, are also scientists.\nIn 1945, she was one of the six commissioners of the new French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) created by de Gaulle and the Provisional Government of the French Republic. She died in Paris on 17 March 1956 from an acute leukemia linked to her exposure to polonium and X-rays.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nIr\u00e8ne was born in Paris, France, on 12 September 1897 and was the first of Marie and Pierre's two daughters. Her sister was \u00c8ve, born in 1904. They lost their father early on in 1906 due to a horse-drawn wagon incident, and Marie was left to raise them. Education was important to Marie and Ir\u00e8ne's education began at a school near the Paris Observatory. This school was chosen because it had a more challenging curriculum than the school nearby the Curie's home. In 1906, it was obvious Ir\u00e8ne was talented in mathematics. Her mother chose to focus on that instead of public school. Marie joined forces with a number of eminent French scholars, including the prominent French physicist Paul Langevin, to form \"The Cooperative\", which included a private gathering of nine students who were children of the most distinguished academics in France. Each contributed to educating these children in their respective homes. The curriculum of The Cooperative was varied and included not only the principles of science and scientific research but also such diverse subjects as Chinese and sculpture, and with great emphasis placed on self-expression and play. Ir\u00e8ne studied in this environment for about two years.\nIr\u00e8ne and her sister \u00c8ve were sent to Poland to spend the summer with their Aunt Bronia (Marie's sister) when Ir\u00e8ne was thirteen. Ir\u00e8ne's education was so rigorous that she still had a German and trigonometry lesson every day of that break. Ir\u00e8ne re-entered a more orthodox learning environment by going back to high school at the Coll\u00e8ge S\u00e9vign\u00e9 in central Paris until 1914. She then went onto the Faculty of Science at the Sorbonne to complete her baccalaureate, until 1916 when her studies were interrupted by World War I.\nWorld War I.\nIr\u00e8ne took a nursing course during college to assist her mother, Marie Curie, in the field as her assistant. She began her work as a nurse radiographer on the battlefield alongside her mother. After a few months she was left to work alone at a radiological facility in Belgium. She taught doctors how to locate shrapnel in bodies using radiology and taught herself how to repair the equipment. She moved throughout facilities and battlegrounds including two bombsites, Furnes and Ypres, and Amiens. She received a military medal for her assistance in X-ray facilities in France and Belgium.\nAfter the war, Ir\u00e8ne returned to the Sorbonne in Paris to complete her second baccalaureate degree in mathematics and physics in 1918. Ir\u00e8ne then went on to work as her mother's assistant, teaching radiology at the Radium Institute, which had been built by her parents. Her doctoral thesis was concerned with the alpha decay of polonium, the element discovered by her parents (along with radium) and named after Marie's country of birth, Poland. Ir\u00e8ne became a Doctor of Science in 1925.\nResearch.\nAs she neared the end of her doctorate in 1924, Ir\u00e8ne Curie was asked to teach the precision laboratory techniques required for radiochemical research to the young chemical engineer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot, whom she would later wed. From 1928, Joliot-Curie and her husband, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, combined their research efforts on the study of atomic nuclei. In 1932, Joliot-Curie and her husband Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric had full access to Marie's polonium. Experiments were done using gamma rays to identify the positron. Though their experiments identified both the positron and the neutron, they failed to interpret the significance of the results and the discoveries were later claimed by Carl David Anderson and James Chadwick respectively. These discoveries would have secured greatness indeed, as together with J. J. Thomson's discovery of the electron in 1897, they finally replaced John Dalton's model of atoms as solid spherical particles.\nIn 1933, Joliot-Curie and her husband were the first to calculate the accurate mass of the neutron. The Joliot-Curies continued trying to get their name into the scientific community; in doing so, they developed a new theory from an interesting experiment they conducted. During an experiment bombarding aluminium with alpha rays, they discovered that only protons were detected. Based on the undetectable electron and positron pair, they proposed that the protons changed into neutrons and positrons. Later in October 1933, this new theory was presented to the Seventh Solvay Conference. The Solvay Conferences consisted of prominent scientists in the physics and chemistry community. Irene and her husband presented their theory and results to their fellow scientists, but they received criticism of their findings from most of the 46 scientists attending. However, they were able to build on the controversial theory later on.\nIn 1934, the Joliot-Curies finally made the discovery that sealed their place in scientific history. Building on the work of Marie and Pierre Curie, who had isolated naturally occurring radioactive elements, the Joliot-Curies realised the alchemist's dream of turning one element into another: creating radioactive nitrogen from boron, radioactive isotopes of phosphorus from aluminium, and silicon from magnesium. Irradiating the natural stable isotope of aluminium with alpha particles (i.e. helium nuclei) resulted in an unstable isotope of phosphorus: 27Al + 4He \u2192 30P + 1n. This phosporus isotope is not found in nature and decays emitting a positron. This discovery is formally known as positron emission or beta decay, where a proton in the radioactive nucleus changes to a neutron and releases a positron and an electron neutrino. By then, the application of radioactive materials for use in medicine was growing, and this discovery allowed radioactive materials to be created quickly, cheaply, and plentifully. The Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1935 brought with it fame and recognition from the scientific community and Joliot-Curie was awarded a professorship at the Faculty of Science.\nThe work that Ir\u00e8ne's laboratory pioneered, research into radium nuclei, would also help another group of physicists within Germany. Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman on 19 December 1938 bombarded uranium with neutrons, but misinterpreted their findings. Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch would theoretically correct Hahn and Strassmann's findings, and after replicating their experiment based on Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard's theory that he had confided to Meitner back in 1933, confirmed on 13 January 1939 that Hahn and Strassmann had indeed observed nuclear fission: the splitting of the nucleus itself, emitting vast amounts of energy. Lise Meitner's now-famous calculations actually disproved Ir\u00e8ne's results and proved that nuclear fission was possible and replicable.\nIn 1948, using work on nuclear fission, the Joliot-Curies, along with other scientists, created the first French nuclear reactor. The Joliot-Curies were a part of the organization in charge of the project, the Atomic Energy Commission, \"Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique\" (CEA). Ir\u00e8ne was the commissioner of the CEA, and Ir\u00e8ne's husband, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, was the director of the CEA. The reactor, Zo\u00e9 (Z\u00e9ro \u00e9nergie Oxyde et Eau lourde) used nuclear fission to generate five kilowatts of power. This was the beginning of nuclear energy as a source of power for France.\nYears of working so closely with radioactive materials finally caught up with Joliot-Curie, and she was diagnosed with leukemia. She had been accidentally exposed to polonium when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench in 1946. Treatment with antibiotics and a series of operations relieved her suffering temporarily, but her condition continued to deteriorate. Despite this, Joliot-Curie continued to work and in 1955 drew up plans for new physics laboratories at the Orsay Faculty of Sciences, which is now a part of the Paris-Saclay University, south of Paris.\nPolitical views.\nThe Joliot-Curies had become increasingly aware of the growth of the fascist movement. They opposed its ideals and joined the Socialist Party in 1934, the \"Comit\u00e9 de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes\" a year later, and in 1936 they actively supported the Republican faction in the Spanish Civil War. In the same year, Joliot-Curie was appointed Undersecretary of State for Scientific Research by the French government, in which capacity she helped in founding the \"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique\".\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Ir\u00e8ne visited Moscow for the two hundred and twentieth anniversary of the Russian Academy of Science and returned sympathizing with Russian colleagues. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric's close connection with the Communist Party caused Ir\u00e8ne to later be detained on Ellis Island during her third trip to the US, coming to speak in support of Spanish refugees, at the Joint Antifascist Refugee Committee's invitation.\nThe Joliot-Curies had continued Pierre and Marie's policy of publishing all of their work for the benefit of the global scientific community, but afraid of the danger that might result should it be developed for military use, they stopped: on 30 October 1939, they placed all of their documentation on nuclear fission in the vaults of the French Academy of Sciences, where it remained until 1949.\nJoliot-Curie's political career continued after the war and she became a commissioner in the \"Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique\". However, she still found time for scientific work and in 1946 became director of her mother's \"Institut Curie\".\nJoliot-Curie became actively involved in promoting women's education, serving on the National Committee of the Union of French Women (\"Comit\u00e9 National de l'Union des Femmes Fran\u00e7aises\") and the World Peace Council. The Joliot-Curies were given memberships to the French \"L\u00e9gion d'honneur\"; Ir\u00e8ne as an officer and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric as a commander, recognising his earlier work for the resistance.\nPersonal life.\nIr\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric hyphenated their surnames to Joliot-Curie after they married in 1926. The Joliot-Curies had two children, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, born eleven months after they were married, and Pierre, born in 1932.\nBetween 1941 and 1943, during World War II, Joliot-Curie contracted tuberculosis and was forced to spend time convalescing in Switzerland. Concern for her own health, together with the anguish of her husband's being in the resistance against the German troops and her children in occupied France, was hard to bear. She did make several dangerous visits back to France, enduring detention by German troops at the Swiss border on more than one occasion. Finally, in 1944, Joliot-Curie judged it too dangerous for her family to remain in France and she took her children back to Switzerland. Later in September 1944, after not hearing from Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric for months, Irene and her children were finally able to rejoin him.\nIr\u00e8ne fought through these struggles to advocate for her own personal views. She was a passionate member of the feminist movement, especially regarding the sciences, and also advocated for peace. She continually applied to the French Academy of Sciences, an elite scientific organization, knowing that she would be denied. She did so to draw attention to the fact they did not accept women in the organization. Ir\u00e8ne was also involved in many speaking functions, such as the International Women's Day conference. She also played a big role for the French contingent at the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace, which promoted the World Peace movement. In 1948, during a strike involving coal miners, Joliot-Curie reached out to Paris Newsletters to convince families to temporarily adopt the children of the coal miners during the strike. The Joliot-Curies adopted two girls during that time.\nDeath.\nIn 1956, after a final convalescent period in the French Alps, Joliot-Curie was admitted to the Curie Hospital in Paris, where she died on 17 March at the age of 58 from leukemia, possibly due to radiation from polonium-210. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric's health was also declining, and he died in 1958 from liver disease, which too was said to be the result of overexposure to radiation.\nJoliot-Curie was an atheist and anti-war. When the French government held a national funeral in her honor, Ir\u00e8ne's family asked to have the religious and military portions of the funeral omitted. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was also given a national funeral by the French government.\nJoliot-Curie's daughter, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Langevin-Joliot, went on to become a nuclear physicist and professor at the University of Paris. Joliot-Curie's son, Pierre Joliot, went on to become a biochemist at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.\nNotable honours.\nHer name was added to the \"Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations\" erected in Hamburg, Germany.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was born into a family of eleven children and reportedly began to write at an early age. She lived on rue Deschambault, a house and neighbourhood in Saint-Boniface that would later inspire one of her most famous works. The house is now a National Historic Site and museum in Winnipeg.\nCareer.\nAfter training as a teacher at The Winnipeg Normal School, she taught in rural schools in Marchand and Cardinal and was then appointed to the Institut Coll\u00e9gial Provencher in Saint Boniface.\nWith her savings she was able to spend some time in Europe, but was forced to return to Canada in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. She returned with some of her works near completion, but settled in Quebec to earn a living as a sketch artist while continuing to write.\nHer first novel, \"Bonheur d'occasion\" (1945), gave a starkly realistic portrait of the lives of people in Saint-Henri, a working-class neighbourhood of Montreal. The novel caused many Quebeckers to take a hard look at themselves, and is regarded as the novel that helped lay the foundation for Quebec's Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. The original French version won her the prestigious Prix Femina in 1947. Published in English as \"The Tin Flute\" (1947), the book won the 1947 Governor General's Award for fiction as well as the Royal Society of Canada's Lorne Pierce Medal. Distributed in the United States, where it sold more than three-quarters of a million copies, the Literary Guild of America made \"The Tin Flute\" a feature book of the month in 1947. The book garnered so much attention that Roy returned to Manitoba to escape the publicity.\nThere are two French versions of \"Bonheur d'occasion\". The first was published in 1945 by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00c9ditions Pascal in two volumes. This version was translated in 1947 by Hannah Josephson, who removed several short passages from the English version. In 1965, Librairie Beauchemin published an abridged French version eliminating a number of passages. This second version was translated by Alan Brown in 1980. As a result, there has never been an unabridged version of \"The Tin Flute\" published in English.\nIn August 1947, she married Marcel Carbotte, a Saint Boniface doctor, and the couple set off for Europe where Carbotte studied gynecology and Roy spent her time writing.\n\"Where Nests the Water Hen\", Gabrielle Roy's second novel, is a sensitive and sympathetic tale that captures both the innocence and the vitality of a sparsely populated frontier.\nAnother of her novels brought additional critical acclaim. \"Alexandre Chenevert\" (1954), is a dark and emotional story that is ranked as one of the most significant works of psychological realism in the history of Canadian literature.\nShe is considered by many to be one of the most important Francophone writers in Canadian history and one of the most influential Canadian authors. In 1963, she was on a panel that gave the Montreal World's Fair, Expo 67, its theme: \"Terre des hommes\" or in English \"Man and His World\". It was her suggestion to use Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's 1939 book title as the organizing theme. In 2016, Margaret Atwood, who had read her books as a teenager, wrote an essay about her career, and noted that her works were still more relevant than ever.\nGabrielle Roy died in 1983 at the age of seventy-four. Her autobiography, \"La D\u00e9tresse et l'enchantement\", was published posthumously and translated in 1984 by Patricia Claxton, a prominent Quebec translator who is considered the primary translator of Gabrielle Roy's works from French to English. Her translation of Gabrielle Roy's autobiography, translated into English as \"Enchantment and Sorrow\" was awarded the Governor General's Award in 1987. The autobiography covers the years from Gabrielle Roy's childhood in Manitoba to the time when she settled in Quebec.\nThe movie \"Tramp at the Door\", based on Roy's short story and released in 1985, was dedicated to her memory.\nPatricia Claxton won her second Governor General's Award in 1999 for translating Fran\u00e7ois Ricard's biography of Gabrielle Roy.\nAwards and recognition.\nShe won the Governor General's Award three times, the Prix David twice, the Prix Duvernay and the Molson Prize.\nThe National Library of Canada (now Library and Archives Canada) has preserved a collection of her materials covering the years 1940 to 1983, including manuscripts, typescripts, galleys of published and unpublished works such as \"La Rivi\u00e8re sans repos\", \"Cet \u00e9t\u00e9 qui chantait\", \"Un jardin au bout du monde\", \"Ces enfants de ma vie\", and \"La D\u00e9tresse et l'enchantement\", as well as business and personal correspondence, business records, and memorabilia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the best-selling writers of all time, he wrote over 25 best-sellers, selling over 750 million copies in 32 languages.\nEarly life.\nRobbins was born Harold Rubin in New York City in 1916, the son of Frances \"Fannie\" Smith and Charles Rubin. His parents were well-educated Jewish emigrants from the Russian Empire, his father from Odessa and his mother from Neshwies (Nyasvizh), south of Minsk. Robbins later falsely claimed to be a Jewish orphan who had been raised in a Catholic boys' home. Instead he was raised by his father, a pharmacist, and his stepmother, Blanche, in Brooklyn.\nRobbins dropped out of high school at 15 to enlist in the U.S. Navy. He claimed to have served on a submarine that was torpedoed, leaving him as the sole survivor; in fact, no U.S. submarines were torpedoed during the 1930s.\nRobbins worked a variety of jobs, including errand boy, bookies' runner, and inventory clerk in a grocers. He was employed by Universal Pictures from 1940 to 1957, starting off as a clerk and rising to an executive.\nWork.\nHis first book was \"Never Love a Stranger\" (1948). \"The Dream Merchants\" (1949) was a novel about the American film industry, from its beginning to the sound era in which Robbins blended his own life experiences with history, melodrama, sex, and glossy high society into a fast-moving story. His 1952 novel, \"A Stone for Danny Fisher,\" was adapted into a 1958 motion picture \"King Creole\", which starred Elvis Presley.\nAmong his best-known books is \"The Carpetbaggers\" (1961)\u2014featuring a protagonist who was a loose composite of Howard Hughes, Bill Lear, Harry Cohn, and Louis B. Mayer. \"The Carpetbaggers\" takes the reader from New York to California, from the prosperity of the aeronautical industry to the glamor of Hollywood. Its sequel, \"The Raiders\", was released in 1995.\nFilm producer Joseph E. Levine acquired the rights to \"The Carpetbaggers\" in September 1962 and produced the 1964 film. He also acquired the rights to Robbins's next book \"Where Love Has Gone\" (1962) with the film version also released in 1964. In 1963, Levine paid Robbins $1 million for pre-publication and film rights for Robbins's upcoming book \"The Adventurers\". The book was released in 1966 and was based on Robbins's experiences living in South America, including three months spent in the mountains of Colombia with a group of bandits. The film version was released in 1970. Robbins also created the ABC television series \"The Survivors\" (1969\u20131970), starring Ralph Bellamy and Lana Turner.\nRobbins's editors included Cynthia White and Michael Korda and his literary agent was Paul Gitlin.\nIn July 1989, Robbins was involved in a literary controversy when the trade periodical \"Publishers Weekly\" revealed that around four pages from Robbins's novel \"The Pirate\" (1974) had been lifted without permission and integrated into Kathy Acker's novel \"The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec\" (1975), which had recently been re-published in the UK in a selection of early works by Acker titled \"Young Lust\" (1989).232 After Paul Gitlin saw the expos\u00e9 in \"Publishers Weekly\", he informed Robbins's UK publisher, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who requested that Acker's publisher Unwin Hyman withdraw and pulp \"Young Lust\". Representatives for the novelist explained that Acker was well known for her deliberate use of literary appropriation234\u2014or bricolage, a postmodern technique akin to plagiarism in which fragments of pre-existing works are combined along with original writings to create new literary works. After an intervention by William S. Burroughs\u2014a novelist who used appropriation in his own works of the 1960s\u2014Robbins issued a statement to give Acker retroactive permission to appropriate from his work, avoiding legal action on his publisher's part.\nSince his death, several new books have been published, written by ghostwriters and based on Robbins's own notes and unfinished stories. In several of these books, Junius Podrug has been credited as co-writer.\nFrom the Hodder &amp; Stoughton 2008 edition of \"The Carpetbaggers\" \"about the author\" section:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Robbins was the playboy of his day and a master of publicity. He was a renowned novelist but tales of his own life contain even more fiction than his books. What is known is that with reported worldwide sales of 750 million, Harold Robbins sold more books than J.K. Rowling, earned and spent $50m during his lifetime, and was as much a part of the sexual and social revolution as the pill, Playboy and pot. In March 1965, he had three novels on the British paperback bestseller list\u2014\"Where Love Has Gone\" at No. 1, \"The Carpetbaggers\" at No. 3 and \"The Dream Merchants\" in the sixth spot.\nPersonal life.\nRobbins was married three times, first to his high school sweetheart, Lillian Machnivitz. In 1965 he wed Grace Palermo, who went on to pen an account of her life with Robbins in 2013. Divorced in the early 1990s, Robbins married Jann Stapp in 1992; they remained together until his death.\nHe spent a great deal of time on the French Riviera and at Monte Carlo until his death from respiratory heart failure, at the age of 81 in Palm Springs, California. His cremated remains are interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cathedral City. Robbins has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6743 Hollywood Boulevard.\nNovels.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPosthumously published novels credited to Robbins.\nWorks bearing Robbins name continued to appear after his death. The earliest three posthumous Harold Robbins novels (\"The Predators\" (1998), \"The Secret\" (2000) and \"Never Enough\" (2001) are generally thought to have been completed by ghostwriters, but may have been partially or even substantially based on completed work or notes written by Robbins. Junius Podrug has been identified as the uncredited ghostwriter of \"Sin City\" (2002) and \"Heat of Passion\" (2003). From 2004 to 2011, a series of novels credited to Robbins and Podrug appeared, although they are strictly the work of Podrug, writing in Robbins's style.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The FRC was established by the Radio Act of 1927, which replaced the Radio Act of 1912 after the earlier law was found to lack sufficient oversight provisions, especially for regulating broadcasting stations. In addition to increased regulatory powers, the FRC introduced the standard that, in order to receive a license, a radio station had to be shown to be \"in the public interest, convenience, or necessity\".\nPrevious regulation.\nRadio Act of 1912.\nAlthough radio communication (originally known as \"wireless telegraphy\") was developed in the late 1890s, it was largely unregulated in the United States until the passage of the Radio Act of 1912. This law set up procedures for the Department of Commerce to license radio transmitters, which initially consisted primarily of maritime and amateur stations. The broadcasting of news and entertainment to the general public, which began to be developed early 1920s, was not foreseen by this legislation.\nThe first Commerce Department regulations specifically addressing broadcasting were adopted on December 1, 1921, when two wavelengths were set aside for stations making broadcasts intended for a general audience: 360 meters (833\u00a0kHz) for \"entertainment\", and 485 meters (619\u00a0kHz) for \"market and weather reports\". The number of broadcasting stations grew tremendously in 1922, numbering over 500 in the United States by the end of the year. The number of reserved transmitting frequencies also expanded, and by 1925, the \"broadcast band\" consisted of the frequencies from 550\u00a0kHz to 1500\u00a0kHz, in ten kHz steps.\nHerbert Hoover became the Secretary of Commerce in March 1921, and thus assumed primary responsibility for shaping radio broadcasting during its earliest days, which was a difficult task in a fast-changing environment. To aid decision-making, he sponsored a series of four national conferences from 1922 to 1925, where invited industry leaders participated in setting standards for radio in general.\nLegal challenges.\nDuring his tenure Hoover was aware that some of his actions were on shaky legal ground, given the limited powers assigned to him by the 1912 Act. In particular, in 1921 the department had tried to refuse to issue a renewal license to a point-to-point radiotelegraph station in New York City, operated by the Intercity Radio Company, on the grounds that it was causing excessive interference to earlier radiotelegraph stations operating nearby. Intercity appealed, and in 1923 the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia sided with Intercity, stating the 1912 Act did not provide for licensing decisions at \"the discretion of an executive officer\". The Department of Commerce planned to request a review by the Supreme Court, but the case was rendered moot when Intercity decided to shut down the New York City station. Still, it had raised significant questions about the extent of Hoover's authority.\nA second, ultimately successful, challenge occurred in 1926. The Zenith Radio Corporation in late 1925 established a high-powered radio station, WJAZ, with a transmitter site outside Chicago, Illinois. After being informed that there might not be an available frequency for the station to use, company president E. F. McDonald proposed that, because they only wanted to broadcast two hours a week, they would be happy with an assignment on 930\u00a0kHz that was limited to 10:00\u00a0p.m. to midnight Central time on Thursday nights, when the only other station on the frequency, KOA in Denver, Colorado, was normally off the air. Despite McDonald's initial expression of satisfaction with a schedule of just two hours per week, his tone soon changed. At this time the United States had an informal agreement with Canada that six designated AM band frequencies would be used exclusively by Canadian stations. In early January 1926, McDonald directed WJAZ to move from its 930\u00a0kHz assignment to 910\u00a0kHz, one of the restricted Canadian frequencies, and begin expanded hours of operation.\nInvoking the Intercity Radio Company case rulings, Zenith ignored the Commerce Department's order to return WJAZ to its assigned frequency. On January 20, 1926, a federal court suit, \"United States versus Zenith Radio Corporation and E. F. McDonald\", was filed in Chicago. McDonald expected a narrow ruling in his favor, claiming that only a small number of stations, including WJAZ, held the \"Class D Developmental\" licenses that were free from normal restrictions. However, the actual outcome was sweeping. On April 16, 1926, Judge James H. Wilkerson's ruling stated that, under the 1912 Act, the Commerce Department in fact could not limit the number of broadcasting licenses issued, or designate station frequencies. The government reviewed whether to try to appeal this decision, but Acting Attorney General William J. Donovan's analysis concurred with the court's decision.\nThe immediate result was that, until Congress passed new legislation, the Commerce Department could not limit the number of new broadcasting stations, which were now free to operate on any frequency and use any power they wished. Many stations showed restraint, while others took the opportunity to increase powers and move to new frequencies (derisively called \"wave jumping\"). The extent to which this new environment resulted in disruption for the average listener is difficult to judge, but the term \"chaos\" started to appear in discussions.\nFederal Radio Commission.\nRadio Act of 1927.\nPrior to the early 1926 adverse ruling on the Commerce Department's regulatory authority, there had been numerous efforts in the U.S. Congress to replace the Radio Act of 1912 with a more comprehensive bill, but none of these efforts made much headway. The need for new legislation gained additional importance because, in the absence of federal regulation, stations were taking their individual disputes to the courts, which began to render decisions favoring incumbent stations. This effectively was granting established stations \"property rights\" in the use of their assignments, which the government wanted to avoid, because it generally considered the radio spectrum to be a public resource.\nDespite the recognition that new legislation was needed, there was a lack of consensus whether it should increase the authority of the Secretary of Commerce, which opponents argued would create a too-powerful \"Radio Czar\", or if an independent regulatory body was needed, which some disputed was unneeded and overly expansive. The legislation ultimately passed was known as the Dill-White Bill, which was proposed and sponsored by Senator Clarence Dill (D-Washington) and Representative Wallace H. White Jr. (R-Maine) on December 21, 1926. It was brought to the Senate floor on January 28, 1927, and, as a compromise, specified that a five member commission would be given the power to reorganize radio regulation, but most of its duties would end after one year. After a month of debates this bill was passed on February 18, 1927, as the Radio Act of 1927, and signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on February 23, 1927. The Commission's organizational meeting was held on March 15.\nCommissioners.\nThe Radio Act of 1927 subdivided the country into five geographical zones, and specified that one commissioner would be appointed who resided within each zone. Terms were initially for up to six years, although this was later reduced to one year, and no more than three commissioners could be members of the same political party. The FRC's commissioners, by zone, from 1927 to 1934 were:\nThe five initial appointments, made by President Coolidge on March 2, 1927, were: Admiral William H. G. Bullard as chairman, Colonel John F. Dillon, Eugene O. Sykes, Henry A. Bellows, and Orestes H. Caldwell. Bullard, Dillon and Sykes were confirmed on March 4, but action on Bellows and Caldwell was deferred, so they initially participated without pay. In October 1927 Dillon died and Bellows resigned. During the next month Bullard died, and Harold Lafount and Sam Pickard were appointed. It was not until March 1928, after Caldwell was approved by a one vote margin and Ira E. Robinson was appointed as chairman, that all five commissioner posts were filled with confirmed members.\nResponsibilities.\nTo rectify the limitations of the 1912 act, the FRC was given the power to grant and deny licenses, assign station frequencies and power levels, and issue fines for violations. The opening paragraph of the Radio Act of 1927 summarized its objectives as:\n\"...this Act is intended to regulate all forms of interstate and foreign radio transmissions and communications within the United States, its Territories and possessions; to maintain the control of the United States over all the channels of interstate and foreign radio transmission; and to provide for the use of such channels, but not the ownership thereof, by individuals, firms, or corporations, for limited periods of time, under licenses granted by Federal authority, and no such license shall be construed to create any right, beyond the terms, conditions, and periods of the license.\"\nSome technical duties remained the responsibility of the Radio Division of the Department of Commerce, and because Congress failed to provide funding for a staff, during the FRC's first year the commission was heavily dependent on support from Commerce personnel. Moreover, most of the FRC's work was expected to be completed within one year, and the original intention was that a majority of its functions would then revert to the Secretary of Commerce:\"Sec 5. From and after one year after the first meeting of the commission created by this Act, all the powers and authority vested in the commission under the terms of this Act, except as to the revocation of licenses, shall be vested in and exercised by the Secretary of Commerce; except that thereafter the commission shall have power and jurisdiction to act upon and determine any and all matters brought before it under the terms of this section.\"\nActing as a check on the commission's power, \"censorship\" of station programming was not allowed, although extreme language was prohibited:\n\"Sec. 29. Nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the licensing authority the power of censorship over the radio communications or signals transmitted by any radio station, and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the licensing authority which shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communications. No person within the jurisdiction of the United States shall utter any obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio communication.\"\nHowever, the \"public interest, convenience, or necessity\" standard allowed the Commission to take into consideration program content when renewing licenses, and the ability to take away a license provided some degree of content control. This allowed the FRC to crack down on \"vulgar\" language \u2014 for example the profanity-filled rants of William K. Henderson on KWKH in Shreveport, Louisiana. But it also led to First Amendment free speech disputes over the appropriateness of some FRC actions.\nA forerunner of the FCC's later \"equal-time rule\" required stations to give equal opportunities for political candidates:\n\"Sec 18. If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station, and the licensing authority shall make rules and regulations to carry this provision into effect: Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provisions of this paragraph. No obligation is hereby imposed upon any licensee to allow the use of its station by any such candidate.\"\nThe Radio Act of 1927 did not authorize the Federal Radio Commission to make any rules regulating advertising, although section 19 required advertisers to properly identify themselves. There was almost no mention of the radio networks \u2014 notably the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and, a bit later the Columbia Broadcasting System) (CBS) \u2014 that were in the process of dominating broadcasting, other than a statement in section 3 that \"The Commission shall have the authority to make special regulations applicable to stations engaged in chain broadcasting\".\nIn early 1928 it became clear that the FRC needed more than a single year to perform its tasks, and its tenure was extended for an additional year. In December 1929 the commission's mandate was extended indefinitely.\nThe FRC's regulatory activities, and the public's knowledge of its work, primarily focused on broadcasting stations. However, in 1932, in addition to 625 broadcasting stations, the commission oversaw numerous other station classifications, including approximately thirty thousand amateur radio stations, two thousand ship stations, and one thousand fixed-point land stations. On February 25, 1928, Charles Jenkins Laboratories of Washington, DC, became the first holder of a television license.\nSelected major FRC actions.\nThe most critical issue the FRC faced at the time of its creation was an excess of broadcasting stations, which now numbered 732, all on the AM band. (The FM broadcast band would not be created until 1941). There were some significant technical restraints on the number of stations that could operate simultaneously. At night, a change in the ionosphere allows radio signals, especially from more powerful stations, to travel hundreds of kilometers. In addition, at this time transmitter frequency stability was often limited, which meant that stations broadcasting on nominally the same frequency often were actually slightly offset from each other, which produced piercing high-pitched \"heterodyne\" interference at even greater distances than the mixing of their audio. Another tool that was not yet available was directional antennas that could restrict signals to specified directions. Overall, the main tools available for insuring quality reception was limiting the number of stations operating concurrently, which meant restricting some stations to daytime-only operation, and in many cases requiring time-sharing, where up to four stations in a given region had to divide up the hours each used on a single frequency.\nGeneral Order 32.\nOn May 3, 1927, the FRC made the first of a series of temporary frequency assignments, which served to reassign the stations operating on Canadian frequencies, and also eliminate \"split-frequency\" operations that fell outside of the standard of transmitting on frequencies evenly divided by 10\u00a0kHz. The FRC conducted a review and census of the existing stations, then notified them that if they wished to remain on the air they had to file a formal license application by January 15, 1928, as the first step in determining whether they met the new \"public interest, convenience, or necessity\" standard.\nAfter reviewing the applications, on May 25, 1928, the FRC issued General Order 32, which notified 164 stations that the initial review had found their justification for receiving a license insufficient, and they would have to attend a hearing in Washington, D.C. Moreover, \"At this hearing, unless you can make an affirmative showing that public interest, convenience, or necessity will be served by the granting of your application, it will be finally denied.\"\nMany low-powered independent stations were eliminated, although eighty-one stations did survive, most with reduced power. Educational stations fared particularly poorly. They were usually required to share frequencies with commercial stations and operate during the daytime, which was considered of limited value for adult education.\nGeneral Order 40.\nWith the roster of stations now reduced to a somewhat more manageable level, the FRC next embarked on a major reorganization of broadcasting station frequency assignments. On August 30, 1928, the Commission issued General Order 40, which defined a \"broadcast band\" consisting of 96 frequencies from 550 to 1500\u00a0kHz. Six frequencies were restricted for exclusive use Canadian stations, leaving 90 available for the slightly fewer than 600 U.S. stations. The new assignments went into effect on November 11, 1928.\nForty of the available frequencies were reserved for high-powered \"clear channel\" stations, which in most cases had only a single station with an exclusive nationwide assignment. Although generally accepted as being successful on a technical level of reducing interference and improving reception, there was also a perception that large companies and their stations had received the best assignments. Commissioner Ira E. Robinson publicly dissented, stating that: \"Having opposed and voted against the plan and the allocations made thereunder, I deem it unethical and improper to take part in hearings for the modification of same\". Some later economic analysis has concluded that the early radio regulation policies reflected regulatory capture and rent-seeking.\nWGY assignment.\nMost of the FRC decisions reviewed by the courts were upheld, however a notable exception involved WGY in Schenectady, New York, a long established high-powered station owned by General Electric. Under the November 11, 1928, reassignment plan, WGY was limited to daytime hours plus evening hours until sunset in Oakland, California, where KGO, transmitting on the same frequency, was located. Previously, WGY had operated with unlimited hours. On February 25, 1929, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia ruled that restricting WGY's hours \"was unreasonable and not in the public interest, convenience or necessity\" The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take the FRC's appeal, but following oral arguments declined to issue a ruling, after deciding that under current legislation it did not have oversight, thus allowing the lower court ruling to stand.\nKFKB deletion.\nKFKB was a popular Milford, Kansas broadcasting station, licensed to an organization controlled by John R. Brinkley, known as \"The Goat Gland Doctor\" due to his promotion of \"sexual rejuvenation\" surgery that included implantation of slivers of goat testes.\nIn 1930 the Federal Radio Commission denied his request for renewal, primarily on the grounds that, instead of being operated as a public service, the station was primarily being run as \"a mere adjunct of a particular business\". (In one of Brinkley's programs he read listener mail describing medical issues, then recommended medication of dubious value, identified by numbers, over the air. Listeners had to visit a Brinkley \"kick back\" pharmacy to purchase these items.)\nBrinkley appealed on the grounds that this was prohibited censorship, but the U.S. Court of Appeals denied his appeal, stating \"This contention is without merit. There has been no attempt on the part of the commission to subject any part of appellant's broadcasting matter to scrutiny prior to its release. In considering the question whether the public interest, convenience, or necessity will be served by a renewal of appellant's license, the commission has merely exercised its undoubted right to take note of appellant's past conduct, which is not censorship.\"\nDenied this station, Brinkley moved his operations to a series of powerful Mexican outlets located on the U.S. border, which helped to lead to implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement in 1941.\nKGEF deletion.\nKGEF was a broadcasting station first licensed in late 1926 to Trinity Methodist Church, South, in downtown Los Angeles. Its programming was dominated by long denunciations made by pastor Robert \"Fighting Bob\" Shuler, who stated that he operated the station in order to \"make it hard for the bad man to do wrong in the community\", but his strident broadcasts soon became very controversial. After a 1931 evaluation of the station's renewal application, chief examiner Ellis A. Yost expressed misgivings about Shuler's \"extremely indiscreet\" broadcasts, but recommended approval. However, a review by the Commission concluded that the station should be deleted, because it \"...could not determine that the granting thereof was in the public interest; that the programs broadcast by its principal speaker were sensational rather than instructive and in two instances he had been convicted of attempting over the radio to obstruct orderly administration of public justice\".\nThe Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia affirmed the Commission's decision and held that, despite First Amendment protections: \"...this does not mean that the Government, through agencies established by Congress, may not refuse a renewal license to one who has abused it to broadcast defamatory and untrue matter. In that case there is not a denial of the freedom of speech but merely the application of the regulatory power of Congress in a field within the scope of its legislative authority\". The court also ruled that denying license renewal as not in the public interest did not violate the Fifth Amendment's prohibition of \"taking of property\" without due process of law. This ruling became final after a petition for \"writ of certiorari\" requesting review by United States Supreme Court was denied.\nWNYC assignment.\nUnder the November 11, 1928, reorganization, WNYC, the municipal station of New York City, was given a half-time, low-power assignment. The station appealed on the grounds that it should have been given a full-time authorization, but lost. Even though the station was government owned, the Federal Radio Commission said that city ownership did not give the station any special standing under the \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" standard. However, the case was viewed as representative of the preferences given to commercial interests above those of non-commercial stations.\nDavis Amendment implementation.\nSection 9 of the 1927 Act included a general declaration about the need to equitably distribute station assignments, stating: \"In considering applications for licenses and renewals of licenses, when and in so far as there is a demand for the same, the licensing authority shall make such a distribution of licenses, bands of frequency of wave lengths, periods of time for operation, and of power among the different States and communities as to give fair, efficient, and equitable radio service to each of the same.\" The 1928 reauthorization strengthened this mandate, by including a provision, known as the \"Davis Amendment\" after its sponsor Representative Ewin L. Davis (D-Tennessee), that required \"a fair and equitable allocation of licenses, wave lengths, time for operation, and station power to each of the States, the District of Columbia, the Territories and possessions of the United States within each zone, according to population\". This resulted in an additional degree of complexity, for in addition to stations being judged on their individual merits, the commission had to monitor whether in heavily populated areas a decision would cause a zone or state to exceed its calculated quota.\nIn cases where two or more stations shared a common frequency on a timesharing basis, a station could petition the FRC to have its hours of operation increased by having the other stations deleted. A prominent example under the FRC's jurisdiction occurred when a Gary, Indiana station, WJKS, proposed the deletion of its two timeshare partners, WIBO and WPCC, both located in Chicago, Illinois. A major justification was that Indiana was currently under-quota based on the Davis Amendment provisions, while Illinois had exceeded its allocation. The commission ruled in favor of WJKS, however the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversed the decision, calling it \"arbitrary and capricious\". The FRC appealed the lower court decision to the Supreme Court, stating that the issue impacted 116 separate cases pending before it.\nA unanimous Supreme Court overturned the District Court, and ruled in FRC's favor, upholding the validity of the Davis Amendment provisions. WIBO made a final attempt to convince the FRC that the expression of strong ties to Indiana by WJKS was fraudulent, and WJKS's owners were really attempting to establish another Chicago station. This appeal was unsuccessful, and both WIBO and WPCC had to cease broadcasting. In 1934 the Davis Amendment provisions were carried over to the FCC, but they were repealed on June 5, 1936. In 1944 WJKS, after changing its call letters to WIND, moved from Gary to Chicago.\nReplacement by the Federal Communications Commission.\nThe Communications Act of 1934 abolished the Federal Radio Commission and transferred jurisdiction over radio licensing to the new Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Title III of the Communications Act contained provisions very similar to the Radio Act of 1927, and the FCC largely took over the operations and precedents of the FRC. The law also transferred jurisdiction over communications common carriers, such as telephone and telegraph companies, from the Interstate Commerce Commission to the FCC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She took station outside the bar.\nCapture of \"Princess Royal\" and Confederate counter-attack.\nOn 29 January 1863, her boats, aided by those of , , and USS \"America\", boarded and refloated the iron steamer . The gunboat had driven the blockade runner ashore as she attempted to slip into Charleston from England with a cargo consisting of two marine engines destined for Confederate ironclads and a large quantity of ordnance and ammunition. These imports were of such great potential value to the South that they have been called \"the war's most important single cargo of contraband.\"\nIt is possibly in the hope of recovering this invaluable prize that the Confederate ironclad rams and slipped out of the main ship channel of Charleston Harbor to attack the Union blockading fleet in the early morning fog two days later. They rammed , forcing her to strike her colors \"in a sinking and perfectly defenseless condition\", and moved on to cripple . Gunfire from the rams also damaged and before the Confederate ships withdrew under fire from \"Housatonic\" to the protection of shore batteries.\nCapture of \"Georgiana\".\nOn 19 March 1863, \"Housatonic\" and , responding to signal flares sent up by \"America\", chased the 407 ton iron-hulled blockade runner ashore on Long Island, South Carolina. \"Georgiana\"'s cargo of munitions, medicine and merchandise was then valued at over $1,000,000. \"Georgiana\" was described in contemporary dispatches and newspaper accounts as more powerful than the Confederate cruisers , , and . This was a serious and very important blow to the Confederacy. The wreck of \"Georgiana\" was discovered by pioneer underwater archaeologist Lee Spence in 1965.\nFurther captures, and attacks on Charleston.\n\"Housatonic\" captured the sloop \"Neptune\" on 19 April as she attempted to run out of Charleston with a cargo of cotton and turpentine. She was credited with assisting in the capture of the steamer \"Seesh\" on 15 May. Howitzers mounted in \"Housatonic\"'s boats joined in the attack on Fort Wagner on 10 July, which began the continuing bombardment of the Southern works at Charleston. In ensuing months her crew repeatedly deployed boats which shelled the shoreline, patrolled close ashore gathering valuable information, and landed troops for raids against the outer defenses of Charleston. On Sept 9th, 1863 Charles W. Pickering, Captain of the USS Housatonic, would submit a report to Rear Admiral Dahlgren concerning the men of his command who were involved in the attack on Fort Sumter of the evening prior. He would list men of the 4th cutter- Lieut Edwin T. Brower, commanding. Among the 17 men of Cutter Four was Frederic Augustus James - the report ends with \"All the above, with the boat, are missing.\"\nSunk in the first submarine attack.\nAt just before 9pm, 17 February 1864, \"Housatonic\", commanded by Charles Pickering, was maintaining her station in the blockade outside the bar. Robert F. Flemming Jr., a Black landsman, first sighted an object in the water 100 yards off, approaching the ship. \"It had the appearance of a plank moving in the water,\" Pickering later reported. Although the chain was slipped, the engine backed, and all hands were called to quarters, it was too late. Within two minutes of the first sighting, the Confederate submarine rammed her spar torpedo into \"Housatonic\"'s starboard side, forward of the mizzenmast, in history's first successful submarine attack on a warship. Before the rapidly sinking ship went down, the crew managed to lower two boats which took all the men they could hold; most others saved themselves by climbing into the rigging which remained above water after the stricken ship settled on the bottom. Two officers and three men in \"Housatonic\" died. The Confederate submarine escaped but was lost with all hands not long after this action; new evidence announced by archaeologists in 2013 indicates that the submarine may have been much closer to the point of detonation than previously realized, thus damaging the submarine as well. In 2017, researchers at Duke University further established through simulation that the Hunley's crew were most likely killed immediately at their posts by the blast's pressure wave damaging their lungs and brains.\nWreck.\nOn February 20, 1864, Capt. Joseph W. Green of the USS \"Canandaigua\" surveyed the wreck and observed that the ship's spar deck was about [ below the water and that the deck \"appears to have been entirely blown off.\" Soon thereafter, the Union began recovery efforts to raise the \"Housatonic\"'s guns, which was accomplished later in 1864. In 1872, the Army Corps of Engineers commissioned Benjamin Maillefert to clear some of the wrecks from the Charleston Harbor, including the \"Housatonic\". Throughout 1873 and 1874, Maillefert scavenged the wreck of any useful materials, and in 1909, the remnants of the ship (notably, its boilers) were further broken up to ensure the wreck was not a hazard. In 1995\u201396, NUMA-funded researchers tentatively located the wreck of the \"Housatonic\", and in 1999, the wreck was surveyed by researchers from the Submerged Resources Center, the Naval Historical Center, and SCIAA.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hunley, also known as the Hunley, CSS \"H. L. Hunley, or CSS \"Hunley, was a submarine of the Confederate States of America that fought in the American Civil War. \"Hunley\" demonstrated the advantages and dangers of undersea warfare. She was the first combat submarine to sink a warship (), although \"Hunley\" was not completely submerged and, following her attack, was lost along with her crew before she could return to base. Twenty-one crewmen died in the three sinkings of \"Hunley\" during her short career. She was named for her inventor, Horace Lawson Hunley, shortly after she was taken into government service under the control of the Confederate States Army at Charleston, South Carolina.\n\"Hunley\", nearly long, was built at Mobile, Alabama, and launched in July 1863. She was then shipped by rail on 12 August 1863 to Charleston. \"Hunley\" (then referred to as the \"fish boat\", the \"fish torpedo boat\", or the \"porpoise\") sank on 29 August 1863 during a test run, killing five members of her crew. She sank again on 15 October 1863, killing all eight of her second crew, including Horace Lawson Hunley himself, who was aboard at the time, even though he was not a member of the Confederate military. Both times \"Hunley\" was raised and returned to service.\nOn 17 February 1864, \"Hunley\" attacked and sank the 1,240-ton United States Navy screw sloop-of-war \"Housatonic\", which had been on Union blockade-duty in Charleston's outer harbor. \"Hunley\" did not survive the attack and sank, taking all eight members of her third crew with her, and was lost.\nFinally located in 1995, \"Hunley\" was raised in 2000 and is on display in North Charleston, South Carolina, at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center on the Cooper River. Examination in 2012 of recovered \"Hunley\" artifacts suggested that the submarine was as close as to her target, \"Housatonic\", when her deployed torpedo exploded, which caused the submarine's sinking.\nHistorical context.\nThe Civil War, April 12, 1861 \u2013 April 9, 1865, was a domestic American war where the Union (also called the North) was locked in combat with the Confederates (also called the South).\nIn the beginning of the war, combat was fought with bayonets, horses, wooden ships, and imprecise artillery.\u00a0During the course of the conflict the weaponry changed and mines, accurate guns, more deadly bullets, torpedoes, and \"ironclad\" ships became a new standard. Though most of the fighting occurred on land, a critical element of the war was at sea. Whichever side controlled the coastline also controlled shipping imports from Europe and Coastal America, which contained critical resources such as clothes, food, artillery, medicine, and, at times, reinforcements. The Hunley was created to destroy the Union blockade and help gain this all-important coastline advantage.\nPredecessors.\nHorace Lawson Hunley provided financing for James McClintock to design three submarines: in New Orleans, Louisiana, built in Mobile, and \"Hunley\".\nWhile the United States Navy was constructing its first submarine , in late 1861, the Confederacy was developing their own. Likely having within them an incessant loyalty to the Confederate states as well as understanding the financial gains that would come from sinking enemy ships, Hunley, McClintock, and Baxter Watson first built \"Pioneer.\" She was tested in February 1862 in the Mississippi River and was later towed to Lake Pontchartrain for additional trials. The Union advance towards New Orleans caused the men to abandon development, however, and \"Pioneer\" was scuttled the following month.\nMcClintock noted the significance that a boat capable of moving in any direction at any depth could be made, but ultimately decided that such a vessel could be improved. Hunley, Watson, and McClintock moved to Mobile to develop a second submarine, \"American Diver.\" They collaborated with Park &amp; Lyons machine shops owners, Thomas Park and Thomas Lyons, in the construction of the vessel. Their efforts were supported by the Confederate States Army. Lieutenant William Alexander of the 21st Alabama Infantry Regiment was assigned to oversee the project. The builders experimented with several methods of providing the new submarine with self-propulsion, including McClintock's electromagnetic drive, followed by a custom steam engine, but eventually settled on a simple hand-cranked propulsion system as they felt that the time and money lost in implementing such an engine would not be worth the trouble. \"American Diver\" was ready for harbor trials by January 1863, but she proved too slow to be practical. Nonetheless, it was decided to tow the submarine down the bay to Fort Morgan and attempt an attack on the Union blockade. However, the submarine foundered in the rough waters caused by foul weather and the currents at the mouth of Mobile Bay and sank. The crew escaped, but the boat was not recovered.\nConstruction and testing.\nConstruction of \"Hunley\" began soon after the loss of \"American Diver\". At this stage, \"Hunley\" was variously referred to as the \"fish boat\", the \"fish torpedo boat\", or the \"porpoise\". Legend held that \"Hunley\" was made from a cast-off steam boiler\u2014perhaps because a cutaway drawing by William Alexander, who had seen her, showed a short and stubby machine. In fact, \"Hunley\" was designed and built for her role, and the sleek, modern-looking craft shown in R.G. Skerrett's 1902 drawing is an accurate representation. Each end was equipped with ballast tanks that could be flooded by valves or pumped dry by hand pumps. Extra ballast was added using iron weights bolted to the underside of the hull. If the submarine needed additional buoyancy to rise in an emergency, the iron weight could be removed by unscrewing the heads of the bolts from inside the vessel.\nThe hull of the ship is estimated to originally have been 4 feet 3 inches (1.30) in diameter. The two hatches, accessible by means of conning tower, located in the forward and aft of the vessel, are estimated to have originally measured at 16.5 inches (42\u00a0cm) in width and 21 inches (53\u00a0cm) in length. The small sizing of the hatches and the cramped quarters made entering, exiting, and maneuvering about the ship remarkably difficult. Hunley was designed for a crew of eight, seven to turn the hand-cranked ducted propeller at about 3.5 horsepower (2.6\u00a0kW), and one to steer and direct the boat. At the height of her speed, \"Hunley\" could reach 4 knots [Wills, 2017].\nBy July 1863, \"Hunley\" was ready for a demonstration. Supervised by Confederate Admiral Franklin Buchanan, \"Hunley\" successfully attacked a coal flatboat in Mobile Bay. Following this, the submarine was shipped by rail to Charleston, South Carolina, on 12 August 1863. However, the Confederate military seized the submarine from her private builders and owners shortly after arriving, turning her over to the Confederate Army. \"Hunley\" would operate as a Confederate Army vessel from then on, although Horace Hunley and his partners would remain involved in her further testing and operation. While sometimes called CSS \"Hunley\", she was never officially commissioned into service.\nConfederate Navy Lieutenant John A. Payne of CSS \"Chicora\" volunteered to be \"Hunley\"'s captain, and seven men from \"Chicora\" and CSS \"Palmetto State\" volunteered to operate her. On 29 August 1863, \"Hunley\"'s new crew was preparing to make a test dive when Lieutenant Payne accidentally stepped on the lever controlling the sub's diving planes as she was running on the surface. This caused \"Hunley\" to dive with one of her hatches still open. Payne and two others escaped, but the other five crewmen drowned.\n\"H. L. Hunley\" crew lost 29 August 1863:\nThe Confederate Army took control of \"Hunley\", with all orders coming directly from General P. G. T. Beauregard, with Lt. George E. Dixon placed in charge. On 15 October 1863, \"Hunley\" failed to surface after a mock attack, killing all eight crewmen. Among these was Hunley himself, who had joined the crew for the exercise and possibly had taken over command from Dixon for the attack maneuver. The Confederate Navy once more salvaged the submarine and returned her to service.\n\"H. L. Hunley\" Crew lost 15 October 1863:\nArmament.\n\"Hunley\" was initially intended to attack by using a floating explosive charge with a contact fuse (a torpedo in 19th-century terminology). The Hunley's methodology of deploying the explosive charge consisted of them diving beneath the ship and catching the charge on the side/hull of the vessel and re-emerging outside of the blast range of the explosive. This plan was discredited and not used as the possibility of \"Hunley\" becoming entangled in the rope, the rope drifting away from the ship, or the charge exploding on the submarine was too great.\nInstead, a spar torpedo\u2014a copper cylinder containing of black powder\u2014was attached to a -long wooden spar, as seen in illustrations made at this time. Mounted on \"Hunley\"'s bow, the spar was to be used when the submarine was or more below the surface. Previous spar torpedoes had been designed with a barbed point: the spar torpedo would be jammed in the target's side by ramming and then detonated by a mechanical trigger attached to the submarine by a line so that as she backed away from her target, the torpedo would set off. However, archaeologists working on \"Hunley\" discovered evidence, including a spool of copper wire and components of a battery, that it may have been electrically detonated. In the configuration used in the attack on \"Housatonic\", it appears \"Hunley\"'s torpedo had no barbs and was designed to explode on contact as it was pushed against an enemy vessel at close range. After Horace Hunley's death, General Beauregard ordered that the submarine should no longer be used to attack underwater. An iron pipe was then attached to her bow, angled downwards so the explosive charge would be delivered sufficiently underwater to make it effective. This was the same method developed for the earlier \"David\" surface attack craft used successfully against the USS \"New Ironsides\". \"The Confederate Veteran\" of 1902 printed a reminiscence authored by an engineer stationed at Battery Marshall who, with another engineer, made adjustments to the iron pipe mechanism before \"Hunley\" left on her last fatal mission on 17 February 1864. A drawing of the iron pipe spar, confirming her \"David\" type configuration, was published in early histories of submarine warfare.\nAttack on \"Housatonic\".\n\"Hunley\" made her only attack against an enemy target on the night of 17 February 1864. The target was United States Navy ship, USS \"Housatonic\", a wooden-hulled steam-powered screw sloop-of-war with 12 large cannons, which was stationed at the entrance to Charleston, about offshore. \"Hunley\" happened to be on patrol around that area at the time. Helmed by Lieutenant George E. Dixon with a crew of seven and desperate to break the naval blockade of the city, H. L. Hunley successfully attacked \"Housatonic\", ramming \"Hunley's\" only spar torpedo against the enemy's hull. The torpedo was detonated, sending \"Housatonic\" to the bottom in three minutes, along with five of her crewmen. \"Hunley\" and her crew went missing after the attack. They would not be found for over 100 years.\nDisappearance.\nAfter the attack, \"H.L. Hunley\" failed to return to her base. At one point, there appeared to be evidence that \"Hunley\" survived as long as one hour following the attack, which occurred at about 20:45. The day after the attack, the commander of \"Battery Marshall\" reported that he had received \"the signals\" from the submarine indicating she was returning to her base. The report did not say what the signals were. A postwar correspondent wrote that \"two blue lights\" were the prearranged signals, and a lookout on \"Housatonic\" reported he saw a \"blue light\" on the water after his ship sank. \"Blue light\" in 1864 referred to a pyrotechnic signal in long use by the U.S. Navy. It has been falsely represented in published works as a blue lantern; the lantern eventually found on the recovered \"H. L. Hunley\" had a clear, not a blue, lens. Pyrotechnic \"blue light\" could be seen easily over the distance between Battery Marshall and the site of \"Hunley\"'s attack on \"Housatonic\".\nAfter signaling, Dixon's plan could have been to take his submarine underwater to make a return to Sullivan's Island, although he left no confirmed documentation of this plan. At one point, the finders of \"Hunley\" suggested she was unintentionally rammed by USS \"Canandaigua\" when that warship was going to rescue the crew of \"Housatonic\", but no such damage was found when she was raised from the bottom of the harbor. Instead, all evidence and analysis eventually pointed to the instantaneous death of \"Hunley\"'s entire crew at the moment of the spar torpedo's contact with the hull of \"Housatonic\". Upon removal of the silt inside the hull, the skeletons of the crewmembers were found seated at their stations with no signs of skeletal trauma. In October 2008, scientists reported they had found that the crew of \"Hunley\" had not set her pump to remove water from the crew's compartment, and this might indicate she was not flooded until after they died. In January 2013, it was announced that conservator Paul Mardikian had found evidence of a copper sleeve at the end of \"Hunley\"'s spar. This finding indicated the torpedo had been attached directly to the spar, meaning the submarine may have been less than from \"Housatonic\" when the torpedo exploded. In 2018, researchers reported that the keel blocks, which the crew could release from inside the vessel to allow the sub to surface quickly in an emergency, had never been released.\nThe short distance between the torpedo and the vessel, in addition to the signs that the crew died instantaneously and without a struggle to survive, led a team of blast trauma specialists from Duke University to theorize that the \"Hunley\"'s crew was killed by the blast itself, which could have transmitted pressure waves inside the vessel without damaging its hull. Their research, which included scaled experiments with live black powder bombs, provided data indicating the crew was likely killed by the explosion of their own torpedo, which could have caused immediate pulmonary blast trauma. The Duke team's experiments and results were published August 2017 in the peer-reviewed journal \"PLoS One\" and eventually became the subject of the book \"In the Waves: My Quest to Solve the Mystery of a Civil War Submarine\". Although their conclusions have been disputed by archaeologists with the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC), the NHCC website disputing the results of the scientific experiments contains several inconsistencies. For example, the website implies that the experiments are not valid because \"a 1/8th inch plate at 1/6th scale is only 0.02 inches thick,\" but neither of these dimensions is relevant to either the original \"Hunley\" or the scale model used by Duke.\nYears after \"Hunley\" went missing, when the area around the wreck of \"Housatonic\" was surveyed, the sunken \"Hunley\" was found on the seaward side of the sloop, where no one had considered looking before. This later indicated that the ocean current was going out following the attack on \"Housatonic\", taking \"Hunley\" with her to where she was eventually found and later recovered.\nRecovery of wreckage.\n\"Hunley\"'s discovery was described by William Dudley, Director of Naval History at the Naval Historical Center as \"probably the most important find of the century.\"\nThe discovery of \"Hunley\" has been claimed by two different individuals. Underwater archaeologist E. Lee Spence, president, Sea Research Society, reportedly discovered \"Hunley\" in 1970, and has a collection of evidence claiming to validate this, including a 1980 Civil Admiralty Case. The court took the position that the wreck was outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. Marshals Office, and no determination of ownership was made.\nOn 13 September 1976, the National Park Service submitted the Sea Research Society's (Spence's) location for \"H. L. Hunley\" for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Spence's location for \"Hunley\" became a matter of public record when \"H.L. Hunley\"'s placement on that list was officially approved on 29 December 1978. Spence's book \"Treasures of the Confederate Coast\", which had a chapter on his discovery of \"Hunley\" and included a map complete with an \"X\" showing the wreck's location, was published in January 1995.\nDiver Ralph Wilbanks located the wreck in April 1995 while leading a NUMA dive team originally organized by archaeologist Mark Newell and funded by novelist Clive Cussler, who announced the find as a new discovery and first claimed that the location was in about of water over inshore of \"Housatonic\", but later admitted to a reporter that that was false. The wreck was actually away from and on the \"seaward\" side of \"Housatonic\" in of water. The submarine was buried under several feet of silt, which had concealed and protected the vessel for over a hundred years. The divers exposed the forward hatch and the ventilator box (the air box for the attachment of her twin snorkels) to identify her. The submarine was resting on her starboard side, at about a 45-degree angle, and was covered in a thick encrustation of rust bonded with sand and seashell particles. Archaeologists exposed part of the ship's port side and uncovered the bow dive plane. More probing revealed an approximate length of , with the entire vessel preserved under the sediment.\nOn 14 September 1995, at the official request of Senator Glenn F. McConnell, Chairman, South Carolina \"Hunley\" Commission, E. Lee Spence, with South Carolina Attorney General Charles M. Condon signing, donated \"Hunley\" to the State of South Carolina. Shortly thereafter, NUMA disclosed to government officials Wilbank's location for the wreck which, when finally made public in October 2000, matched Spence's 1970s plot of the wreck's location well within standard mapping tolerances. Spence avows that he discovered \"Hunley\" in 1970, revisiting and mapping the site in 1971 and again in 1979, and that after he published the location in his 1995 book he expected NUMA to independently verify the wreck as \"Hunley\", not to claim that NUMA had discovered her. NUMA was actually part of a SCIAA expedition directed by Dr. Mark M. Newell and not Cussler. Dr. Newell swore under oath that he used Spence's maps to direct the joint SCIAA/NUMA expedition and credited Spence with the original discovery. Dr. Newell credits his expedition only with the official verification of \"Hunley\".\nThe \"in situ\" underwater archaeological investigation and excavation culminated with the raising of \"Hunley\" on 8 August 2000. A large team of professionals from the Naval Historical Center's Underwater Archaeology Branch, National Park Service, the South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology, and various other individuals investigated the vessel, measuring and documenting her before removal. Once the on-site investigation was complete, harnesses were slipped underneath the sub and attached to a truss designed by Oceaneering International. After the last harness had been secured, the crane from the recovery barge \"Karlissa B\" hoisted the submarine from the sea floor. She was raised from the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean, just over from Sullivan's Island outside the entrance to Charleston Harbor. Despite having used a sextant and hand-held compass thirty years earlier to plot the wreck's location, Dr. Spence's accuracy turned out to be well within the length of the recovery barge, which was long. On 8 August 2000, at 08:37, the sub broke the surface for the first time in more than 136 years, greeted by a cheering crowd on shore and in surrounding watercraft, including author Clive Cussler. Once safely on her transporting barge, \"Hunley\" was shipped back to Charleston. The removal operation concluded when the submarine was secured inside the Warren Lasch Conservation Center, at the former Charleston Navy Yard in North Charleston, in a specially designed tank of fresh water to await conservation until she could eventually be exposed to air.\nThe exploits of \"Hunley\" and her final recovery were the subject of an episode of the television series \"\", called \"Hunley: First Kill\". This program was based on a section (\"Part 6\") in Clive Cussler's 1996 non-fiction book of the same name (which was accepted by the Board of Governors of the Maritime College of the State University of New York in lieu of his Ph.D. thesis).\nIn 2001, Clive Cussler filed a lawsuit against E. Lee Spence for unfair competition, injurious falsehood, civil conspiracy, and defamation. Spence filed a countersuit against Cussler, in 2002, seeking damages, claiming that Cussler was engaging in unfair competition, tortious interference, and civil conspiracy by claiming Cussler had discovered the location of the wreck of \"Hunley\" in 1995 when she had already been discovered by Spence in 1970, and that such claims by Cussler were damaging to Spence's career, and had caused him damages over $100,000. Spence's lawsuit was dismissed through summary judgment in 2007, on the legal theory that, under the Lanham Act, regardless of whether Cussler's claims were factual or not, Cussler had been making them for over three years before Spence brought his suit against Cussler; thus the suit was not filed within the statute of limitations. Cussler dropped his suit a year later, after the judge agreed that Spence could introduce evidence in support of his discovery claims as a truth defense against Cussler's claims against him.\n\"Hunley\" may be viewed during tours at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center in Charleston. A replica is on display at the USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park, Mobile, Alabama, alongside the and the .\nCrew.\nThe crew was composed of \nApart from the submarine commander, Lieutenant George E. Dixon, the identities of the volunteer crewmen of \"Hunley\" had long remained a mystery. Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist working for the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, examined the remains and determined that four of the men were American born, while the four others were of European birth, based on the chemical signatures left on the men's teeth and bones by the predominant components of their diet. Four men had eaten plenty of corn, an American diet, while the remainder ate mostly wheat and rye, a mainly European diet. By examining Civil War records and conducting DNA testing with possible relatives, forensic genealogist Linda Abrams identified the remains of Dixon and the three other Americans: Frank G. Collins of Fredericksburg, Va., Joseph Ridgaway, and James A. Wicks. Identifying the European crewmen has been more problematic, but was apparently solved in late 2004. The position of the remains indicated that the men died at their stations and were not trying to escape from the sinking submarine.\nOn 17 April 2004, the remains of the crew were laid to rest at Magnolia Cemetery, in Charleston. Tens of thousands of people attended including some 6,000 reenactors and 4,000 civilians wearing period clothing. Color guards from all five branches of the U.S. armed forces\u2014wearing modern uniforms\u2014were also in the procession. Even though only two of the crew were from the Confederate States, all were buried with full Confederate honors, including being buried with the 2nd Confederate national flag, known as the Stainless Banner.\nAnother surprise occurred in 2002, when lead researcher Maria Jacobsen, examining the area close to Lieutenant Dixon, found a misshapen $20 gold piece, minted in 1860, with the inscription \"Shiloh April 6, 1862, My life Preserver G. E. D.\" on a sanded-smooth area of the coin's reverse side, and a forensic anthropologist found a healed injury to Lt. Dixon's hip bone. The findings matched a family legend that Dixon's sweetheart, Queenie Bennett, had given him the coin to protect him. However, the supposed relationship between Bennett and Dixon has not been supported by archaeological investigations of the legend. Dixon had the coin with him at the Battle of Shiloh, where he was wounded in the thigh on 6 April 1862. The bullet struck the coin in his pocket, saving his leg and possibly his life. He had the gold coin engraved and carried it as a lucky charm.\nAdam Jon Kronegh of the Danish National Archive identified the J.F. Carlsen of \"Hunley\". Johan Frederik Carlsen was born in \u00c6r\u00f8sk\u00f8bing 9 April 1841. The last year he was registered in the census of \u00c6r\u00f8sk\u00f8bing was 1860, when he was registered as a \"sailor\". His father was registered as a cobbler, and the teeth of Carlsen's remains in \"Hunley\" still bear significant marks of a so-called \"tailor's notch\", probably from helping his father with needle and thread from childhood. In 1861, J.F. Carlsen entered the freight ship \"Grethe\" of Drag\u00f8r. The ship landed in Charleston in February 1861, where records in the Danish military archives show that Carlsen deserted the ship. In June 1861, he entered \"Jefferson Davis\" (the Confederate privateer brig originally named \"Putnam\") as a mate.\nTours.\nThe \"Hunley\" is on display at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center.

His books, which include such best sellers as \"Hotel\" (1965), \"Airport\" (1968), \"Wheels\" (1971), \"The Moneychangers\" (1975), and \"Overload\" (1979), have sold 170 million copies in 38 languages.\nEarly life.\nArthur Frederick Hailey was born on 5 April 1920, in Luton, Bedfordshire, England, the only child of George Wellington Hailey, a factory worker, and Elsie Wright Hailey. An avid reader, Hailey began to write poems, plays and stories at a young age. He once said, \"My mother left me off chores so I could write.\" Elsie encouraged her son to learn typing and shorthand so that he might become a clerk instead of a factory worker.\nAt fourteen, Hailey failed to win a scholarship which would have enabled him to continue his schooling. From 1934 to 1939 he was an office boy and clerk in London. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1939, and served as a pilot during World War II, eventually rising to the rank of flight lieutenant. In 1947, unhappy with the post-war Labour government, he emigrated to Canada, becoming a dual citizen. Settling in Toronto, he held a variety of jobs in such fields as real estate, sales, and advertising. He was editor of a trade magazine called \"Bus and Truck Transport\". During these years, he continued to write.\nCareer.\nHailey's professional writing career began in 1955 with a script called \"Flight into Danger\", which was purchased by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and telecast on 3 April 1956. This story of a plane flight in jeopardy after its crew is incapacitated was \"the smash hit of the season,\" won enormous acclaim, and was broadcast internationally. It was adapted as a novel by \"John Castle\" (a pseudonym for Ronald Payne and John Garrod), with Hailey credited as co-author; it was published by Britain's Souvenir Press in 1958 under its original title, but renamed \"Runway Zero-Eight\" (Doubleday) for its 1959 American publication. The story was filmed in 1957 as \"Zero Hour!\" (Paramount), and for television in 1971 as \"Terror in the Sky\".\nWith the success of \"Flight into Danger\", Hailey was in demand as a television writer, and wrote for such shows as \"Studio One\", \"Kraft Television Theatre\", \"Playhouse 90\", and \"Suspense\". In 1959, he adapted his teleplay \"No Deadly Medicine\" (for which he received an Emmy nomination) into his first novel \"The Final Diagnosis.\" Published by Doubleday, it is the story of the chief pathologist at a Burlington, Pennsylvania, hospital. The book received good reviews, and was a selection of the Literary Guild of America.\nHailey's second novel, \"In High Places\" (Doubleday) was published in 1962. Dealing with international politics the book was again selected by the Literary Guild, and was a best seller in Canada.\nHailey's commercial breakthrough came in 1965 with publication of \"Hotel\" (Doubleday), which followed five days in the lives of employees and residents of New Orleans' luxurious St. Gregory Hotel. The book spent 48 weeks on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list, peaking at No. 3, and became the eighth highest-selling novel of the year. It established the template for Hailey's future works: ordinary people involved in extraordinary situations in a business or industry which is described in meticulous detail.\nFollowing the success of \"Hotel\", Hailey moved to California. In 1968 he achieved international fame with his fourth novel, \"Airport\" (Doubleday), the story of one eventful night at a midwestern international airport. The novel was No. 1 in the \"New York Times\" for 30 weeks, and became the top-selling novel of the year. The film adaptation, released in 1970, was the second-highest-grossing film of the year (second only to \"Love Story\") and received ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. The success of the film, together with that of 1972's \"The Poseidon Adventure\", led to the proliferation of \"disaster films\" during the 1970s, which included three additional films in what became the \"Airport\" franchise.\nAfter the financial success of \"Airport\", on the advice of his tax attorney, Hailey moved as a tax exile to the Bahamas settling in Lyford Cay on New Providence Island. He had intended to stay for just two years, but liked it so much that he remained there for the rest of his life. In 1971, he published \"Wheels\" (Doubleday), set in the automobile industry; like \"Airport\", it was a no. 1 \"New York Times\" best seller, and the highest-selling novel of its year. Hailey followed it with two additional no. 1 sellers: \"The Moneychangers\" (Doubleday, 1975), about the banking industry; and \"Overload\" (Doubleday, 1979), about an electric utility company.\nIn 1979, following publication of \"Overload\", Hailey announced his retirement. After undergoing quadruple heart bypass surgery, however, he felt rejuvenated, and returned to work. His novel \"Strong Medicine\" (Doubleday), about the pharmaceutical industry, was published in 1984 and was another major best seller; it became the thirteenth highest-selling novel of the year. His commercial success had declined somewhat by 1990 with publication of \"The Evening News\" (Doubleday), and with his final novel, \"Detective\" (Crown), which appeared in 1997. Hailey continued to write, but\u2014except for the slim \"The Lyford Legacy: A Brief History of Lyford Cay from 1788\" (Lyford Cay Foundation, 2000),\u2014Hailey now wrote only as a hobby.\nArthur Hailey's papers are housed at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto, and at the Harry C. Moore Library of the College of The Bahamas.\nWriting method and critical reception.\nHailey would usually spend three years on each book. First, he would dedicate a year to research, then six months reviewing his notes, and finally 18 months writing. His research was painstaking: he read 27 books about the hotel industry for \"Hotel\", he spent months at a Detroit car plant for \"Wheels\", and he spent time\u2014at the age of 67\u2014with rebel guerillas in the jungles of Peru for \"The Evening News\". Hailey had no discernible literary pretensions; he said, \"I'm a storyteller and anything else is incidental.\"\nHailey was not a critical favourite. In the \"New York Times\", Martin Levin called him \"a plodding sort of writer.\" Martha Gellhorn, reviewing \"The Evening News\" for \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote, \"This is not a book you cannot put down; it is a book you can hardly hold up. It will sell in millions and be translated into 34 languages. Possibly it is more readable in Icelandic or Urdu.\" And \"Time\" magazine, reviewing \"Wheels\" together with Harold Robbins's \"The Betsy\", said, \"Yes, junk fans, it is a mano a mano for novelists who are all thumbs. Two of the greatest schlockmeisters in the history of solid waste have just published novels about the auto industry.\"\nBut Hailey's ability to tell a story was recognised by some critics. In the \"New York Times\", John Reed conceded, in a review of \"Wheels\", that \"Mr. Hailey is nothing if not a competent craftsman.\" Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, in his \"New York Times\" review of \"The Moneychangers\" wrote, \"What I had in mind was diversion, and, to tell the shameful truth, I found it.\" Reviewing \"Detective\", \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote, \"Old pro Hailey... remains adept at hooking readers with his propulsive brand of storytelling.\"\nPersonal life.\nHailey was married twice. In 1944 he married Joan Fishwick (1918\u20132004), with whom he had three children before divorcing in 1950. In 1951 he married Sheila Dunlop (1927\u20132017), with whom he also had three children. In 1978 Sheila Hailey published \"I Married a Best Seller: My Life with Arthur Hailey\" (Doubleday), which was not always complimentary, but the couple remained together for 53 years.\nArthur Hailey died at age 84 in his sleep on 24 November 2004, at his home in Lyford Cay in the Bahamas, of what doctors believed to be a stroke.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Pictures. It was produced by Hal B. Wallis and Henry Blanke, directed by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, and written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller.\nIt stars Errol Flynn as the legendary Saxon knight Robin Hood, who in Richard I's absence in the Holy Land during the Crusades, fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla band against Prince John and the Norman lords oppressing the Saxon commoners. The cast also includes Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains, Patric Knowles, Eugene Pallette, and Alan Hale.\nUpon its premiere on May 14, 1938, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was very well received by critics. The film was a commercial success; it grossed around $4 million at the box office, making it one of the highest grossers of 1938.\nAt the 11th Academy Awards, it received four nominations, winning three\u2014Best Art Direction (Carl Jules Weyl), Best Film Editing (Ralph Dawson) and Best Original Score (Erich Wolfgang Korngold). In 1995, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation by the National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nRichard, the Norman King of England, is taken captive in 1191 by Duke Leopold while returning from the Third Crusade. Richard's treacherous brother Prince John, aided by fellow Norman Sir Guy of Gisbourne, names himself regent of England, increasing the Saxons' taxes under the pretense of gathering a ransom for Richard.\nThe Normans exploit and oppress the Saxons. Sir Robin of Locksley, a Saxon noble, opposes the brutality and rescues Much the Miller's Son from being executed for poaching, earning Gisbourne's ire. Robin later confronts Prince John at a Nottingham Castle banquet, telling the assembled guests that he regards John's declaring himself regent as treason. John orders Robin's execution, but he escapes and flees with Much and Will Scarlet into Sherwood Forest. John seizes Robin's lands and names him outlaw.\nMuch is sent to recruit men to join their band. Robin and Will encounter John the Little on a log bridge, and after a quarterstaff contest, welcome him into their ranks. Dozens more men join Robin's band, swearing an oath to despoil the rich while aiding the poor, to fight injustice, and to show courtesy to all oppressed. They start a war against John and Gisbourne, dispatching those who abuse their power.\nRobin's band encounters the rotund Friar Tuck, a renowned swordsman. Tuck joins the band and assists in capturing a company of Normans transporting a shipment of gathered taxes. In the company are Gisbourne, the cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham, and King Richard's ward Lady Marian. After their capture, the men are humiliated at a celebratory woodland banquet, with Marian given a seat of honor. Initially scornful, she comes to share Robin's views after he shows her examples of Norman brutality against the Saxons. Robin sends the convoy back to Nottingham Castle, telling them that they have Marian's presence to thank for their lives being spared.\nHaving noted Robin's focus on Marian during the Sherwood banquet, the sheriff suggests hosting an archery tournament, with the Lady Marian presenting a golden arrow as the prize to entrap Robin. Robin enters the tournament, is recognized by his archery skill, and is captured and sentenced to be hanged. Marian aids Robin's Men in a scheme to save him. After his daring escape, he scales the palace walls to thank her, and the two pledge their love for one another. Marian declines Robin's marriage proposal, electing to instead remain in the castle as a spy.\nKing Richard returns with several of his knights. The Bishop of the Black Canons sees through Richard's disguise and alerts John. John sends disgraced former knight Dickon Malbete to kill Richard, promising Dickon Robin's title and lands. Marian overhears and writes to Robin, but is found out by Gisbourne and sentenced to death. Her nursemaid, Bess, tells Much everything. He intercepts Dickon and kills him after a fight.\nRichard and his men, disguised as Norman monks, travel through Sherwood and are stopped by Robin. Assuring Robin they are on the king's business, Richard accepts Robin's offer of hospitality and his condemnation of the Holy Crusade, but does not reveal his identity.\nMuch relays Bess' news. Robin orders his men to find and protect Richard; now certain of Robin's loyalty, Richard reveals himself. Robin coerces the Bishop of the Black Canons to allow them to join his monks in disguise so they can enter Nottingham Castle. Once inside, Richard announces his presence, and a huge melee erupts. Robin kills Gisbourne after a lengthy duel, frees Marian, and prompts John's men to surrender.\nReturned to his throne, Richard banishes John, the Sheriff, and the Bishop from England \"for the remainder of my lifetime.\" He restores Robin's rank, raising him to Baron of Locksley and Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham. The king also pardons Robin's men, and commands Robin to take the hand of the Lady Marian in marriage. As Robin exits the castle with her, he responds \"May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire.\"\nCast.\nUncredited:\nProduction.\n\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was produced at an estimated cost of $2 million, the most expensive film Warner Bros. had made up to that time. It was also the studio's second film using the three-strip Technicolor process. The film was, in fact, planned to be shot in black and white for most of its development; the switch to Technicolor happened just three months before production started. It was an unusually extravagant production for the Warner Bros. studio, which was known in the 1930s for socially conscious crime films.\nProducer Hal B. Wallis is generally supposed to have been the film's creative helmsman. The first draft of the script was written by Rowland Lee, but Wallis objected to its heavily archaic and fanciful dialogue (one line he cited was \"Oh my lord, tarry not too long, for I fear that in her remorse she may fling herself from the window. Some harm may befall her, I know.\"). At Wallis's insistence, the script was heavily rewritten to modernize the dialogue, and whether any of Lee's work survives in the completed film is unclear.\nThe scene in which Robin Hood first meets Prince John, Guy of Gisbourne, and Maid Marian went through several iterations. Initially, the scene was to be at a jousting tournament with Robin tilting against Guy of Gisbourne, mimicking the 1922 Douglas Fairbanks production of \"Robin Hood\", but screenwriter Norman Reilly Raine pointed out that a banquet scene would be much less expensive to produce, and so long as Technicolor was employed would look just as lavish to the average moviegoer. In another draft, instead of a deer, a slain villager was who Robin Hood brought in and dumped on Prince John's table. Wallis felt the use of a dead villager expended all the tension of the scene in \"a momentary kick\" and preferred the use of a deer from an earlier draft, which allowed the tension to simmer with the threat of an explosion at any moment. During the brawl where Robin escapes from the banquet hall, Basil Rathbone was trampled by an extra whose spear cut his foot badly, requiring eight stitches to close the wound.\nJames Cagney was originally cast as Robin Hood but walked out on his Warner Bros. contract, paving the way for the role to go to Errol Flynn. The filming was postponed three years as a result. Though Olivia de Havilland was an early frontrunner for the role of Maid Marian, for a time the studio vacillated between Anita Louise and her for the part. De Havilland was ultimately chosen because the success of \"Captain Blood\" established the pairing of Flynn and de Havilland as a safe bet to help ensure box-office success.\nLocation work for \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" included Bidwell Park in Chico, California, which substituted for Sherwood Forest, although one major scene was filmed at the California locations \"Lake Sherwood\" and \"Sherwood Forest\", so named because they were the location sites for the Fairbanks production of \"Robin Hood\". Several scenes were shot at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios and the Warner Ranch in Calabasas. The archery tournament was filmed at the former Busch Gardens, now part of Lower Arroyo Park, in Pasadena.\nScenes which were filmed but not included in the final cut include the disguised King Richard brawling with Friar Tuck, and Robin riding off with Maid Marian; the latter would have been the concluding scene of the film and appears in the theatrical trailer despite not appearing in the film itself.\nStunts.\nAll the arrows in the film were shot by professional archer Howard Hill. Those actors shot with arrows wore clothing padded with balsa wood on protective metal plates that prevented injury, though impact was fairly painful and the arrows lodged into the balsa wood to create the illusion of bodily penetration. Although listed as the archer captain defeated by Robin, Hill was cast as Elwyn the Welshman, an archer seen shooting at Robin in his escape from Nottingham Castle and later defeated by Robin at the archery tournament. To win, Robin splits the arrow of Philip of Arras, a captain of the guard under Gisbourne, who had struck the bullseye. Hill did in fact split one arrow with another during filming (albeit while firing from a much closer range than that from which Robin Hood is portrayed as shooting). However, the resulting footage did not look good enough on film, so the shot was redone with some effects trickery. Stuntman Buster Wiles, a close friend of Errol Flynn's and his frequent on-set stand-in, maintained that the arrow-splitting stunt was carried out using an extra-large arrow (for the target) and that the second arrow had a wide, flat arrowhead and was fired along a wire. This wire is briefly visible attached to the fletching of the arrow in the final film. Wiles discusses the scene in his autobiography, \"My Days with Errol Flynn\".\nFlynn performed most of his own stunts in the film; exceptions include Robin jumping onto a horse with hands tied behind his back during the hanging scene, scaling the fortress gate and coming down the other side, and a few select shots in the duel between Robin and Guy of Gisbourne.\nMusic score.\nIn 1938, Erich Wolfgang Korngold was conducting opera in Austria when he was asked by Warner Bros. to return to Hollywood and compose a score for \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\". Music historian Laurence E. MacDonald notes that many factors made the film a success, including its cast, its Technicolor photography, and fast-paced direction by Michael Curtiz, but \"most of all, there is Korngold's glorious music\". Also, film historian Rudy Behlmer describes Korngold's contribution to this and his other films:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Korngold's score was a splendid added dimension. His style for the Flynn swashbucklers resembled that of the creators of late 19th-century and early 20th-century German symphonic tone poems. It incorporated chromatic harmonies, lush instrumental effects, passionate climaxes\u2014all performed in a generally romantic manner. Korngold's original and distinctive style was influenced by the Wagnerian \"leitmotif\", the orchestral virtuosity of Richard Strauss, the delicacy and broad melodic sweep of Puccini, and the long-line development of Gustav Mahler.\nIn reply to Warner Bros.\u2019 request, Korngold told studio head of production Hal B. Wallis that he was a composer of drama and the heart and felt little connection to what he perceived as \"a 90% action picture.\" Wallis was persistent, and Korngold finally agreed to begin composing on the condition that he not have a contract and work on a week-by-week basis so that he could withdraw if he were dissatisfied with the music he composed. However, Korngold later admitted that the real reason he changed his mind was Adolf Hitler's November 1937 meeting with Austrian ministers, which convinced Korngold that the situation was no longer safe in his home country. As Korngold feared, Austria was annexed by the Nazis, and his home in Vienna was confiscated. This meant that all Jews in Austria were then at risk, so Korngold stayed in the USA until the end of World War II.\nKorngold called his film scores \"Opern ohne Singen\", operas without singing, but otherwise approached their composition just as he would for the operatic stage. \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was, therefore, a large-scale symphonic work, and despite the studio music department's providing a team of orchestrators, including future Oscar-winner Hugo Friedhofer, to assist Korngold, the amount of work was immense, especially for the limited time he was given to compose. Erich described this dilemma to his father Julius Korngold, one of Vienna's foremost music critics, and the elder Korngold suggested that themes from his 1920 symphonic overture \"Sursum Corda\" (\"Lift Up Your Hearts\") would serve splendidly for much of the most demanding action-scene music, and Erich agreed.\nIt also won for Korngold his second Academy Award for Best Original Score and established the symphonic style that was later used in action films during Hollywood's Golden Age. Modern-day epics such as the \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\" trilogies similarly included original symphonic scores. Composer John Williams has cited Korngold as his inspiration in scoring the \"Star Wars\" series. The love theme of Robin and Marian went on to become a celebrated concert piece.\nReception.\nContemporary reviews were highly positive. \"A richly produced, bravely bedecked, romantic and colorful show, it leaps boldly to the forefront of this year's best\", wrote Frank S. Nugent of \"The New York Times.\" The movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall. \"It is cinematic pageantry at its best\", raved \"Variety\". \"A highly imaginative retelling of folklore in all the hues of Technicolor, deserving handsome box office returns\". \"Film Daily\" called it \"high class entertainment\" with \"excellent direction\" and an \"ideal choice\" in the casting of Flynn. \"Excellent entertainment!\" wrote \"Harrison's Reports\". \"Adventure, romance, comedy, and human appeal have been skilfully blended to give satisfaction on all counts ... The duel in the closing scenes between the hero and his arch enemy is the most exciting ever filmed\". John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" called it \"a rich, showy, and, for all its tussles, somewhat stolid affair\", praising Flynn's performance and the action sequences but finding the \"excellent collection\" of supporting actors to be \"somewhat buried under the medieval panoply\". \nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of critics gave the film a positive rating based on 51 reviews, with an average score of 9.00/10. The film is 13th on their list of the 100 best classic films. Rotten Tomatoes summarizes the critical consensus as, \"Errol Flynn thrills as the legendary title character, and the film embodies the type of imaginative family adventure tailor-made for the silver screen\". Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 97 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating .\nBox office.\n\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" became the sixth-highest-grossing film of the year, with just over $4 million in revenues at a time when the average ticket price was less than 25 cents.\nAccording to Warner Bros records, the film earned $1,928,000 domestically and $2,053,000 overseas.\nIn 1938, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was the eighth-highest-grossing film nationally in the U.S., and the highest-grossing film the same year in the southern states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas.\nWarner Bros. was so pleased with the results that the studio cast Flynn in two more color epics before the end of the decade: \"Dodge City\" and \"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex\".\nA sequel, \"Sir Robin of Locksley,\" was announced, but never developed.\nAwards and nominations.\nOther honors:\nLegacy.\nThe film's popularity inextricably linked Errol Flynn's name and image with that of Robin Hood in the public eye, even more so than those of Douglas Fairbanks, who had played the role in 1922. The film became a benchmark for later movie adaptations of Robin Hood.\nThis was the third film to pair Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (after \"Captain Blood\" and \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\"). They would ultimately star together in nine films, the aforementioned and \"Four's a Crowd\" (1938), \"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex\" (1939), \"Dodge City\" (1939), \"Santa Fe Trail\" (1940), \"They Died with Their Boots On\" (1941) and \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" (1943), although they shared no scenes in the last film.\nScenes and costumes worn by the characters have been imitated and spoofed endlessly. For instance, in the 1949 Bugs Bunny animated short film, \"Rabbit Hood\", Bugs is continually told by a dim-witted Little John, \"Don't you worry, never fear; Robin Hood will soon be here.\" When Bugs finally meets Robin at the end of the film, he is stunned to find that it is Errol Flynn, in a spliced-in clip from this film (he subsequently shakes his head and declares, \"It \"couldn't\" be him!\"). Other parodies were Daffy Duck and Porky Pig in \"Robin Hood Daffy\" (1958) and Goofy and Black Pete in \"Goof Troop\" episode \"Goofin' Hood &amp; His Melancholy Men\" (1992).\nThe cat-and-mouse cartoon duo Tom and Jerry have twice taken on the Robin Hood legend, first in the 1958 short \"Robin Hoodwinked\", which implies heavily that its events take place during the Flynn movie, and again in the 2012 animated feature \"Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse\".\n\"The Court Jester\", a musical comedy starring Danny Kaye, is in great measure a spoof of Robin Hood. Basil Rathbone even appears as the villain and has a climactic sword fight with Kaye.\nIn 1982, comedian and impressionist Rich Little played all the major roles in the aptly-titled television special \"Rich Little's Robin Hood\", portraying Groucho Marx as Robin, Carol Channing as Marian, Humphrey Bogart as Prince John, John Wayne as Little John, and many others. Many features of the Flynn film were lampooned, including the stairway sword fight between Robin and Sir Guy (Little imitating Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau). When the pair execute a maneuver twice, Robin asks, \"Didn't we do this just now?\" to which Guy replies, \"Yes, but we did not get it right!\"\n\"The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood\", a 1984 telefilm starring George Segal as the outlaw and Morgan Fairchild as Maid Marian, borrows heavily from the Flynn film and spoofs many sequences including the banquet which Robin Hood crashes... disguised as a woman. In one scene, a villager mistakes Robin for Ivanhoe. When Robin tells her, \"I'm Robin Hood,\" one of the Sheriff's soldiers mutters to himself, \"I thought Errol Flynn was Robin Hood.\" The looks of many of the characters closely match the originals, primarily the villainous triumvirate of Roddy McDowall as Prince John, Tom Baker as Sir Guy, and Neil Hallett as the Sheriff.\nMost of the 1993 Mel Brooks parody ' relied on this film for its aesthetics, although the plot was almost completely a riff on ', as well as referencing the 1973 Disney version. Mel Brooks also spoofed the Robin Hood legend in his 1975 television series \"When Things Were Rotten\".\nActor Matthew Poretta, who played Will Scarlet in Brooks's film, went on to play Robin himself in the first two seasons of the television series \"The New Adventures of Robin Hood\", one episode of which featured Robin and his team visiting a Robin Hood festival. One of the contestants in a Robin Hood lookalike contest was dressed to look like Flynn, prompting Robin to wonder just who the contestant was supposed to be.\nA fragment of one of the film's sword fighting scenes was converted to sprites by Jordan Mechner and used for his 1989 platform game \"Prince of Persia\".\nErrol Flynn's acrobatic swordplay became a crucial touchstone for the light-saber duels choreography in \"Star Wars\" movies.\nIn Disney\u2019s 2010 animated film \"Tangled\", the appearance and personality of Flynn Rider are partly inspired by that of Errol Flynn, with his surname also being used in homage.\nIn 2025, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" listed \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" as having the best stunts of 1938.\nComic and storybook adaptations.\n\"Knockout Comic\" (weekly picture paper, Amalgamated Press, London) No 434, June 21, 1947 \u2013 No 447, September 20, 1947, 14 issues, 28pp in black-and-white and drawn by Michael Hubbard) Produced when the film was first revived after World War II, with several deviations made from the film's plot, the comic strip's storyline is generally faithful to the look and narrative of the Warner Bros.' film. However, the famous climactic duel between Robin and Sir Guy is reduced to a couple of strip panels, with Robin remaining dressed in his earlier monk's habit. The strip opens with a joust between Robin and Sir Guy, a scene which was in the original screenplay, but was never actually filmed.\nLondon's Ward, Lock &amp; Co. published a thick children's book entitled \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" to coincide with the film's opening. Although no year is given it must have appeared early in 1938 since Warner's publicity department used the hand-tinted pictures found in the book\u2014whose costume colors are often different from those in the film\u2014for Sunday supplements in newspapers. With very few differences, the storyline hews closely to that of the screenplay, even inserting the fight between Friar Tuck and the disguised King Richard deleted from the final print. 16 color plates and well over 100 black and white stills, all taken from the movie, are scattered throughout the text.\nAnother, thinner but taller, hardbound edition came out without a date but in what must have been 1955. This is deduced from its dust-jacket, the rear fold-over of which contains an advertisement for Ward, Lock's storybook version of \"Rogues of Sherwood Forest\", a film which appeared in 1955. In this volume only 8 color plates appeared but all the black and white photos are reprinted and the text is identical to the first version. Yet another edition,similar to the second was produced, again, without a year and also sans dust jacket, the picture from the dust-jacket being printed in color directly onto the book's hard cover.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Despite its title, the song is a march as opposed to a rag and contains little syncopation. The song is a narrative sequel to Berlin's earlier 1910 composition \"Alexander and His Clarinet\". This earlier composition recounts the reconciliation between an African-American musician named Alexander Adams and his flame Eliza Johnson as well as highlights Alexander's innovative musical style. Berlin's friend Jack Alexander, a cornet-playing African-American bandleader, inspired the title character.\nEmma Carus, a famous contralto renowned for her high lung power, introduced Berlin's song to the public in Spring 1911. Carus' brassy performance of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" at the American Music Hall in Chicago on April 18, 1911, electrified the audience, and she toured other metropolises such as Detroit and New York City with acclaimed performances that featured the catchy tune. Carus' tour showcased the song in the United States and contributed to its immense popularity.\nAmid the success of Carus' national tour, the comedic duo of Arthur Collins and Byron G. Harlan released a phonograph recording of the song on May 23, 1911, which became the best-selling record in the United States for ten consecutive weeks. Soon after, Berlin's jaunty melody \"sold a million copies of sheet music in 1911, then another million in 1912, and continued to sell for years afterwards,\" and it became \"the number one song from October 1911 through January 1912.\" Although not a traditional ragtime song, Berlin's composition kickstarted a ragtime jubilee\u2014a belated celebration of the music which African-Americans had originated a decade prior in the 1890s. The positive international reception of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" led to a musical and dance revival known as \"the ragtime craze\".\nNearly two decades later, singer Bessie Smith recorded a 1927 cover which became one of the hit songs of that year. The song's popularity re-surged in 1934 with the release of a close harmony cover by the Boswell Sisters, and a 1938 musical film of the same name starring Tyrone Power and Alice Faye. A variety of artists covered the song such as Al Jolson, Billy Murray, Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, and others. The song had at least a dozen hit covers within fifty years of its release. \nHistory.\nComposition and difficulties.\nIn March 1911, the Ted Snyder Company in New York City employed the 23-year-old Irving Berlin as a Tin Pan Alley songwriter. One morning after arriving at work, Berlin decided to compose an instrumental ragtime number. By this time, the ragtime phenomenon popularized by pianist Scott Joplin and other African-American musicians had begun to wane, and over a decade had passed since the syncopated genre's initial heyday in the Gay Nineties.\nA tireless workaholic, Berlin composed the piece while in the noisy offices of Ted Snyder's music publishing firm where \"five or six pianos and as many vocalists were making bedlam with songs of the day.\" Berlin composed the lyrics of the song as a narrative sequel to his earlier 1910 composition \"Alexander and His Clarinet\". This earlier composition recounts the reconciliation between an African-American musician named Alexander Adams and his flame Eliza Johnson as well as highlights Alexander's innovative musical style. Berlin's friend Jack Alexander, a cornet-playing African-American bandleader, inspired the title character.\nBy the next day, Berlin completed four pages of notes for the copyist-arranger. Berlin registered the song in the name of the Ted Snyder Company as E252990 and published it on March 18, 1911. Upon playing the composition for others, listeners criticized the song as too lengthy (\"running beyond the conventional 32 bars\"), too rangy, and not \"a real ragtime number\". In fact, the tune is a march as opposed to a rag and barely contains a trace of syncopation. Its sole notability consists of quotes from \"Swanee River\" and a bugle call. Due to such criticisms, the tune unimpressed listeners at the Ted Snyder Company.\nUndaunted by the lackluster response, Berlin submitted the song to Jesse L. Lasky, a Broadway theater producer planning an extravagant debut for his nightclub theater called the Follies Berg\u00e8re. Lasky hesitated to incorporate the pseudo-ragtime number into his show. When the show opened on April 27, 1911, Lasky chose only to use its melody whistled by performer Otis Harlan. Thus the song failed to find an appreciative audience.\nFortunately for Berlin, vaudeville singer and baritone Emma Carus liked his humorous composition, and she introduced the song on April 18, 1911, at the American Music Hall in Chicago. She next embarked on a tour of the Midwest in Spring 1911. Consequently, music historians credit Carus for showcasing the song to the country and helping contribute to its immense popularity. In gratitude, Berlin credited Carus on the cover of the sheet music. The catchy song became indelibly linked with Carus in the public consciousness, although rival performers such as Al Jolson later co-opted the hit tune.\nAmid the success of Carus' national tour, the comedic duo of Arthur Collins and Byron G. Harlan released a phonograph recording of the song on May 23, 1911, which became the best-selling record in the United States for ten consecutive weeks. Five days later, Berlin performed the song himself on May 28, 1911, in a special charity performance of the first \"Friars Frolic\" by the New York Friars Club at the New Amsterdam Theater. A fellow composer in attendance, George M. Cohan, instantly recognized the catchiness of the tune and told Berlin that the song would be an obvious hit. Soon after, Berlin's jaunty melody \"sold a million copies of sheet music in 1911, then another million in 1912, and continued to sell for years afterwards.\" \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" became \"the number one song from October 1911 through January 1912.\"\nCultural sensation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA Meritorious Addition\n\"In a few days, 'Alexander's Ragtime Band' will be whistled on the streets and played in the caf\u00e9s. It is the most addition to the list of popular songs introduced this season. The vivacious comedienne [Emma Carus] had her audience singing the choruses with her, and those who did not sing, whistled.\"\n \u2014\"The New York Sun\", May 1911\nAlthough neither Irving Berlin's first commercial hit nor his first composition to attract international attention, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" nevertheless catapulted Berlin's career. American newspapers hailed Berlin's jumpy tune as the decade's musical sensation, and he became a cultural luminary over night. An adoring international press subsequently touted him as the \"King of Ragtime\", an inaccurate title as the song \"had little to do with ragtime and everything to do with ragtime audacity, alerting Europe to hot times in the colonies.\" Baffled by this new title, Berlin publicly insisted that he did not originate ragtime but merely \"crystallized it and brought it to people's attention.\" Historian Mark Sullivan later claimed that, with the auspicious debut of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\", Berlin abruptly \"lifted ragtime from the depths of sordid dives to the of fashionable vogue.\"\nAlthough not a traditional ragtime song, Berlin's jaunty composition kickstarted a ragtime jubilee\u2014a belated popular celebration of the musical style which African-American composers such as Scott Joplin had originated a decade earlier in the 1890s. The positive international reception of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" in 1911 led to a musical and dance revival known as \"the ragtime craze\".\nAt the time, ragtime music caught \"its second wind\" and ragtime dancing spread \"like wildfire.\" One dancing couple in particular who exemplified this faddish sensation were Vernon and Irene Castle. The charismatic, trendsetting duo frequently danced to Berlin's \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" and his other modernist compositions. The Castles' modern dancing paired with Berlin's modern songs came to embody the ongoing culture clash between the waning propriety of the Edwardian era and the waxing joviality of the Ragtime revolution on the eve of World War\u00a0I. The \"Daily Express\" wrote in 1913 that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In every London restaurant, park and theater, you hear [Berlin's] strains; Paris dances to it; Vienna has forsaken the waltz; Madrid has flung away her castanets, and Venice has forgotten her barcarolles. Ragtime has swept like a whirlwind over the earth.\nWriters such as Edward Jablonski and Ian Whitcomb have emphasized the irony that, in the 1910s, even the upper class of the Russian Empire\u2014a reactionary nation from which Berlin's Jewish forebears had been compelled to flee decades earlier\u2014became enamored with \"the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania.\" Specifically, British socialite Lady Diana Cooper described Prince Felix Yusupov, an affluent Russian aristocrat who married the niece of Tsar Nicholas II and later murdered Grigori Rasputin, as dancing \"around the ballroom like a demented worm\" and shouting, \"More ragtime!\"\nHearing of such behavior, commentators diagnosed such individuals as \"bitten by the ragtime bug\" and behaving like \"a dog with rabies.\" They declared that \"whether [the ragtime mania] is simply a passing phase of our decadent culture or an infectious disease which has come to stay, like \"la grippe\" or leprosy, time alone can show.\"\nContinued popularity.\nAs the years passed, Berlin's \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" had many recurrent manifestations as many artists covered it: Billy Murray, in 1912; Bessie Smith, in 1927; Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, in 1930; the Boswell Sisters, in 1934; Louis Armstrong, in 1937; Bing Crosby and Connee Boswell, in 1938; Johnny Mercer, in 1945; Al Jolson, in 1947; Nellie Lutcher, in 1948, and Ray Charles in 1959. Consequently, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" had a dozen hit covers within the half-a-century prior to 1960.\nReflecting decades later upon the song's unlikely success, Berlin confessed his amazement at its immediate global acclaim and continued popularity. He ascribed its unexpected success to the farcical and silly lyrics which were \"fundamentally right\" and \"started the heels and shoulders of all America and a good section of Europe to rocking.\"\nIn 1937, 20th Century Fox approached Irving Berlin to write a story treatment for an upcoming film tentatively titled \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\". Berlin agreed to write a story outline for the film which featured twenty-six of Berlin's well-known musical scores. \nDuring press interviews promoting the film prior to its premiere, Berlin decried articles by the American press which painted ragtime as jazz's forerunner. Berlin stated: \"Ragtime really shouldn't be called 'the forerunner of jazz' or 'the father of jazz' because, as everyone will tell when they hear some of the old rags, ragtime and jazz are the same.\"\nReleased on August 5, 1938, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" starring Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, and Don Ameche became a smash hit and grossed in excess of five million dollars. Soon after the film's release, writer Marie Cooper Dieckhaus filed a plagiarism lawsuit. After Dieckhaus presented evidence at the trial, a federal judge ruled in Dieckhaus' favor that Berlin had stolen the plot of her unpublished 1937 manuscript and used many of its elements for the film. Dieckhaus had submitted the unpublished manuscript in 1937 to various Hollywood studios, literary agents, and other individuals for their perusal. The judge believed that, after rejecting her manuscript, Berlin nonetheless appropriated much of her work. In 1946, an appellate court reversed the ruling on appeal.\nAlleged plagiarism.\nThere are allegations that Berlin purloined the melody for \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" (in particular, the four notes of \"oh, ma honey\") from drafts of \"Mayflower Rag\" and \"A Real Slow Drag\" by prolific composer Scott Joplin. Berlin and Joplin were acquaintances in New York, and Berlin had opportunities to hear Joplin's scores prior to publication. At the time, \"one of Berlin's functions at the Ted Snyder Music Company was to be on the lookout for publishable music by other composers.\"\nAllegedly, Berlin \"heard Joplin's music in one of the offices, played by a staff musician (since Berlin could not read music) or by Joplin himself.\" According to one account: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Joplin took some music to Irving Berlin, and Berlin kept it for some time. Joplin went back and Berlin said he couldn't use [the song]. When \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" came out, Joplin said, \"That's my tune.\"\nJoplin's widow claimed that, \"after Scott had finished writing \"Treemonisha\", and while he was showing it around, hoping to get it published, [Berlin] stole the theme, and made it into a popular song. The number was quite a hit, too, but that didn't do Scott any good.\" A relative of John Stillwell Stark, Joplin's music publisher, asserted \"the publication of 'Alexander's Ragtime Band' brought Joplin to tears because it was his [own] composition.\" Joplin later died bankrupt after undertaking the financial burden of his unsuccessful \"Treemonisha\" opera and was buried in a pauper's grave (remaining unmarked for 57 years) in Queens, New York, on April 1, 1917. As writer Edward A. Berlin notes in \"King of Ragtime: Scott Joplin and His Era\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There were also rumors heard throughout Tin Pan Alley to the effect that \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" had actually been written by a black man, and even a quarter-century later [composer] W.C. Handy told an audience that \"Irving Berlin got all his ideas and most of his music from the late Scott Joplin.\" Berlin was aware of the rumors and addressed the issue in a magazine interview in 1916.\nFor the next half-century, Berlin was incensed by the allegation that a \"'black boy' [\"sic\"] had written 'Alexander's Ragtime Band'.\" Responding to his detractors, Berlin stated: \"If a negro could write 'Alexander,' why couldn't I? ... If they could produce the negro and he had another hit like 'Alexander' in his system, I would choke it out of him and give him twenty thousands dollars in the bargain.\" In 1914, Berlin referenced the allegation in the lyrics of his composition \"He's A Rag Picker.\" The song features a verse in which a \"black character\" named Mose claims authorship of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band.\"\nLyrical implications.\nAlthough the 1911 sheet music cover drawn by artist John Frew depicts the band's musicians as either white or biracial, Berlin's \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\"\u2014and his earlier 1910 composition \"Alexander and His Clarinet\"\u2014employ certain idiomatic expressions (\"oh, ma honey\", \"honey lamb\") and vernacular English (\"bestest band what am\") in the lyrics to indicate to the listener that the characters in the song should be understood to be African-American.

Originally known as \"The City of Little Men\", the organization was begun by Edward J. Flanagan, a Roman Catholic priest, while he worked in the Diocese of Omaha. Using a loan of $90, he first rented a home at 25th and Dodge streets, in Omaha, to care for five boys. From these beginnings, the City of Little Men developed new juvenile care methods in 20th-century America, emphasizing \"social preparation as a model for public boys' homes worldwide\". Flanagan is now a candidate for beatification.\n1917\u20131921: Early growth and move to Overlook Farm.\nBoys Town quickly grew from the original five boys living in a home in downtown Omaha in 1917 to more than 100 boys by early 1918. The increase required a relocation in 1919 to South Omaha. Flanagan had been contending with criticism about having kids of different races, religions, nationalities, and backgrounds all living together under the same roof. Mounting societal tensions and the need for even more space led to Flanagan\u2019s 1921 decision to relocate Boys Town to Overlook Farm.\nIn 1921, Father Flanagan purchased Overlook Farm on the outskirts of Omaha and moved his boys' home there. The move to Overlook Farm was a major step in Father Flanagan's plan to create a developed community. In time, the Home became known as the Village of Boys Town. By the 1930s, hundreds of boys lived at the Village, which was developed to include a school, dormitories, and administration buildings. Adapting the \"Junior Republic\" model, the boys elected their own government, including a mayor, council, and commissioners. In 1936, the community of Boys Town was designated as an official village in the state of Nebraska.\nBy the late 1930s, Boys Town's development and staff efforts to court public support had made it the subject of many newspaper and magazine articles. In 1938, producers from MGM Studios traveled to Boys Town to discuss the prospects of a movie about the Home. A few months later, actors Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney, along with a 61-member crew, arrived at Boys Town to begin ten days of on-location filming. Tracy won an Academy Award for his role.\nIn 1943, Boys Town adopted as its image and logo a picture of a boy carrying a younger boy on his back, captioned \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother,\" a phrase originating with the United Free Church of Scotland.\nWhen Flanagan suffered a fatal heart attack in Berlin, Germany in 1948, the archbishop of Omaha, Gerald T. Bergan, named Monsignor Nicholas H. Wegner as Boys Town's second executive director. The best records available indicate that the home's population peaked at 880, in the 1960s.\nFundraising controversy and Wegner's resignation.\nBoys Town's fundraising practices drew scrutiny in 1972 after the Omaha Sun, a local newspaper, investigated the nonprofit after a tip from local Omaha businessman Warren Buffett. The charity was found to have an endowment of over $191 million in 1971, enough to place it at #230 on the Fortune 500, yet continued to fundraise even with a shrinking population and no new expansion projects. Wegner was forced to resign and temporarily halted its fundraising activities. The Omaha Sun received the Pulitzer Prize for Local Investigative Specialized Reporting in 1973 for the story. On October 11, 1973, Robert P. Hupp was named the third national executive director.\nTransition to Family Home programs.\nIn late 1974, Boys Town hired its first \"Family-Teachers\", a married couple who would begin caring for a small group of youth in a former cottage being converted into a \"Family Home\". Three other couples were hired soon after. That core group worked with other staff members to develop formal training materials for the Family-Teachers who were being recruited. As new couples were trained, they moved into newly built homes and converted cottages. By the end of 1975, the last of the dormitories was closed and the transition to the Boys Town Family Home Program was complete.\nBoys Town admits girls (1979).\nThe executive director Robert Hupp had experience working with troubled girls. He had served from 1946 to 1950 as chaplain, teacher, and athletic coach for a girls' home run by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd Convent in Omaha. In 1979, a few girls were admitted to live in a Family Home on the main campus. More followed and by 1985, twenty-six girls were citizens of Boys Town.\nNational Historic Landmark.\nThe national headquarters of Boys Town is in the village of Boys Town, Nebraska; the village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark on February 4, 1985.\nFacilities include the Hall of History, dedicated to the history of Boys Town; the restored home of Father Flanagan; the Dowd Memorial Chapel and the Chambers Protestant Chapel; and the Leon Myers Stamp Center. The latter provides historical stamp-collecting exhibits and sells donated stamps to provide support for Boys Town programs.\nIt has a summer camp on West Lake Okoboji, located near West Okoboji, Iowa.\nHospitals and clinics.\nIn 1977, Boys Town founded and continues to operate the Boys Town National Research Hospital, located at 555\u00a0N.\u00a030th Street in Omaha. Its sister hospital, Boys Town National Research Hospital \u2013 West, is operated on the Boys Town campus. The NPO also operates several medical clinics in Nebraska, and one in Iowa.\nNational locations.\nBoys Town has nine sites across the United States, in Central Florida, North Florida, South Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, Iowa, New England, Nevada, and Washington, D.C.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Trotsky described himself as an orthodox Marxist, a revolutionary Marxist, and a Bolshevik\u2013Leninist as well as a follower of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Karl Liebknecht, and Rosa Luxemburg. His relations with Lenin have been a source of intense historical debate. However, on balance, scholarly opinion among a range of prominent historians and political scientists such as E. H. Carr, Isaac Deutscher, Moshe Lewin, Ronald Suny, Richard B. Day and W. Bruce Lincoln was that Lenin's desired \"heir\" would have been a collective responsibility in which Trotsky was placed in \"an important role and within which Stalin would be dramatically demoted (if not removed)\".\nTrotsky advocated for a decentralized form of economic planning, workers' control of production, elected representation of Soviet socialist parties, mass soviet democratization,\nthe tactic of a united front against far-right parties,\ncultural autonomy for artistic movements, voluntary collectivisation, a transitional program, and socialist internationalism. He supported founding a vanguard party of the proletariat, and a dictatorship of the proletariat (as opposed to the \"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\", which Marxists argue is a major component of capitalism) based on working-class self-emancipation and council democracy. Trotsky also adhered to scientific socialism and viewed this as a conscious expression of historical processes. Trotskyists are critical of Stalinism as they oppose Stalin's theory of socialism in one country in favour of Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution. Trotskyists criticize the bureaucracy and anti-democratic current developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin.\nDespite their ideological disputes, Trotsky and Lenin were close personally prior to the London Congress of Social Democrats in 1903 and during the First World War. Lenin and Trotsky were close ideologically and personally during the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. Trotskyists and some others call Trotsky its \"co-leader\". This was also alluded to by Rosa Luxemburg. Lenin himself never mentioned the concept of \"Trotskyism\" after Trotsky became a member of the Bolshevik party. Trotsky was the Red Army's paramount leader in the Revolutionary period's direct aftermath. Trotsky initially opposed some aspects of Leninism, but eventually concluded that unity between the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks was impossible and joined the Bolsheviks. Trotsky played a leading role with Lenin in the October Revolution. Lenin and Trotsky were also both honorary presidents of the Third International. Trotskyists have traditionally drawn upon Lenin's testament and his alliance with Trotsky in 1922\u201323 against the Soviet bureaucracy as primary evidence that Lenin sought to remove Stalin from the position of General Secretary. Various historians have also cited Lenin's proposal to appoint Trotsky Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Union as further evidence that he intended Trotsky to be his successor as head of government.\nIn October 1927, by order of Stalin, Trotsky was removed from power. In November of the same year, he was expelled from the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (VKP(b)). He was exiled to Alma-Ata (now Almaty) in January 1928 and then expelled from the USSR in February 1929. As the head of the Fourth International, Trotsky continued in exile to oppose what he termed the degenerated workers' state in the USSR. On 20 August 1940, Trotsky was attacked in Mexico City by Ram\u00f3n Mercader, a Spanish-born NKVD agent, and died the next day in a hospital. His murder is considered a political assassination. Almost all Trotskyists within the VKP(b) were executed in the Great Purges of 1937\u20131938, effectively removing all of Trotsky's internal influence in the USSR. Nikita Khrushchev had come to power as head of the Communist Party in Ukraine, signing lists of other Trotskyists to be executed. Trotsky and the party of Trotskyists were still recognized as enemies of the USSR during Khrushchev's rule of the USSR after 1956. Trotsky's Fourth International was established in the French Third Republic in 1938 when Trotskyists argued that the Comintern or Third International had become irretrievably \"lost to Stalinism\" and thus incapable of leading the international working class to political power.\nDefinition.\nAccording to Trotsky, his programme could be distinguished from other Marxist theories by five key elements:\nOn the political spectrum of Marxism, Trotskyists are usually considered to be on the left. In the 1920s, they called themselves the Left Opposition, although today's left communism is distinct and usually non-Bolshevik. The terminological disagreement can be confusing because different versions of a left-right political spectrum are used. Anti-revisionists consider themselves the ultimate leftists on a spectrum from communism on the left to imperialist capitalism on the right. However, given that Stalinism is often labelled rightist within the communist spectrum and left communism leftist, anti-revisionists' idea of the left is very different from that of left communism. Despite being Bolshevik-Leninist comrades during the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War, Trotsky and Stalin became enemies in the 1920s and, after that, opposed the legitimacy of each other's forms of Leninism. Trotsky was highly critical of the Stalinist USSR for suppressing democracy and the lack of adequate economic planning.\nOverall, Trotsky and the Left-United Opposition factions advocated for rapid industrialization, voluntary collectivisation of agriculture, and the expansion of a worker's democracy.\nTheory.\nUntil 1905, some revolutionaries claimed that Marx's theory of history posited that only a revolution in a European capitalist society would lead to a socialist one. According to this position, a socialist revolution could not occur in a backward, feudal country such as early 20th-century Russia when it had such a small and almost powerless capitalist class. In 1905, Trotsky formulated his theory of permanent revolution, which later became a defining characteristic of Trotskyism.\nThe theory of permanent revolution addressed how such feudal regimes were to be overthrown and how socialism could establish itself, given the lack of economic prerequisites. Trotsky argued that only the working class could overthrow feudalism and win the peasantry's support in Russia. Furthermore, he argued that the Russian working class would not stop there. They would win their revolution against the weak capitalist class, establish a workers' state in Russia, and appeal to the working class in the advanced capitalist countries worldwide. As a result, the global working class would come to Russia's aid, and socialism could develop worldwide.\nAccording to political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz, Trotsky\u2019s theory of \u201cpermanent revolution\u201d was grossly misrepresented by Stalin as defeatist and adventurist during the succession struggle, when in fact Trotsky encouraged revolutions in Europe but was not at any time proposing \u201creckless confrontations\u201d with the capitalist world.\nCapitalist or bourgeois-democratic revolution.\nRevolutions in Britain in the 17th century and in France in 1789 abolished feudalism and established the essential requisites for the development of capitalism. Trotsky argued that these revolutions would not be repeated in Russia.\nIn \"Results and Prospects\", written in 1906, Trotsky outlines his theory in detail, arguing: \"History does not repeat itself. However much one may compare the Russian Revolution with the Great French Revolution, the former can never be transformed into a repetition of the latter.\" In the French Revolution of 1789, France experienced what Marxists called a \"bourgeois-democratic revolution\"\u2014a regime was established wherein the bourgeoisie overthrew the existing French feudalistic system. The bourgeoisie then moved towards establishing a regime of democratic parliamentary institutions. However, while democratic rights were extended to the bourgeoisie, they were not generally extended to a universal franchise. The freedom for workers to organize unions or to strike was not achieved without considerable struggle.\nPassivity of the bourgeoisie.\nTrotsky argues that countries like Russia had no \"enlightened, active\" revolutionary bourgeoisie which could play the same role, and the working class constituted a tiny minority. In his book, Results and Prospects, Trotsky states that, by the time of the European revolutions of 1848, \"the bourgeoisie was already unable to play a comparable role. It did not want and was not able to undertake the revolutionary liquidation of the social system that stood in its path to power.\"\nThe theory of permanent revolution considers that in many countries that are thought, by Trotskyists, to not have completed a bourgeois-democratic revolution, the capitalist class opposes the creation of any revolutionary situation, as a revolutionary proletariat may threaten their position in society. Trotsky believed that, \"[the bourgeoisie] fear of the armed proletariat is greater than the fear of the soldiery of the autocracy.\" In the case of Russia, the working class, although a small minority in a predominantly peasant-based society, was organised in vast factories, owned by the capitalist class, and into large working-class districts. Proletariat organisation meant that, during the Russian Revolution of 1905, the bourgeoisie found it necessary to ally with reactionary elements, such as the essentially feudal landlords and, ultimately, the existing Czarist Russian state forces. This was to protect capitalist class ownership of property, such as factories, banks, etc.\u2014from expropriation by the revolutionary proletariat.\nTherefore, according to the theory of permanent revolution, the capitalist classes of economically backward countries are incapable of carrying through revolutionary change. As a result, they are linked to and rely on the feudal landowners in many ways. Thus, Trotsky argues that because a majority of the branches of industry in Russia originated under the direct influence of government measures\u2014sometimes with the help of government subsidies\u2014the capitalist class was again tied to the ruling elite. The capitalist class was subservient to European capital.\nThe incapability of the peasantry.\nThe theory of permanent revolution further considers that the peasantry as a whole cannot take on the task of carrying through the revolution because it is dispersed in small holdings throughout the country and forms a heterogeneous grouping, including the rich peasants who employ rural workers and aspire to landlordism as well as the poor peasants who aspire to own more land. Trotsky argues: \"All historical experience [...] shows that the peasantry are absolutely incapable of taking up an independent political role\".\nThe key role of the proletariat.\nTrotskyists differ on the extent to which this is true today. However, even the most orthodox tend to recognise in the late twentieth century a new development in the revolts of the rural poor: the self-organising struggles of the landless, along with many other struggles that in some ways reflect the militant united, organised struggles of the working class, which to various degrees do not bear the marks of class divisions typical of the heroic peasant struggles of previous epochs. However, orthodox Trotskyists today still argue that the town- and city-based working-class struggle is central to the task of a successful socialist revolution linked to these struggles of the rural poor. They argue that the working class learns of the necessity to conduct a collective struggle, for instance, in trade unions, arising from its social conditions in the factories and workplaces; and that the collective consciousness it achieves is an essential ingredient of the socialist reconstruction of society.\nTrotsky himself argued that only the proletariat or working class was capable of achieving the tasks of that bourgeois revolution. In 1905, the working class in Russia, a generation brought together in vast factories from the relative isolation of peasant life, saw the result of its labour as a vast collective effort, also seeing the only means of struggling against its oppression in terms of a collective effort, forming workers councils (soviets) in the course of the revolution of that year. In 1906, Trotsky argued: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The factory system brings the proletariat to the foreground [...] The proletariat immediately found itself concentrated in tremendous masses, while between these masses and the autocracy there stood a capitalist bourgeoisie, very small in numbers, isolated from the \"people\", half-foreign, without historical traditions, and inspired only by the greed for gain.\u2014\u200a\nFor instance, the Putilov Factory numbered 12,000 workers in 1900 and, according to Trotsky, 36,000 in July 1917.\nAlthough only a tiny minority in Russian society, the proletariat would lead a revolution to emancipate the peasantry and thus \"secure the support of the peasantry\" as part of that revolution, on whose support it would rely. However, to improve their conditions, the working class must create a revolution of their own, which would accomplish the bourgeois revolution and establish a workers' state.\nInternational revolution.\nOnly fully developed capitalist conditions prepare the basis for socialism. According to classical Marxism, a revolution in peasant-based countries such as Russia ultimately prepares the ground for capitalism's development since the liberated peasants become small owners, producers, and traders. This leads to the growth of commodity markets, from which a new capitalist class emerges.\nTrotsky agreed that a new socialist state and economy in a country like Russia would not be able to hold out against the pressures of a hostile capitalist world and the internal pressures of its backward economy. Trotsky argued that the revolution must quickly spread to capitalist countries, bringing about a socialist revolution that must spread worldwide. In this way, the revolution is \"permanent\", moving out of necessity first, from the bourgeois revolution to the workers' revolution and from there, uninterruptedly, to European and worldwide revolutions.\nAn internationalist outlook of permanent revolution is found in the works of Karl Marx. The term \"permanent revolution\" is taken from a remark of Marx in his March 1850 Address: \"it is our task\", Marx said: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] to make the revolution permanent until all the more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling positions, until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far\u2014not only in one country but in all the leading countries of the world\u2014that competition between the proletarians of these countries ceases and at least the decisive forces of production are concentrated in the hands of the workers.\u2014\u200a\nHis biographer, Isaac Deutscher, has explicitly contrasted his support for proletarian internationalism against his opposition to revolution by military conquest as seen with his documented opposition to the war with Poland in 1920, proposed armistice with the Entente and temperance with staging anti-British revolts in the Middle East. Historian Robert Vincent Daniels believed that the practical differences, in the domain of international policy, between the Left Opposition and other factions had been exaggerated and he contended that Trotsky was no more prepared than other Bolshevik figures to risk war or for the loss of trade opportunities despite his support for world revolution.\nSocialist democracy and Workers' Control.\nPrior to the October Revolution, Trotsky had been part of a tendency toward radical democracy which included both Left Mensheviks and Left Bolsheviks. His work, \"Our Political Tasks\", published in 1904 reviewed issues related to party organisation, mass participation and the potential dangers of substitutionism which he foresaw in a Leninist party model. Trotsky would also assume a central role in the 1905 revolution and serve as the Chairman of the Petersburg Soviet of Workers' Delegates in which he wrote several proclamations urging for improved economic conditions, political rights and the use of strike action against the Tsarist regime on behalf of workers.\nIn 1917, he had proposed the election of a new Soviet presidium with other socialist parties based on proportional representation. On the other hand, he had accepted the ban on rival parties in Moscow during the Russian Civil War due to their opposition to the October Revolution. Yet, he also opposed the extension of the ban to the Mensheviks in Soviet Georgia.\nIn 1922, Lenin allied with Leon Trotsky against the party's growing bureaucratisation and the influence of Joseph Stalin. In 1923, Trotsky and a number of Old Bolsheviks who signed The Declaration of 46 raised concerns to the Poliburo concerning intra-party democracy which shared similarities with Lenin's before his death. The signatories of the 46 letter expressed grievances related to the provincial conferences, party congresses, and the election of committees. Separately, Trotsky would develop his views further with the publication of the \"New Course\" in 1924.\nIn 1927, Trotsky and the United Opposition had argued for the expansion of industrial democracy with their joint platform which demanded majority representation of workers in trade union congresses including the All-Union Congress and an increase of non-party workers to one-third of representation in these elected organs. They also supported legal protection for workers' right to criticise, such as the right to make independent proposals. According to historian Vadim Rogovin, these proposals would have developed democracy in the sphere of production and facilitated the establishment of workers' control over economic management.\nFollowing Stalin's consolidation of power in the Soviet Union and static centralization of political power, Trotsky condemned the Soviet government's policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing workers' self-management and democratic participation in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a deformed workers' state that could not effectively transition to socialism. Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by orthodox Trotskyist theories as degenerated or deformed workers' states and not socialist states.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBureaucratic autocracy must give place to Soviet democracy. A restoration of the right of criticism, and a genuine freedom of elections, are necessary conditions for the further development of the country. This assumes a revival of freedom of Soviet parties, beginning with the party of Bolsheviks, and a resurrection of the trade unions. The bringing of democracy into industry means a radical revision of plans in the interests of toilers.\nTrotsky, \"The Revolution Betrayed\", 1936\nIn 1931, Trotsky wrote a pamphlet on the Spanish Revolution and called for the creation of worker\u2019s juntas in emulation of elected soviets as an expression of working class organisation. Trotsky stipulated the need for shared participation of the communist factions, anarcho-syndicalists and socialists.\nIn 1936, Trotsky argued in his work, \"The Revolution Betrayed\", for the restoration of the right of criticism in areas such as economic matters, the revitalization of trade unions and free elections of the Soviet parties. Trotsky also argued that the excessive authoritarianism under Stalin had undermined the implementation of the First five-year plan. He noted that several engineers and economists who had created the plan were themselves later put on trial as \"conscious wreckers who had acted on the instructions of a foreign power\".\nPolish historian and biographer, Isaac Deutscher, viewed his inner-party reforms in 1923\u201324 as arguably the first act in the restoration of free Soviet institutions which the party had sought to establish in 1917 and the return of worker's democracy which would correspond with a gradual dismantlement of the single-party system.\nAt the same time, Deutscher noted that Trotsky's attitude towards democracy could be characterised as inconsistent and hesitant by opponents, but this stemmed from a range of reasons, such as the ill timing after the failed revolutions in the West and controversies around party schisms.\nIn the \"Transitional Program\", which was drafted in 1938 during the founding congress of the Fourth International, Trotsky reiterated the need for the legalization of the Soviet parties and worker's control of production.\nUneven and combined development.\nThe concept of uneven and combined development was derived from the political theories of Trotsky. This concept was developed in combination with the related theory of permanent revolution to explain the historical context of Russia. He would later elaborate on this theory to explain the specific laws of uneven development in 1930 and the conditions for a possible revolutionary scenario. According to biographer Ian Thatcher, this theory would be later generalised to \"the entire history of mankind\".\nPolitical scientists Emanuele Saccarelli and Latha Varadarajan valued his theory as a \"signal contribution\" to the discipline of international relations. They argued his theory presented \"a specific understanding of capitalist development as \"uneven\", insofar as it systematically featured geographically divergent \"advanced\" and \"backward\" regions\" across the world economy.\nSocialist culture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFaith merely promises to move mountains; but technology, which takes nothing \u2018on faith\u2019, is actually able to cut down mountains and move them. Up to now this was done for industrial purposes (mines) or for railways (tunnels); in the future this will be done on an immeasurably larger scale, according to a general industrial and artistic plan. Man will occupy himself with re-registering mountains and rivers, and will earnestly and repeatedly make improvements in nature.\n\u2014Trotsky, \"Literature and Revolution\", 1924\nIn \"Literature and Revolution\", Trotsky examined aesthetic issues concerning class and the Russian Revolution. Soviet scholar Robert Bird considered his work the \"first systematic treatment of art by a Communist leader\" and a catalyst for later Marxist cultural and critical theories. He had also defended intellectual autonomy in relation to the Russian literary movements and scientific theories such as Freudian psychoanalytic theory along with Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity during the succession period. However, these theories were increasingly marginalised during the Stalin era.\nIn \"Problems of Everyday Life\", a contemporaneous book which further articulated his views on culture and science, Trotsky argued that cultural development would accentuate industrial and technical progress. He viewed both elements to be interrelated components as part of dialectical interaction in which he viewed the low level of Russian technique and expertise to be a function of cultural backwardness. According to Trotsky, Western industrial methods and products such as the radio should not be rejected due to their status as products of a capitalist system, but rather absorbed into the Soviet socialist framework to facilitate new forms of techniques and cultural production. In this interpretation, the transference of techniques brought new cultural changes in terms of rationalism, efficiency, exactitude, and quality.\nTrotsky would later co-author the 1938 \"Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art\" with the endorsement of prominent artists Andre Breton and Diego Rivera. Trotsky's writings on literature such as his 1923 survey which advocated tolerance, limited censorship and respect for literary tradition had strong appeal to the New York Intellectuals.\nTrotsky critiqued contemporary literary movements such as Futurism and emphasised the need for cultural autonomy to develop a socialist culture. According to literary critic Terry Eagleton, Trotsky recognised \"like Lenin on the need for a socialist culture to absorb the finest products of bourgeois art\". Trotsky himself viewed the proletarian culture as \"temporary and transitional\" which would provide the foundations for a culture above classes. He also argued that the preconditions for artistic creativity were economic well-being and emancipation from material constraints.\nPolitical scientist, Baruch Knei-Paz, characterised his view on the role of the party as transmitters of culture to the masses and raising the standards of education, as well as entry into the cultural sphere, but that the process of artistic creation in terms of language and presentation should be the domain of the practitioner. Knei-Paz also noted key distinctions between Trotsky's approach to cultural matters and Stalin's policy in the 1930s.\nEconomics.\nTrotsky was an early proponent of economic planning since 1923 and favored an accelerated pace of industrialization. In 1921, he had also been a prominent supporter of Gosplan as a newly established body and called for the strengthening of its formal responsibilities to support a balanced level of economic reconstruction after the Civil War. Lenin and Politburo members had also proposed he served as deputy chairman with a focus on economic matters related to the either STO, Gosplan or the Council of National Economy.\nTrotsky had urged economic decentralisation between the state, oblast regions, and factories to counter structural inefficiency and the problem of bureaucracy. He had proposed the principles underlying the N.E.P. in 1920 to the Politburo to mitigate urgent economic matters arising from war communism. He would later reproach Lenin privately about the delayed government response in 1921-1922. However, his position also differed from the majority of Soviet leaders at the time who fully supported the New Economic policy.\nComparatively, Trotsky believed that planning and N.E.P. should develop within a mixed framework until the socialist sector gradually superseded the private industry. He found allies among a circle of economic theorists and administrators, which included Evgenii Preobazhensky along Georgy Pyatakov, deputy chairman of the Council of the National Economy and had more broadly the support of many party intellectuals.\nTrotsky had specified the need for the \"overall guidance in planning i.e. the systematic co-ordination of the fundamental sectors of the state economy in the process of adapting to the present market\" and urged for a national plan alongside currency stabilization. He also rejected the Stalinist conception of industrialisation, which favoured heavy industry. Instead, he proposed the use of foreign trade as an accelerator and to direct investments by means of a system of comparative coefficients.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe problem of agriculture is a much more complicated one, and there is nothing surprising in this to the Marxian mind. The change from the system of small individual peasant holdings to socialist methods of land cultivation is only conceivable after a number of consecutive stages of progress in technical science in economics and culture.\n-Trotsky on the need for a gradual and scientific socialization of agriculture in \"\u201cTowards Socialism or Capitalism?\u201d\", 1926.\nTrotsky and the Left Opposition developed a number of economic proposals in response to the scissor crisis, which had undermined relations between the workers and peasants in 1923\u20131924. This included a progressive tax on the wealthier sections of populations, such as the kulaks and NEPmen, alongside an equilibrium of the import-export balance to access accumulated reserves to purchase machinery from abroad to increase the pace of industrialization. The policy was later adopted by members of the United Opposition, which also advocated a programme of rapid industrialization during the debates of 1924 and 1927. The United Opposition proposed a progressive tax on wealthier peasants, the encouragement of agricultural cooperatives, and the formation of collective farms voluntarily.\nTrotsky, as president of the electrification commission, along with members of the Opposition bloc, had also put forward an electrification plan which involved the construction of the hydroelectric Dnieprostroi dam. According to historian Sheila Fitzpatrick, the scholarly consensus was that Stalin appropriated the position of the Left Opposition on such matters as industrialisation and collectivisation. In exile, Trotsky maintained that the disproportions and imbalances which became characteristic of Stalinist planning in the 1930s such as the underdeveloped consumer base along with the priority focus on heavy industry were due to a number of avoidable problems. He argued that the industrial drive had been enacted under more severe circumstances, several years later, and in a less rational manner than originally conceived by the Left Opposition.\nErnest Mandel argued that the economic programme of Trotsky differed from the forced policy of collectivisation implemented by Stalin after 1928 due to the levels of brutality associated with its enforcement. Notably, Trotsky sought to raise taxation on wealthier farmers and encourage farm labourers, along with poor peasants to form collective farms voluntarily in conjunction with the allocation of state resources to agricultural machinery, fertilizers, credit and agronomic assistance.\nIn 1932\u201333, Trotsky insisted upon the need for mass participation in the operationalisation of the planned economy:\"Insoluble without the daily experience of millions, without their critical review of their own collective experience, without their expression of their needs and demands and could not be carried out within the confines of the official sanctums... even if the Politburo consisted of seven universal geniuses, of seven Marxes, or seven Lenins, it will still be unable, all on its own, with all its creative imagination, to assert command over the economy of 170 million people\".\nBritish cybernetician Stafford Beer, who worked on a decentralized form of economic planning, Project Cybersyn from 1970 to 1973, was reported to have read and been influenced by Trotsky's critique of the Soviet bureaucracy.\nThe economic platform of a planned economy combined with an authentic worker's democracy as originally advocated by Trotsky has constituted the programme of the Fourth International and the modern Trotskyist movement.\nTransitional program.\nTrotsky drafted the transitional programme as a programmatic document for the founding congress of the Fourth International in 1938.\nHe explicitly emphasised the core need for the programme:\n\"It is explicitly necessary to help the masses in the process of the daily struggle to find the bridge between present demands and the socialist program of the revolution. This bridge should include a system of transitional demands, stemming from today's conditions and from today's consciousness of wide layers of the working class and unalterably leading to one final conclusion: the conquest of power by the proletariat\".\nThe transitional programme features three types of proposals for action. This includes democratic demands such as the right of unions and self-determination; immediate demands which are concerned with everyday struggles such as wage increases and transitional demands which are directed at the capitalist system such as worker's control of production .\nScientific socialism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe must give a scientific explanation of society, and clearly explain it to the masses. That is the difference between Marxism and reformism.\n\u2014Trotsky on the transitional program of the Fourth International.\nIn his collection of texts, \"In Defence of Marxism\", Leon Trotsky defended the dialectical method of scientific socialism during the factional schisms within the American Trotskyist movement during 1939\u201340. Trotsky viewed dialectics as an essential method of analysis to discern the class nature of the Soviet Union. Specifically, he described scientific socialism as the \"conscious expression of the unconscious historical process\". According to Daniels, Trotsky conceived historical revolutions as a long, interrelated process of political and social struggle which undergo various stages with national and international dimensions.\nPrior to his expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotsky had encouraged empirical studies with the use of Marxist methods for social and historical development. He also insisted on the need for a freedom of science, including theoretical research, in 1925, for socially useful purposes. Trotsky defended Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity in Soviet intellectual circles, but this became an anathema during the Stalin era and was only rehabilitated following the latter's death.\nIn line with the scientific outlook of Marxist philosophy, Trotsky heavily emphasized science to alleviate the level of backwardness among the Soviet masses. Concurrently, he viewed socialism as a progressive struggle for science, culture, and morality in which science should be given the maximum scope for development. In 1918, he had supported Taylorism along with Lenin as a means of scientifically managing industries with the support of foreign engineers. Multiple historians have stressed the technocratic nature of his governance proposals compared to Stalin and Bukharin with a higher reliance on \"bourgeois\" experts and specialists.\nTrotskyists have emphasised the dialectical relationship between objective, material conditions, and subjective factors such as party, leadership, in understanding the nature of change in historical events.\nUnited front and theory of fascism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt a time when hundreds of thousands and millions of workers, especially in Germany, are departing from Communism, in part to fascism and in the main into the camp of indifferentism, thousands and tens of thousands of Social Democratic workers, under the impact of the self-same defeat, are evolving into the left, to the side of Communism. There cannot, however, even be talk of their accepting the hopelessly discredited Stalinist leadership.\n\u2014Trotsky's writings on the challenge of Stalinism and fascism in 1933.\nTrotsky was a central figure in the Comintern during its first four congresses. During this time, he helped to generalize the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards, the united front, a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in the common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution.\nAfter he was exiled and politically marginalized by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British Socialist Workers Party in \"International Socialism\", his articles on the united front represent an essential part of his political legacy.\nTrotsky also formulated a theory of fascism based on a dialectical interpretation of events to analyze the manifestation of Italian fascism and the early emergence of Nazi Germany from 1930 to 1933.\nMarxist theorist and economist Hillel Ticktin argued that his political strategy and approach to fascism such as the emphasis on an organisational bloc between the German Communist Party and Social-Democratic party during the interwar period would very likely have prevented Adolf Hitler from ascending to political power.\nPolitical ethics and morality.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA means can be justified only by its end. But the end in turn needs to be justified. From the Marxist point of view, which expresses the historical interests of the proletariat, the end is justified if it leads to increasing the power of man over nature and to the abolition of the power of man over man.\n\u2014Trotsky's writings on \"The Dialectical Interpedence of Ends and Means\".\nIn 1938, Trotsky had written \"\" which consisted of ethical polemics in response to criticisms around his actions concerning the Kronstadt rebellion and wider questions posed around the perceived, \"amoral\" methods of the Bolsheviks. Critics believed these methods seemed to emulate the Jesuit maxim that the \"ends justifies the means\". Trotsky argued that Marxism situated the foundation of morality as a product of society to serve social interests rather than \"eternal moral truths\" proclaimed by institutional religions. On the other hand, he regarded it as farcical to assert that an end could justify any criminal means and viewed this to be a distorted representation of the Jesuit maxim. Instead, Trotsky believed that the means and ends frequently \u201cexchanged places\u201d as when democracy is sought by the working class as an instrument to actualize socialism. He also viewed revolution to be deducible from the laws of the development and primarily the class struggle, but this did not mean all means are permissible. Fundamentally, Trotsky argued that ends \"rejects\" means that are incompatible with itself. In other words, socialism cannot be furthered through fraud, deceit or the worship of leaders but through honesty and integrity as essential elements of revolutionary morality in dealing with the working masses.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAccording to Trotsky, the term \"Trotskyism\" was coined by Pavel Milyukov (sometimes transliterated as Paul Miliukoff), the ideological leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in Russia. Milyukov waged a bitter war against Trotskyism \"as early as 1905\".\nTrotsky was elected chairman of the St. Petersburg Soviet during the Russian Revolution of 1905. He pursued a policy of proletarian revolution at a time when other socialist trends advocated a transition to a \"bourgeois\" (capitalist) regime to replace the essentially feudal Romanov state. This year, Trotsky developed the theory of permanent revolution, as it later became known (see below). In 1905, Trotsky quotes from a postscript to a book by Milyukov, \"The Elections to the Second State Duma\", published no later than May 1907: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Those who reproach the Kadets with failure to protest at that time, by organising meetings, against the \"revolutionary illusions\" of Trotskyism and the relapse into Blanquism, simply do not understand [...] the mood of the democratic public at meetings during that period.\u2014\u200a\nMilyukov suggests that the mood of the \"democratic public\" was in support of Trotsky's policy of the overthrow of the Romanov regime alongside a workers' revolution to overthrow the capitalist owners of industry, support for strike action and the establishment of democratically elected workers' councils or \"soviets\". This differed from variations of Council Communism in Germany due to the Russian Peasantry and the role they have in overall Leninism including Trotskyism compared to the role they have in Council Communism\nTrotskyism and the 1917 Russian Revolution.\nDuring his leadership of the Russian revolution of 1905, Trotsky argued that once it became clear that the Tsar's army would not come out in support of the workers, it was necessary to retreat before the armed might of the state in as good an order as possible. In 1917, Trotsky was again elected chairman of the Petrograd soviet, but this time soon came to lead the Military Revolutionary Committee, which had the allegiance of the Petrograd garrison and carried through the October 1917 insurrection. Stalin wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All practical work in connection with the organisation of the uprising was done under the immediate direction of Comrade Trotsky, the President of the Petrograd Soviet. It can be stated with certainty that the Party is indebted primarily and principally to Comrade Trotsky for the rapid going over of the garrison to the side of the Soviet and the efficient manner in which the work of the Military Revolutionary Committee was organized. The principal assistants of Comrade Trotsky were Comrades Antonov and Podvoisky.\u2014\u200a\nAs a result of his role in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the theory of permanent revolution was embraced by the young Soviet state until 1924.\nThe Russian revolution of 1917 was marked by two revolutions: the relatively spontaneous February 1917 revolution and the 25 October 1917 seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, who had gained the leadership of the Petrograd soviet.\nBefore the February 1917 Russian revolution, Lenin had formulated a slogan calling for the \"democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry\", but after the February revolution, through his April Theses, Lenin instead called for \"all power to the Soviets\". Nevertheless, Lenin continued to emphasise (as did Trotsky) the classical Marxist position that the peasantry formed a basis for the development of capitalism, not socialism.\nAlso, before February 1917, Trotsky had not accepted the importance of a Bolshevik-style organisation. Once the February 1917 Russian revolution had broken out, Trotsky admitted the importance of a Bolshevik organisation and joined the Bolsheviks in July 1917. Although many, like Stalin, saw Trotsky's role in the October 1917 Russian revolution as central, Trotsky wrote that without Lenin and the Bolshevik Party, the October revolution of 1917 would not have taken place.\nOther Bolshevik figures such as Anatoly Lunacharsky, Moisei Uritsky and Dmitry Manuilsky agreed that Lenin's influence on the Bolshevik party was decisive but the October insurrection was carried out according to Trotsky's, not to Lenin's plan.\nAs a result, since 1917, Trotskyism as a political theory has been fully committed to a Leninist style of democratic centralist party organisation, which Trotskyists argue must not be confused with the party organisation as it later developed under Stalin. Trotsky had previously suggested that Lenin's method of organisation would lead to a dictatorship. However, it is essential to emphasise that after 1917, orthodox Trotskyists argue that the loss of democracy in the USSR was caused by the failure of the revolution to spread internationally and the consequent wars, isolation, and imperialist intervention, not the Bolshevik style of organisation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAfter the majority of the petrograd Soviet passed into the hands of the Bolsheviks, [Trotsky] was elected its chairman and in that position organized and led the insurrection of October 25.\nLenin on the organization of the October Revolution, Vol.XIV of the \"Collected Works\".\nLenin's outlook had always been that the Russian revolution would need to stimulate a Socialist revolution in Western Europe so that this European socialist society would come to the aid of the Russian revolution and enable Russia to advance towards socialism. Lenin stated: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We have stressed in a good many written works, in all our public utterances, and in all our statements in the press that [...] the socialist revolution can triumph only on two conditions. First, if it is given timely support by a socialist revolution in one or several advanced countries.\u2014\u200a\nThis outlook matched Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution precisely. Trotsky's permanent revolution had foreseen that the working class would not stop at the bourgeois democratic stage of the revolution but proceed towards a workers' state, as happened in 1917. The Polish Trotskyist Isaac Deutscher maintains that in 1917, Lenin changed his attitude toward Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution, and after the October revolution, it was adopted by the Bolsheviks.\nLenin was met with initial disbelief in April 1917. Trotsky argues that: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] up to the outbreak of the February revolution and for a time after Trotskyism did not mean the idea that it was impossible to build a socialist society within the national boundaries of Russia (which \"possibility\" was never expressed by anybody up to 1924 and hardly came into anybody's head). Trotskyism meant the idea that the Russian proletariat might win the power in advance of the Western proletariat, and that in that case it could not confine itself within the limits of a democratic dictatorship but would be compelled to undertake the initial socialist measures. It is not surprising, then, that the April theses of Lenin were condemned as Trotskyist.\u2014\u200a\n\"Legend of Trotskyism\".\nIn \"The Stalin School of Falsification\", Trotsky argues that what he calls the \"legend of Trotskyism\" was formulated by Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev in collaboration with Stalin in 1924 in response to the criticisms Trotsky raised of Politburo policy. Orlando Figes argues: \"The urge to silence Trotsky, and all criticism of the Politburo, was in itself a crucial factor in Stalin's rise to power\".\nDuring 1922\u20131924, Lenin suffered a series of strokes and became increasingly incapacitated. In a document dictated before his death in 1924 while describing Trotsky as \"distinguished not only by his exceptional abilities\u2014personally he is, to be sure, the most able man in the present Central Committee\" and also maintaining that \"his non-Bolshevik past should not be held against him\", Lenin criticized him for \"showing excessive preoccupation with the purely administrative side of the work\" and also requested that Stalin be removed from his position of General Secretary, but his notes remained suppressed until 1956. Zinoviev and Kamenev broke with Stalin in 1925 and joined Trotsky in 1926 in what was known as the United Opposition.\nIn 1926, Stalin allied with Nikolai Bukharin, who led the campaign against \"Trotskyism\". In \"The Stalin School of Falsification\", Trotsky quotes Bukharin's 1918 pamphlet, \"From the Collapse of Czarism to the Fall of the Bourgeoisie\", which was re-printed in 1923 by the party publishing house, Proletari. Bukharin explains and embraces Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution in this pamphlet: \"The Russian proletariat is confronted more sharply than ever before with the problem of the international revolution ... The grand total of relationships which have arisen in Europe leads to this inevitable conclusion. Thus, the permanent revolution in Russia is passing into the European proletarian revolution\". Yet it is common knowledge, Trotsky argues, that three years later in 1926 \"Bukharin was the chief and indeed the sole theoretician of the entire campaign against 'Trotskyism', summed up in the struggle against the theory of the permanent revolution.\"\nTrotsky wrote that the Left Opposition grew in influence throughout the 1920s, attempting to reform the Communist Party, but in 1927 Stalin declared \"civil war\" against them:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;During the first ten years of its struggle, the Left Opposition did not abandon the program of ideological conquest of the party for that of conquest of power against the party. Its slogan was: reform, not revolution. The bureaucracy, however, even in those times, was ready for any revolution in order to defend itself against a democratic reform.\nIn 1927, when the struggle reached an especially bitter stage, Stalin declared at a session of the Central Committee, addressing himself to the Opposition: \"Those cadres can be removed only by civil war!\" What was a threat in Stalin's words became, thanks to a series of defeats of the European proletariat, a historic fact. The road of reform was turned into a road of revolution.\u2014\u200a\nInternationally, Trotsky's opposition and criticism of the ruling troika received support from several, Central Committee members of foreign communist parties. This included Christian Rakovsky, Chairman of the Ukraine Sovnarkom, Boris Souvarine of the French Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party which was led by prominent theoreticians such as Maksymilian Horwitz, Maria Koszutska and Adolf Warski.\nThe defeat of the European working class led to further isolation in Russia and further suppression of the Opposition. Trotsky argued that the \"so-called struggle against 'Trotskyism' grew out of the bureaucratic reaction against the October Revolution [of 1917]\". He responded to the one-sided civil war with his \"Letter to the Bureau of Party History\" (1927), contrasting what he claimed to be the falsification of history with the official history of just a few years before. He further accused Stalin of derailing the Chinese Communist Revolution and causing the massacre of the Chinese workers: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the year 1918, Stalin, at the very outset of his campaign against me, found it necessary, as we have already learned, to write the following words:\n\"All the work of practical organization of the insurrection was carried out under the direct leadership of the Chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, comrade Trotsky...\" (Stalin, \"Pravda\", 6 November 1918)\nWith full responsibility for my words, I am now compelled to say that the cruel massacre of the Chinese proletariat and the Chinese Revolution at its three most important turning points, the strengthening of the position of the trade union agents of British imperialism after the General Strike of 1926, and, finally, the general weakening of the position of the Communist International and the Soviet Union, the party owes principally and above all to Stalin.\u2014\u200a\nTrotsky was sent into internal exile, and his supporters were jailed. For instance, Victor Serge first \"spent six weeks in a cell\" after a visit at midnight, then 85 days in an inner GPU cell, most of it in solitary confinement. He details the jailings of the Left Opposition. However, the Left Opposition worked secretly within the USSR. Trotsky was eventually exiled to Turkey and moved to France, Norway and finally Mexico.\nAfter 1928, the various Communist Parties worldwide expelled Trotskyists from their ranks. Most Trotskyists defend the economic achievements of the planned economy in the USSR during the 1920s and 1930s, despite the \"misleadership\" of the Soviet bureaucracy and what they claim to be the loss of democracy. Trotskyists claim that in 1928 inner party democracy and soviet democracy, which was at the foundation of Bolshevism, had been destroyed within the various Communist Parties. Anyone who disagreed with the party line was labelled a Trotskyist and even a fascist.\nFounding of the Fourth International.\nTrotsky founded the International Left Opposition in 1930. It was meant to be an opposition group within the Comintern, but anyone who joined or was suspected of joining the ILO was immediately expelled from the Comintern. The ILO, therefore, concluded that opposing Stalinism from within the communist organizations controlled by Stalin's supporters had become impossible, so new organizations had to be formed. In 1933, the ILO was renamed the International Communist League (ICL), which formed the basis of the Fourth International, founded in Paris in 1938.\nTrotsky said that only the Fourth International, based on Lenin's theory of the vanguard party, could lead the world revolution and that it would need to be built in opposition to the capitalists and the Stalinists.\nTrotsky argued that the defeat of the German working class and the coming to power of Adolf Hitler in 1933 was due in part to the mistakes of the Third Period policy of the Communist International and that the subsequent failure of the Communist Parties to draw the correct lessons from those defeats showed that they were no longer capable of reform and a new international organisation of the working class must be organised. The transitional demand tactic had to be a key element.\nAt the time of the founding of the Fourth International in 1938, Trotskyism was a mass political current in Vietnam, Sri Lanka and slightly later Bolivia. There was also a substantial Trotskyist movement in China which included the founding father of the Chinese communist movement, Chen Duxiu, amongst its number. Wherever Stalinists gained power, they prioritised hunting down Trotskyists and treated them as the worst enemies.\nThe Fourth International suffered repression and disruption through the Second World War. Isolated from each other and faced with political developments quite unlike those anticipated by Trotsky, some Trotskyist organizations decided that the USSR could no longer be called a degenerated workers' state and withdrew from the Fourth International. After 1945, Trotskyism was smashed as a mass movement in Vietnam and marginalised in many other countries.\nThe International Secretariat of the Fourth International (ISFI) organised an international conference in 1946 and then World Congresses in 1948 and 1951 to assess the expropriation of the capitalists in Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia, the threat of a Third World War and the tasks of revolutionaries. The Eastern European Communist-led governments, which came into being after World War II without a social revolution, were described by a resolution of the 1948 congress as presiding over capitalist economies. By 1951, the Congress had concluded that they had become \"deformed workers' states\". As the Cold War intensified, the ISFI's 1951 World Congress adopted theses by Michel Pablo that anticipated an international civil war. Pablo's followers considered that the Communist Parties, under pressure from the real workers' movement, could escape Stalin's manipulations and follow a revolutionary orientation.\nThe 1951 Congress argued that Trotskyists should start to conduct systematic work inside those Communist Parties, followed by the majority of the working class. However, the ISFI's view that the Soviet leadership was counterrevolutionary remained unchanged. The 1951 Congress argued that the USSR took over these countries because of the military and political results of World War II and instituted nationalized property relations only after its attempts at placating capitalism failed to protect those countries from the threat of incursion by the West.\nPablo began expelling many people who disagreed with his thesis and did not want to dissolve their organizations within the Communist Parties. For instance, he expelled most of the French section and replaced its leadership. As a result, the opposition to Pablo eventually rose to the surface, with the Open Letter to Trotskyists of the World, by Socialist Workers Party leader James P. Cannon.\nThe Fourth International split in 1953 into two public factions. Several sections of the International established the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) as an alternative centre to the International Secretariat, in which they felt a revisionist faction led by Michel Pablo had taken power and recommitted themselves to the Lenin-Trotsky Theory of the Party and Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution. From 1960, led by the U.S Socialist Workers Party, many ICFI sections began the reunification process with the IS, but factions split off and continued their commitment to the ICFI.\nCuban Revolution.\nHistorian Theodore Draper had been a Trotskyist in his youth, but eventually became a more independently minded historian, still skeptical of Stalinism. Draper originally gained scholarly recognition for his writings on the history of the American Communist Party.\nAfter the Cuban Revolution, a variety of socialist writers like C. Wright Mills, Paul Sweezy, Herbert Matthews, and Paul Johnson were delivering polemics in defense of the new \"Fidelista\" government. In 1961 Encounter magazine asked Theodore Draper to write an assessment of the Cuban Revolution and the new provisional government. Draper published \"Castro's Cuba - A Revolution Betrayed\" in which, Draper presents a Marxist analysis which claims that \"Castroism\" is a rudimentary nationalism which ignores the principles of Marxism, and that Fidel Castro is a demagogue. Draper also describes his \"Betrayal thesis\" by alluding to Trotsky's allegation that Stalin \"betrayed\" the Russian Revolution. Draper alleges that Castro had \"betrayed\" the Cuban Revolution in a similar manner.\nTrotskyists in general, were split about Castroism. Trotskyists like J. Posadas celebrated Castroism, and claimed that Cuba is on the road to socialism, while the British and French sections of the International Committee of the Fourth International, claimed that the Cuban Revolution only developed a form of state capitalism in Cuba.\nTrotskyist movements.\nLatin America.\nTrotskyism has influenced some recent major social upheavals, particularly in Latin America. The Bolivian Trotskyist party (, POR) became a mass party in the late 1940s and early 1950s and, together with other groups, played a central role during and immediately after the period termed the Bolivian National Revolution.\nIn Argentina, the Workers' Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores, PRT) lay in the merger of two leftist organizations in 1965, the Revolutionary and Popular Amerindian Front (, FRIP) and Worker's Word . In 1968, the PRT adhered to the Fourth International, based in Paris. That same year, a related organisation was founded in Argentina, the ERP (People's Revolutionary Army), which became South America's most powerful rural guerrilla movement during the 1970s. The PRT left the Fourth International in 1973. During the Dirty War, the Argentine military regime suppressed both the PRT and the ERP. ERP commander Roberto Santucho was killed in July 1976. Owing to the ruthless repression, PRT showed no signs of activity after 1977. During the 1980s in Argentina, the Trotskyist party founded in 1982 by Nahuel Moreno, MAS (, Movement for Socialism), claimed to be the \"largest Trotskyist party\" in the world before it broke into many different fragments in the late 1980s, including the present-day Workers' Socialist Movement (MST), Socialist Workers' Party (PTS), Socialist Left (IS), Self-determination and Freedom (AyL, which is not outspoken Trotskyist). In 1989, an electoral front with the Communist Party and MRS called (\"United Left\") retrieved 3.49% of the vote, representing 580,944 voters. The Workers' Party (Partido Obrero) in Argentina later founded with other Trotskyist groups the Workers' Left Front which is represented in parliament.\nVenezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez declared himself a Trotskyist during the swearing-in of his cabinet two days before his inauguration on 10 January 2007. Venezuelan Trotskyist organizations do not regard Ch\u00e1vez as a Trotskyist, with some describing him as a bourgeois nationalist. In contrast, others consider him an honest revolutionary leader who made significant mistakes due to his lack of a Marxist analysis.\nNorth America.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThey fear, in a word, that Soviet America will become the counterpart of what they have been told Soviet Russia looks like. Actually American soviets will be as different from the Russian soviets as the United States of President Roosevelt differs from the Russian Empire of Czar Nicholas II. Yet communism can come in America only through revolution, just as independence and democracy came in America.\nTrotsky on \"If American Should Go Communist\" in 1934.\nThe development of the American Trotskyism movement emerged with the Communist League of America (CLA), then as the Workers Party of the United States (WPUS) and briefly as the Socialist Party (SP) of America before beginning in 1938 as the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). According to historian Paul Le Blanc, James Cannon and Max Shachtman were the most influential leaders of early US Trotskyism.\nTrotsky engaged with members of the American Socialist Workers Party on reaching the Black population. He had correspondence with C.L.R. James on the question of self-determination and expressed support for Black Americans seeking equal rights and an autonomous state.\nIn 1953 there was a major split in the Fourth International between the International Secretariat of the Fourth International (ISFI) led by Michel Pablo and the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) led iniatially by James Cannon of the SWP. While a decade later in 1963 the majority of the SWP reunited with Pablo's supporters, a minority group persisted in their independence and criticisms of what they deemed to be the ISFI's abandonment of Permanent Revolution and their promotion of Stalinst regimes and parties. This group that remained loyal to the ICFI would go on to become the Socialist Equality Party (US). There is also another North American national section of the ICFI in Canada, also known as the Socialist Equality Party.\nThere is a Trotskyist-influenced caucus within the Democratic Socialists of America, Reform and Revolution.\nAfrica.\nThrough the 1930s, the first viable black trade unions in Transvaal were established by Trotskyists.\nThe Democratic Socialist Movement (Nigeria) exists in Nigeria, it was founded in 1986 among a confederation of labour and student socialists. It is affiliated to the Committee for a Workers' International.\nAsia.\nChina.\nIn China, various left opposition groups in the late 1920s sought to engage Trotsky against the Comintern policy of support for the Kuomintang. In 1931, at Trotsky's urging, the various factions united in the Communist League of China, adopting Trotsky's document \"The Political Situation in China and the Task of the Bolshevik-Leninist Opposition\". Prominent members include Chen Duxiu, Wang Fanxi and Chen Qichang. The League was persecuted by the Nationalist government and by the Chinese Communist Party.\nIn 1949, the Revolutionary Communist Party of China (; RCP) fled to Hong Kong. Since 1974, the party has been legally active as October Review, its official publication.\nVietnam.\nIn French Indochina during the 1930s, Vietnamese Trotskyism, led by T\u1ea1 Thu Th\u00e2u, was a significant current, particularly in Saigon, Cochinchina. In 1929, in the French Left Opposition , Ta Thu Thau condemned the Comintern for leading Chinese Communists (in 1927) to \"the graveyard\" through its support for the Kuomintang. The \"'Sun Yat-sen-ist' synthesis of democracy, nationalism and socialism\" was \"a kind of nationalist mysticism\". In Indochina, it could only obscure \"the concrete class relationships, and the real, organic liaison between the indigenous bourgeoisie and French imperialism,\" in the light of which the call for independence is \"mechanical and formalistic\". \"A revolution based on the organisation of the proletarian and peasant masses is the only one capable of liberating the colonies ... The question of independence must be bound up with that of the proletarian socialist revolution.\"\nFor a period in the 1930s, Ta Thu Thau's Struggle group, centred around the newspaper La Lutte, was sufficiently strong to induce \"Stalinists\" (members of the then Indochinese Communist Party) to collaborate with the Trotskyists in support of labour and peasant struggles, and in the presentation of a common Workers Slate for Saigon municipal, and Cochinchina Council, elections. Ta Thu Thau was captured and executed by the Communist-front \"Viet Minh\" in September 1945. Many, if not most, of his fellow \"luttuers\" were subsequently killed, caught between the Viet Minh and the French effort at colonial reconquest.\nSri Lanka.\nIn Sri Lanka, a group of Trotskyists (known as the \"T Group\"), including South Asia's pioneer Trotskyist, Philip Gunawardena, who had been active in Trotskyist politics in Europe, and his colleague N. M. Perera, were instrumental in the foundation of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) in 1935. It expelled its pro-Moscow wing in 1940, becoming a Trotskyist-led party. After a prison break it helped form the short lived Bolshevik\u2013Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI).\nAfter the war, the Sri Lanka section split into the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party (BSP). In the general election of 1947, the LSSP became the main opposition party, winning ten seats, the BSP winning a further 5. It joined the Trotskyist Fourth International after fusion with the BSP in 1950 and led a general strike (Hartal) in 1953.\nIn 1964 a faction of the LSSP broke away in response to the party joining the governing coalition of Sirimavo Bandaranaike and affiliated itself with the International Committee of the Fourth International who shared their critiques of Trotskyist parties joining bourgois governments. In 1968 they would officially form the Revolutionary Communist League which would eventually become the Socialist Equality Party in 1996. \nIn 1974, a secret faction of the LSSP, allied to the Militant group in the United Kingdom, emerged. In 1977, this faction was expelled and formed the Nava Sama Samaja Party, led by Vasudeva Nanayakkara.\nIndia.\nIn 1942, following the escape of the leaders of the Sri Lankan LSSP from a British prison, a unified Bolshevik\u2013Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI) was established in India, bringing together the many Trotskyist groups in the subcontinent. The BLPI was active in the Quit India Movement and the labour movement, capturing the second oldest union in India. Its high point was when it led the strikes which followed the Bombay Mutiny.\nIn India, the BLPI fractured. In 1948, at the Fourth International's request, the party's rump dissolved into the Congress Socialist Party as an exercise in entryism.\nEurope.\nSpain.\nIn the Spanish Civil War, Stalinist-directed NKVD oversaw purges of anti-Stalinist elements in the Spanish Republican forces including Trotskyist and anarchist factions. Notable cases involved the execution of Andreu Nin, former government minister in Revolutionary Catalonia, Jose Robles, a left-wing academic and translator along with many members of the Trotskyist-aligned POUM faction, such as Mary Stanley Low.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn Britain during the 1980s, the entryist Militant group operated within the Labour Party with three members of parliament and effective control of Liverpool City Council, and was described by journalist Michael Crick as \"Britain's fifth most important political party\" in 1986.\nOne of the more prominent Trotskyist parties in Britain has been the Socialist Workers Party, formerly the International Socialists (IS) and traces its history back to 1950. The SWP has helped found several organisations through which they have sought to exert influence over the broader left, such as the Anti-Nazi League in the late 1970s and the Stop the War Coalition in 2001. It also allied with George Galloway and Respect, whose dissolution in 2007 caused an internal crisis in the SWP. A more serious internal crisis, leading to a significant decline in the party's membership, emerged in 2013 over allegations of rape and sexual assault made against a leading party member. \nThe Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) was formed in 2010 between the Socialist Party, the SWP and Socialist Resistance, along with the RMT union, has participated in several general elections. The TUSC stood 40 candidates at the 2024 United Kingdom general election.\nIn April 2019, a 1970s splinter from IS made headlines when three former members of the Revolutionary Communist Party campaigned in the European Parliamentary election as candidates for the Brexit Party, and a fourth, Munira Mirza, was appointed head of the Number 10 Downing Street policy unit by the new Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The RCP's rejection of the SWP's critical engagement with the Labour Party and trade unions had morphed into embracing right-wing libertarian positions.\nIreland.\nThe Socialist Party in Ireland was formed in 1996 by members who had been expelled from the Labour Party in 1989 under the leadership of Dick Spring. It achieved electoral success at the 1997 general election with the election of Joe Higgins in Dublin West. The Socialist Party has been part of electoral alliances such as the United Left Alliance, Solidarity and People Before Profit\u2013Solidarity. As of 2024[ [update]], it is represented at a national level by Mick Barry, a TD for Cork North-Central. It contests elections in Northern Ireland as part of the Cross-Community Labour Alternative.\nPortugal.\nIn Portugal's October 2015 parliamentary election, the Left Bloc won 550,945 votes, translating into 10.19% of the expressed votes and 19 (out of 230) \"deputados\" (members of parliament). Although founded by several leftist tendencies, it still expresses much of the Trotskyist thought upheld and developed by its former leader, Francisco Lou\u00e7\u00e3.\nTurkey.\nIn Turkey, there are some Trotskyist organizations, including the International Socialist Tendency's section (Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party). The International Committee of the Fourth International's Turkish section, the Socialist Equality Party (formerly the Socialist Equality Group), have held several public meetings on the history of the Trotskyist movement on B\u00fcy\u00fckada, also known as Prinkipo, an island in the Sea of Marmara that served as Trotsky\u2019s first exiled home from 1929 to 1933 after being deported from the USSR.\nGermany.\nA section of the International Committee of the Fourth International has existed in Germany since 1971, originally founded as the Federation of Socialist Workers (\"Bund Sozialistischer Arbeiter\"), it adopted its current name Socialist Equality Party (\"Sozialistische Gleichheitspartei\") in 2017.\nFrance.\nThe Communist League was formed in 1930, becoming the first Trotskyist group in the country. French Trotskyists have historically faced internal splits and external repression, notably during World War II when their activities were banned. Postwar, French Trotskyism was shaped by significant divisions, such as the 1952 split between Lambertist and Pabloist factions, reflecting global tensions within the Fourth International. The movement gained public attention during events like the May 1968 protests, where Trotskyist groups, including the Revolutionary Communist League (LCR), played a prominent role.\nThe French section of the Fourth International was the Internationalist Communist Party (PCI). In 1952 the party split when the Fourth International removed its Central Committee and split again when in 1953, the Fourth International itself divided. Further divisions occurred over which independence faction to support in the Algerian War. In 1967, the rump of the PCI renamed itself the \"Internationalist Communist Organisation\" (, OCI). It proliferated during the May 1968 student demonstrations but was banned alongside other far-left groups, such as the (Proletarian Left). Members temporarily reconstituted the group as the Trotskyist Organisation but soon obtained a state order permitting the reformation of the OCI. By 1970, the OCI was able to organise a 10,000-strong youth rally. The group also gained a strong base in trade unions. However, further splits and disintegration followed.\nToday, France remains a hub for Trotskyist activity, represented by groups such as . In 2002, three trotskyist candidates ran in the election. Arlette Laguiller of got 5.72%, Olivier Besancenot of the Revolutionary Communist League () got 4.25% and Daniel Gluckstein of the Workers' Party () got 0.47%. In 2016 Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, formerly of the ICO, launched the left-wing political platform (Unbowed France), subsequently endorsed by several parties, including his own Left Party and the French Communist Party. In the 2017 French Presidential Election, he received 19% in the first round. In the same election, Philippe Poutou of the New Anticapitalist Party, into which the Revolutionary Communist League dissolved itself in 2008, won 1.20% of the vote. The only openly Trotskyist candidate, Nathalie Arthaud of Workers' Struggle, won 0.64% of the vote.\nInternationals.\nThe Fourth International derives from the 1963 reunification of the two public factions into which the Fourth International split in 1953: the International Secretariat of the Fourth International (ISFI) and some sections of the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). It is often referred to as the United Secretariat of the Fourth International, the name of its leading committee before 2003. The USFI retains sections and sympathizing organizations in over 50 countries, including France's \"Ligue Communiste Revolutionnaire\" (LCR) and sections in Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Pakistan.\nThe International Committee of the Fourth International maintains its independent organization and publishes the World Socialist Web Site. They have full sections in the US, UK, Canada, Germany, France, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Australia with sympathizing groups in Russia, Ukraine, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Croatia, Ireland, and other countries.\nThe Committee for a Workers' International (CWI) was founded in 1974 and has sections in over 35 countries. Before 1997, most organisations affiliated with the CWI sought to build an entrist Marxist wing within the large social democratic parties. The CWI has adopted a range of tactics, including working with trade unions, but in some cases working within or supporting other parties, endorsing Bernie Sanders for the 2016 U.S. Democratic Party nomination and encouraging him to run independently.\nIn France, the LCR is rivalled by , the French section of the Internationalist Communist Union (UCI), with small sections in a handful of other countries. It focuses its activities, whether propaganda or intervention, on the industrial proletariat.\nThe Committee for a Marxist International (CMI) founders claims they were expelled from the CWI when the CWI abandoned entryism. The CWI claims they left, and no expulsions were carried out. In 2006, it became the International Marxist Tendency (IMT). CMI/IMT groups continue the policy of entering mainstream social democratic, communist or radical parties. Known as the Revolutionary Communist International (RCI) since 2024, it is headed by Alan Woods.\nThe list of Trotskyist internationals shows that there are a large number of other multinational tendencies that stand in the tradition of Leon Trotsky.\nDebated comparison with Stalinism.\nSome Western historians have regarded Trotsky as a forerunner to Stalinism and centred this notion on his record during the period of war communism, which included practices such as the militarization of labour. Criticism has also been levied at his support for concentration camps to detain war prisoners and the Red Terror. Other historians such as Robert Service, Dmitri Volkogonov, N.A. Vasetskii and Alter Litvin contend that Trotsky shared the same totalitarian strand of thought as Stalin and would not have represented a radically different USSR. Concerning the ideological differences between the varieties of Marxist philosophy that are Stalinism and Trotskyism, novelist George Orwell said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The fact that Trotskyists are everywhere a persecuted minority, and that the accusation usually made against them, i.e. of collaborating with the Fascists, is obviously false, creates an impression that Trotskyism is intellectually and morally superior to Communism; but it is doubtful whether there is much difference.\nHowever, literary critic Jeffrey Meyers, who reviewed the political allegories in Orwell\u2019s work, stated that:\n\"Orwell ignores the fact that Trotsky passionately opposed Stalin\u2019s dictatorship from 1924 to 1940, which featured Siberian prison camps, the deliberately created Ukraine famine and the massive slaughter during the Moscow Purge Trials of 1937.\u201d\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u201cWith all the greater frankness can I state how, in my view, the Soviet government should act in case of a fascist upheaval in Germany. In their place, I would, at the very moment of receiving telegraphic news of this event, sign a mobilisation order calling up several age groups. In the face of a mortal enemy, when the logic of the situation points to inevitable war, it would be irresponsible and unpardonable to give that enemy time to establish himself, to consolidate his positions, to conclude alliances\u2026 and to work out the plan to attack.\u201d\nTrotsky describing the military measures he would have taken in place of Stalin to counter the rise of Nazi Germany in 1932.\nMeyers further added that Orwell reinforced his arguments by using the views of a right-wing combatant. In contrast, Meyers cited Isaac Deutscher's biographical account of Trotsky, which presented him to be a much more civilised figure than Stalin and suggested that he would not have purged the Red Army generals or millions of Soviet citizens.\nHistorian Sheila Fitzpatrick has also questioned the premise of historical inevitability presented by conservative critics such as Robert Service in that the Soviet Union would have experienced the same \"totalitarian despotism under Trotskyist rule\". Fitzpatrick suggested it was implausible that Trotsky, like Stalin, would have launched an anti-semitic campaign after World War II or initiated the Great Purges. Rather, she inferred that Trotsky would presumably have provided good leadership during the Second World War but may have struggled to maintain party cohesion as seen during the succession struggle after 1924.\nMoreover, several scholars such as Richard B.Day, Vadim Rogovin and Robert Vincent Daniels along with Western socialists have considered Trotsky to have represented a more democratic alternative to Stalin. In particular, emphasis has been drawn to his activities in the pre-Civil War period and as leader of the Left Opposition. Proponents of this view have specified further differences with Stalinism, which emerged during the succession struggle, over intraparty democracy, autonomy of the Comintern and the dogmatization of Leninist orthodoxy. Mandel and Deutscher maintain that his intra-party reforms from 1923-1926 would have revitalised party democratization, mass participation, worker's self-management and eventually a multi-party socialist democracy. Trotsky also opposed the policy of forced collectivisation under Stalin and favoured a voluntary, gradual approach towards agricultural production, with greater tolerance for the rights of Soviet Ukrainians. Daniels viewed Trotsky and the Left Opposition as a critical alternative to the Stalin-Bukharin majority in a number of areas. He also stated that the Left Opposition would have prioritised industrialisation but never contemplated the \"violent uprooting\" employed by Stalin and contrasted most directly with Stalinism on the issue of party democratization and bureaucratization.\nOther figures such as Baruch Knei-Paz and Victor Serge acknowledge some affinities with Stalinism in regards to the use of coercion but have also recognised clear differences between Trotsky and Stalin. On the cultural field, Knei-Paz highlighted their contrasting attitudes towards matters such as the arts and sciences. According to Knei-Paz, it does not seem credible that Trotsky would have treated culture and society with the same total, brutal disregard as Stalin. He also argued that Trotsky sought far-reaching economic, commercial relations with European countries which was at variance with the economic policy of isolationism and harsher measures pursued under Stalin. In the view of Knei-Paz, the most discernible difference between Trotsky and Stalin was their respective approaches towards international affairs. In this matter, Trotsky firmly adhered to the notion that socialism in Russia, as \u201cbackward society\u201d was dependent on revolution in the West. Biographer Geoffrey Swain believed that the Soviet Union under the leadership of Trotsky would have been more technocratic as he would have made far more use of \"bourgeois experts\" in the planning process, and inferred this from his conduct during the Civil War along with his writings in the early 1920s. Swain also expressed the view that the Soviet Union under Trotsky would certainly have been a less terrorised society yet was critical of his military methods in relation to desertion and hostage taking during the Civil War.\nIn post-exile, Trotsky challenged claims from American socialist Norman Thomas that the Soviet Union would have been no better under his leadership. Trotsky countered that it was not a question of personalities but opposing, social interests represented by the bureaucracy and the working class. More specifically, Trotsky attributed the retraction of the progressive gains of the October revolution, the mass purge and Soviet foreign policy as seen in Spanish Civil War to the interests of the bureaucracy rather than the socialist proletariat or Bolshevik tradition. He asserted that the excessive form of totalitarianism under Stalinism would not have emerged under his variant of Bolshevism. Comparatively, he viewed his interpretation of Marxism to represent a political and moral regeneration of the Soviet Union against the Stalinist bureaucracy.\nSeparately, Trotsky would defend his military decisions as necessary, making a comparison between his military endeavours with Abraham Lincoln's ruthlessness during the American Civil War. Deutscher drew attention to the fact that Trotsky preferred to exchange hostages and prisoners rather than execute them. He recounts that Trotsky had released General Krasnov on parole in 1918 after the Kerensky\u2013Krasnov uprising during the initial stage of the Civil War, but the general would take up arms against the Soviets shortly afterwards.\nTrotskyist theoreticians have disputed the view that the Stalinist dictatorship was a natural outgrowth of the Bolsheviks' actions as most of the original, central committee members from 1917 were later eliminated by Stalin. George Novack stressed the initial efforts by the Bolsheviks to form a multi-party government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and bring other parties such as the Mensheviks into political legality. Upon the Menshevik \nwalkout from the Soviet congress, Trotsky released a number of arrested, socialist ministers of the Provisional government from prison, at the request of Julius Martov. Tony Cliff argued the Bolshevik-Left Socialist Revolutionary coalition government dissolved the Constituent Assembly due to a number of reasons. They cited the outdated voter rolls, which did not acknowledge the split among the Socialist Revolutionary party and the assemblies' conflict with the Congress of the Soviets as an alternative democratic structure.\nCriticism.\nTrotskyism has been criticised from various directions. In 1935, Marxist\u2013Leninist Moissaye J. Olgin argued that Trotskyism was \"the enemy of the working class\" and \"should be shunned by anybody who has sympathy for the revolutionary movement of the exploited and oppressed the world over.\" The African American Marxist\u2013Leninist Harry Haywood, who spent much time in the USSR during the 1920s and 1930s, stated that although he had been somewhat interested in Trotsky's ideas when he was young, he came to see it as \"a disruptive force on the fringes of the international revolutionary movement\" which eventually developed into \"a counter-revolutionary conspiracy against the Party and the Soviet state\". He continued to put forward his following belief:\nTrotsky was not defeated by bureaucratic decisions or Stalin's control of the Party apparatus\u2014as his partisans and Trotskyite historians claim. He had his day in court and finally lost because his whole position flew in the face of Soviet and world realities. He was doomed to defeat because his ideas were incorrect and failed to conform to objective conditions, as well as the needs and interests of the Soviet people.\nOther figures associated with Marxism\u2013Leninism criticized Trotskyist political theory, including R\u00e9gis Debray and Earl Browder.\nIn 1966, Fidel Castro said that \"Even though at one time Trotskyism represented an erroneous position, but a position in the field of political ideas, Trotskyism became during the following years a vulgar instrument of imperialism and reaction.\"\nPolish philosopher Leszek Ko\u0142akowski wrote: \"Both Trotsky and Bukharin were emphatic in their assurances that forced labour was an organic part of the new society.\"\nSociologist Peter Beilharz was critical of Trotskyism and viewed it as the most complete expression of Jacobinism. Although, Beiharz acknowledged that Trotsky had opposed Jacobinism as a young democrat but in his view had extended the tradition during the period of war communism and through his ideological defence of terror. On the other hand, historian Paul Le Blanc found Beilharz's historical comparisons between Trotsky and earlier Jacobin figures to be unconvincing and suggested his analogies were more centred in rhetoric rather than in analysis due to his blurring of ideological concepts.\nSome left communists, such as Paul Mattick, claim that the October Revolution was totalitarian from the start. Therefore, Trotskyism has no fundamental differences from Stalinism in practice or theory. French historian and Trotskyist Pierre Broue rejected this form of criticism and characterised it in the following way:\"The theory according to which Stalin and Trotsky were two rival wild beasts is useful for historians serving those in power: the establishment of an equivalence between Stalinism and Trotskyism aids the idea of a continuity from Bolshevism and Leninism to Stalinism and strengthens a regime which fears revolutionary sentiments\".\nBritish historian Christian H\u00f8gsbjerg believed that the academic literature and wider criticisms of Trotskyist organisations had minimised their historical role in building wider social movements. H\u00f8gsbjerg stressed the key role of British Trotskyists in various movements such as the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign (1966\u201371), the Anti-Nazi League (1977\u201381), the Anti Poll Tax Federation (1989\u201391) and the Stop the War Coalition (2001).\nIn the United States, Dwight Macdonald broke with Trotsky and left the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party by raising the question of the Kronstadt rebellion, which Trotsky, as leader of the Soviet Red Army, and the other Bolsheviks had brutally repressed. He then moved towards democratic socialism and anarchism. The Lithuanian-American anarchist Emma Goldman raised a similar critique of Trotsky's role in the events around the Kronstadt rebellion. In her essay \"Trotsky Protests Too Much\", she says: \"I admit, the dictatorship under Stalin's rule has become monstrous. That does not, however, lessen the guilt of Leon Trotsky as one of the actors in the revolutionary drama of which Kronstadt was one of the bloodiest scenes\".\nTrotsky defended the actions of the Red Army in his essay \"Hue and Cry over Kronstadt\". He would also argue that the attitudes and social composition of the Kronstadt sailors had changed during the Civil War. Trotsky further argued that the isolated location of the naval fortress would have enabled financial funding to flow between Kronstadt and White army emigres. Separately, he would also argue that he and Lenin had intended to lift the ban on the opposition parties such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries as soon as the economic and social conditions of Soviet Russia had improved after the Civil War.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As such, he was the consort of the British monarch from his wife's accession on 6\u00a0February 1952 until his death in 2021, making him the longest-serving royal consort in history.\nPhilip was born in Greece into the Greek and Danish royal families; his family was exiled from the country when he was eighteen months old. After being educated in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, he joined the Royal Navy in 1939, when he was 18 years old. In July 1939, Philip began corresponding with the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heir presumptive of King George\u00a0VI. During the Second World War, he served with distinction in the British Mediterranean and Pacific fleets.\nIn the summer of 1946, the King granted Philip permission to marry Elizabeth, then aged 20. Before the official announcement of their engagement in July 1947, Philip stopped using his Greek and Danish royal titles and styles, became a naturalised British subject, and adopted his maternal grandparents' surname Mountbatten. In November 1947, he married Elizabeth, was granted the style \"His Royal Highness\" and was created Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich. Philip left active military service when Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1952, having reached the rank of commander. In 1957, he was created a British prince. Philip had four children with Elizabeth: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.\nA sports enthusiast, Philip helped develop the equestrian event of carriage driving. He was patron, president, or member of over 780 organisations, including the World Wide Fund for Nature, and served as chairman of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, a youth awards programme for people aged 14 to 24. Philip is the longest-lived male member of the British royal family. He retired from royal duties in 2017, aged 96, having completed 22,219 solo engagements and 5,493 speeches since 1952, and died two months before his 100th birthday at Windsor Castle.\nEarly life and education.\nFamily, infancy and exile from Greece.\nPhilip () was born on 10\u00a0June 1921 on the dining room table at Mon Repos, a villa on the Greek island of Corfu. He was the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and his wife, Princess Alice of Battenberg. Philip's father was the fourth son of King George\u00a0I and Queen Olga of Greece, and his mother was the eldest child of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, and Victoria Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven (formerly Prince Louis of Battenberg and Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine). A member of the House of Gl\u00fccksburg, Philip was a prince of both Greece and Denmark by virtue of his patrilineal descent from George\u00a0I of Greece and George's father, Christian\u00a0IX of Denmark; he was from birth in the line of succession to both thrones. Philip's four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie. He was baptised in the Greek Orthodox rite at St.\u00a0George's Church in the Old Fortress in Corfu. His godparents were his paternal grandmother, Queen Olga of Greece; his cousin George, Crown Prince of Greece; his uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten; and the municipality of Corfu, represented by its mayor, Alexandros Kokotos, and by the president of the council, Stylianos Maniarizis.\nShortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather died in London. The Marquess of Milford Haven was a naturalised British subject who, after a career in the Royal Navy, had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten\u2014an Anglicised version of Battenberg\u2014during the First World War, owing to anti-German sentiment in the United Kingdom. After visiting London for his grandfather's memorial service, Philip and his mother returned to Greece, where Prince Andrew had remained to command a Greek Army division embroiled in the Greco-Turkish War.\nGreece suffered significant losses in the war, while the Turks made substantial gains. Philip's uncle and high commander of the Greek expeditionary force, King Constantine\u00a0I, was blamed for the defeat and was forced to abdicate in September 1922. The new military government arrested Andrew, along with others. General Georgios Hatzianestis, who was commanding officer of the army, and five senior politicians were arrested, tried, and executed in the Trial of the Six. Andrew's life was also believed to be in danger and Alice was under surveillance. Finally, in December, a revolutionary court banished Andrew from Greece for life. The British naval vessel evacuated Andrew's family, with Philip carried to safety in a fruit box.\nUpbringing in France, Britain and Germany.\nPhilip's family settled in a house in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud lent to them by his wealthy aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark. During his time there, Philip was first educated at The Elms, an American school in Paris run by Donald MacJannet, who described Philip as a \"know it all smarty person, but always remarkably polite\". In 1930 Philip was sent to Britain to live with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire. He was then enrolled at Cheam School. Over the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and placed in an asylum, and his father took up residence in Monte Carlo. Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood.\nIn 1933 Philip was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, which had the \"advantage of saving school fees\", because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law Berthold, Margrave of Baden. With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Salem's Jewish founder, Kurt Hahn, fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun School in Scotland, to which Philip moved after two terms at Salem. In 1937, his sister Cecilie; her husband, Georg Donatus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse; their two sons; and Georg Donatus's mother were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then 16 years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt. Cecilie and Georg Donatus were members of the Nazi Party. The following year, Philip's uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of bone marrow cancer. Milford Haven's younger brother Lord Louis took parental responsibility for Philip for the remainder of his youth.\nPhilip did not speak Greek because he had left Greece as an infant. In 1992 he said that he \"could understand a certain amount\". He stated that he thought of himself as Danish and spoke mostly English, while his family was multilingual. Known for his charm in his youth, Philip was linked to several women, including Osla Benning.\nNaval and wartime service.\nAfter leaving Gordonstoun in early 1939, Philip completed a term as a cadet at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, then repatriated to Greece, living with his mother in Athens for a month in mid-1939. At the behest of King George\u00a0II of Greece, his first cousin, he returned to Britain in September to resume training for the Royal Navy. He graduated from Dartmouth the next year as the best cadet in his course. During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christoph of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side. Philip was appointed as a midshipman in January 1940. He spent four months on the battleship , protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on , on , and in British Ceylon. After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship in the Mediterranean Fleet.\nPhilip was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant on 1\u00a0February 1941 after a series of courses at Portsmouth, in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination. Among other engagements, he was involved in the Battle of Crete and was mentioned in dispatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship's searchlights. He was also awarded the Greek War Cross. In June 1942, he was appointed to the destroyer , which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the Allied invasion of Sicily.\nPromotion to lieutenant followed on 16\u00a0July 1942. That October Philip, aged 21, became first lieutenant of HMS \"Wallace\", one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy. During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, he was second-in-command of \"Wallace\". The ship was attacked at night by German aircraft, which would return to finish off the damaged ship; it was saved by Philip's devising a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully decoyed the bombers, allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed. In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, , where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla. He was present in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the \"Whelp\" in January 1946 and was posted as an instructor at , the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire.\nMarriage.\nIn 1939 King George\u00a0VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. During the visit, the Queen and Lord Louis Mountbatten asked his nephew Philip to escort the royal couple's daughters, 13-year-old Elizabeth and 9-year-old Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and second cousins once removed through King Christian\u00a0IX of Denmark. Philip and Elizabeth had first met as children in 1934 at the wedding of Elizabeth's uncle Prince George, Duke of Kent, to Philip's first cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark. After their 1939 meeting, Elizabeth fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters.\nEventually, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked George\u00a0VI for his daughter's hand in marriage. The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's 21st birthday the following April. By March 1947, Philip had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother's family and had stopped using his Greek and Danish royal titles upon becoming a naturalised British subject. The engagement was announced to the public on 9\u00a0July 1947.\nThe engagement attracted some controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born, and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links. Marion Crawford wrote: \"Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin.\" Later biographies reported that Elizabeth's mother had reservations about the union initially and teased Philip as \"the Hun\". In later life, however, she told the biographer Tim Heald that Philip was \"an English gentleman\".\nThough Philip appeared \"always to have regarded himself as an Anglican\", and he had attended Anglican services with his classmates and relations in England and throughout his Royal Navy days, he was baptised in the Greek Orthodox Church. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, wanted to \"regularise\" Philip's position by officially receiving him into the Church of England, which he did in October 1947. The day before the wedding, the King bestowed the style of \"Royal Highness\" on Philip, and, on the morning of the wedding, 20\u00a0November 1947, he was made the Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich in the County of London. Consequently, being already a Knight of the Garter, between 19 and 20\u00a0November 1947, he bore the unusual style Lieutenant His Royal Highness Sir Philip Mountbatten and is so described in the letters patent of 20\u00a0November 1947.\nPhilip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200\u00a0million people around the world. In post-war Britain, it was unacceptable for any of Philip's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding. After their marriage, Philip and Elizabeth took residence at Clarence House. Their first two children were born before Elizabeth's accession in 1952: Prince Charles in November 1948 and Princess Anne in August 1950. The couple's marriage was the longest of any British monarch, lasting over 73 years until Philip died in 2021. Concerned by her father's poor health, Elizabeth insisted that Philip give up smoking, which he did on their wedding day.\nPhilip was introduced to the House of Lords on 21\u00a0July 1948, immediately before his uncle Louis Mountbatten, who had been made Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Philip ostensibly never spoke in the House of Lords. He, his sons and other royals ceased to be members of the House of Lords following the House of Lords Act 1999, although Philip's former brother-in-law, Lord Snowdon, remained in the House.\nEarly duties.\nAfter his honeymoon at the Mountbatten family home, Broadlands, Philip returned to the navy, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich. From 1949 he was stationed in Malta (residing at Villa Guardamangia) after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer , the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 16\u00a0July 1950 and given command of the frigate . Philip was promoted to commander on 30\u00a0June 1952, though his active naval career had ended in July 1951.\nWith the King in ill health, Elizabeth and Philip were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4\u00a0November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada. At the end of January 1952, the couple set out on a tour of the Commonwealth. They were in Kenya when Elizabeth's father died on 6\u00a0February 1952, and she became queen. Philip broke the news to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge, and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom.\nIn December 1952, Philip was initiated into Freemasonry by the Worshipful Master of Navy Lodge No\u00a02612, honouring a commitment he had made to George\u00a0VI, who had made it clear that he expected Philip to maintain the tradition of royal patronage of Freemasonry. However, according to one journalist writing in 1983, Philip's mother-in-law and his uncle Lord Mountbatten had unfavourable views of Freemasonry; after his initiation, Philip took no further part in the organisation. Although as the consort of the Queen, he might in time have been made Grand Master of British Freemasonry, Elizabeth's cousin Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, assumed that role in 1967. Philip's son Charles apparently never joined Freemasonry.\nConsort of the Queen.\nRoyal house.\nElizabeth's accession to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name upon marriage. Lord Mountbatten advocated the name \"House of Mountbatten\". Philip suggested \"House of Edinburgh\" after his ducal title. When Elizabeth's grandmother Queen Mary heard of this, she informed Winston Churchill, who later advised Elizabeth to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor. Philip privately complained, \"I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\"\nIn February 1960, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that Mountbatten-Windsor would be the surname of the couple's male-line descendants who are not styled as Royal Highness or titled as prince or princess. While it seems Elizabeth had \"absolutely set her heart\" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only 11 days before the birth of their third child, Prince Andrew, and only after three months of protracted correspondence between English constitutional expert Edward Iwi (who averred that, without such a change, the royal child would be born with \"the Badge of Bastardy\") and Harold Macmillan, who had attempted to refute Iwi's arguments. Elizabeth and Philip's fourth child, Prince Edward, was born in March 1964.\nSix months after she acceded to the throne, Elizabeth announced that Philip was to have \"place, pre-eminence and precedence\" next to her \"on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament\". She also intervened to ensure that Philip would serve as regent for their son Charles in the event of her unexpected death. Parliament passed a bill to that effect in 1953. Contrary to rumours over the years, Elizabeth and Philip were said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth's reign. Elizabeth referred to Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her \"constant strength and guide\".\nPhilip received a Parliamentary annuity (of \u00a3359,000 since 1990) to meet official expenses in carrying out public duties. The annuity was unaffected by the reform of royal finances under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011. Any part of the allowance that was not used to meet official expenditure was liable for tax. In practice, the entire allowance was used to fund his official duties.\nSupporting the Queen.\nAs consort, Philip supported his wife in her duties as sovereign, accompanying her to ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament in various countries, state dinners, and tours abroad. As chairman of the Coronation Commission, he was the first member of the royal family to fly in a helicopter, visiting the troops that were to take part in the ceremony. Philip was not himself crowned in the coronation service, but knelt before Elizabeth, with her hands enclosing his, and swore to be her \"liege man of life and limb\". For six months, spanning 1953 and 1954, they toured the Commonwealth; as was customary during previous tours, the children remained in Britain.\nIn the early 1950s, Philip's sister-in-law, Princess Margaret, considered marrying a divorced older man, Peter Townsend. The press accused Philip of being hostile to the match, to which he replied: \"I haven't done anything.\" Eventually, Margaret and Townsend parted. In 1960 Margaret married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; Margaret did not remarry.\nIn 1956 Philip and Kurt Hahn founded The Duke of Edinburgh's Award to give young people \"a sense of responsibility to themselves and their communities\". In the same year, he also established the Commonwealth Study Conferences. From 1956 to 1957, he travelled around the world aboard the newly commissioned , during which he opened the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne and visited the Antarctic, becoming the first royal to cross the Antarctic Circle. Elizabeth and the children remained in Britain. On the return leg of the journey, Philip's private secretary, Mike Parker, was sued for divorce by his wife. As with Townsend, the press still portrayed divorce as a scandal, and eventually, Parker resigned. He later said that Philip was very supportive and \"the Queen was wonderful throughout. She regarded divorce as a sadness, not a hanging offence.\" In a public show of support, Elizabeth created Parker a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.\nFurther press reports claimed that the royal couple were drifting apart, which enraged Philip and dismayed Elizabeth, who issued a strongly worded denial. She granted him the style and title of a Prince of the United Kingdom by Letters Patent on 22\u00a0February 1957; it was gazetted that Philip was to be known as \"His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh\". Philip was appointed to the Queen's Privy Council for Canada on 14\u00a0October 1957, taking his Oath of Allegiance before the Queen in person at her Canadian residence, Rideau Hall. Remarks he made two years later to the Canadian Medical Association on the subject of youth and sport were taken as a suggestion that Canadian children were out of shape. This was at first considered \"tactless\", but Philip was later admired for his encouragement of physical fitness. While in Canada in 1969, he spoke about his views on republicanism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is a complete misconception to imagine that the monarchy exists in the interests of the monarch. It doesn't. It exists in the interests of the people. If at any time any nation decides that the system is unacceptable, then it is up to them to change it.\nIn 1960 Philip attended the National Eisteddfod of Wales wearing a long green robe, where he was initiated as an Honorary Ovate by the Archdruid of Wales Edgar Phillips through his bardic name \"Philip Meirionnydd\", to reflect his title of Earl of Merioneth. In 1961 he became the first member of the royal family to be interviewed on television, after he appeared on \"Panorama\" to answer questions by Richard Dimbleby about the Commonwealth Technical Training Week, an initiative of which he was patron. In 1969 he made a similar appearance on \"Meet the Press\" during a tour of North America.\nCharities and patronages.\nPhilip was patron of some 800 organisations, particularly focused on the environment, industry, sport, and education. His first solo engagement as Duke of Edinburgh was in March 1948, presenting prizes at the boxing finals of the London Federation of Boys' Clubs at the Royal Albert Hall. He was president of the National Playing Fields Association (now known as Fields in Trust) for 64 years, from 1947 until his grandson Prince William took over the role in 2013. He was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society in 1951. In 1952, he became patron of The Industrial Society (since renamed The Work Foundation). In the same year, and after his father-in-law's death, he took over the role of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park, overseeing its protection and maintenance. From 1955 to 1957, Philip was president of The Football Association and also served two terms as president of the Marylebone Cricket Club, with his tenures starting in 1949 and 1974, respectively. In the same decade, he became the first patron of Lord's Taverners, a youth cricket and disability sports charity, for which he organised fundraising events. Between 1959 and 1965 Philip was the president of BAFTA. He helped found the Australian Conservation Foundation in 1963 and the World Wildlife Fund in 1961 and served as the latter's UK president from 1961 to 1982, international president from 1981, and president emeritus from 1996. He was also president of the Zoological Society of London for two decades and was appointed an honorary fellow in 1977. Despite his involvement in initiatives for conserving nature, he was also criticised for practices such as fox hunting, shooting of game birds and the killing of a tiger in India in 1961. He was president of the International Equestrian Federation from 1964 to 1986. In 1980 he became world champion in four-in-hand driving with the British national team. He served as chancellor of the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Salford, and Wales. In 1965, at the suggestion of Harold Wilson, Philip became chair to a scheme set up for awarding industrial innovations, which later became known as The Queen's Awards for Enterprise. In the same year, Philip became president of the Council of Engineering Institutions and in that capacity he assisted with the inception of the Fellowship of Engineering (later the Royal Academy of Engineering), of which he later became the senior fellow. He also commissioned the Prince Philip Designers Prize and the Prince Philip Medal to recognise designers and engineers with exceptional contributions. In 1970 he was involved with the founding of The Maritime Trust for restoring and preserving historic British ships. In 2017 the British Heart Foundation thanked Philip for being its patron for 55 years, during which time, in addition to organising fundraisers, he \"supported the creation of nine BHF-funded centres of excellence\". He was an honorary fellow of St\u00a0Edmund's College, Cambridge.\nCharles and Diana.\nAt the beginning of 1981 Philip wrote to his son Charles counselling him to make up his mind to either propose to Lady Diana Spencer or break off their courtship. Charles felt pressured by his father to make a decision and did so, proposing to Diana in February. They married five months later. By 1992 the marriage had broken down. Elizabeth and Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana, trying to effect a reconciliation, but without success. Philip wrote to Diana, expressing his disappointment at Charles's and her extra-marital affairs and asking her to examine both his and her behaviour from the other's point of view. She found the letters hard to take but appreciated that he acted with good intent. Charles and Diana separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.\nA year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31\u00a0August 1997. At the time, Philip was on holiday at Balmoral with the extended royal family. In their grief, Diana's sons, Princes William and Harry, wanted to attend church, so Elizabeth and Philip took them that morning. For five days, the royal couple shielded their grandsons from the ensuing press interest by keeping them at Balmoral, where they could grieve in private. The royal family's seclusion caused public dismay, but the public mood changed after a live broadcast made by Elizabeth on 5\u00a0September. Uncertain as to whether they should walk behind their mother's coffin during the funeral procession, William and Harry hesitated. Philip told William: \"If you don't walk, I think you'll regret it later. If I walk, will you walk with me?\" On the day of the funeral, Philip, William, Harry, Charles, and Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, walked through London behind her gun carriage. Over the next few years, Mohamed Al-Fayed, whose son Dodi Fayed was also killed in the crash, claimed that Philip had ordered the death of Diana and that the accident was staged. The inquest into Diana's death concluded in 2008 that there was no evidence of a conspiracy.\nIn October 1994, Prince Philip became the first member of the British royal family to visit Israel. He travelled to Jerusalem to attend a ceremony at Yad Vashem honouring his mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, who had been recognised as one of the Righteous Among the Nations for sheltering members of a Jewish family during the Nazi occupation of Greece.\nLongevity.\nIn April 2009, Philip became the longest-serving British royal consort, surpassing Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of George\u00a0III. He became the oldest-ever male British royal in February 2013 and the third-longest-lived member of the British royal family (following Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) in April 2019. Personally, he was not enthused about living an extremely long life, remarking in a 2000 interview (when he was 79) that he could not \"imagine anything worse\" and had \"no desire whatsoever\" to become a centenarian, saying \"bits of me are falling off already\".\nIn 2008 Philip was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital, London, for a chest infection; he walked into the hospital unaided, recovered quickly, and was discharged three days later. After the \"Evening Standard\" reported that Philip had prostate cancer, Buckingham Palace\u2014which usually refuses to comment on health rumours\u2014denied the story and the paper retracted it.\nIn June 2011, in an interview marking his 90th birthday, Philip said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties, stating that he had \"done [his] bit\". The Queen gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday. While staying at Sandringham House in December 2011, Philip suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio-thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting. He was discharged a few days later.\nIn June 2012, during the celebrations in honour of his wife's diamond jubilee, Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to King Edward VII's Hospital suffering from a bladder infection. He was subsequently discharged. After a recurrence of infection in August 2012, while staying at Balmoral Castle, he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure. In June 2013, Philip was admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen, spending 11 days in hospital. In May 2014, he appeared in public with a bandage on his right hand after a \"minor procedure\" was performed in Buckingham Palace the preceding day. In June 2017, Philip was taken from Windsor to London and admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital after being diagnosed with an infection. He spent two nights in the hospital and was unable to attend the State Opening of Parliament and Royal Ascot.\nFinal years and retirement.\nPhilip retired from royal duties on 2\u00a0August 2017, meeting Royal Marines in his final solo public engagement, aged 96. Since 1952, he had completed 22,219 solo engagements. British prime minister Theresa May thanked him for \"a remarkable lifetime of service\". On 20\u00a0November 2017, he celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary with Elizabeth, which made her the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary.\nIn April 2018, Philip was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital for a planned hip replacement. This came after the Duke missed the annual Maundy and Easter Sunday services. Princess Anne spent about 50 minutes in the hospital and afterwards said her father was \"on good form\". He was discharged the next day. In May that year, he attended the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and was able to walk with Elizabeth unaided. That October, he also accompanied Elizabeth to the wedding of their granddaughter Princess Eugenie of York with Jack Brooksbank, with \"The Telegraph\" reporting that Philip works on a \"wake up and see how I feel\" basis when deciding whether to attend an event or not.\nIn January 2019, Philip was involved in a car collision as he drove out onto a main road near the Sandringham Estate. An official statement said he was uninjured. An eyewitness who helped him out of his car said there was \"a little bit of blood\". The driver and a passenger of the other car were injured and taken to hospital. Philip attended hospital the next morning as a precaution. He apologised, and three weeks later voluntarily surrendered his driving licence. In February, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that prosecuting Philip would not be in the public interest. Philip was still allowed to drive around private estates, and was seen behind the wheel in the grounds of Windsor Castle in April 2019.\nIn December 2019, Philip stayed at King Edward VII's Hospital and received treatment for a \"pre-existing condition\" in a visit described by Buckingham Palace as a \"precautionary measure\". He had not been seen in public since attending Lady Gabriella Windsor's wedding in May 2019. A photo of the royal couple as they isolated at Windsor Castle during the COVID-19 pandemic was released ahead of his 99th birthday in June 2020. In July 2020, he stepped down as Colonel-in-Chief of The Rifles, a position he had held since 2007. He was succeeded by his daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.\nIn January 2021, Philip and Elizabeth were vaccinated against COVID-19 by a household doctor at Windsor Castle. In February 2021, Philip was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital as a \"precautionary measure\" after feeling unwell; he was visited by Prince Charles. Buckingham Palace confirmed that Philip was \"responding to treatment\" for an infection. In March, Philip was transferred by ambulance to St\u00a0Bartholomew's Hospital to continue treatment for an infection, and to undergo \"testing and observation\" relating to a pre-existing heart condition. He underwent a successful procedure for his heart condition and was transferred back to King Edward VII's Hospital. He was discharged a week later and returned to Windsor Castle.\nDeath.\nPhilip died of \"old age\" on the morning of 9\u00a0April 2021 at Windsor Castle, at the age of 99. He was the longest-serving royal consort in world history. Elizabeth described his death as \"having left a huge void in her life\".\nThe palace said Philip died peacefully, which was confirmed by his daughter-in-law Sophie, Countess of Wessex, who told the press it was \"so gentle. It was just like somebody took him by the hand and off he went.\" His death led to the commencement of Operation Forth Bridge, the plan for publicly announcing his death and organising his funeral. The usual public ceremonial could not take place because of the regulations for the COVID-19 pandemic which restricted the number of mourners to thirty; it was later reported in the press that Elizabeth had rejected a government offer to relax the rules. The funeral took place on 17\u00a0April 2021 at St\u00a0George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and Philip was temporarily interred alongside 25 other coffins, including that of George\u00a0III, in the Royal Vault inside St\u00a0George's. Representatives of countries around the world sent condolences to the royal family upon his death.\nAs with other senior members of the royal family, Philip's last will and testament will be sealed for at least 90 years, according to a High Court ruling, which deemed it necessary to protect the Sovereign's \"dignity and standing\". This led to speculation that the will might contain material harmful to the reputation of the royal family. The order was made by the President of the Family Division after a private hearing in July 2021, who said that he had neither seen the will nor been informed of any of its contents. In January 2022, \"The Guardian\" challenged the judge's decision to exclude the press from that hearing, arguing that the judge had \"erred by failing to consider any lesser interference with open justice than a private hearing\", and the newspaper was granted leave to appeal. In July 2022, the Court of Appeal dismissed the newspaper's arguments, stating that the press could not have been informed of the hearing \"without risking the media storm that was feared\". The court added that \"a perceived lack of transparency might be a matter of legitimate public debate, but the (Non-Contentious Probate Rules) allow wills and their values to be concealed from the public gaze in some cases\".\nA service of thanksgiving for Philip's life took place at Westminster Abbey on 29\u00a0March 2022, with Elizabeth, foreign royalty and politicians in attendance. Elizabeth died on 8\u00a0September 2022 and the royal couple's bodies were interred in the King George VI Memorial Chapel at St\u00a0George's on the evening of 19\u00a0September after her state funeral.\nLegacy.\nInterests.\nPhilip played polo until 1971 when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped to expand; the sport's early rule book was drafted under his supervision. He was also a keen yachtsman and struck up a friendship in 1949 with boat designer and sailing enthusiast Uffa Fox in Cowes.\nPhilip's first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952, and by his 70th birthday, he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours. He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953, helicopter wings with the Royal Navy in 1956, and his private pilot's licence in 1959. After 44 years as a pilot, he retired in August 1997 with 5,986 hours spent in 59 different aircraft. In April 2014, it was reported that an old British Path\u00e9 newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of South America. Filmed sitting alongside him at the aircraft's controls was his co-pilot Captain Peter Middleton, the grandfather of Philip's granddaughter-in-law Catherine. In 1959, Philip flew solo in a Druine Turbulent, becoming the first and, as of April 2021,[ [update]] the only member of the royal family to have flown a single-seat aircraft.\nPhilip painted with oils and collected artworks, including contemporary cartoons, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle. Hugh Casson described Philip's own artwork as \"exactly what you'd expect\u00a0... totally direct, no hanging about. Strong colours, vigorous brushstrokes.\" He was patron of the Royal Society of Arts from 1952 until 2011. He was \"fascinated\" by cartoons about the monarchy and the royal family and was a patron of The Cartoon Museum.\nPersonality and image.\nPhilip's down-to-earth manner was attested to by a White House butler, who recalled that, on a visit in 1976, Philip engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation and poured them drinks. As well as having a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip was noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that were construed as funny or typical for someone of his age and background by some, but as gaffes, awkward, politically incorrect, or even offensive by others. In an address to the General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: \"Dontopedalogy is the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years.\" Later in life, he suggested his comments may have contributed to the perception that he was \"a cantankerous old sod\".\nIn a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's Northwest University during a state visit to China in 1986, Philip joked: \"If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed.\" The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go \"round-eyed\". His comment did not affect Sino-British relations, but it shaped his reputation. Philip also made comments on the eating habits of Cantonese people, stating: \"If it has four legs and is not a chair, has wings and is not an airplane, or swims and is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.\"&lt;ref name=\"independent31/5/2021\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia he asked an Indigenous Australian entrepreneur: \"Do you still throw spears at each other?\"\nIn 2011 historian David Starkey described Philip as a kind of \"HRH Victor Meldrew\". For example, in May 1999, British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying: \"No wonder you are deaf listening to this row.\" Later, Philip wrote: \"The story is largely invention. It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing.\" When he and Elizabeth met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by a Real IRA bomb, and Elizabeth enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: \"Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing.\" Menary later said: \"I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didn't take any offence.\" Philip's comparison of prostitutes and wives was also perceived as offensive after he reportedly stated: \"I don't think a prostitute is more moral than a wife, but they are doing the same thing.\"\nCentenary.\nTo mark the centenary of Philip's birth in June 2021, the Royal Collection Trust held an exhibition at Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Titled \"Prince Philip: A Celebration\", it showcased around 150 personal items related to him, including his wedding card, wedding menu, midshipman's logbook from 1940 to 1941, Chair of Estate, and the coronation robes and coronet that he wore for his wife's coronation in 1953. George Alexis Weymouth's portrait of Philip in the ruins of Windsor Castle after the fire of 1992 formed part of a focus on Philip's involvement with the subsequent restoration.\nThe Royal Horticultural Society also marked Philip's centenary by breeding a new rose in his honour, christened \"The Duke of Edinburgh Rose\", created by British rose breeder Harkness Roses. Elizabeth, as patron of the society, was given the deep pink commemorative rose in honour of her husband, and she remarked that \"It looks lovely\". A Duke of Edinburgh Rose has since been planted in the mixed rose border of Windsor Castle's East Terrace Garden. Philip played a major role in the garden's design.\nIn September 2021, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution honoured Philip by naming their new state-of-the-art lifeboat \"Duke of Edinburgh\". The tribute was initially planned to mark his 100th birthday. In the same month, a documentary initially planned for his centenary was broadcast on BBC One under the title \"Prince Philip: The Royal Family Remembers\", with contributions from his children, their spouses, and seven of his grandchildren.\nPortrayals.\nPhilip has been portrayed by several actors, including Stewart Granger (\"The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana\", 1982), Christopher Lee (\"Charles &amp; Diana: A Royal Love Story\", 1982), David Threlfall (\"The Queen's Sister\", 2005), James Cromwell (\"The Queen\", 2006), and Finn Elliot, Matt Smith, Tobias Menzies, and Jonathan Pryce (\"The Crown\", 2016 onwards). He also appears as a fictional character in Nevil Shute's novel \"In the Wet\" (1952), Paul Gallico's novel \"Mrs. 'Arris Goes to Moscow\" (1974), Tom Clancy's novel \"Patriot Games\" (1987), and Sue Townsend's novel \"The Queen and I\" (1992).\nBooks.\nPhilip authored:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nForewords to:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms.\nPhilip held many titles throughout his life. Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark, Philip abandoned these royal titles before he married and was thereafter created a British duke, among other noble titles. Elizabeth formally issued letters patent in 1957 making him a British prince.\nHonours and honorary military appointments.\nPhilip was awarded medals from Britain, France, and Greece for his service during the Second World War, as well as ones commemorating the coronations of George\u00a0VI and Elizabeth\u00a0II and the silver, gold and diamond jubilees of Elizabeth. George\u00a0VI appointed him to the Order of the Garter on the eve of his wedding on 19\u00a0November 1947. Since then, Philip received 17 appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth and 48 from foreign states. The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu, worship Philip as a god-like spiritual figure; the islanders possess portraits of him and hold feasts on his birthday.\nUpon his wife's accession to the throne in 1952, Philip was appointed Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps, Colonel-in-Chief of the British Army Cadet Force, and Air Commodore-in-Chief of the Air Training Corps. The following year, he was appointed to the equivalent positions in Canada and made Admiral of the Fleet, Captain General Royal Marines, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom. Subsequent military appointments were made in New Zealand and Australia. In 1975 he was appointed colonel of the Grenadier Guards, a position he handed over to his son Andrew in 2017. On 16\u00a0December 2015, he relinquished his role as Honorary Air Commodore-in-Chief and was succeeded by his granddaughter-in-law Catherine, then Duchess of Cambridge, as Honorary Air Commandant.\nTo celebrate Philip's 90th birthday, Elizabeth appointed him Lord High Admiral, as well as to the highest ranks available in all three branches of the Canadian Armed Forces. On their 70th wedding anniversary, 20\u00a0November 2017, she appointed him Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, making him the first British national since his uncle Lord Mountbatten of Burma to be entitled to wear the breast stars of four orders of chivalry in the United Kingdom.\nAncestry.\nBoth Philip and Elizabeth were great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, Elizabeth by descent from Victoria's eldest son, King Edward\u00a0VII, and Philip by descent from Victoria's second daughter, Princess Alice. Both were also descended from King Christian\u00a0IX of Denmark.\nPhilip was also related to the House of Romanov through all four of his grandparents. His paternal grandmother was the granddaughter of Emperor Nicholas\u00a0I of Russia. His paternal grandfather was a brother of Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark), wife of Emperor Alexander\u00a0III. His maternal grandmother was a sister of Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse), wife of Emperor Nicholas\u00a0II, and Elizabeth Feodorovna (Elisabeth of Hesse), wife of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia. His maternal grandfather was the nephew of Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse), who was the wife of Emperor Alexander\u00a0II.\nIn 1993 scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of the Romanov family, more than seventy years after their murder in 1918, by comparing their mitochondrial DNA to living matrilineal relatives, including Philip. Philip, Alexandra Feodorovna, and her children were all descended from Princess Alice through a purely female line.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62095", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62095", "title": "Four Daughters (1938 film)", "text": "1938 film by Michael Curtiz\nFour Daughters is a 1938 American romance film that tells the story of a happy musical family whose lives and loves are disrupted by the arrival of a charming young composer who interjects himself into the daughters' romantic lives. His cynical, bitter musician friend comes to help orchestrate his latest composition and complicates matters even more. The movie stars the Lane Sisters (Priscilla Lane, Rosemary Lane, and Lola Lane) and Gale Page, and features Claude Rains, Jeffrey Lynn, John Garfield, and Dick Foran. The three Lanes were sisters and members of a family singing trio.\nThe film was written by Lenore J. Coffee and Julius J. Epstein, adapted from the 1937 Fannie Hurst story \"Sister Act\", and was directed by Michael Curtiz. The movie's success led to two sequels with more or less the same cast: \"Four Wives\" and \"Four Mothers\". The same cast\u2014with the addition of Fay Bainter and Donald Crisp\u2014appeared in the film \"Daughters Courageous\", which had no connection with the Lemp family trilogy.\nPlot.\nThe Lemp sisters, Emma (Gale Page), Thea (Lola Lane), Kay (Rosemary Lane), and Ann (Priscilla Lane) are accomplished musicians in a musical family headed by their widowed father, Adam (Claude Rains), who plays the flute. Harpist Emma, the oldest daughter, is the object of a neighbor's affection, but she rebuffs Ernest's (Dick Foran) attentions. Thea, a pianist and the second eldest, is courted by wealthy Ben Crowley (Frank McHugh), another neighbor, but she is not sure she loves him. Kay, the third daughter, is a talented singer and has a chance at a music school scholarship but doesn't want to leave home. The youngest daughter is Ann, a violinist.\nOne day, Ann's violin practice is interrupted by the sound of their front gate squeaking. She instructs the young man making free with it in the finer points of the art, and introduces him to an apparently disapproving passerby, Mrs. Ridgefield, a local gossip. This charmer is young composer Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), come to work at the foundation where Adam is Dean. He has a letter of introduction to Adam, and while they talk, the girls set the dinner table with the very best silver. All four daughters are attracted to Felix, and they soon invite him to room with the family. He also charms Aunt Etta. Felix hopes to win a prize with his latest composition. Enter Felix's friend Mickey (John Garfield), a cynical orchestral arranger whose hard life has given him a grim view of existence. He falls for Ann, and is crushed when she announces at Adam's birthday party that she and Felix are engaged.\nAn hour before Ann and Felix are to marry, Mickey tells Ann how he feels\u2014and that Emma is \u201cinsane\u201d about Felix. Through a window, Ann observes Emma's distress when she ties Felix's tie before the ceremony. Everyone is wondering where Ann is when a telegram arrives, addressed to Emma, telling them she has eloped with Mickey. Ernest calmly steps in to tell the guests.\nFour months later, Ann and Mickey are living a hard life in New York City, professing love for each other but poor and unhappy. Mickey is invited to form a band and go to South America with some fellow musicians, but cannot afford passage. Ann forbids him to ask Ben for the money and asks Mickey if he would go if she weren't hung around his neck.\nThe family meets at the Lemps' house for Christmas, except Kay, who is singing on the radio that night. Emma did not get together with Felix; she is now engaged to Ernest. Felix is alone and unhappy, though the composition Mickey helped to orchestrate won a prize: a contract with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. He is to leave that very night. While Kay sings Mendelssohn's \u201cOn Wings of Song,\u201d the camera passes over the listening family, revealing much. Ann, moved to tears, takes out her handkerchief and drops two pawn tickets. Felix sees them\u2014one is for a bracelet he'd given her earlier in the year.\nMickey drives Felix to the train station in Ben's car, dropping Ben at the drugstore. He apologizes to Felix, who says it is all in the past. Felix offers Mickey a loan, but Mickey refuses, musing that he must be a new man; the old Mickey would have taken it. As the train pulls out, Felix presses an envelope into his hands and tells him to use it for Ann, \u201cany way you think that will make her happy.\u201d Mickey watches the train leave and is suddenly grim. He gets into the car and drives away. It begins to snow. He turns off the windshield wiper and presses the accelerator to the floor.\nIn the kitchen, doing dishes, Emma tells Ann that she had thought she was in love with Felix and would have kept on thinking so and spoiled her life if Ann had married him, but she was awakened to Ernest's qualities when he took charge at the wedding. Ann bursts into tears\u2014and Thea screams. Ben is in the hospital.\nAdam emerges from the hospital room to tell them that it isn't Ben, it's Mickey. He dies with Ann at his bedside.\nIt is spring; the trees in the yard are heavy with blossom. The girls and Adam are playing the piece that opened the film. Ann hears the sound of the gate squeaking. It is Felix. The family watches from the house as she welcomes him home and they swing together\u2014until Mrs. Ridgefield approaches. \u201cThis is where we came in,\u201d Felix cries, and they run inside. Mrs. Ridgefield looks around and steps onto the gate. The camera pulls slowly back as she swings back and forth, a blissful smile on her face.\nProduction.\nContemporary sources report that Errol Flynn was originally cast as Felix, but dropped out because of illness. According to TCM, Flynn was actually unhappy with the size of the part. Modern sources indicate that Michael Curtiz wanted Burgess Meredith to play Mickey, but he was unavailable. Garfield modeled his performance on troubled pianist Oscar Levant. Garfield's characterization of Mickey in this, his first major film role, defined his screen personality for many future roles.\nThe classical music that plays a key part in the film is not identified and the composers are not credited on screen. The only onscreen credit is \u201cMusic by Max Steiner\u201d. Records credit Franz Schubert and his Serenade, which opens the film and is played again near the end. According to TCM.com, Harry Warren, Al Dubin, Allie Wrubel, Elliot Grennard, Hugo Friedhofer, Heinz Roemheld and Bernard Kaun contributed to the music. Max Rabinowitz composed \"Mickey's Theme,\" and also played the piano off-screen during Garfield's performance. Ray Heindorf handled the orchestration.\nReception.\nThe movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, and \"The New York Times\" movie review said: \"A charming, at times heartbreakingly human, little comedy about life in a musical family of attractive daughters which occasionally is ruffled by the drama of a masculine world outside, Four Daughters, at the Music Hall, tempts one to agree with Jack Warner's recent assertion in the advertisements that it is the climax of his career. Putting aside Mr. Warner's career for the nonce, we may assert with equal confidence that Four Daughters is one of the best pictures of anybody's career, if only for the sake of the marvelously meaningful character of Mickey Borden as portrayed by John (formerly Jules) Garfield, who bites off his lines with a delivery so eloquent that we still aren't sure whether it is the dialogue or Mr. Garfield who is so bitterly brilliant.\"\n\"The New York Times\" named it one of the year's ten best films. The National Board of Review named Garfield as one of the year's best actors.\nThe film has a 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 10 reviews.\nFilm series and remake.\n\"Four Daughters\" is the first in a series of four films by Warner Bros. featuring the Lane Sisters and the other cast members. It was followed by 1939's \"Daughters Courageous\", also directed by Michael Curtiz and co-starring Claude Rains and John Garfield, though it is a story about a different family. However, the storyline of \"Four Daughters\" and the Lemp family is continued in the 1940 film, \"Four Wives\", and 1941's \"Four Mothers\".\n\"Four Daughters\" was remade in 1954 as \"Young at Heart,\" starring Frank Sinatra in the role played by Garfield and Doris Day in Priscilla Lane's part. All the characters' names were changed, the number of daughters was reduced to three, and the young men who vie for the heroine's heart compose songs rather than orchestral music. \"Young at Heart\" also has a very different ending: Frank Sinatra's character's suicide attempt fails.\nHome media.\nWarner Archive released \"Four Daughters\" on DVD on August 4, 2009. The film was also released by Warner Archive in the \"Four Daughters Movie Series Collection\" on August 1, 2011.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62097", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62097", "title": "La Grande Illusion", "text": "1937 war film directed by Jean Renoir\nLa Grande Illusion (French for \"The Grand Illusion\") is a 1937 French war drama film directed by Jean Renoir, who co-wrote the screenplay with Charles Spaak. The story concerns class relationships among a small group of French officers who are German prisoners of war during World War I and are plotting an escape. \nThe title of the film comes from the 1909 book \"The Great Illusion\" by British journalist Norman Angell, which argued that war is futile because of the common economic interests of all European nations. The perspective of the film is generously humanistic to its characters of various nationalities.\n\"La Grande Illusion\" is regarded by critics and film historians as one of the masterpieces of French cinema and among the greatest films ever made. Orson Welles named \"La Grande Illusion\" as one of the two movies he would take with him \"on the ark\". Director and producer Sydney Pollack picked \"La Grande Illusion\" as one of his ten favorite films of all time.\nIn 1958, the film was voted number 5 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. In 1995, the Vatican included \"La Grande Illusion\" in its list of 45 \"great films\" under the category of \"Art\". \"Empire\" magazine ranked it #35 in \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nDuring the First World War, two French aviators of the \"Service A\u00e9ronautique\", the aristocratic Captain de Bo\u00ebldieu and the working-class Lieutenant Mar\u00e9chal, set out to investigate a blurred spot found on reconnaissance photographs. They are shot down by German flying ace and aristocrat \"Rittmeister\" von Rauffenstein, and both are taken prisoner by the Imperial German Army. Upon returning to the aerodrome, Rauffenstein sends a subordinate to find out if the aviators are officers and, if so, to invite them to lunch. During the meal, Rauffenstein and Bo\u00ebldieu discover they have mutual acquaintances\u2014a depiction of the familiarity, if not solidarity, within the upper classes that crosses national boundaries.\nBo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal are then taken to a prisoner-of-war camp, where they meet a colorful group of French prisoners and stage a vaudeville-type performance just after the Germans have taken Fort Douaumont in the epic Battle of Verdun. During the performance, word arrives that the French have recaptured the fort. Mar\u00e9chal interrupts the show, and the French prisoners spontaneously burst into \"La Marseillaise\". As a result of the disruption, Mar\u00e9chal is placed in solitary confinement, where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger; the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned. Bo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal also help their fellow prisoners to finish digging an escape tunnel. However, just before it is completed, everyone is transferred to other camps. Because of the language barrier, Mar\u00e9chal is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming British prisoner.\nBo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal are moved from camp to camp, finally arriving in Wintersborn, a mountain fortress prison commanded by Rauffenstein, who has been so badly injured in battle that he has been given a posting away from the front, much to his regret. Rauffenstein tells them that Wintersborn is escape-proof.\nAt Wintersborn, the pair are reunited with a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal, from the original camp. Rosenthal is a wealthy French Jew who generously shares the food parcels he receives. Bo\u00ebldieu comes up with an idea, after carefully observing how the German guards respond to an emergency. He volunteers to distract the guards for the few minutes needed for Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal to escape. After a commotion staged by the prisoners, the guards are ordered to assemble them in the fortress courtyard. During the roll call, it is discovered that Bo\u00ebldieu is missing. He makes his presence known high up in the fortress, drawing the German guards away in pursuit. Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal take the opportunity to lower themselves from a window by a homemade rope and flee.\nRauffenstein stops the guards from firing at Bo\u00ebldieu and pleads with his friend to give himself up. Bo\u00ebldieu refuses, and Rauffenstein reluctantly shoots him with his pistol, aiming for his legs, but misses and accidentally (and fatally) hits him in the stomach. Nursed in his final moments by a grieving Rauffenstein, Bo\u00ebldieu laments that the whole purpose of the nobility and their usefulness to both French and German culture is being destroyed by the war. He expresses pity for Rauffenstein, who will have to find a new purpose in the postwar world.\nMar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal journey across the German countryside, trying to reach neutral Switzerland. Rosenthal injures his foot, slowing Mar\u00e9chal down. They quarrel and part, but then Mar\u00e9chal returns to help his comrade. They take refuge in the modest farmhouse of a German woman, Elsa, who lost her husband at Verdun, along with three brothers, at battles which, with quiet irony, she describes as \"our greatest victories\". She takes them in and does not betray them to a passing army patrol. She and Mar\u00e9chal fall in love, despite not speaking each other's language, but he and Rosenthal eventually leave from a sense of duty after Rosenthal recovers from his injury. Mar\u00e9chal declares he will come back to Elsa and her young daughter, Lotte, if he survives the war.\nA German patrol sights the two fugitives crossing a snow-covered valley. They fire a few rounds, but their commanding officer, hurrying to the scene, orders them to stop, saying the pair have crossed into Switzerland.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Jean Gabin as Lieutenant Mar\u00e9chal, a French officer, of modest social background\nPolitical and historical themes.\nRenoir used the First World War (1914\u20131918) as a lens through which to examine Europe as it faced the rising spectre of fascism (especially in Nazi Germany) and the impending approach of the Second World War (1939\u20131945). Renoir's critique of contemporary politics and ideology celebrates the universal humanity that transcends national and racial boundaries and radical nationalism, suggesting that mankind's common experiences should prevail above political division, and its extension: war.\nOn the message of \"La Grande Illusion\", Renoir himself said, in a film trailer, dating from the re-release of the film in 1958: \"[\"La Grande Illusion\" is] a story about human relationships. I am confident that such a question is so important today that if we don't solve it, we will just have to say 'goodbye' to our beautiful world.\" Despite widespread interest in the subject, Renoir found it difficult to find a producer and distributor, having to \"shop around\" the project for years.\nClass.\n\"La Grande Illusion\" examines the relationships between different social classes in Europe. Two of the main characters, Bo\u00ebldieu and Rauffenstein, are aristocrats. They are represented as cosmopolitan men, educated in many cultures and conversant in several languages. Their level of education and their devotion to social conventions and rituals makes them feel closer to each other than to the lower class of their own nation. They share similar social experiences: dining at Maxim's in Paris, courting dalliances with the same woman, and even know of each other through acquaintances. They converse with each other in heavily formal French and German, and in moments of intimate personal conversation, escape into English as if to hide these comments from their lower class counterparts.\nRenoir depicts the rule of the aristocracy in \"La Grande Illusion\" as in decline, to be replaced by a new, emerging social order, led by men who were not born to privilege. He emphasizes that their class is no longer an essential component to their respective nation's politics. Both Rauffenstein and Bo\u00ebldieu view their military service as a duty, and see the war as having a purpose; as such, Renoir depicts them as laudable but tragic figures whose world is disappearing and who are trapped in a code of life that is rapidly becoming meaningless. Both are aware that their time is past, but their reaction to this reality diverges: Bo\u00ebldieu accepts the fate of the aristocracy as a positive improvement, but Rauffenstein does not, lamenting what he sarcastically calls the \"charming legacy of the French Revolution\".\nIn \"La Grande Illusion\", Renoir contrasts the aristocrats with characters such as Mar\u00e9chal (Gabin), an engineer from Paris. The lower class characters have little in common with each other; they have different interests and are not worldly in their views or education. Nonetheless, they have a kinship too, through common sentiment and experience.\nRenoir's message is made clear when the aristocratic Bo\u00ebldieu sacrifices himself by distracting the prison guards by dancing around, singing, and playing a flute, to allow Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal, members of the lower class, to escape. Reluctantly and strictly out of duty, Rauffenstein is forced to shoot Bo\u00ebldieu, an act that Bo\u00ebldieu admits he would have been compelled to do were the circumstances reversed. However, in accepting his inevitable death, Bo\u00ebldieu takes comfort in the idea that \"For a commoner, dying in a war is a tragedy. But for you and me, it's a good way out\", and states that he has pity for Rauffenstein who will struggle to find a purpose in the new social order of the world where his traditions, experiences, and background are obsolete.\nThe critique of the romantic idealization of duty in \"La Grande Illusion\" is comparable to that in the earlier film \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930), based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque.\nPrejudice.\nIn \"La Grande Illusion\", Renoir briefly touches on the question of antisemitism through the character of Rosenthal, a son from a \"nouveau riche\" Jewish banking family (a parallel to the Rothschild banking family of France). His biographers believed that Renoir created this character to counter the rising anti-Jewish campaign enacted by Adolf Hitler's government in Nazi Germany. Further, Rosenthal is shown as a symbol of humanity across class lines: though he may be financially wealthy, he shares his food parcels with everyone so that he and his fellow prisoners are well fed \u2014 when compared with their German captors. Through the character of Rosenthal, Renoir rebuffs Jewish stereotypes.\nThere is also a black French officer among the prisoners at Wintersborn who appears to be ignored by the other prisoners, and not accepted as an equal by them. When he speaks to them he is not responded to. For instance, when he shows his artwork, he is shrugged off.\nWar.\nIn \"La Grande Illusion\" Renoir seeks to refute the notion that war accomplishes anything, or that it can be used as a political tool to solve problems and create a better world. \"That's all an illusion\", says Rosenthal, speaking of the belief that this is the war that will end war forever.\n\"La Grande Illusion\" is a war film without any depiction of battle. Instead, the prisoner of war camp setting is used as a space in which soldiers of many nations have a common experience. Renoir portrays war as a futile exercise. For instance, Elsa, the German widow, shows photos to Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal of her husband and her brothers who were killed, respectively, at the battles of Verdun, Li\u00e8ge, Charleroi, and Tannenberg. The last three of these battles were amongst Germany's most celebrated victories in World War I. Through this device, Renoir refutes the notion that one common man's bravery, honor, or duty can make an impact on a great event. This undermines the idealistic intention of Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal to return to the front, so that by returning to the fight they can help end this war.\nProduction.\nElements of \"La Grande Illusion\" are semi-autobiographical in nature. Jean Renoir was a reconnaissance pilot during World War I, and received a change of post after being wounded in action. Renoir's life was saved by a French pilot, Armand Pinsard, when he was under attack by a German Fokker in 1915, during the First World War. In 1935, during the production of \"Toni\", Pinsard recounted his WWI history, shot down seven times, captured seven times, and escaping seven times from German POW camps, inspiring Grand Illusion, and Pinsard became the model for Lt. Mar\u00e9chal.&lt;ref name=\"unaffiliatedcritic/grand-illusion-1937\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Renoir used his own uniform as Jean Gabin's costume in the film. Several other cast members had also fought in the war, Marcel Dalio won the Croix de Guerre for his actions with the French artillery during the Action at Villers-Cotter\u00eats (1914), and Pierre Fresnay was in the army between 1916 and 1919. Renoir developed the screenplay with Charles Spaak,&lt;ref name=\"inlibris/bn33953\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and spent several years trying to finance it. Through Albert Pink\u00e9vitch, an assistant to the financier, Frank Rollmer, and the attachment of Jean Gabin, private producers finally supported a small production budget.&lt;ref name=\"sensesofcinema/2003/great/renoir/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe casting of Erich von Stroheim came as Renoir was a great admirer of the director's films, and had inspired him to pursue filmmaking. According to Renoir's memoirs, Stroheim, despite having been born in Vienna, Austria (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire) did not speak much German as he had been living in the United States since 1909, and struggled with learning the language along with his lines in between filming scenes. Renoir eventually resorted to hiring a dialect coach to help Stroheim with his lines.\n\"La Grande Illusion\" was filmed in the winter of 1936-37.&lt;ref name=\"bfi.org.uk/grande-illusion-1937-greatest\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The exteriors of \"Burg Wintersborn\" were filmed at the Upper Koenigsbourg Castle in Alsace. Other exteriors were filmed at the artillery barracks at Colmar (built by Wilhelm II) and at Neuf-Brisach on the Upper Rhine. The interiors were shot at Epinay and Billancourt Studios.\nSoundtrack.\nThe score was written by the Hungarian composer Joseph Kosma, who also wrote the famous song \"Autumn Leaves\". The soundtrack also includes many well-known songs of the day from French, English, and German culture. The uncredited musical director was the film and music critic \u00c9mile Vuillermoz, who had been a composer in his early career.\nSongs:\nReception.\nEurope.\nAfter the film won a prize at the Venice Film Festival for \"Best Artistic Ensemble\" in 1937, and was nominated for the International Jury Cup, the Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels declared \"La Grande Illusion\" \"Cinematic Public Enemy No. 1\" and ordered the prints to be confiscated and destroyed. Fearing a decline in fighting morale, French authorities banned the film in 1940 \"pour la dur\u00e9e des hostilit\u00e9s\" (for the duration of hostilities). This ban was renewed by the German Propaganda-Abteilung in October of the same year. When the German Army marched into France in 1940 during World War II, Goebbels made sure that the film's prints and negative were among the first things seized by the Nazis, chiefly because of its anti-war message, and what were perceived as ideological criticisms pointed towards Germany on the eve of the Second World War.\n\"La Grande Illusion\" was a massive hit in France, with an estimated 12 million admissions.\nUnited States and elsewhere.\n\"La Grande Illusion\", released by World Pictures Corporation in the U.S. premiered on 12 September 1938 in New York City; Frank S. Nugent in his review for \"The New York Times\" called \"La Grande Illusion\" a \"strange and interesting film\" that \"owes much to his cast\",\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Erich von Stroheim's appearance as von Rauffenstein reminds us again of Hollywood's folly in permitting so fine an actor to remain idle and unwanted. Pierre Fresnay's de Boeldieu is a model of gentlemanly decadence. Jean Gabin and Dalio as the fugitives, Dita Parlo as the German girl, and all the others are thoroughly right.\n\"La Grande Illusion\" won the awards for Best Foreign Film at the 1938 New York Film Critics Circle Awards and at the 1938 National Board of Review Awards it was named the Best Foreign Language Film for that year. At the 11th Academy Awards held on 23 February 1939, \"La Grande Illusion\" became the first foreign language film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nAt the time of its release, John Ford, impressed with the film, opted to remake it in English but was urged by studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck not to. \"You'll never top it,\" he told Ford.\nOrson Welles, in an interview with Dick Cavett on 27 July 1970, expressed that if he only could save a handful of films that were not his own for future posterity, this would be one of those films.\nMartin Scorsese included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker\".\nSixty years after its release, Janet Maslin called it \"one of the most haunting of all war films\" and an \"oasis of subtlety, moral intelligence and deep emotion on the cinematic landscape\"; according to Maslin:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It seems especially disarming now in its genius for keeping its story indirect yet its meaning perfectly clear. Its greatest dramatic heights seem to occur almost effortlessly, as a tale of escape derived from the experience of one of Renoir's wartime comrades evolves into a series of unforgettable crises and stirring sacrifices.\nFilm critic Roger Ebert also reviewed the film after its 1999 re-release, and added it to his list of The Great Movies:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Apart from its other achievements, Jean Renoir's \"Grand Illusion\" influenced two famous later movie sequences. The digging of the escape tunnel in \"The Great Escape\" and the singing of the \"Marseillaise\" to enrage the Germans in \"Casablanca\" can first be observed in Renoir's 1937 masterpiece. Even the details of the tunnel dig are the same\u2014the way the prisoners hide the excavated dirt in their pants and shake it out on the parade ground during exercise. But if \"Grand Illusion\" had been merely a source of later inspiration, it wouldn't be on so many lists of great films. It's not a movie about a prison escape, nor is it jingoistic in its politics; it's a meditation on the collapse of the old order of European civilization. Perhaps that was always a sentimental upper-class illusion, the notion that gentlemen on both sides of the lines subscribed to the same code of behaviour. Whatever it was, it died in the trenches of World War I.\nFilmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited \"La Grande Illusion\" as one of his favorite films. In the 2012 edition of the annual Sight And Sound poll in which directors are asked to select their favourite movies, Woody Allen picked La Grand Illusion as one of his top ten.\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"La Grande Illusion\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars\".\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 74 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Jean Renoir's \"Grand Illusion\" is a masterful anti-war statement, bringing humane insight and an undercurrent of ironic humor to an unusual relationship between captor and captive.\"\nPrints and home media.\nFor many years, the original nitrate film negative of \"La Grande Illusion\" was thought to have been lost in an Allied air raid in 1942 that destroyed a leading laboratory outside Paris. Prints of the film were rediscovered in 1958 and restored and re-released during the early 1960s. Then, it was revealed that the original negative had been shipped back to Berlin (probably due to the efforts of Frank Hensel) to be stored in the Reichsfilmarchiv vaults. In the Allied occupation of Berlin in 1945, the Reichsfilmarchiv by chance was in the Russian zone and consequently shipped along with many other films back to be the basis of the Soviet Gosfilmofond film archive in Moscow. The negative was returned to France in the 1960s, but sat unidentified in storage in Toulouse Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que for over 30 years, as no one suspected it had survived. It was rediscovered in the early 1990s as the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que's nitrate collection was slowly being transferred to the French Film Archives at Bois d'Arcy.\nIn August 1999, Rialto Pictures re-released the film in the United States, based on the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que negative found in Toulouse; after watching the new print at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, Janet Maslin called it \"beautifully refurbished\" and \"especially lucid\". A transfer of this restored print was released on DVD by the Criterion Collection in 1999 as spine number 1, but has been out of print since 2005. \"Grand Illusion\" was intended to be Criterion's first release on the DVD format in 1998, but the discovery of the new negative delayed its release.\nIn 2012, StudioCanal and Lionsgate released a 1080p Blu-ray version based on a new high-definition scan of the original negative. According to Lee Kline, Technical Director of the Criterion Collection, this release was \"night and day of what we did\u2014because they had better film.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62107", "revid": "664832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62107", "title": "Trafalgar Square", "text": "Public square in London, England\nTrafalgar Square ( ) is a public square in the City of Westminster in Central London. It was established in the early 19th century around the area known as Charing Cross. Its name commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, the British naval victory in the Napoleonic Wars over France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of Cape Trafalgar.\nThe area around Trafalgar Square has been a significant landmark since the 1200s, as distances from London are measured from Charing Cross. The King's Mews occupied part of the site until the reign of George IV, who moved them to Buckingham Palace, allowing the area to be redeveloped by John Nash. Progress stalled after the death of Nash in 1835, and the square did not open until 1844. It is faced by buildings including the National Gallery, St Martin-in-the-Fields, Canada House and South Africa House. The square also contains several pieces of public sculpture, including the Nelson's Column in the centre, which commemorates Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson's victory at Trafalgar; an equestrian statue of Charles I; and the fourth plinth, which since 1999 has hosted a variety of artworks.\nThe square has been used for community gatherings and political demonstrations, including Bloody Sunday in 1887, the culmination of the first Aldermaston March, anti-war protests and campaigns against climate change. A Christmas tree has been donated to the square by the government of Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on New Year's Eve and was known for its feral pigeons until their removal in the early 21st century.\nName.\nThe square is named after the Battle of Trafalgar, a British naval victory in the Napoleonic Wars with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of Cape Trafalgar, southwest Spain, although it was not named as such until 1835.\nThe name \"Trafalgar\" is a Spanish word of Arabic origin, derived from either \"Taraf al-Ghar\" ( 'cape of the cave/laurel') or \"Taraf al-Gharb\" ( 'extremity of the west').\nGeography.\nTrafalgar Square is owned by the King in Right of the Crown and managed by the Greater London Authority, while Westminster City Council owns the roads around the square, including the pedestrianised area of the North Terrace. The square contains a large central area with roadways on three sides and a terrace to the north, in front of the National Gallery. The roads around the square form part of the A4, a major road running west of the City of London. Originally, traffic travelled both directions around the square until a one-way clockwise gyratory system was introduced on 26 April 1926. In 2003, the northern side was closed and the road width reduced.\nNelson's Column is in the centre of the square, flanked by fountains designed by the English architect Sir Edwin Lutyens between 1937 and 1939 (replacements for two of Peterhead granite, now in Canada) and guarded by four monumental bronze lions sculpted by Sir Edwin Landseer. At the top of the column is a statue of Horatio Nelson, who commanded the British Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar.\nSurrounding the square are the National Gallery on the north side and St Martin-in-the-Fields Church to the east. Also on the east is South Africa House, and facing it across the square is Canada House. To the south-west is The Mall, which leads towards Buckingham Palace via Admiralty Arch, while Whitehall is to the south and the Strand to the east. Charing Cross Road passes between the National Gallery and the church.\nLondon Underground's Charing Cross station on the Northern and Bakerloo lines has an exit in the square. The lines had separate stations; the Bakerloo line branch was called Trafalgar Square until the two were linked in 1979 during the construction of the Jubilee line (which was rerouted to Westminster in 1999). Other nearby tube stations are Embankment connecting the District, Circle, Northern and Bakerloo lines, and Leicester Square on the Northern and Piccadilly lines.\nSeveral bus routes run through the square, including routes 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 23, 24, 29, 53, 87, 88, 91, 139, 159, 176, 453.\nA point in Trafalgar Square is regarded as the official centre of London in legislation and when measuring distances from the capital.\nHistory.\nBuilding work on the south side of the square in the late 1950s revealed river terrace deposits containing fossils from the Last Interglacial, around 130-115,000 years ago. Among the findings were the remains of cave lions, rhinoceroses, straight-tusked elephant and hippopotamus, as well as feces of cave hyenas.\nThe site has been significant since the 13th century. During the reign of Edward I of England it hosted the King's Mews, running north from the T-junction in the south, Charing Cross, where the Strand from the City of London meets Whitehall coming north from Westminster. From the reign of Richard II to that of Henry VII, the mews was at the western end of the Strand. The name \"Royal Mews\" comes from the practice of keeping hawks here for moulting; \"mew\" is an old word for this. After a fire in 1534, the mews were rebuilt as stables, and remained here until George IV moved them to Buckingham Palace.\nClearance and development.\nAfter 1732 the King's Mews were divided into the Great Mews and the smaller Green Mews to the north by the Crown Stables, a large block, built to the designs of William Kent. Its site is occupied by the National Gallery.\nIn 1826 the Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues instructed John Nash to draw up plans for clearing a large area south of Kent's stable block, and as far east as St Martin's Lane. His plans left open the whole area of what became Trafalgar Square, except for a block in the centre, which he reserved for a new building for the Royal Academy of Arts. The plans included the demolition and redevelopment of buildings between St Martin's Lane and the Strand and the construction of a road (now called Duncannon Street) across the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The Charing Cross Act was passed in 1826 and clearance started soon after. Nash died soon after construction started, impeding its progress. The square was to be named after William IV commemorating his accession to the throne in 1830. Around 1835 it was decided that the square would be named after the Battle of Trafalgar as suggested by the architect George Ledwell Taylor, commemorating Nelson's victory over the French and Spanish in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars.\nAfter the clearance development progressed slowly. The National Gallery was built on the north side between 1832 and 1838 to a design by William Wilkins, and in 1837 the Treasury approved Wilkins' plan for the laying out of the square, but it was not put into effect. In April 1840, following Wilkins' death, new plans by Charles Barry were accepted, and construction started within weeks. For Barry, as for Wilkins, a major consideration was increasing the visual impact of the National Gallery, which had been widely criticised for its lack of grandeur. He dealt with the complex sloping site by excavating the main area to the level of the footway between Cockspur Street and the Strand, and constructing a high balustraded terrace with a roadway on the north side, and steps at each end leading to the main level. Wilkins had proposed a similar solution with a central flight of steps. All the stonework was of granite from Aberdeen. In 1845 four Bude-Lights with octagonal glass lanterns were installed. Two, opposite the National Gallery, are on tall bronze columns, and two, in the south-west and south-east corners of the square, on shorter bronze columns on top of wider granite columns. They were designed by Barry and manufactured by Stevens and Son, of Southwark.\nIn 1841 it was decided that two fountains should be included in the layout. The estimated budget, excluding paving and sculptures, was \u00a311,000. The earth removed was used to level Green Park. The square was originally surfaced with tarmacadam, which was replaced with stone in the 1920s.\nTrafalgar Square was opened to the public on 1 May 1844.\nNelson's Column.\nNelson's Column was planned independently of Barry's work. In 1838 a Nelson Memorial Committee had approached Her Majesty's Government proposing that a monument to the victory of Trafalgar, funded by public subscription, should be erected in the square. A competition was held and won by the architect William Railton, who proposed a Corinthinan column topped by a statue of Nelson and guarded by four sculpted lions. The design was approved, but received widespread objections from the public. Construction went ahead beginning in 1840 but with the height reduced to . The column was completed and the statue raised in November 1843.\nThe last of the bronze reliefs on the column's pedestals was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although part of the original design, were only added in 1867. Each lion weighs seven tons. A hoarding remained around the base of Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place. Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the London Zoo to be brought to his studio. He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to decompose and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.\nBarry was unhappy about Nelson's Column being placed in the square. In July 1840, when its foundations had been laid, he told a parliamentary select committee that \"it would in my opinion be desirable that the area should be wholly free from all insulated objects of art\".\nIn 1940, during the Second World War, the \"Schutzstaffel\" of Nazi Germany developed secret plans to transfer Nelson's Column to Berlin after an expected German invasion, as related by the historian Norman Longmate in \"If Britain Had Fallen\" (1972).\nThe square has been Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens since 1996.\nTerrorist bombings.\nThe square was the target of two suffragette bombings in 1913 and 1914. This was as part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign of 1912\u20131914, in which suffragettes carried out a series of politically-motivated bombing and arson attacks nationwide as part of their campaign for women's suffrage.\nThe first attack occurred on 15 May 1913. A bomb was planted in the public area outside the National Gallery, but failed to explode. A second attack occurred at St Martin-in-the-Fields church at the north-east corner of the square on 4 April 1914. A bomb exploded inside the church, blowing out the windows and showering passers-by with broken glass. The bomb then started a fire. In the aftermath a mass of people rushed to the scene, many of whom aggressively expressed their anger towards the suffragettes. Churches were a particular target during the campaign, as it was believed that the Church of England was complicit in reinforcing opposition to women's suffrage. Between 1913 and 1914 thirty-two churches were attacked nationwide. In the weeks after the bombing, there were also attacks on Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral.\nRedevelopment.\nA major 18-month redevelopment of the square led by W.S. Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides of the square, demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace in front of the National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a caf\u00e9. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.\nStatues and monuments.\nPlinths.\nBarry's scheme provided two plinths for sculptures on the north side of the square. A bronze equestrian statue of George IV was designed by Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey and Thomas Earle. It was originally intended to be placed atop the Marble Arch, but instead was installed on the eastern plinth in 1843, while the other plinths remained empty until late in the 20th century. There are two other statues on plinths, both installed during the 19th century: General Sir Charles James Napier by George Cannon Adams in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir Henry Havelock by William Behnes in the south-east in 1861. In 2000 the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, suggested replacing the statues with figures more familiar to the general public.\nFourth plinth.\nIn the 21st century the empty plinth in the north-west corner of the square, the \"fourth plinth\", has been used to show specially commissioned temporary artworks. The scheme was initiated by the Royal Society of Arts and continued by the Fourth Plinth Commission, appointed by the mayor of London.\nOther sculptures.\nThere are three busts of admirals against the north wall of the square. Those of John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe (by Sir Charles Wheeler) and David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty (by William MacMillan) were installed in 1948 in conjunction with the square's fountains, which also commemorate them. The third, of First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope (by the Czech sculptor Franta Belsky) was unveiled alongside them on 2 April 1967.\nOn the south side of Trafalgar Square, on the site of the original Charing Cross, is a bronze equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur. It was cast in 1633, and placed in its present position in 1678.\nThe two statues on the lawn in front of the National Gallery are the statue of James II (designed by Peter van Dievoet and Laurens van der Meulen for the studio of Grinling Gibbons) to the west of the portico, and of George Washington, a replica of a work by Jean-Antoine Houdon, to the east. The latter was a gift from the government of the U.S. state of Virginia, installed in 1921.\nTwo statues erected in the 19th century have since been removed. One of Edward Jenner, pioneer of the smallpox vaccine, was set up in the south-west corner of the square in 1858, next to that of Napier. Sculpted by William Calder Marshall, it showed Jenner sitting in a chair in a relaxed pose, and was inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by Prince Albert. It was moved to Kensington Gardens in 1862. The other, of General Charles George Gordon by Hamo Thornycroft, was erected on an 18-foot-high pedestal between the fountains in 1888. It was removed in 1943 and re-sited on the Victoria Embankment ten years later.\nFountains.\nIn 1841, following suggestions from the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly. The fountains were fed from two wells, one in front of the National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.\nIn the late-1930s it was decided to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, were memorials to Lord Jellicoe and Lord Beatty, although busts of the admirals, initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War. The fountains cost almost \u00a350,000. The original centrepieces were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in Confederation Park in Ottawa and the Wascana Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan.\nA programme of restoration was completed by May 2009. The pump system was replaced with one capable of sending an jet of water into the air. A light-emitting diode lighting system that can project different combinations of colours on to the fountains was installed to reduce the cost of lighting maintenance and to coincide with the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nPigeons.\nThe square was once famous for feral pigeons and feeding them was a popular activity. Pigeons began flocking to the square before construction was completed and feed sellers became well known in the Victorian era. The desirability of the birds' presence was contentious: their droppings disfigured the stonework and the flock, estimated at its peak to be 35,000, was considered a health hazard. A stall seller, Bernie Rayner, infamously sold bird seed to tourists at inflated prices.\nIn February 2001 the sale of bird seed in the square was stopped and other measures were introduced to discourage the pigeons including the use of birds of prey. Supporters continued to feed the birds, but in 2003 Livingstone enacted bylaws to ban feeding them in the square. In September 2007 Westminster City Council passed further bylaws banning feeding birds on the pedestrianised North Terrace and other pavements in the area. Nelson's column was repaired from years of damage from pigeon droppings at a cost of \u00a3140,000.\nEvents.\nNew Year.\nFor many years, revellers celebrating the New Year have gathered in the square despite a lack of celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003 a fireworks display centred on the London Eye and South Bank of the River Thames has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014 New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with UNICEF, who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers. The fireworks display was cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic. An event scheduled to take place in the Square to welcome in 2022 was cancelled during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.\nChristmas.\nA Christmas ceremony has been held in the square every year since 1947. A Norway spruce (or sometimes a fir) is presented by Norway's capital city, Oslo, as London's Christmas tree, a token of gratitude for Britain's support during the Second World War. (Prince Olav and the Norwegian government also lived in exile in London throughout the war.)\nThe Christmas tree is decorated with lights that are switched on at a seasonal ceremony. It is usually held twelve days before Christmas Day. The festivity is open to the public and attracts a large number of people. The switch-on is usually followed by several nights of Christmas carol singing and other performances and events. On the twelfth night of Christmas, the tree is taken down for recycling. Westminster City Council threatened to abandon the event to save \u00a35,000 in 1980 but the decision was reversed.\nThe tree is selected by the Head Forester from Oslo's municipal forest and shipped across the North Sea to the Port of Felixstowe, then by road to Trafalgar Square. The first tree was tall, but more recently has been around . In 1987 several protesters chained themselves to the tree. In 1990 a man sawed into the tree with a chainsaw a few hours before a New Year's Eve party was scheduled to take place. He was arrested and the tree was repaired by tree surgeons who removed gouged sections from the trunk while the tree was suspended from a crane.\nPolitical demonstrations.\nThe square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners, developing over its history from \"an esplanade peopled with figures of national heroes, into the country's foremost \"place politique\"\", as historian Rodney Mace has written. Since its construction, it has been a venue for political demonstrations. The great Chartist rally in 1848, a campaign for social reform by the working class began in the square. A ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s, when the emerging Labour movement, particularly the Social Democratic Federation, began holding protests. On 8 February 1886 (also known as \"Black Monday\"), protesters rallied against unemployment leading to a riot in Pall Mall. A larger riot, \"Bloody Sunday\", occurred in the square on 13 November 1887.\nThe Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's first Aldermaston March, protesting against the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), began in the square in 1958. One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square on 19 September 1961 by the Committee of 100, which included the philosopher Bertrand Russell. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons. In March 1968 a crowd of 10,000 demonstrated against American involvement in the Vietnam War before marching to the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square.\nThroughout the 1980s a continuous anti-apartheid protest was held outside South Africa House. In 1990 the Poll Tax Riots began by a demonstration attended by 200,000 people and ultimately caused rioting in the surrounding area. More recently there have been anti-war demonstrations opposing the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War. A large vigil was held shortly after the terrorist bombings in London on Thursday, 7 July 2005.\nIn December 2009 participants from the Camp for Climate Action occupied the square for the two weeks during which the United Nations Conference on Climate Change took place in Copenhagen. It was billed as a UK base for direct action on climate change and saw various actions and protests stem from the occupation.\nIn March 2011 the square was occupied by a crowd protesting against the government budget and proposed budget cuts. During the night the situation turned violent as the escalation by riot police and protesters damaged portions of the square. In November 2015 a vigil against the terrorist attacks in Paris was held. Crowds sang the French national anthem, La Marseillaise, and held banners in support of the city and country.\nEvery year on the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar (21 October), the Sea Cadet Corps holds a parade in honour of Admiral Lord Nelson and the British victory over the combined fleets of Spain and France at Trafalgar. The Royal British Legion holds a Silence in the Square event on Armistice Day, 11 November, in remembrance of those who died in war. The event includes music and poetry readings, culminating in a bugler playing the Last Post and a two-minute silence at 11 am.\nIn February 2019 hundreds of students participated in a protest against climate change as a part of the School strike for Climate campaign. The protest started in the nearby Parliament Square, and as the day went on, the demonstrators moved towards Trafalgar Square.\nIn July 2020 two members of the protest group Animal Rebellion were arrested on suspicion for criminal damage after releasing red dye into the fountains.\nIn September 2020 anti-lockdown protests opposed to the imposition of regulations relating to the coronavirus outbreak took place in the square.\nA police observation box has been in the Square since 1919, originally a wooden freestanding unit, it was replaced by hollowing out a lampstand at the southeastern corner of the Square into a permanent structure in 1928, but decommissioned in the 1970s.\nSport.\nIn the 21st century Trafalgar Square has been the location for several sporting events and victory parades. In June 2002, 12,000 people gathered to watch England's FIFA World Cup quarter-final against Brazil on large video screens which had been erected for the occasion. The square was used by England on 9 December 2003 to celebrate their victory in the Rugby World Cup, and on 13 September 2005 for England's victory in the Ashes series.\nOn 6 July 2005 Trafalgar Square hosted the official watch party for London's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore, hosted by Katy Hill and Margherita Taylor. A countdown clock was erected in March 2011, although engineering and weather-related faults caused it to stop a day later. In 2007 it hosted the opening ceremonies of the Tour de France and was part of the course for subsequent races.\nOther uses.\nThe Sea Cadets hold a yearly Battle of Trafalgar victory parade running the north of Whitehall, from Horse Guard's Parade to Nelson's Column.\nAs an archetypal London location, Trafalgar Square featured in film and television productions during the Swinging London era of the late 1960s, including \"The Avengers\", \"Casino Royale\", \"Doctor Who\" and \"The Ipcress File\". It was used for filming several sketches and a cartoon backdrop in the BBC comedy series \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". In May 2007 the square was grassed over with 2,000 square metres of turf for two days in a campaign by London authorities to promote \"green spaces\" in the city.\nIn July 2011, due to building works in Leicester Square, the world premiere of the final film in the \"Harry Potter\" series, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2\", was held in Trafalgar Square, with a red carpet linking the squares. Fans camped in Trafalgar Square for up to three days before the premiere, despite torrential rain. It was the first film premiere ever to be held there.\nThe square has seen controversy over busking and street theatre, which have attracted complaints over noise and public safety. In 2012 the Greater London Authority created a bylaw for regulating busking and associated tourism. In 2016 the National Gallery proposed to introduce licensing for such performances.\nCultural references.\nA Lego architecture set based on Trafalgar Square was released in 2019. It contains models of the National Gallery and Nelson's Column alongside miniature lions, fountains and double-decker buses.\nTrafalgar Square is one of the squares on the standard British Monopoly Board. It is in the red set alongside the Strand and Fleet Street.\nSeveral scenes in George Orwell's dystopian novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" take place in Trafalgar Square, which was renamed \"Victory Square\" by the story's totalitarian regime and dominated by the giant statue of Big Brother, which replaced Nelson.\nOther Trafalgar Squares.\nA Trafalgar Square in Stepney is recorded in \"Lockie's Topography of London\", published in 1810. \nTrafalgar Square in Scarborough, North Yorkshire gives its name to the Trafalgar Square End at the town's North Marine Road cricket ground.\nThe square known as Chelsea Square, London SW3 was at one time known as Trafalgar Square and predated the one in Westminster.\nNational Heroes Square in Bridgetown, Barbados, was named Trafalgar Square in 1813, before its better-known British namesake. It was renamed in 1999 to commemorate national heroes of Barbados. \nThere is a life scale replica of the square in Bahria Town, Lahore, Pakistan, which is a tourist attraction and centre for local residents.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He graduated in 1949 with a Bachelor of Science degree in marine engineering and a United States Naval Reserve commission, and joined the Aircraft Gas Turbine Division of General Electric as an engineer. He was called to active duty as a naval aviator during the Korean War, and flew Grumman F9F Panther fighters with Fighter Squadron 144 (VF-144) from the aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, and in the Western Pacific. He married Marilyn Denahy in 1954, and they had three children.\nSee rejoined General Electric (GE) in 1956 as a flight test engineer after his tour of duty, and became a group leader and experimental test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base, where he flew the latest jet aircraft with GE engines. He also obtained a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from UCLA.\nSelected in NASA's second group of astronauts in 1962, See was the prime command pilot for what would have been his first space flight, Gemini 9. He was killed along with Charles Bassett, his Gemini 9 crewmate, in a NASA jet crash at the St. Louis McDonnell Aircraft plant, where they were to undergo two weeks of space rendezvous simulator training.\nEarly life and education.\nElliot McKay See Jr. was born on July 23, 1927, in Dallas, Texas, to Elliot McKay See Sr. (1888\u20131968) and Mamie Norton See (n\u00e9e Drummond; 1900\u20131988). He was the first of two children; his sister Sally Drummond See rounded out the family in 1930. His father was an electrical engineer who worked for General Electric, and his mother worked in jobs ranging from advertising to real estate. See was active in the Boy Scouts of America for five years, and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. He attended Highland Park High School and was on the varsity team in several sports, including boxing. He was also on the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Rifle Team. He graduated from high school in 1945.\nThe United States entered World War II in December 1941. See had to choose between going to war or going to college, as he would otherwise be drafted at age 18. He decided to apply for aviation cadet training. He failed a physical, and, according to See, \"going to college became the most important thing\". He enrolled at the University of Texas, and after a few months pledged to Phi Kappa Psi. While at the University of Texas, he signed up for flying lessons and received his private pilot's license.\nSee applied for military officer training and received an appointment to the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) in 1945. As the end of the war drew near, the USMMA changed its curriculum to a four-year college-level program, which was the minimum requirement to be a merchant marine in peacetime. He spent his plebe year at Pass Christian, Mississippi, where the USMMA had a satellite campus, and then transferred to the main campus at Kings Point, New York. He commanded the Third Company as a cadet officer. He was a member of the Propeller Club and head cheerleader. He was on the mile relay running team, played intramural softball, and was a varsity boxer. As co-captain of the rifle team, he won the Captain Tomb Trophy for individual rifle and pistol marksmanship in December 1948. In 1949, Congress authorized the USMMA to award Bachelor of Science degrees to its graduates, so on graduation that year Elliot received his B.S. degree, his marine engineer's licenses, and a commission as an officer in the United States Naval Reserve.\nNavy service and General Electric.\nAfter graduation, See took a summer job with Lykes Brothers Steamship Company. On September 1, 1949, he joined the Aircraft Gas Turbine Division of General Electric, the firm his father had worked for, in Boston. He moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, when the division was relocated. There he met Marilyn Jane Denahy from Georgetown, Ohio, who worked at General Electric as a secretary. He and his friend Tay Haney pooled their funds to buy a Luscombe Silvaire Sprayer aircraft, which they flew on cross-country trips. In November 1952, while taking Marilyn on a joyride, the Luscombe's engine began to fail. See attempted to land the aircraft on a short, unimproved field, but the tail wheel snagged a power line and forced the aircraft into the ground. See suffered deep cuts to his face which required plastic surgery. Marilyn escaped the crash with only minor injuries.\nBy 1953, See was working as a flight test engineer at General Electric's plant in Evendale, Ohio. Like many naval reservists, he was called to active duty due to the Korean War. He was initially stationed at Miramar Naval Air Station near San Diego, California. He married Marilyn on September 30, 1954, before shipping out for a sixteen-month operational tour as a naval aviator, flying the Grumman F9F Panther with Fighter Squadron 144 (VF-144), part of Carrier Air Group 14. He was deployed to the Mediterranean on the aircraft carrier , which returned to the United States in June 1955.\nIn October, after further training at El Centro Naval Air Station, California, he embarked with VF-144 on an operational cruise on the aircraft carrier , which formed part of Task Force 77. The task force traveled to Hawaii, Japan, the Philippine Islands, and Hong Kong. See primarily focused on line maintenance, but also became proficient at carrier landings. By the end of the tour, he had reached the rank of lieutenant commander. He returned home in February 1956, in time for the birth of his first child, Sally. The couple later had two more children: Carolyn in 1957, and David in 1962.\nSee rejoined General Electric in 1956 as a flight test engineer after his tour of duty. He became a group leader and experimental test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base, California, where the United States Air Force conducted flight tests. He served as a project pilot for the development of the General Electric J79-8 engine used in the F4H aircraft. He also conducted powerplant flight tests on the J-47, J-73, J-79, CJ805 and CJ805 aft-fan engines, which involved flying in F-86, XF4D, F-104, F11F-1F, RB-66, F4H, and T-38 aircraft. He worked towards his master's degree one night a week, starting in 1960, eventually obtaining a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from UCLA in 1962, and continued flying with the Naval Reserve. He was eventually promoted to commander.\nNASA.\nIn 1962, See applied to become a NASA astronaut. After undergoing preliminary evaluations, medical tests, and interviews during the selection process, See was selected to be in NASA's second group of astronauts, known as The New Nine. He was 35 at the time of his selection; the oldest in the group. On his selection, he said \"Overwhelmed isn't the right word. I was amazed and certainly pleased. It's a very great honor.\" At the time of his selection, See had logged more than 3,900 hours of flying time, including more than 3,300 in jet aircraft. He drove from Edwards with fellow civilian pilot Neil Armstrong to start his new career in Houston, Texas, where the new Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) was under construction.\nEvery astronaut was assigned a core competency, a special area in which they had to develop expertise, by the NASA Astronaut Office. The knowledge they gathered could then be shared with the others, and the astronaut-expert was expected to provide astronaut input to the spacecraft designers and engineers. See's special area of expertise was the spacecraft electrical and sequential systems, and the coordination of mission planning. See was tasked with determining if the crewed lunar landing should occur in direct sunlight or using light reflected from the Earth. To help make the decision, he flew helicopters and airplanes wearing special welding goggles to simulate different lighting conditions. See also landed helicopters with Jim Lovell on lava flows that simulated the terrain on the Moon.\nSee was announced as the backup pilot for Gemini 5 on February 8, 1965, with Armstrong serving as the backup command pilot. They were the first civilians selected for a spaceflight. Gemini 5 was launched on August 21, 1965. Early in the flight, a problem was discovered with the fuel cells, and the flight controllers considered ending the mission early. See, who had worked with General Electric in developing the fuel cells, was confident that they could find a solution. Flight Director Chris Kraft gave them 24 hours to fix the problem. After working through the night, they diagnosed the problem and developed procedures that allowed the astronauts to fix the fuel cells, which allowed the mission to continue.\nSee was a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) at MSC in Houston during the Gemini 7/Gemini 6A rendezvous mission in December 1965. Under the crew rotation system devised by chief astronaut Deke Slayton, as the backup for Gemini 5, Armstrong and See were in line for prime crew of Gemini 8. From the spring to the fall of 1965, Armstrong and See trained for the Gemini 5 mission. They spent a significant amount of time training in the spacecraft simulators. They flew back and forth to Kennedy Space Center, from which their spacecraft would be launched; to North Carolina to develop experiments to be conducted during the flight; and to McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis, where the Gemini spacecraft was made.\nContrary to Slayton's typical crew rotation, David Scott took See's place as the pilot of Gemini 8. According to his autobiography, Slayton did not assign See to Gemini 8 because he considered him as too out-of-shape to perform an extravehicular activity. \"Life\" photographer Ralph Morse asked Armstrong why See was no longer assigned with him on the Gemini 8 mission, and Armstrong replied, \"Elliot's too good a pilot not to have a command of his own.\" In October 1965 See was promoted to command pilot (first seat) of Gemini 9, with Charles Bassett as his pilot. The Gemini 9 mission was similar to the previous mission. An extravehicular activity (EVA) that used the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU) was scheduled, and they would rendezvous with an Agena target vehicle. Bassett was scheduled for the EVA and See would stay in the capsule.\nDeath.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOn February 28, 1966, See and Charles Bassett were flying with their backup crew, Gene Cernan and Thomas Stafford, from Ellington Air Force Base to Lambert Field in St. Louis, Missouri, for two weeks of space rendezvous simulator training. The prime crew flew in one jet and the backup crew in another. See was the pilot of their T-38 trainer jet, with Bassett in the rear seat.\nThe weather at Lambert Field that Monday morning was poor and required an instrument approach. Both jets overshot the initial landing attempt; See continued with a visual circling approach and Stafford elected to follow the standard procedure for a missed approach. On his second attempt, See undershot the runway, hit the afterburners and turned to the right.\nThe jet crashed into McDonnell Aircraft Building 101, where the Gemini spacecraft was built. See was found in a parking lot still strapped to his ejection seat. Both astronauts died instantly from trauma sustained in the accident, within of their spacecraft. See and Bassett were buried near each other in Arlington National Cemetery; their graves are about from Theodore Freeman, another astronaut who had died in a T-38 crash sixteen months earlier.\nAfter a reporter had disclosed to Freeman's wife that he had died, NASA enacted new policies to avoid a similar embarrassing situation in the future. In compliance with these policies, astronaut John Young asked Marilyn Lovell and Jane Conrad to go to Marilyn See's house and ensure that she did not find out about her husband's death from a non-NASA source. They rushed over and made excuses for their early surprise visit. After Young arrived to break the news, the three hugged her for comfort. Marilyn Lovell then went to the school to pick up Marilyn See's children, to make sure they did not find out from the press.\nA NASA investigative panel later concluded that pilot error, caused by bad weather, was the principal cause of the accident. The panel concluded that See was flying too low on his second approach, probably due to poor visibility. At the time, See was known as one of the better pilots in the astronaut corps. Slayton later expressed doubts about See's flying abilities, claiming that he flew too slowly: \"[He] wasn't aggressive enough ... he flew too slow\u2014a fatal problem in a plane like the T-38, which will stall easily if you get below .\"\nJim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin were promoted to the backup crew as a result of the accident. Stafford and Cernan, the original backup crew, were launched three months later on June 3, 1966, as Gemini\u00a09A. The shuffling of the Gemini crews caused by the deaths of See and Bassett affected crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and Project Apollo missions. In particular, Aldrin flew as the pilot of Gemini 12, and later Apollo 11.\nOn Friday, March 4, 1966, both men were buried in Arlington National Cemetery. During funeral services in Texas two days before, Aldrin, Bill Anders, and Walter Cunningham flew the missing man formation in See's honor, while Lovell, Jim McDivitt, and civilian pilot Jere Cobb did the same to honor Bassett.\nLegacy.\nSee was survived by his wife Marilyn and three children. After his death she continued to live in Houston, where she worked as a court reporter. See's name is inscribed on the \"Fallen Astronaut\" plaque placed on the Moon by Apollo 15 in 1971. He is also listed on the Space Mirror Memorial at the John F. Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, dedicated in 1991. He was honored by Highland Park High School in 2010 as one of the recipients of its Distinguished Alumni Award. A conference room in Wiley Hall at the USMMA is also dedicated to his memory.\nSee was a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) and an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).\nIn media.\nSee was played by Steve Zahn in the 1998 HBO miniseries \"From the Earth to the Moon\", and by Patrick Fugit in the 2018 film \"First Man\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Oscar-nominated film tells the story of a daredevil test pilot (Gable), his wife (Loy), and his best friend (Tracy).\n\"Test Pilot\" was written by Howard Hawks, Vincent Lawrence, John Lee Mahin, Frank Wead, and Waldemar Young. The screenplay was largely based on an original story by former naval aviator Wead.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nReckless test pilot Jim Lane is forced to land on a Kansas farm in his aircraft, the \"Drake Bullet\", where he meets Ann \"Thursday\" Barton. They spend the day together and fall in love. Once Jim's best friend and mechanic, Gunner Morris, arrives, Jim ignores Ann. To spur him, she gets engaged to her sweetheart. Jim leaves in the morning, but soon comes back for her. They quickly get married.\nJim loses his job at Drake when he clashes with the owner. He gets a job with another outfit, flying a very experimental aircraft. Ann soon finds out how dangerous her husband's occupation is, but she promises Gunner that she will stick to her man. Jim wins the race, but Benson, the man Drake sends in Jim's place, dies, leaving a wife and three children behind.\nJim tries to reform his ways and begins by taking a job testing aircraft, even conducting dangerous flights as he wants to give Ann a real home. Gunner remains true to his friend.\nOne day, Gunner accompanies Jim on a test flight of a new bomber (a Y1B-17, a pre-production Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress prototype). Upon reaching , the bomber goes into a spin and sandbags (substituting for the weight of bombs) break loose, pinning Gunner. Unwilling to bail out without his buddy, Jim manages to crash land, and pulls a badly injured Gunner out of the wreckage right before it burst into flames, but it is too late for Gunner. When Jim realizes the toll his job has taken on his wife, he gives it up and joins the United States Army Air Corps.\nCast.\nAs appearing in \"Test Pilot\" (main roles and screen credits identified):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\n\"Test Pilot\" brought together three of the most bankable Hollywood stars of the period, but while Loy and Gable became friends, an uneasy relationship existed between Tracy and Gable. At the climax of a lengthy take where he was cradling his comrade's head in his arms, Gable was reported to have said, \"Die, goddamn it, Spence! I wish to Christ you would!\" and dropped Tracy's head with a thud.\nPrincipal photography took place from December 1, 1937, to February 18, 1938, at MGM studios and on location at Van Nuys, California, Lindbergh Field (San Diego), March Field, California, and at the Cleveland National Air Races, with retakes on March 30 to early April 1938. \"Test Pilot\" utilized authentic United States Army Air Corps airfield settings and was able to obtain rights to film using Boeing's new Y1B-17, which was destined to become the progenitor of the wartime B-17 bomber series. The Drake Bullet was actually the SEV-S2 NR70Y, a modified civilian racer version of the U.S. Army Air Corps P-35. The other test aircraft that is flown to its top diving speed is a Northrop A-17 attack bomber. Renowned movie stunt pilot Paul Mantz served as the second unit director in charge of the flying sequences. Although uncredited, real-life test pilot Sammy Wroath did the flying sequences.\nReception.\nProving to be an \"audience-pleaser\" and becoming one of MGM's top money-makers in 1938, \"Test Pilot\" also found favor with critics. Frank S. Nugent of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a bang-up aviation drama ... It is a generous show by any reckoning, long in its running time, star-studded and spectacular, and Victor Fleming, its director, has paced it wisely.\" \"Film Daily\" raved, \"Spectacular romance thriller ... It can't miss.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" wrote, \"Excellent entertainment ... Other air pictures have been made; but for sheer thrills, this one leads them all because of the realistic way it has been done.\" John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that while aviation films with fine flying scenes had already been done, those in this picture were \"superior to the average\".\nToday, it is considered a significant aviation film by historians due to the use of contemporary aircraft. Even at the time of its release, \"Variety\" noted that the \"story bespeaks authority in detail, obviously explained by the fact that Capt. Frank Wead, who authored the original, has had (a) practical aviation background.\"\nBoth Loy and Tracy (despite his obvious scene-stealing battles with Gable) later claimed \"Test Pilot\" was their favorite film.\nBox office.\nAccording to MGM records, \"Test Pilot\" earned $2,431,000 in the U.S. and $1,472,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $967,000.\nAcademy Award nominations.\n\"Test Pilot\" was nominated for Best Picture at the 11th Academy Awards, while Wead was nominated for Best Story, and Tom Held for Best Film Editing.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The screenplay by Casey Robinson was based on the 1934 play of the same title by George Brewer and Bertram Bloch, starring Tallulah Bankhead.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nJudith \"Judy\" Traherne is a young, carefree, hedonistic Long Island socialite and heiress with a passion for horses, fast cars, and too much smoking and drinking. She initially ignores severe headaches and brief episodes of dizziness and double vision, but when she uncharacteristically takes a spill while riding and then tumbles down a flight of stairs, her secretary and best friend Ann King insists she see the family doctor, who refers her to a specialist.\nDr. Frederick Steele is closing his New York City office in preparation for a move to Brattleboro, Vermont, where he plans to devote his time to brain cell research and scientific study on their growth. He reluctantly agrees to see Judy, who acts coldly and is openly antagonistic towards him. She shows signs of short-term memory loss but dismisses her symptoms. Steele convinces her the ailments she is experiencing are severe and potentially life-threatening and puts his career plans on hold to tend to her.\nWhen diagnostic tests confirm his suspicions, Judy agrees to surgery to remove a malignant glioma brain tumor. Steele discovers the tumor cannot be removed entirely and realizes she has less than a year to live. The end will be painless but swift; shortly after experiencing total blindness, Judy will die.\nTo allow her a few more months of happiness, Steele opts to lie to Judy and Ann and assures them the surgery was a success. As he is a poor liar, Ann is suspicious and confronts Steele, who admits the truth. Steele tells Ann \"she must never know\" she will die soon. She agrees to remain silent and continue the lie.\nJudy and Steele become involved romantically and eventually engaged. While helping his assistant pack the office before their departure for Vermont, Judy discovers her case history file containing letters from several doctors, all of them confirming Steele's prognosis. Assuming Steele was marrying her out of pity, Judy breaks off the engagement and reverts to her former lifestyle. One day, her stable master Michael O'Leary, who for years has loved her from afar, confronts her about her unruly behavior, and she confesses she is dying. Their conversation convinces her she should spend her final months happy, dignified, and with the man she loves. She apologizes to Steele, and they marry and move to Vermont.\nThree months later, Ann comes to visit. Judy and she are in the garden planting bulbs when Judy comments on how odd it is she still feels the sun's heat under the rapidly darkening skies. They both immediately realize she is losing her vision and approaching the end. Judy makes Ann stay mum, as Steele leaves that day to present his most recent medical findings\u2014which hold out the long-term prospect of a cure for her type of cancer\u2014in New York. Judy makes an excuse to remain home, helps him pack, and sends him off, telling him, \"What we have now can't be destroyed. That's our victory, our victory over the dark. It's a victory because we're not afraid.\"\nThen, after bidding Ann, her housekeeper Martha (who has silently deduced the situation), and her dogs farewell, she goes to her bedroom. Martha follows Judy and, upon entering the room, pauses as she sees Judy kneeling briefly, apparently praying. Judy then lies down on the bed; Martha drapes a blanket over her, withdrawing quietly when Judy asks to be left alone.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Bette Davis as Judith Traherne\nCast notes:\nProduction.\nTallulah Bankhead originated the role of Judith Traherne in the Broadway production, which ran for 51 performances at the Plymouth Theatre, before being cut short when Bankhead fell ill with a bacterial infection. Davis openly admitted in later years that she had emulated Bankhead in the role. In 1935, David O. Selznick wanted to cast Greta Garbo and Fredric March in the leads, but Garbo chose to play the lead in \"Anna Karenina\" instead. In 1936, he offered the role to Merle Oberon, but contractual problems with Samuel Goldwyn prevented her from doing the film. \nWhen Bette Davis discovered the play in 1938, she shopped it to every producer on the Warners lot, and Hal Wallis bought the rights from Selznick for her, for $50,000, when director Edmound Goulding and producer David Lewis showed interest in the project.\nAccording to another account, Casey Robinson, the writer, had wanted to buy the play ever since he saw it on stage, knowing how to adapt it. He lost the rights to David O. Selznick but when Selznick decided not to make it, recommended Hal Wallis but it for Warners. Robinson said:\nThe play was about a rich, spoiled girl who gets carcinoma of the brain and is going to die. In the second act she learns she is going to die and accepts it gallantly... They just had a lot of gabble in the third act that meant nothing. There had to be, in the middle of the piece, a period of great rebellion against fate\u2014of anger, which, of course, was mixed up with her love for the doctor. Also, the anger that she hadn\u2019t been told, and so on. That was an entirely new development in the screenplay and a very important one.\nRobinson decided the film would be about two things, love and death:\nI decided that these two elements should be kept apart as long as possible\u2014that when there was a scene about love, it wasn\u2019t about death; when there was a scene about death, it wasn\u2019t about love. That is, on the surface. So when there was a scene about love, death was underneath it; when there was a scene about death, love was underneath it\u2014 all the time until the very end, when they would reunite into a sort of requiem. Now, in order to do that, I needed a character, and that was the birth of Ann [Geraldine Fitzgerald], the secretary-companion of the heroine Judith Traherne. She was not in the play at all.\nDavis had recently ended affairs with William Wyler and Howard Hughes and her husband Ham Nelson had filed for divorce, and after the first few days of filming she begged to be released from her contract, claiming she was too sick to continue. Producer Hal Wallis responded, \"I've seen the rushes \u2013 stay sick!\" She found comfort with Brent, who had just divorced Constance Worth, and the two embarked on an affair that continued throughout filming and for a year \u2013 and three films \u2013 after. Goulding shot the film in sequence, and the arc of Judith's relationship with Dr. Steele mirrored Davis' relationship with Brent. Davis was later to say that she wanted to marry Brent, but thought that it wouldn't work out. Still, \"Of the men I didn't marry, the dearest was George Brent.\"\nThe tune \"Oh! Give Me Time for Tenderness\", sung by Judith, was written by Edmund Goulding and Elsie Janis. The voice of Vera Van was dubbed for Davis.\nAnother scene for the film's ending was shot, but ultimately was deemed anticlimactic: after Judith's death, her horse was seen winning a race, and her stablehand Michael (Bogart) was shown crying. The scene met with negative response with sneak preview audiences and was cut.\nThe film premiered at Radio City Music Hall.\nReception.\nFrank S. Nugent, in his review in \"The New York Times\", observed: \"A completely cynical appraisal would dismiss it all as emotional flim-flam, a heartless play upon tender hearts by a playwright and company well versed in the dramatic uses of going blind and improvising on \"Camille\". But it is impossible to be that cynical about it. The mood is too poignant, the performances too honest, the craftsmanship too expert. Miss Davis, naturally, has dominated\u2014and quite properly\u2014her film, but Miss Fitzgerald has added a sentient and touching portrayal of the friend, and George Brent, as the surgeon, is\u2014dare we say?\u2014surprisingly self-contained and mature. This once we must run the risk of being called a softy: we won't dismiss \"Dark Victory\" with a self-defensive sneer.\"\nAn article in \"Neurology\" says the film marked \"the beginnings of the depiction of neurologic disease in cinema. Bette Davis' cinematic portrayal of a young woman dying from a brain tumor is close to the reality of denial, bargaining, a hope for a cure, and final acceptance.\" Although the film \"shows an implausible clinical course (an abrupt peaceful ending)...the cinematic portrayal of the vicissitudes of living with a brain tumor is often close to reality.\"\n\"Variety\" called the film \"intense drama\" and \"a nicely produced offering [with] Bette Davis in a powerful and impressive role.\"\n\"Time Out London\" critic Tom Milne writes: \"[Davis] and [director Edmund] Goulding almost transform the soap into style; a Rolls-Royce of the weepie world.\"\nOn Turner Classic Movies, Margarita Landazuri said: \"\"Dark Victory\" was a three-hanky hit. Filmgoers and critics alike knew their emotions were being manipulated, but so expertly and touchingly that they couldn't help but cheer.\"\nThe film is mentioned in the play \"Steel Magnolias\", by Clairee in Act Two, Scene 1. It is also mentioned in the 2015 movie \"The Frontier\" by the Luanne character as a missed opportunity in her career.\n\"Dark Victory\" currently holds an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Bette Davis does it her way with a tour de force performance in \"Dark Victory\", a moving melodrama that snatches triumph from the jaws of mortality.\"\nAwards and honors.\nBette Davis was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress but lost to Vivien Leigh, star of \"Gone with the Wind\". Max Steiner, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score for both this and \"Gone with the Wind\", lost to Herbert Stothart for \"The Wizard of Oz\". The film itself lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to \"Gone with the Wind\".\n\"The New York Times\" named \"Dark Victory\" as one of the \"10 Best Films of 1939\", as did \"Film Daily\", and the National Board of Review picked both Bette Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald for Best Acting that year.\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\nAdaptations and remakes.\nRadio.\nOn January 8, 1940, Davis and Spencer Tracy appeared in a 60-minute adaptation of the film on \"Lux Radio Theatre\". Barbara Stanwyck and Melvyn Douglas had previously performed an adaptation, one based on the original Broadway play, on \"Lux Radio Theatre\" on April 4, 1938. On March 6, 1952, CBS Radio's \"Hollywood Sound Stage\" aired a condensed 30-minute version starring Stanwyck and David Brian.\nFilm.\nIn 1963, the film was remade as \"Stolen Hours\" with Susan Hayward and Michael Craig, directed by Daniel Petrie. The action took place in then-contemporary England.\nTelevision.\nIt was remade in 1953, under its original title, as a TV adaptation for the \"Broadway Television Theatre\", starring Sylvia Sidney, Christopher Plummer, and Ian Keith. In 1976, the story was produced under its original title as an NBC television movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery as television producer Katherine Merrill under the care of Dr. Michael Grant, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins; this version was directed by Robert Butler.\nMusic.\nMax Steiner's original score to \"Dark Victory\" was released in 2006 by Screen Archives Entertainment and Chelsea Rialto Studios. The album contains the majority of the score as heard in the film in chronological order. It was produced using digital copies of the composer's personal reference acetate discs stored at Brigham Young University which were digitally restored by Ray Faiola. This rare limited edition includes a lavishly illustrated 32-page color booklet featuring extensive liner notes by film and music historians Rudy Behlmer, Ray Faiola and James V. D'Arc (curator of the BYU Film Music Archives) detailing the film's production and scoring.\nTrack listing\nTotal Time: 38:76\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nStreaming audio"}

It is relatively easy to tie and is secure, but can become difficult to untie after heavy loading, and can jam badly in any rope type.\nTying methods.\nOn a bight.\nA figure-eight loop is created by doubling the rope into a bight, then tying the standard figure-eight knot.\nIn climbing, this knot is used to save time when repeatedly attaching the rope to climbing harnesses, using locking carabiners, such as when a group of people are climbing on the same top-rope.\nFollow-through.\nAlternatively, to tie the knot directly around an object, the follow-through method must be used. \nClimbing.\nThis is the standard method for attaching a rope to a climbing harness.\nOften an additional strangle knot (which is half of a double fisherman's knot) \"backup knot\" is tied in the tail of the figure 8. This is not required for the knot's integrity during climbing, but could prevent ring-loading failure if belaying from the rope loop (instead of a dedicated belay loop). It also ensures that adequate tail length has been included, and gets excess tail out of the way. If the finish knot is not included, the tail should be 4 to 8 inches long. The tail can also be tucked back into the knot, called a \"Yosemite finish\" or \"Yosemite tuck\". This holds the bottom loop open, making the knot easier to untie after falling, but also making it weaker in a ring-loading configuration.\nThe diameter of the loop should be kept small to avoid being caught on protrusions while falling, or clipped into accidentally while lead climbing. A well-dressed knot has a symmetrical appearance, with the strands parallel through each curve.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It came to prominence when it was reprinted as the lead piece of the April 1934 issue of \"The Atlantic Monthly\". The success of the \"Atlantic Monthly\" publication prompted a book deal between the author and the US publisher Little, Brown and Company, who published the story in book form for the first time in June 1934. Published during the Great Depression, Little, Brown cautiously released a small first print run. Public demand for more was immediate and Little, Brown went into an almost immediate reprinting the same month. Public demand remained strong, and Little, Brown continued to reprint the book in cautious lots for many months, with at least two reprintings per month.\nThe first British edition went to press in October 1934. The publishers were Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who had observed the success of the book in the United States, and they released a much larger first print run. It sold 15,000 copies on the day of publication, and they quickly found themselves going into reprints as the reading public's demand for the book proved insatiable. With the huge success of this book, James Hilton became a best-selling author. In 1938, he published a sequel, \"To You, Mr Chips\".\nPlot summary.\nThe novella tells the story of a beloved school teacher, Mr Chipping, and his long tenure at Brookfield School, a fictional minor British boys' public boarding school located in the fictional village of Brookfield in the Fenlands. Mr Chips, as the boys call him, is conventional in his beliefs and exercises firm discipline in the classroom. His views broaden, and his pedagogical manner loosens after he marries Katherine, a young woman whom he meets on holiday in the Lake District. Katherine charms the Brookfield teachers and headmaster and quickly wins the favour of Brookfield's pupils. Their marriage is brief. She dies in childbirth and he never remarries or has another romantic interest.\nOne of the themes of the book is that Chipping so outlasts all of his peers that his brief marriage fades into myth and few people know him as anything other than a confirmed and lonely bachelor. Despite Chipping's mediocre credentials and his view that classic Greek and Latin (his academic subjects) should be taught using obsolete instructional methods, he is an effective teacher who becomes highly regarded by pupils and the school's governors\u2014he has become a well-worn institution. In his later years, he develops an arch sense of humour that pleases everyone. However, he also becomes somewhat of an anachronism, and is pitied for his isolation. On his deathbed, he talks of the fulfillment he felt as a teacher of boys.\nInspiration.\nThe setting for \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" is probably based on The Leys School, Cambridge, where James Hilton was a pupil (1915\u201318). Hilton is reported to have said that the inspiration for the protagonist, Mr. Chips, came from many sources, including his father, who was the headmaster of Chapel End School. Mr. Chips is also likely to have been based on W. H. Balgarnie, a master at The Leys (1900\u201330), who was in charge of the \"Leys Fortnightly\" (in which Hilton's first short stories and essays were published.) Over the years, old boys wrote to Geoffery Houghton, a master at The Leys and a historian of the school, confirming the links between Chipping and Balgarnie, who eventually died at Porthmadog at the age of 82. Balgarnie had been linked with the school for 51 years and spent his last years in modest lodgings nearby. Like Mr. Chips, Balgarnie was a strict disciplinarian, but would also invite boys to visit him for tea and biscuits.\nHilton wrote upon Balgarnie's death that \"Balgarnie was, I suppose, the chief model for my story. When I read so many other stories about public school life, I am struck by the fact that I suffered no such purgatory as their authors apparently did, and much of this miracle was due to Balgarnie.\" The mutton chop side whiskers of one of the masters at The Leys earned him the nickname \"Chops\", a likely inspiration for Mr Chips' name.\nIn Hilton\u2019s final novel, \"Time and Time Again\" (1953), protagonist Charles Anderson bears clear biographical similarities to Hilton himself. Early in the novel, Anderson briefly reminisces about attending Brookfield and knowing \"Chips\".\nAdaptations.\nRadio.\nA 50-minute adaptation by James Hilton and Barbara Burnham was broadcast on the BBC National Programme at 20:00 on 23 July 1936, with Richard Goolden in the title part and a cast that included Norman Shelley, Ronald Simpson, Lewis Shaw and Hermione Hannen. There was a repeat broadcast the following evening.\nA radio adaptation by the \"Lux Radio Theatre\" starring Laurence Olivier and Edna Best and presented by Cecil B. DeMille was first broadcast on 20 November 1939. \nA radio adaptation by \"Hallmark Playhouse\" starring Ronald Colman was broadcast on 16 September 1948. Jean Holloway wrote the adaptation, Dee Engelbach was the producer and director, and James Hilton was the host. A second version, told from the point of view of Mrs. Chips as portrayed by Deborah Kerr, was broadcast on 1 February 1951. Whitfield Connor was Mr. Chips, Leonard St. Clair wrote the adaptation, Bill Gay was the producer and director, and James Hilton was again the host. \nA radio adaptation by the \"NBC University Theatre\" was broadcast on 10 July 1949, starring Herbert Marshall and Alma Lawton. Agnes Eckhardt wrote the adaptation, and Andrew C. Love was the director.\nA radio adaptation in two parts by Margaret Simpson was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in October 1980 and was rebroadcast by BBC Radio 4 Extra in September 2005 and again in September 2025.\nTheatre.\nBarbara Burnham adapted the book for a stage production in three acts, which was first performed at the Shaftesbury Theatre on 23 September 1938, with Leslie Banks as Mr. Chips and Constance Cummings as his wife Katherine. It ran for over 100 performances until 14 January 1939.\nA stage musical based on the original novel, but using most of the Leslie Bricusse vocal score of the 1969 film, was mounted at the Chichester Festival and opened on 11 August 1982. The book was by Roland Starke and the production was directed by Patrick Garland and Christopher Selbie. Among the Chichester Festival cast were John Mills as Mr. Chips, Colette Gleeson as Kathie, Nigel Stock as Max, Michael Sadler, Paul Hardwick, Simon Butteriss and Robert Meadmore in supporting roles, and 20 local school boys, including Kevin Farrar who was selected by Bricusse to sing the final verse of the iconic \"School Song\". The original cast album was recorded on the That's Entertainment Records label TER 1025 at Abbey Roads Studios in London on 17/18 August 1982. JAY-jay Records also have a release of it.\nFilm.\n1939 film.\nThis version stars Robert Donat, Greer Garson, Terry Kilburn, John Mills, and Paul Henreid. Donat won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the lead role, beating Clark Gable, James Stewart, Laurence Olivier, and Mickey Rooney. While some of the incidents depicted in the various screen adaptations do not appear in the book, this film is generally faithful to the original story. The exteriors of the buildings of the fictional Brookfield School were filmed at Repton School, an independent school (at the time of filming, for boys only), located in the village of Repton, in Derbyshire, in the Midlands area of England, whilst the interiors, school courtyards and annexes, including the supposedly exterior shots of the Austrian Tyrol Mountains, were filmed at Denham Film Studios, near the village of Denham in Buckinghamshire. Around 200 boys from Repton School stayed on during the school holidays so that they could appear in the film.\n1969 film.\nIn 1969 a musical film version appeared, starring Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark, with songs by Leslie Bricusse and an underscore by John Williams. In this version the character of Katherine is greatly expanded, and the time setting of the story is moved forward several decades, with Chips' career beginning in the early 20th century and his later career covering World War II, rather than World War I. O'Toole and Clark's performances were widely praised. At the 42nd Academy Awards, O'Toole was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.\nTelevision.\n1984 serial.\nIn 1984 it was adapted as a television serial by the BBC. It starred Roy Marsden and Jill Meager and ran for six half-hour episodes. Many scenes were filmed at Repton School, Derbyshire, in an effort to remain faithful to the original film.\n2002 serial.\nA television film adaptation was produced by STV Studios (then known as \"SMG TV Productions\") in 2002. It aired on the ITV Network in Britain and on PBS's \"Masterpiece Theatre\" in the United States. It starred Martin Clunes and Victoria Hamilton with Henry Cavill, William Moseley, Oliver Rokison and Harry Lloyd.\nParodies.\n\"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" was parodied in the British sketch comedy programmes \"Hale and Pace\" (as \"Piss Off, Mr. Chips\") and \"Big Train\".\nVince Gilligan created the television show \"Breaking Bad\" with the premise that the show's protagonist Walter White would turn \"From Mr. Chips to \"Scarface\"\" through the series's course.\nIn the Marx Brothers film \"At the Circus\", as Groucho Marx is about to walk out of a scene, he shakes hands with a nearby caged monkey and says, \"Goodbye, Mister Chimps.\"\nIn 2009, the short-running ABC sitcom \"Better Off Ted\" titles its 6th episode \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" wherein the computer system misidentifies then completely deletes the account of Ted Crisp, the main character.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
