Set in post-World War II Allied-occupied Vienna, the film centres on American writer Holly Martins, who arrives in the city to accept a job with his friend Harry Lime, only to learn that he has died. Martins stays in Vienna to investigate Lime's death, becoming infatuated with Lime's girlfriend Anna Schmidt.\nThe use of black-and-white German expressionist-influenced cinematography by Robert Krasker, with its harsh lighting and Dutch angles, is a major feature of \"The Third Man\". Combined with the use of ruined locations in Vienna, the style evokes exhaustion and cynicism at the start of the Cold War.\nGreene wrote a novella as a treatment for the screenplay. Composer Anton Karas' title composition \"The Third Man Theme\" topped the international music charts in 1950, bringing international fame to the previously unknown performer. \"The Third Man\" is considered one of the greatest films of all time, celebrated for its acting, musical score, and atmospheric cinematography.\nIn 1999, the British Film Institute voted \"The Third Man\" the greatest British film of all time. In 2011, a poll for \"Time Out\" ranked it the second-best British film ever.\nPlot.\nHolly Martins, an American author of Western pulp novels, arrives in the British sector of Allied-occupied Vienna seeking Harry Lime, a childhood friend who has offered him a job. However, Martins is told that Lime was killed by a car while crossing the street. At Lime's funeral, Martins meets two Royal Military Police officers, part of the ICPO: Sergeant Paine, a fan of Martins' novels, and Major Calloway. Afterward, Martins is asked to lecture at a book club a few days later. He then meets a friend of Lime's, \"Baron\" Kurtz, who tells Martins that he and another friend, Popescu, carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident, and that, before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins and Lime's girlfriend, actress Anna Schmidt.\nAs Martins and Anna query Lime's death, they realise that accounts differ as to whether Lime was able to speak before his death, and how many men carried away the body. The porter at Lime's apartment tells them that he saw a third man helping. He offers to give Martins more information but is murdered before they can speak again; Martins and Anna flee the scene after a mob begins to suspect him of the murder. When Martins confronts Major Calloway and demands that Lime's death be investigated, Calloway reveals that Lime was stealing penicillin from military hospitals, diluting it, and then selling it on the black market, injuring or killing countless people. Martins agrees to drop his investigation and leave.\nAn inebriated Martins visits Anna and confesses his feelings for her. A man crosses the street towards her front door, but moves away after seeing Martins at the window. After leaving, Martins walks the streets until he notices Anna's cat and realises someone is watching from a darkened doorway. In a momentary flash of light, Martins sees that the man is Lime. Martins calls out, but Lime flees and vanishes. Martins summons Calloway, who realises that Lime has escaped through the city's sewers to the Soviet sector. The British police exhume Lime's coffin and discover that the body is that of a hospital orderly who had been assisting him. Anna, who is Czech, is to be sent to the Soviet sector after the British police discover that she has a forged Austrian passport, and is questioned again by Calloway.\nMartins goes to Kurtz and asks to see Lime. Lime and Martins meet and talk as they ride the Wiener Riesenrad. Lime speaks cynically of the insignificance of his victims' lives and the personal gains to be earned from the city's chaos and deprivation. Martins realises that Lime sold Anna out to the Soviet authorities for his own benefit. Lime obliquely threatens Martins as now the only 'proof' that Lime is alive. Lime then offers Martins a chance to join in on his scheme before leaving quickly. Calloway asks Martins to help arrest Lime; he agrees provided that Calloway will arrange for Anna to leave Vienna rather than be handed over to the Soviets. The British authorities arrange for Anna to take a train to Paris, but she spots Martins, who has come to observe her departure, at the station. After persuading Martins to reveal the plan to capture Lime, she leaves in order to warn him. Exasperated, Martins decides to leave Vienna; on the way to the airport, Calloway stops at a hospital to show Martins children dying of meningitis who were treated with Lime's diluted penicillin, which convinces him to stay and assist in capturing Lime.\nLime arrives at a caf\u00e9 in the international zone to meet Martins, but Anna is able to warn him that the police are closing in. He flees into the sewer, with the police following him underground. Lime shoots and kills Sgt Paine, but Calloway shoots and badly wounds Lime. Lime drags himself up a cast-iron stairway to a street grating but cannot lift it. Martins, armed with Paine's gun, runs after Lime finding him beneath the grating where they stare at each other. Calloway, realising Martins has chased Lime, shouts that Martins must not take any chances and shoot on sight. Lime nods his head slightly at Martins. Calloway follows down the tunnel as a single shot is heard.\nMartins attends Lime's second funeral at the risk of missing his flight out of Vienna. He waits on the road to the cemetery to speak with Anna, but she walks past without glancing in his direction.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Orson Welles as Harry Lime \nUncredited\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Annie Rosar as the porter's wife \nProduction.\nBefore writing the screenplay, Graham Greene worked out the atmosphere, characterisation, and mood of the story by writing a novella as a film treatment. He never intended for it to be read by the general public, although it was later published under the same name as the film. The novella is narrated in the first person from Calloway's perspective. In 1948, Greene met Elizabeth Montagu in Vienna; she gave him tours of the city, its sewers, and some of its less reputable nightclubs. She also introduced Greene to Peter Smolka, the central European correspondent for \"The Times\", who gave Greene stories about the black market in Vienna.\nDuring the shooting of the film, the final scene was the subject of a dispute between producer David O. Selznick and Reed. While Selznick preferred the hopeful ending of the novella, with Martins and Anna walking away arm-in-arm, Reed refused to end the film on what he felt was an artificially happy note. Greene later wrote: \"One of the very few major disputes between Carol Reed and myself concerned the ending, and he has been proved triumphantly right.\" Selznick's contribution, according to himself, was mainly enlisting Cotten and Welles and producing the shortened US version.\nThrough the years there was occasional speculation that Welles was the \"de facto\" director of \"The Third Man\" rather than Reed. Jonathan Rosenbaum's 2007 book \"Discovering Orson Welles\" calls this a \"popular misconception\", although Rosenbaum did note that the film \"began to echo the Wellesian theme of betrayed male friendship and certain related ideas from \"Citizen Kane\".\" Rosenbaum writes that Welles \"didn't direct anything in the picture; the basics of his shooting and editing style, its music and meaning, are plainly absent. Yet old myths die hard, and some viewers persist in believing otherwise.\" Welles himself fuelled this theory in a 1958 interview, in which he said he \"entirely wrote the role\" of the Harry Lime character and that he'd had an unspecified role in making the film\u2014more than the contribution he made to \"Journey into Fear\"\u2014but that it was a \"delicate matter\" he did not want to discuss because he wasn't the film's producer. However, in a 1967 interview with Peter Bogdanovich, Welles said that his involvement was minimal: \"It was Carol's picture\". Welles did contribute some of the film's best-known dialogue. Bogdanovich also stated in the introduction to the DVD: \nHowever, I think it's important to note that the look of \"The Third Man\"\u2014and, in fact, the whole film\u2014would be unthinkable without \"Citizen Kane\", \"The Stranger\" and \"The Lady from Shanghai\", all of which Orson made in the '40s, and all of which preceded \"The Third Man\". Carol Reed, I think, was definitely influenced by Orson Welles, the director, from the films he had made.\nPrincipal photography.\nSix weeks of principal photography were shot on location in Vienna, ending on 11 December 1948. Some use was made of the Sievering Studios facilities in the city. Production then moved to Worton Hall Studios in Isleworth and Shepperton Studios in Surrey and was completed in March 1949. Thomas Riegler emphasises the opportunities for Cold War espionage that the Vienna locations made available, and notes that \"the audio engineer Jack Davies noticed at least one mysterious person on the set.\"\nThe scenes of Harry Lime in the sewer were shot on location or on sets built at Shepperton; most of the location shots used doubles for Welles. However, Reed claimed that, despite initial reluctance, Welles quickly became enthusiastic and stayed in Vienna to finish the film.\nAccording to the 2015 recollection of assistant director Guy Hamilton, Greene and Reed worked very well together but Welles \"generally annoyed everyone on the set\". His temporary absence forced Hamilton to step in as a body double, and the filming of the sewer scenes was moved to studios in the UK as a result of Welles' complaints about shooting in the actual sewers.\nReed had four different camera units shooting around Vienna for the duration of the production. He worked around the clock, using Benzedrine to stay awake.\n\"Cuckoo clock\" speech.\nIn a famous scene, Lime meets Martins on the Wiener Riesenrad in the Prater amusement park. Looking down on the people below from his vantage point, Lime compares them to dots, and says that it would be insignificant if one of them or a few of them \"stopped moving, forever\". Back on the ground, he notes:\nYou know what the fellow said\u2014in Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed; but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love; they had 500 years of democracy and peace\u2014and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock!\nAccording to scriptwriter Graham Greene, \"the popular line of dialogue concerning Swiss cuckoo clocks was written into the script by Mr Welles himself\" (in the published script, it is in a footnote). Greene wrote in a letter that \"What happened was that during the shooting of \"The Third Man\" it was found necessary for the timing to insert another sentence.\" Welles apparently said the lines came from \"an old Hungarian play\"\u2014in any event the idea is not original to Welles, as acknowledged by the phrase \"what the fellow said\". The likeliest source is the painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler; in an 1885 lecture published in \"Mr Whistler's \"Ten O'Clock\"\" in 1888, he said that \"The Swiss in their mountains\u00a0... What more worthy people!\u00a0... yet, the perverse and scornful [goddess, Art] will have none of it, and the sons of patriots are left with the clock that turns the mill, and the sudden cuckoo, with difficulty restrained in its box! For this was Tell a hero! For this did Gessler die!\" In a 1916 reminiscence, American painter Theodore Wores said that he \"tried to get an acknowledgment from Whistler that San Francisco would some day become a great art center on account of our climatic, scenic and other advantages. 'But environment does not lead to a production of art,' Whistler retorted. 'Consider Switzerland. There the people have everything in the form of natural advantages\u2014mountains, valleys and blue sky. And what have they produced? The cuckoo clock!\"\nWelles also may have been influenced by Geoffrey Household, who wrote in his 1939 novel \"Rogue Male\": \"...Swiss. A people, my dear fellow, of quite extraordinary stupidity and immorality. A combination which only a long experience of democratic government could have produced.\"\n\"This Is Orson Welles\" (1993) quotes Welles: \"When the picture came out, the Swiss very nicely pointed out to me that they've never made any cuckoo clocks\", as cuckoo clocks were actually invented in the German Black Forest (however, it is not true that the Swiss have never made any cuckoo clocks: they contributed a whole subtype, the chalet style). Writer John McPhee pointed out that when the Borgias flourished in Italy, Switzerland had \"the most powerful and feared military force in Europe\" and was not the neutral country it later became.\nMusic.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhat sort of music it is, whether jaunty or sad, fierce or provoking, it would be hard to reckon; but under its enthrallment, the camera comes into play\u00a0... The unseen zither-player\u00a0... is made to employ his instrument much as the Homeric bard did his lyre.\n William Whitebait, \"New Statesman and Nation\" (1949) \nZither player Anton Karas composed and performed the film's score. Before the production came to Vienna, Karas was an unknown performer in local \"Heurigers\". According to \"Time\": \"The picture demanded music appropriate to post-World War II Vienna, but director Reed had made up his mind to avoid schmaltzy, heavily orchestrated waltzes. In Vienna one night Reed listened to a wine-garden zitherist named Anton Karas, [and] was fascinated by the jangling melancholy of his music.\"\nAccording to Guy Hamilton, Reed met Karas by coincidence at a party in Vienna, where he was playing the zither. Reed brought Karas to London, where the musician worked with Reed on the score for six weeks. Karas stayed at Reed's house during that time. The American film critic Roger Ebert later asked: \"Has there ever been a film where the music more perfectly suited the action than in Carol Reed's \"The Third Man\"?\"\nAdditional music for the film was written by the Australian-born composer Hubert Clifford under the pseudonym of Michael Sarsfield. From 1944 until 1950 Clifford was Musical Director for Korda at London Film Productions, where he chose the composers and conducted the scores for films, as well as composing many original scores of his own. An extract from his \"Third Man\" music, \"The Casanova Melody\", was orchestrated by Rodney Newton in 2000.\nDifferences between releases.\nAs the original British release begins, the voice of director Carol Reed (uncredited) describes post-war Vienna from a racketeer's point of view. The version shown in American cinemas cut eleven minutes of footage and replaced Reed's voice-over with narration by Cotten as Holly Martins. Selznick instituted the replacement narration because he did not think American audiences would relate to the seedy tone of the original. Today, Reed's original version appears on American DVDs, in showings on Turner Classic Movies, and in U.S. cinema releases with the eleven minutes of footage restored, including a shot of a near-topless dancer that would have violated the Hays Code. Both the Criterion Collection and StudioCanal DVD releases of the film include both opening monologues.\nA restored version of the film was released in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2015.\nIn September 2024, StudioCanal released a 4K restoration of the film to celebrate its 75th anniversary. It had a short run in UK cinemas and was later released on 4K Blu-ray.\nReception.\nThe Grand Gala World Premiere of the film was held at the Ritz Cinema in Hastings on 1 September 1949.\nBox office.\n\"The Third Man\" was the most popular film at the British box office in 1949.\nCritical response.\nIn Austria, \"local critics were underwhelmed\", and the film ran for only a few weeks. The Viennese \"Arbeiter-Zeitung\", although critical of a \"not-too-logical plot\", praised the film's \"masterful\" depiction of a \"time out of joint\" and the city's atmosphere of \"insecurity, poverty and post-war immorality\". William Cook, after his 2006 visit to Vienna's Third Man Museum, wrote: \"In Britain it's a thriller about friendship and betrayal. In Vienna it's a tragedy about Austria's troubled relationship with its past.\"\nSome critics at the time criticised the film's Dutch angles. C. A. Lejeune in \"The Observer\" described Reed's \"habit of printing his scenes askew, with floors sloping at a diagonal and close-ups deliriously tilted\" as \"most distracting\". Reed's friend William Wyler sent him a spirit level with a note stating: \"Carol, next time you make a picture, just put it on top of the camera, will you?\"\nUpon its release in Britain and America, the film received overwhelmingly positive reviews. \"Time\" wrote that the film was \"crammed with cinematic plums that would do the early Hitchcock proud\u2014ingenious twists and turns of plot, subtle detail, full-bodied bit characters, atmospheric backgrounds that become an intrinsic part of the story, a deft commingling of the sinister with the ludicrous, the casual with the bizarre.\" \n\"The New York Times\" movie critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review, stating that the film:\n... for all the awesome hoopla it has received, is essentially a first-rate contrivance in the way of melodrama\u2014and that's all. ... It doesn't present any 'message.' It hasn't a point of view. It is just a bang-up melodrama, designed to excite and entertain.\nNonetheless he also described it as \"an extraordinarily fascinating picture\" and that: \n[Reed] brilliantly packaged the whole bag of his cinematic tricks, his whole range of inventive genius for making the camera expound. His eminent gifts for compressing a wealth of suggestion in single shots, for building up agonized tension and popping surprises are fully exercised. His devilishly mischievous humor also runs lightly through the film, touching the darker depressions with little glints of the gay or macabre.\nA rare negative review came from the British communist newspaper \"Daily Worker\", which complained that \"no effort is spared to make the Soviet authorities as sinister and unsympathetic as possible.\"\nIn a 1997 book, Roger Ebert praised the film and wrote: \"It was a rainy day in Paris in 1962, and I was visiting Europe for the first time. A little cinema on the Left Bank was showing \"The Third Man,\" and I went, into the humid cave of Gauloise smoke and perspiration, and saw the movie for the first time. When Welles made his entrance, I was lost to the movies.\" He added it to his canon of \"Great Movies\" and wrote, \"Of all the movies that I have seen, this one most completely embodies the romance of going to the movies.\" In a 1994 episode of \"Siskel &amp; Ebert\", Ebert named Lime as his favourite film villain. Gene Siskel remarked that \"The Third Man\" was an \"exemplary piece of moviemaking, highlighting the ruins of World War II and juxtaposing it with the characters' own damaged histories\".\nThe film has a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 9.3/10 and the following consensus: \"This atmospheric thriller is one of the undisputed masterpieces of cinema, and boasts iconic performances from Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 97 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating .\nAkira Kurosawa cited \"The Third Man\" as one of his 100 favourite films.\nPauline Kael for \"The New Yorker\" later said that the film had an atmosphere of \"baroque glamour and evil.\"\nSoundtrack release.\n\"The Third Man Theme\" was released as a single in 1949/1950 (Decca in the UK, London Records in the US). It became a best-seller. By November 1949, 300,000 records had been sold in Britain, and the teen-aged Princess Margaret was reportedly a fan. Following its release in the US in 1950, \"\"The Third Man\" Theme\" spent 11 weeks at number one on \"Billboard\"'s Best Sellers in Stores chart, from 29 April to 8 July. The exposure made Anton Karas an international star; the trailer for the film stated that \"the famous musical score by Anton Karas\" would have the audience \"in a dither with his zither\".\nAwards and honours.\nBesides its top ranking in the BFI Top 100 British films list, in 2004 the magazine \"Total Film\" ranked it the fourth-greatest British film of all time. In 2005, viewers of BBC Television's \"Newsnight Review\" voted the film their fourth favourite of all time, the only film in the top five made before 1970.\nThe film also placed 57th on the American Film Institute's list of top American films in 1998, though the film's only American connections were Selznick, Welles, and Cotten. In June 2008, the AFI's \"10 Top 10\" series of lists ranked it as the fifth-best American mystery film. The film also placed 75th on AFI's list of 100 Years...100 Thrills, and Harry Lime was listed as the 37th-greatest villain in 100 Heroes and Villains.\nIt has also consistently been listed on the \"Sight and Sound\" Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time, conducted every decade. In 1982 it was 14th, 42nd in 1992, 32nd in 2002, 73rd in 2012 and 63rd in the latest poll in 2022.\nCopyright status.\nIn the United Kingdom, films of this vintage are copyright protected as dramatic works until 70 years after the end of the year in which that last \"principal author\" died. The principal authors are generally the writer/s, director/s or composer/s of original work, and since in the case of \"The Third Man\" Graham Greene died in 1991, the film is protected until the end of 2061.\nThe film lapsed into public domain in the United States when the copyright was not renewed after Selznick's death. In 1996, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act restored the film's U.S. copyright protection to StudioCanal Image UK Ltd. The Criterion Collection released a digitally restored DVD of the original British print of the film. In 2008, Criterion released a Blu-ray edition, and in September 2010, Lionsgate reissued the film on Blu-ray.\nOn 18 January 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in \"Golan v. Holder\" that the copyright clause of the United States Constitution does not prevent the U.S. from meeting its treaty obligations towards copyright protection for foreign works. Following the ruling, films such as \"The Third Man\" and \"The 39 Steps\" were taken back out of the public domain and became fully copyrighted in the United States. Under current U.S. copyright law, \"The Third Man\" will remain copyrighted until 1 January 2045.\nAdaptations.\nCotten reprised his role as Holly Martins in a one-hour \"Theatre Guild on the Air\" radio adaptation on 7 January 1951. It was also adapted as a one-hour radio play on two broadcasts of \"Lux Radio Theatre\": on 9 April 1951 with Joseph Cotten again reprising his role and on 8 February 1954 with Ray Milland as Martins.\nOn 26 December 1950, the BBC Home Service broadcast a radio adaptation by Desmond Carrington, using the actual soundtrack of the film with linking narration performed by Wilfred Thomas.\nOn 13 November 1971, as part of the \"Saturday Night Theatre\", BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation from the screenplay by Richard Wortley, with Ed Bishop as Holly Martins, Ian Hendry as Harry Lime, Ann Lynn as Anna and John Bentley as Col. Calloway,\nIn November 1994, a new dramatisation directed by Robert Robinson was performed and recorded by the L.A. Theatre Works in front of a live audience at the Guest Quarter Suite Hotel in Santa Monica, California. The cast included Kelsey Grammer as Holly Martins, Rosalind Ayres as Anna Schmidt, John Vickery as Harry Lime and John Mahoney as Major Calloway.\nSpin-offs.\nThe British radio series \"The Adventures of Harry Lime\" (broadcast in the US as \"The Lives of Harry Lime\") created as a prequel to the film, centres on Lime's adventures prior to the film, and Welles reprises his role as a somewhat less nefarious adventurer anti-hero than the sociopathic opportunist depicted in the film's incarnation. Fifty-two episodes aired in 1951 and 1952, several of which Welles wrote, including \"Ticket to Tangiers\", which is included on the Criterion Collection and StudioCanal releases of \"The Third Man\". Recordings of the 1952 episodes \"Man of Mystery\", \"Murder on the Riviera\", and \"Blackmail Is a Nasty Word\" are included on the Criterion Collection DVD \"The Complete Mr. Arkadin\".\nHarry Lime appeared in two comic book stories in the fourth issue of \"Super Detective Library\": \"The Secret of the Circus\" and \"Too Many Crooks\".\nA television spin-off starring Michael Rennie as Harry Lime ran for five seasons from 1959 to 1965. Seventy-seven episodes were filmed; directors included Paul Henreid (10 episodes) and Arthur Hiller (six episodes). Jonathan Harris played sidekick Bradford Webster for 72 episodes, and Roger Moore guest-starred in the instalment \"The Angry Young Man\", which Hiller directed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Despite being inconsistent with the expected behavior of \"normal\" matter, negative mass is mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation of momentum or energy. It is used in certain speculative theories, such as on the construction of artificial wormholes and the Alcubierre drive. The closest known real representative of such exotic matter is the region of pseudo-negative-pressure density produced by the Casimir effect.\nComplex mass.\nA hypothetical particle with complex rest mass would always travel faster than the speed of light. Such particles are called tachyons. There is no confirmed existence of tachyons.\n formula_1\nIf the rest mass formula_2 is complex this implies that the denominator is complex because the total energy is observable and thus must be real. Therefore, the quantity under the square root must be negative, which can only happen if \"v\" is greater than \"c\". As noted by Gregory Benford \"et al.,\" special relativity implies that tachyons, if they existed, could be used to communicate backwards in time (see tachyonic antitelephone). Because time travel is considered to be non-physical, tachyons are believed by physicists either not to exist, or else to be incapable of interacting with normal matter.\nIn quantum field theory, complex mass would induce tachyon condensation.\nMaterials at high pressure.\nAt high pressure, materials such as sodium chloride (NaCl) in the presence of an excess of either chlorine or sodium were transformed into compounds \"forbidden\" by classical chemistry, such as Na3Cl and NaCl3. Quantum mechanical calculations predict the possibility of other compounds, such as NaCl7, Na3Cl2 and Na2Cl. The materials are thermodynamically stable at high pressures. Such compounds may exist in natural environments that exist at high pressure, such as the deep ocean or inside planetary cores. The materials have potentially useful properties. For instance, Na3Cl is a two-dimensional metal, made of layers of pure sodium and salt that can conduct electricity. The salt layers act as insulators while the sodium layers act as conductors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Banks\nFeersum Endjinn is a science fiction novel by Scottish writer Iain M. Banks, first published in 1994. It won a British Science Fiction Association Award in 1994.\nThe novel is sometimes referred to as Banks' second science fiction novel not set within the Culture universe, the first being \"Against a Dark Background\".\nSetting.\nThe book is set on a far future Earth where the uploading of mindstates into a world-spanning computer network (known as \"Cryptosphere\", \"the Data Corpus\", or simply \"Crypt\") is commonplace, allowing the dead to be easily reincarnated, a set number of times, first physically and then virtually within the crypt. The crypt has become increasingly chaotic, causing much concern within society. Much of the story takes place within a giant, decaying megastructure known as the \"Fastness\" or \"Serehfa\" built to resemble a medieval castle, in which each \"room\" spans several kilometers horizontally and vertically, and King Adijine's palace occupies one room's chandelier. The structure used to be a space elevator, left behind by the ancestors of those who remained on Earth, with the circuitry of the crypt built into its structure. The world is in crisis as the Solar System is slowly drifting into an interstellar molecular cloud (\"the Encroachment\"), which will eventually dim and then destroy the Sun, ending life on Earth.\nPlot summary.\nThe narrative switches between four main characters. Count Alandre Sessine VII is a high-ranking member of the court who is assassinated, ending his last life. Reborn inside the crypt he comes under repeated attack and is almost permanently killed. On his last virtual life, he makes contact with a copy of himself who assists him. He spends many subjective years wandering the wider reaches of the crypt before being contacted by its representative who requests his aid in relation to the Encroachment.\nHortis Gadfium III, the Chief Scientist of the ruling class, is engaged in a conspiracy with like-minded nobles who believe that the elite are not acting in the best interests of the population, and who question the real motive of the ongoing war with the rival clan of Engineers. She learns of a message apparently sent from the fast tower, the highest and previously inaccessible part of the castle, which stresses the danger of the Encroachment and tells of an attempt by the crypt to activate a long-forgotten subsystem which may prevent disaster. The message also warns that this will be opposed by those in power as it will threaten their interests. She and her fellow conspirators are considering how to respond when the security forces attempt to arrest them, although Gadfium manages to escape into the depths of the castle.\nBascule the Teller is a young man who contacts the dead personalities within the crypt on behalf of their relatives or other interested parties. Whilst searching for a lost friend, he attracts the attention of the Security forces and takes refuge with various chimeric animals whose implants have taken on personalities from within the crypt. He is eventually tasked with ascending the central shaft of the highest tower in a vacuum balloon in order to reach its control room.\nAsura is a young woman who awakens in a re-incarnation facility with no memory. She is compelled to travel towards the castle, rapidly gathering knowledge about the world before being captured by the security forces. She is interrogated within the crypt, but is able to resist the questioning, becoming stronger at understanding and manipulating her virtual environments. As she escapes her virtual prison, she is physically freed by Gadfium, assisted by the copy of Count Sessine who guided her to Asura's location. Asura broadcasts to the world the truth regarding the Encroachment and the attempts of the monarchy to prevent the activation of the crypt sub-systems. She explains her origin, being an emissary of the crypt that was combined with the mind of Count Sessine who sacrificed himself in the process. She was created by the crypt because the relevant systems were kept separate by their designers to prevent infection by chaos. The so-called chaotic elements of the crypt are a burgeoning ecology of Artificial Intelligences. Asura states that both the humans and chaos will have to learn to live with each other.

Banks\nAgainst a Dark Background is a science fiction novel by Scottish writer Iain M. Banks, first published in 1993. It was his first science fiction novel not to feature, or be set in, the Culture.\nPlot summary.\nThe main protagonist is Lady Sharrow, a former military pilot and antiquities thief. She lives on Golter, a planet orbiting a star in an isolated planetary system with no nearby galaxies. A cult named the Huhsz is granted permission to assassinate her, believing that their messiah can not be born until the end of her family's female bloodline. She is forced to choose between going into hiding for a year or recovering the last Lazy Gun, an ancient weapon of mass destruction that was stolen from the cult by her ancestor.\nSharrow resolves to recover the Lazy Gun, rejecting an offer of help from her cousin Geis, a wealthy industrialist and businessman. In order to do this, she must first find the Universal Principles, a long lost book rumoured to contain a clue to the Gun's hiding place. She visits her half-sister Breyghun who is held prisoner in the Seahouse, a monastery run by the Sad Brothers. Breyghun tells her that their grandfather Gorko, a collector of rare artefacts, encoded information regarding the location of the Universal Principles into the DNA of his servants. Sharrow recruits the surviving members of her combat unit and sets out to make contact with the son of Gorko's butler. During these events, Sharrow is menaced by two unidentified bald-headed clones, who have the ability to inflict pain on her via a military virus embedded in her nervous system. They demand the Gun be turned over to them and not the Huhsz.\nSharrow and her team follow the trail left by Gorko and recover the Universal Principles. The book has long since turned to dust, but the case contains a quotation that is also inscribed on Gorko's tomb. Sharrow visits the storage facility where the tomb is kept and finds a device that provides them with co-ordinates deep in an embargoed zone. The team are joined by an android named Feril and set out to retrieve the Lazy Gun. After disembarking from the submarine they hired, they are attacked first by air and ground troops. During these encounters, her team are killed one by one and Sharrow is wounded. Sharrow and Feril reach a small tower which contains both the Gun and numerous other pieces of ancient technology. After leaving the tower, Sharrow is immobilised by a neural weapon and the clones appear, confiscate the Gun and take them both prisoner.\nThey are conveyed to a desert stronghold and are presented to a man named Molgarin, who claims to be immortal. The fortress is attacked, by both the Huhsz and another unidentified set of troops. In the chaos, Sharrow kills the clones and escapes using a monowheeled tank that was found along with the Lazy Gun. She realizes that the first force contained members of the Sad Brothers and she and Feril head for the Seahouse, taking the Lazy Gun with them. They arrive and discover that her cousin Geis has been behind events, acting out of an unrequited love for Sharrow and a desire to engineer political change within the system. Molgarin was an actor employed to try and make Sharrow feel gratitude towards Geis. After they are taken captive Sharrow and Feril cause the Lazy Gun to begin firing uncontrollably and the Seahouse is destroyed, with Feril still inside it. In the confusion, Sharrow kills first her half-sister Breyghun and then Geis, before leaving in the tank, self-identifying with the Lazy Gun and the destruction that it brings to everything it encounters.\nLazy Guns.\nThe eight Lazy Guns were mysterious ancient objects, discovered together a long time before the events of the book. A Lazy Gun is roughly half a metre long, 30\u00a0cm wide and 20\u00a0cm tall. The Lazy Gun is \"light but massy\", and weighs three times as much when turned upside down. The Lazy Gun is the only weapon known to display a sense of humour. When fired, some calamity or cataclysm will befall the target on whatever scale is necessary to assure its destruction. The effect is random and in no way limited by its own implausibility, ranging from (for example) an inexplicable wild animal attack in the case of humans to a spontaneous cometary impact in the case of a city.\nIn addition to being susceptible to ordinary damage, tampering with the Guns usually results in a mundane but profoundly powerful explosion that destroys the gun and everything in the vicinity. Only one of the original eight guns survives. The seventh, also found by the Lady Sharrow before the events of the book, was destroyed by the university it was sold to when they tampered with it. The resulting explosion devastated the city the university was located in. Sharrow still carries the guilt of this catastrophe.\nHistory.\n\"Against a Dark Background\" was rewritten from an original work of 1975. Banks said that it was the last of his old material that he had to rewrite.\nBanks wrote an epilogue to the book that did not appear with the published text, but is available separately online.\nBibliography.\n\"Against a Dark Background\", Iain M.

The infections caused three confirmed deaths, with unconfirmed estimates of as many as 50. She was the first person in the United States identified as an asymptomatic carrier of the pathogenic bacterium \"Salmonella typhi\". She was forcibly quarantined twice by authorities, the second time for the remainder of her life because she persisted in working as a cook and thereby exposed others to the disease. Mallon died after a total of nearly 30 years quarantined. Her popular nickname has since become a term for persons who spread disease or other misfortune.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nMary Mallon was born in 1869 in Cookstown, County Tyrone, Ireland. She may have been born with typhoid fever as her mother was infected during pregnancy. In 1884 at the age of 15, she emigrated from Ireland to the United States. She lived with her aunt and uncle for a time and worked as a maid but eventually became a cook for affluent families.\nCareer.\nFrom 1900 to 1907, Mallon worked as a cook in the New York City area for eight families, seven of whom contracted typhoid. In 1900, she worked in Mamaroneck, New York, where within two weeks of her employment, residents developed typhoid fever. In 1901, she relocated to Manhattan, where members of the family for whom she worked developed fevers and diarrhea. Mallon then went to work for a lawyer and left after seven of the eight people in that household became ill.\nIn June 1904, she was hired by a prosperous lawyer, Henry Gilsey. Soon four of the seven servants were ill. No Gilsey family members were infected because they resided separately, and the servants lived in their own house. Immediately after the outbreak began, Mallon left and relocated to Tuxedo Park, where she was hired by George Kessler. Two weeks later, the laundry worker in his household was infected and taken to St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center, where her case of typhoid was the first in a long time. The investigator Dr. R. L. Wilson concluded that the laundry worker had caused the outbreak, but he failed to prove it. The laundry worker died soon afterward.\nIn August 1906, Mallon began a job in Oyster Bay on Long Island with the family of a wealthy New York banker, Charles Elliot Warren. Mallon went along with the Warrens when they rented a house in Oyster Bay for the summer of 1906. From August 27 to September 3, six of the 11 people in the family contracted typhoid fever. According to three medical doctors, the disease at that time was \"unusual\" in Oyster Bay. The landlord, understanding that it would be difficult to rent a house with the reputation of having typhoid, hired several independent experts to find the source of the infection. They took water samples from pipes, faucets, toilets, and the cesspool, all of which were negative for typhoid.\nInvestigation.\nGeorge Soper, an investigator hired by the Oyster Bay property owner after the outbreak there, had been trying to determine the cause of typhoid outbreaks in affluent families, when it was known that the disease typically occurred in unsanitary conditions. He discovered that a female Irish cook, who fit the physical description he had been given, was involved in all of the outbreaks. He was unable to locate her because she generally left after an outbreak began, without giving a forwarding address. The Park Avenue outbreak helped to identify Mallon as the source of the infections. Soper learned of the case while it was still active and discovered Mallon was the cook.\nSoper first met Mallon in the kitchen of the Bownes' Park Avenue penthouse and accused her of spreading the disease. Though Soper himself recollected his behavior \"as diplomatic as possible\", he infuriated Mallon and she threatened him with a carving fork. When Mallon refused to give samples, Soper decided to compile a five-year history of her employment. He found that, of the eight families that had hired Mallon as a cook, members of seven claimed to have contracted typhoid fever. Then Soper learned where Mallon's boyfriend lived and arranged a new meeting there. He took Raymond Hoobler to persuade Mary to give them urine and stool samples for analysis. Mallon again refused to cooperate, claiming that typhoid was everywhere and that the outbreaks had happened because of contaminated food and water. At that time, the concept of healthy carriers was unknown even to healthcare workers.\nSoper published his findings on June 15, 1907, in the \" Journal of the American Medical Association\". He wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was found that the family changed cooks on August 4. This was about three weeks before the typhoid epidemic broke out. The new cook, Mallon, remained in the family only a short time and left about three weeks after the outbreak occurred. Mallon was described as an Irish woman about 40 years of age, tall, heavy, single. She seemed to be in perfect health.\nFirst quarantine (1907\u20131910).\nSoper notified the New York City Health Department, whose investigators realized that Mallon was a typhoid carrier. By sections 1169 and 1170 of the Greater New York Charter, Mallon was arrested as a public health threat. She was forced into an ambulance by five policemen and Dr. Sara Josephine Baker, who at some time had to sit on Mallon to restrain her. Mallon was transported to the Willard Parker Hospital, where she was restrained and forced to give samples. For four days, she was not allowed to get up and use the bathroom on her own. The massive numbers of typhoid bacteria that were discovered in her stool samples indicated that the infection source was in her gallbladder. During questioning, Mallon admitted that she almost never washed her hands. This was not unusual at the time; the germ theory of disease put forth by obstetrician Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis in the 1860s and surgeon Dr. Joseph Lister in the 1880s was still not fully accepted by the general public, especially by the undereducated.\nOn March 19, 1907, Mallon was sentenced to quarantine on North Brother Island. While quarantined she gave stool and urine samples three times per week. Authorities suggested removing her gallbladder, but she refused because she claimed she did not believe she carried the disease. At the time, gallbladder removal was dangerous, and people had died from the procedure. Mallon was also unwilling to stop working as a cook, a job that earned more money for her than any other. Having no home of her own, she was always on the verge of poverty.\nAfter the publication of Soper's article in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\", Mallon attracted extensive media attention and received the nickname \"Typhoid Mary\". Later, in a textbook that defined typhoid fever, she again was termed \"Typhoid Mary\".\nSoper visited Mallon in quarantine, telling her he would write a book and give her part of the royalties. She angrily rejected his proposal and locked herself in the bathroom until he left. She hated the nickname and wrote in a letter to her lawyer:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNot all medical experts endorsed the decision to forcibly quarantine Mallon. For example, Milton J. Rosenau and Charles V. Chapin both argued that she just had to be taught to carefully treat her condition and ensure that she would not transmit the typhoid to others. Both considered isolation to be an unnecessary, overly strict punishment. Mallon suffered from a nervous breakdown after her arrest and forcible transportation to the hospital. In 1909 she tried to sue the New York Health Department, but her complaint was denied and the case dismissed by the New York Supreme Court. In a letter to her lawyer she complained that she was treated like a \"guinea pig\". She was obliged to give samples for analysis three times a week, but for six months was not allowed to visit an eye doctor, even though her eyelid was paralyzed and she had to bandage it at night. Her medical treatment was hectic: she was given urotropin in three-month courses for a year, threatening to destroy her kidneys. That was changed to brewer's yeast and urotropin in increasing doses. She was first told that she had typhoid in her intestinal tract, then in her bowel muscles, then in her gallbladder.\nMallon herself claimed never to believe that she was a carrier. With the help of a friend, she sent several samples to an independent New York laboratory. All came back negative for typhoid. On North Brother Island, almost a quarter of her analyses from March 1907 through June 1909 were also negative. After 2 years and 11 months of Mallon's quarantine, Eugene H. Porter, the New York State Commissioner of Health, decided that disease carriers should no longer be quarantined and that Mallon could be freed if she agreed to stop working as a cook and take reasonable efforts to avoid transmitting typhoid to others. On February 19, 1910, Mallon said she was \"prepared to change her occupation (that of a cook), and would give assurance by affidavit that she would upon her release take such hygienic precautions as would protect those with whom she came in contact, from infection.\" She was released from quarantine and returned to the mainland.\nRelease and second quarantine (1915\u20131938).\nUpon her release, Mallon was given a job as a laundry worker, which paid less than cooking\u2014$20 per month instead of $50. After a time she wounded her arm and the wound became infected, meaning that she could not work at all for six months. After several unsuccessful years, she started cooking again. She used fake surnames like Breshof or Brown, and accepted jobs as a cook against the explicit instructions of health authorities. No agencies that hired servants for affluent families would offer her employment, so for the next five years, she worked in a number of kitchens in restaurants, hotels, and spa facilities. Almost everywhere she worked, there were outbreaks of typhoid. However, she changed jobs frequently, and Soper was unable to find her.\nIn 1915, Mallon started working at Sloane Hospital for Women in New York City. Soon 25 people were infected, and two died. The chief obstetrician, Edward B. Cragin, called Soper and asked him to help in the investigation. Soper identified Mallon from the servants' verbal descriptions and also by her handwriting.\nMallon fled again, but the police were able to find and arrest her when she took food to a friend on Long Island. Mallon was returned to quarantine on North Brother Island on March 27, 1915.\nLittle is known about her life during the second quarantine. She remained on North Brother for more than 23 years, and the authorities gave her a private one-story cottage. As of 1918, she was allowed to take day trips to the mainland. In 1925, the physician Alexandra Plavska came to the island for an internship. She organized a laboratory on the second floor of the chapel and offered Mallon a job as a technician. Mallon washed bottles, did recordings, and prepared glasses for pathologists.\nMedia reception.\nAfter Mallon was sent into her initial quarantine, the newspapers changed their opinion of her case. The articles at first mentioned how Josephine Baker claimed Mallon attacked her and the other doctors with forks, and came at them fighting and swearing. Later the press articles shifted the blame away from being her fault, the claim being that she was unaware she was carrying anything and instead germs that she had no control over were to blame. Despite this shift, she was still popularly understood to have believed that she was contagious. The newspapers also claimed that Mallon was prohibited from using the telephone to contact anybody except the surgeons treating her and her guard. Stories that once celebrated the public health department and legal system eventually became sympathetic to Mallon and the events she supposedly encountered. Public health officials claimed the opposite, that she was treated to their best ability but in return refused to comply with the requests of the health officials.\nDeath.\nMallon spent the rest of her life in quarantine at Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island. She was quite active until 1932, when she suffered a stroke; afterwards, she was confined to the hospital. She never completely recovered, and half of her body remained paralyzed. On November 11, 1938, she died of pneumonia at age 69. Mallon's body was cremated, and her ashes were buried in Section 15, Row 19, Grave 55 (S15-R19-G55) at Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx. Nine people attended the funeral.\nSome sources claim that an autopsy found evidence of live typhoid bacteria in Mallon's gallbladder. Soper wrote, however, that there was no autopsy, a claim cited by other researchers to assert a conspiracy to calm public opinion after her death.\nLegacy.\nAftermath.\nMallon's case became the first in which an asymptomatic carrier was discovered and isolated forcibly. The ethical and legal issues raised by her case are still discussed. Research has resulted in an estimate that Mallon had contaminated \"at least one hundred and twenty two people, including five dead\". Other sources attribute at least three deaths to contact with Mallon, but because of health officials' inability to persuade her to cooperate, the exact number is not known. Some have estimated that contact with her may have caused 50 fatalities.\nIn a 2013 article in the \"Annals of Gastroenterology\", the authors concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTwo scholarly sources combined to provide this conclusion:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This case highlighted the problematic nature of the subject and the need for an enhanced medical and legal-social treatment model aimed at improving the status of disease carriers and limiting their impact on society.\nOther healthy typhoid carriers identified in the first quarter of the 20th century include Tony Labella, an Italian immigrant, presumed to have caused more than 100 cases (with five deaths); an Adirondack guide dubbed \"Typhoid John\", presumed to have infected 36 people (with two deaths); and Alphonse Cotils, a restaurateur and bakery owner.\nThe health technology of the era did not have a completely effective solution: there were not any antibiotics to fight the infection, and gallbladder removal was a dangerous, sometimes fatal operation. Some modern specialists claim that typhoid bacteria can become integrated in macrophages and then reside in intestinal lymph nodes or the spleen.\nEthics.\nThe ethical question of her arrest and forced quarantine is still being debated. Historians frequently discuss the argument of Mallon knowing that she was infecting her clients with typhoid based on the frequency of the disease being present after her departure. They also cite the argument that antibiotics did not exist at this time and ten percent of those affected by Mallon carrying the infection died. By this argument Mallon could be considered a murderer of those ten percent of people if she knew she was a carrier of the disease, and would be a justification for her arrest.\nOthers argue that Mallon did not know that she had the bacteria and therefore did not deserve to be arrested when she never committed a crime. At the time, asymptomatic carriers were not understood and Mallon was believed to have said that she did not feel sick, look sick, or have any sort of visible sickness. Although Mallon did not feel ill or look sick, the disease was living dormant in what was assumed to be her gallbladder.\nLessons learned.\nMallon was the first person found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the typhoid bacterium, and this caused the health officials to have little to no idea of how to deal with her. However, Mallon's case helped these officials identify other people who carried diseases that were dormant in their bodies based on the information they learned from Mallon's case. Mallon's case created controversy concerning personal autonomy and social responsibility. It also was the first case that provided good evidence of the existence of asymptomatic carriers.\nThe phrase \"Typhoid Mary\" is now a colloquial term for anyone who spreads disease or something else undesirable.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the 19th century the Scandinavian \"nisse\" became increasingly associated with the Christmas season and Christmas gift giving, its pictorial depiction strongly influenced by American Santa Claus in some opinion, evolving into the .\nThe nisse is one of the most familiar creatures of Scandinavian folklore, and he has appeared in many works of Scandinavian literature.\nThe \"nisse\" is frequently introduced to English readership as an \"elf\" or \"gnome\"; the Christmas \"nisse\" often bears resemblance to the garden gnome.\nNomenclature.\nThe word \"nisse\" (plural \"nisser\") is a pan-Scandinavian term. Its modern usage in Norway into the 19th century is evidenced in Asbj\u00f8rnsen's collection. The Norwegian is also equated to \"nisse\" or \"tomte\". In Danish the form (\"house nisse\") also occurs.\nOther synonyms include the Swedish names and (cf. ). The names and (\"tomte farmer\") have occurred in Sweden and parts of Norway close to Sweden. The Finnish tonttu is borrowed from Swedish (cf. ), but the Finnish spirit has gained a distinct identity and is no longer synonymous. There is also the (lit. \"house lot man\") but this is a literary Christmas elf.\nThere are also localized appellations, in and in Gudbrandsdalen and Nordland regions of Norway (cf. ).\nOther variants include the Swedish names and ; also in Sweden (and Norwegian regions proximate to Sweden) and (\"tomte farmer\"), (cf. ) and (. \"mound man\", etc.).\nEnglish translations.\nThe term \"nisse\" in the native Norwegian is retained in Pat Shaw Iversen's English translation (1960), appended with the parenthetical remark that it is a household spirit. \nVarious English language publications also introduce the \"nisse\" as an \"elf\" or \"gnome\".\nIn the past, H. L. Braekstad (1881) chose to substitute \"nisse\" with \"brownie\". Brynildsen's dictionary (1927) glossed \"nisse\" as 'goblin' or 'hobgoblin'.\nIn the English editions of the Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales the Danish word has been translated as 'goblin', for example, in the tale \"The Goblin at the Grocer's\".\nDialects.\nForms such as have been seen as dialect. Aasen noted the variant form to be prevalent in the Nordland and Trondheim areas of Norway, and the tale \"Tuftefolket p\u00e5 Sandflesa\" published by Asbj\u00f8rnsen is localized in Tr\u00e6na Municipality in Nordland. Another synonym is tunkall (\"yard fellow\") also found in the north and west. \nThus ostensibly prevails in eastern Norway (and adjoining Sweden),\nalthough there are caveats attached to such over-generalizations by linguist Oddrun Gr\u00f8nvik. It might also be conceded that is more a Swedish term than Norwegian. In Scania, Halland and Blekinge within Sweden, the \"tomte\" or \"nisse\" is also known as (i.e 'good nisse').\nReidar Thoralf Christiansen remarked that the \"belief in the is confined to the south and east\" of Norway, and theorized the \"nisse\" was introduced to Norway (from Denmark) in the 17th century, but there is already mention of \"Nisse pugen\" in a Norwegian legal tract c. 1600 or earlier, and Emil Birkeli (1938) believed the introduction to be as early as 13 to 14c. The \"Norsk Allkunnebok\" encyclopedia states less precisely that \"nisse\" was introduced from Denmark relatively late, whereas native names found in Norway such as \"tomte\", , \"tufte\", \"tuftekall\", , etc., date much earlier.\nEtymology.\nIt has repeatedly been conjectured that \"nisse\" might be a variant of \"nixie\" or but detractors including Jacob Grimm note that a nixie is a water sprite and its proper Dano-Norwegian cognate would be \"n\u00f8kk\", not \"nisse\". \nAccording to Grimm \"nisse\" was a form of Niels (or German: ), like various house sprites that adopted human given names, and was therefore cognate to St. Nicholas, and related to the Christmas gift-giver. Indeed, the common explanation in Denmark is that \"nisse\" is the diminutive form of Niels, as Danes in 19th century used to refer to a \"nisse\" as \"\" or (, literally \"yard/farmstead dweller\" is also name for a sprite).\nAn alternate etymology derives \"nisse\" from Old Norse , meaning \"dear little relative\".\nThe (\"homestead man\"), (\"farm guardian\"), and (\"yard fellow\") bear names that associated them with the farmstead. The Finnish is also borrowed from Swedish \"tomte\", but \"later tradition no longer consider these identical\".\nAdditional synonyms.\nFaye also gives Dano-Norwegian forms or . These are echoed by the Swedish , Norwegian Nynorsk .\nNorwegian (cf. ) is a synonym for \"nisse\", or has become conflated with it. Likewise is a synonym. Also the (\"farmyard-dweller\"), \nOther synonyms are Norwegian (\"good farmer\"), Danish (\"good lad\"). Also Danish (\"farm buck\") and (\"housebuck\") where buck could mean billygoat or ram.\nRegionally in Uppland Sweden is (\"yard-spirit\"), which being a \"r\u00e5\" often takes on a female form, which might relate to Western Norwegian (gardvord).\nIn the confines of Klepsland in Evje, Setesdal, Norway they spoke of (\"barn gnome\").\nNear synonyms.\nSome commentators have equated or closely connected the \"tomte/nisse\" to the (&lt; \"mound dweller\"). However there is caution expressed by linguist Oddrun Gr\u00f8nvik against completely equating the \"tomte/nissse\" with the mound dwellers of lore, called the or (from the Old Norse 'mound'), although the latter has become indistinguishable with ', as evident from the form '.\nThe \"haugbonde\" is said to be the ghost of the first inhabitant of the farmstead, he who cleared the (house lot), who subsequently becomes its guardian. This \"haugbonde\" has also connected with the Danish/Norwegian (modern spelling: , \"farm tree\") or in Swedish (\"ward tree\") cult (Cf. ).\nAnother near synonym is the , where \"dukke\" denotes a \"dragger\" or \"drawer, puller\" (of luck or goods delivered to the beneficiary human), which is distinguishable from a \"nisse\" since it is considered not to haunt a specific household.\nOrigin theories.\nThe story of propitiating a household deity for boons in Iceland occurs in the \"Story of \u00deorvaldr Ko\u00f0r\u00e1nsson the Far-Travelled\" () and the \"Kristni saga\" where the 10th century figure attended to his father Ko\u00f0r\u00e1n giving up worship of the heathen idol (called or 'year-man' in the saga: or 'prophet' in the \"\u00de\u00e1ttr\") embodied in stone; this has been suggested as a precursor to the \"nisse\" in the monograph study by Henning Frederik Feilberg, though there are different opinions on what label or category should be applied to this spirit (e.g., alternatively as Old Norse \"landv\u00e6ttr\" \"land spirit\").\nFeilberg argued that in Christianized medieval Denmark the \"puge\" (cog. Old Norse , German \"puk\" cf. \"Nis Puk\"; English puck) was the common name for the ancient pagan deities, regarded as devils or fallen angels. Whereas Feilberg here only drew a vague parallel between \"puge\" and \"nisse\" as nocturnally active, this \"puge\" or \"puk\" in medieval writings may be counted as the oldest documentation of \"nisse\", by another name, according to Henning Eichberg. But Claude Lecouteux handles \"puk\" or \"puge\" as distinct from \"niss\"[\"e\"].\nFeilberg made the fine point of distinction that \"tomte\" actually meant a planned building site (where as \"tun\" was the plot with a house already built on it), so that the Swedish \"tomtegubbe\", Norwegian \"tuftekall\", , etc. originally denoted the (\"earth wights\"). The thrust of Feilberg's argument considering the origins of the \"nisse\" was a combination of a nature spirit and an ancestral ghost (of the pioneer who cleared the land) guarding the family or particular plot. The nature spirits\u2015i.e., \"tomtev\u00e6tte\" (\"site wights\"), (\"howe/mound dwellers\"), \"underground wights\" (), or dwarves, or \"v\u00e6tte\" of the forests\u2015originally freely moved around Nature, occasionally staying for short or long periods at people's homes, and these transitioned into house-wights () that took up permanent residence at homes. In one tale, the sprite is called \"nisse\" but is encountered but by a tree stump (not in the house like a \"bona fide\" \"nisse\"), and this is given as an example of the folk-belief at its transitional stage. But there is also the aspect of the ghost of the pioneer who first cleared the land, generally abiding in the woods or heaths he cleared, or seeking a place at the family hearth, eventually thought to outright dwelling in the home, taking interest in the welfare of the homestead, its crops, and the family members.\nThere are two 14th century Old Swedish attestations to the \"the gods of the building site\". In the \"Sj\u00e4linna thr\u00f6st\" (\"Comfort of the Soul\"), a woman sets the table after her meal for the deities, and if the offering is consumed, she is certain her livestock will be taken care of. In the \"Revelations\" of Saint Birgitta (\"Birgittas uppenbarelser\"), it is recorded that the priests forbade their congregation from providing offerings to the or \"tomte gods\", apparently perceiving this to be competition to their entitlement to the tithe (, book VI, ch. 78). There is not enough here to precisely narrow down the nature of the deity, whether it was land spirit () or a household spirit ().\nSeveral helper-demons were illustrated in the Swedish writer Olaus Magnus's 1555 work, including the center figure of a spiritual being laboring at a stable by night (cf. fig. right). It reprints the same stable-worker picture found on the map \"Carta Marina\", B, k. The prose annotation to the map, \"Ain kurze Auslegung und Verklerung\" (1539) writes that these unnamed beings in the stables and mine-works were more prevalent in the pre-Christian period than the current time. The sector \"B\" of this map where the drawing occurs spanned Finnmark (under Norway) and West Lappland (under Sweden). While Olaus does not explicitly give the local vernacular (Scandinavian) names, the woodcuts probably represent the \"tomte\" or \"nisse\" according to modern commentators.\nLater folklore says that a \"tomte\" is the soul of a slave during heathen times, placed in charge of the maintenance of the household's farmland and fields while the master was away on viking raids, and was duty-bound to continue until doomsday.\nAppearance.\nThe Norwegian \"nisse\" was no bigger than a child, dressed in gray, wearing a red, pointy hat ( \n \"\"; a \"hue\" is a soft brimless hat) according to Faye.\nIn Denmark also, \"nisser\" are often seen as long-bearded, wearing gray and a red brimless cap (). But the \"nisse\" turned bearded is an alteration, and the traditional purist \"nisse\" is beardless as a child, according to the book by Axel Olrik and Hans Ellekilde.\nThe \"tomte\", according to Afzelius's description, was about the size of a one year-old child, but with an elderly wizened face, wearing a little red cap on his head and a gray wadmal (coarse woolen) jacket, short breeches, and ordinary shoes such as a peasant would wear.\nThe \"tonttu\" of Finland was said to be one-eyed, and likewise in Swedish-speaking areas of Finland, hence the stock phrase \"\" (one-eyed like the tomten).\nThe \"Tomte\"'s height is anywhere from to no taller than according to one Swedish-American source, whereas the \"tomte\" (pl. \"tomtarna\") were just 1 \"aln\" tall (an \"aln\" or Swedish ell being just shy of 60\u00a0cm or 2\u00a0ft), according to one local Swedish tradition.\nShapeshifter.\nThe \"nisse\" may be held to have the ability to transform into animals such as the buck-goat. horse, or a goose.\nIn one tale localized at Oxholm, the \"nisse\" (here called the \"gaardbuk\") falsely announces a cow birthing to the girl assigned to care for it, then tricks her by changing into the shape of a calf. She stuck him with a pitchfork which the sprite counted as three blows (per each prong), and avenged the girl by making her lie precarious on a plank on the barn's ridge while she was sleeping.\nOfferings.\nFor the various benefits the \"nisse\" provided for his host family (which will be elaborated below under ), the family was expected to reward the sprite usually with porridge (subsection below). Even in the mid-19th century, there were still Christian men who made offerings to the tomtar spirit on Christmas day. The offering (called or \"give them a reward\") used to be pieces of wadmal (coarse wool), tobacco, and a shovelful of dirt.\nPorridge-lover.\nOne is also expected to please \"nisse\" with gifts (cf. ) a traditional gift is a bowl of porridge on Christmas Eve. The \"nisse\" was easily angered over the porridge offering. It was not only a servant who ate up the porridge meant for the sprite that incurred its wrath, but the \"nisse\" was so fastidious that if it was not prepared or presented correctly using butter, he still got angry enough to retaliate. Cf. also .\nThe Norwegian household, in order to gain favor of the \"nisse\", sets out the Christmas Eve and Thursday evenings meal for it under a sort of catwalks (of the barn) The meal consisted of sweet porridge, cake, beer, etc. But the sprite was very picky about the taste. Some (later) authorities specified that it is the \"r\u00f8mmegr\u00f8t\" (var. , \"sour cream porridge\", using wheat flour and/or semolina) should be the treat to serve the Norwegian \"nisse\". While the rommegr\u00f8t still remained the traditional Christmas treat for Norwegian-Americans as of year 2000, Norwegian taste has shifted to preferring rice pudding () for Christmas, and has taken to serving it to the supposed \"julenisse\".\nThe \"nisse\" likes his porridge with a pat of butter on the top. In a tale that is often retold, a farmer put the butter \"underneath\" the porridge. When the \"nisse\" of his farmstead found that the butter was missing, he was filled with rage and killed the cow resting in the barn. But, as he thus became hungry, he went back to his porridge and ate it, and so found the butter at the bottom of the bowl. Full of grief, he then hurried to search the lands to find another farmer with an identical cow, and replaced the former with the latter.\nIn a Norwegian tale, a maid decided to eat the porridge herself, and ended up severely beaten by the \"nisse\". It sang the words: \"Since you have eaten up the porridge for the tomte (nisse), you shall with the tomte have to dance!\" The farmer found her nearly lifeless the morning after. In a Northern Danish variant, the girl behaves more appallingly, not only devouring the beer and porridge, but peeing in the mug and doing her business (i.e., defecating) in the bowl. The \"nisse\" leaves her lying on a slab above the well. The motif occurs in Swedish-speaking Finland with certain twists. In one version, the servant eats the \"tomte\"'s porridge and milk to bring his master to grief, who winds up having to sell the homestead when the sprite leaves.\nAnd in the legend from Nyland (Uusimaa) it decides the rivalry between neighbor the B\u00e4ckars and the Smeds, the boy from the first family regains the \"tomte\" lost to the other family by intercepting the offering of milk and porridge, eating it, and defiled it in \"shameful manner \". The \"tomte\" returning from the labor of carrying seven bales of rye exclaimed some words and reverted to the old family.\nIn Sweden, the Christmas porridge or gruel () was traditionally placed on the corner of the cottage-house, or the grain-barn (), the barn, or stable; and in Finland the porridge was also put out on the grain-kiln () or sauna. This gruel is preferably offered with butter or honey. This is basically the annual salary to the spirit who is being hired as \"the broom for the whole year\". If the household neglects the gift, the contract is broken, and the tomte may very well leave the farm or house.\nAccording to one anecdote, a peasant used to put out food on the stove for the \"tomtar\" or \"nissar\". When the priest inquired as to the fate of the food, the peasant replied that Satan collects it all in a kettle in hell, used to boil the souls for all eternity. The practice was halted. The bribe could also be bread, cheese, leftovers from the Christmas meal, or even clothing (cf. below). A piece of bread or cheese, placed under the turf, may suffice as the bribe to the \"tomtar/nissar\" (\"good nisse\") according to the folklore of Blekinge.\nIn Denmark, it is said that the \"nisse\" or \"nis puge\" (\"nis pug\") particularly favors sweet buckwheat porridge (), though in some telling it is just ordinary porridge or flour porridge that is requested.\nGift clothing.\nIn certain areas of Sweden and Finland, the Christmas gift consisted of a set of clothing, a pair of mittens or a pair of shoes at a minimum. In Uppland (Skokloster parish), the folk generously offered a fur coat and a red cap such as was suitable for winter attire.\nConversely, the commonplace motif where the \"House spirit leaves when gift of clothing is left for it\" might be exhibited: According to one Swedish tale, a certain Danish woman () noticed that her supply of meal she sifted seemed to last unusually long, although she kept consuming large amounts of it. But once when she happened to go to the shed, she spied through the keyhole or narrow crack in the door and saw the tomte in a shabby gray outfit sifting over the meal-tub (). So she made a new gray kirtle () for him and left it hanging on the tub. The tomte wore it and was delighted, but then sang a ditty proclaiming he will do no more sifting as it may dirty his new clothes. A similar tale about a \"nisse\" grinding grain at the mill is localized at the farmstead of Vaker in Ringerike, Norway. It is widespread and has been assigned Migratory Legend index ML 7015.\nAs helpers.\nAccording to tradition, the Norwegian and Danish \"nisse\" lives in the barns of the farmstead; in Denmark, it is said the spirit starts out living in the church at first, but can be coaxed into move to one's barn. A house-\"tomte\" dwelled in every home according to Swedish tradition, and it is emphasized the \"tomte\" is attached to the farmstead rather than the family. The \"tomte\" is regarded as dwelling under the floorboards of houses, stables, or barns.\nThe \"nisse\" will beneficially serve those he likes or those he regards as friend, doing farm-work or stable chores such as stealing hay from the neighbor (Norwegian) or stealing grain (Danish). The Norwegian \"tusse\" (i.e. \"nisse\") in a tale had stolen both fodder and food for its beneficiary. Similarly, the \"tomte\", if treated well, will protect the family and animals from evil and misfortune, and may also aid the chores and farm work. But it has a short temper, especially when offended, and can cause life to be miserable. Once insulted, the \"tomte\" will resort to mischief, braiding up the tails of cattle, etc. or even kill the cow.\nHarvesting.\nIn one anecdote, two Swedish neighboring farmers owned similar plots of land, the same quality of meadow and woodland, but one living in a red-colored, tarred house with well-kept walls and sturdy turf roof grew richer by the year, while the other living in a moss-covered house, whose bare walls rotted, and the roof leaked, grew poorer each year. Many would give opinion that the successful man had a tomte in his house. The tomte may be seen heaving just a single straw or ear of corn with great effort, but a man who scoffed at the modest gain lost his tomte and his fortune foundered; a poor novice farmer valued each ear tomte brought, and prospered. A \"tusse\" in a Norwegian tale also reverses all the goods (both fodder and food) he had carried from elsewhere after being laughed at for huffing and heaving just a ear of barley.\nAnimal husbandry.\nThe Norwegian \"nisse\" will gather hay, even stealing from neighbors to benefit the farmer he favors, often causing quarrels. He will also take the hay from the manger () of other horses to feed his favorite. One of his pranks played on the milkmaid is to hold down the hay so firmly the girl is not able to extract it, and abruptly let go so she falls flat on her back; the pleased \"nisse\" then explodes into laughter. Another prank is to set the cows loose. There is also a Danish tale of the \"nisse\" stealing fodder for the livestock.\nAs the protector of the farm and caretaker of livestock, the \"tomte\"'s retributions for bad practices range from small pranks like a hard strike to the ear to more severe punishment like killing of livestock.\nThe stable-hand needed to remain punctual and feed the horse (or cattle) both at 4 in the morning and 10 at night, or risk being thrashed by the \"tomte\" upon entering the stable. Belief has it that one could see which horse was the \"tomte\"'s favourite as it will be especially healthy and well taken care of. \nThe phenomenon of various \"elves\" (by various names) braiding \"elflocks\" on the manes of horses is widespread across Europe, but is also attributed to the Norwegian \"nisse\", where it is called the \"nisse-plaits\" () or \"tusse-plaits\" (), and taken as a good sign of the sprite's presence. Similar superstition regarding \"tomte\" (or \"nisse\") is known to have been held in the Swedish-American community, with the taboo that the braid must be unraveled with fingers and never cut with scissors.\nCarpentry.\nThe \"tomte\" is also closely associated with carpentry. It is said that when the carpenters have taken their break from their work for a meal, the \"tomte\" could be seen working on the house with their little axes. It was also customary in Swedish weddings to have not just the priest but also a carpenter present, and he will work on the newlyweds' abode. Everyone then listens for the noises that the \"tomtegubbe\" helping out with the construction, which is a sign that the new household has been blessed with its presence.\nWrath and retribution.\nThe \"nisse\"'s irritability and vindictiveness especially at being insulted has already been discussed. And its wrath cannot be taken lightly due to the \"nissen\"'s immense strength despite their size. They are also easily offended by carelessness, lack of proper respect, and lazy farmers.\nIf displeased, the \"nisse\" may resort to mischiefs such as overturning buckets of milk, causing cream to sour, or causing the harness straps on horses to break.\nIf he is angered, he may leave the home, and take the good luck and fortune of the family with him, or be more vindictive, even as to kill someone.\nObservance of traditions is thought to be important to the nisse, as they do not like changes in the way things are done at their farms. They are also easily offended by rudeness; farm workers swearing, urinating in the barns, or not treating the creatures well can frequently lead to a sound thrashing by the tomte/nisse. If anyone spills something on the floor in the nisse's house, it is considered proper to shout a warning to the tomte below.\nExorcism.\nAlthough the \"tomte\" (def. pl. ) were generally regarded as benevolent (compared to the \"r\u00e5\" or troll), some of the tales show church influence in likening the \"tomte\" to devils. Consequently, the stories about their expulsions are recounted as \"exorcisms\".\nParallels.\nAny of the various household spirits across the world can be brought to comparison as a comparison to the \"nisse\" (cf. ). In English folklore, there are several beings similar to the \"nisse\", such as the Scots and English \"brownie\", Robin Goodfellow, and Northumbrian hob. These plus the Scottish redcap, Irish clurichaun, various German household spirits such as \"H\u00f6deken\" (\"H\u00fctchen\"), \"Napfhans\", Puk (cog. English puck), and so on and so forth are grouped together with the Scandinavian \"nisse\" or \"nisse-god-dreng\" (\"good-lad\") in similar lists compiled by T. Crofton Croker (1828) and William John Thoms (1828). Both name Spain's \"\", the latter claiming an exact match with the \"Tomte Gubbe\", explaining \"duende\" to be a contraction of \"\" meaning \"master of the house\" in Spanish (The \"duende\" lore has reached Latin America. cf. ).\nAs for subtypes, the nisse could also take a ship for his home, and be called , equivalent to German \"klabautermann\", and Swedish . Also related is the Nis Puk, which is widespread in the area of Southern Jutland/Schleswig, in the Danish-German border area.\nIn Finland, the sauna has a \"saunatonttu\". \nModern Julenisse.\nThe household nisse/tomte later evolved into the Christmas of Sweden and \"Julenisse\" of Denmark/Norway (, ). Likewise in Finland, where the of Christmas-tide developed rather late, based on the \"tonttu\" which had been introduced much earlier from Scandinavian (Swedish etc.) myth, and already attested in Finland in the writings of Mikael Agricola (16 cent.).\nWhile the original \"household spirit\" was no \"guest\" and rather a house-haunter, the modern itinerant \"jultomte\" was a reinvention of the spirit as an annual visitor bearing gifts. He has also been transformed from a diminutive creature into an adult-size being. In Denmark, it was during the 1840s the farm's became , the multiple-numbered bearers of Yuletide presents, through the artistic depictions of Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich (1840), Johan Thomas Lundbye (1845), and H. C. Ley (1849). Lundbye was one artist who frequently inserted his own cameo portraiture into his depictions of the \"nisse\" over the years (cf. fig. above).\nThe image shift in Sweden (to the white-bearded and red-capped) is generally credited to illustrator Jenny Nystr\u00f6m's 1881 depiction of the \"tomte\" accompanying Viktor Rydberg's poem \"Tomten\", first published in the magazine She crafted the (facial) appearance of her tomte using her own father as her model, though she also extracted features from elderly Lappish men.\nCarl Wilhelm von Sydow (1935?) charged that the make-over of the tomte came about through a misconception or confusion with English Christmas cards featuring a red-capped and bearded Santa Claus (Father Christmas) wearing a fur coat. Nystr\u00f6m squarely denied her depiction of the tomte had introduced adulterated foreign material, but she or others could have emulated Danish precursors like the aforementioned Hans Christian Ley in the 1850s, and it is said she did construct her image based on Swedish and Danish illustrations.\nHerman Hofberg's anthology of Swedish folklore (1882), illustrated by Nystr\u00f6m and other artists, writes in the text that the \"tomte\" wears a \"pointy red hat\" (\"\"). Nystr\u00f6m in 1884 began illustrating the \"tomte\" handing out Christmas presents.\nGradually, the commercialized version has made the Norwegian look more and more like the \"roly-poly\" American Santa Claus, compared with the thin and gaunt traditional version which has not entirely disappeared. The Danish impersonated by the fake-bearded father of the family wearing gray (glossed as a cardigan (sweater) or peasant's frock), red hat, black belt, and wooden shoes full of straw was relatively a new affair as of the early 20th century, and deviates from the traditional \"nisse\" in many ways, for instance, the \"nisse\" of old lore is beardless like a youth or child.\nJulebock.\nAlso in Sweden, the forerunner Christmas gift-giver was the mythical Yule goat (, cf. Julebukking) starting around the early 19th century, before the advent of the . The \"julbock\" was either a prop (straw figure) or a person dressed as goat, equipped with horns, beard, etc. The modern version of \"juletomte\" is a mixture of the traditional \"tomte\" combined with this Yule goat and Santa Claus.\nIn later celebrations of Christmas (cf. ), the julbock no longer took on the role as thus described, but as a sumpter beast, or rather, the animal or animals drawing the gift-loaded sleigh of the \"jultomte\". Meanwhile some commentators have tried to link this Christmas goat with the pair of goats hitched to the god \u00de\u00f3rr's chariot, which flies over the sky. \nAs for other animals, period Christmas cards also depict the \"julenisse\" in the company of a cat () The \"juletomte\" of the Christmas card artist's imagination, is often paired with a horse or cat, or riding on a goat or in a sled pulled by a goat. The \"jultomte\" is also commonly depicted with a pig on Christmas cards.\nPresent-day.\nIn the modern conception, the \"jultomte\", \"Julenisse\" or Santa Claus, enacted by the father or uncle, etc., in disguise, will show up and deliver as Christmas gift-bringer. In Finland too, the Suomi version of Father Christmas will show up at the door bringing gifts to the children. After dinner, the children await the \"Jultomten\" or \"Julenisse\" to arrive (on a julbok-drawn sleigh), then ask them \"Are there any good children here?\" before passing out his gifts.\nThere are still a number of differences from the American Santa Claus myth. The Scandinavian Christmas \"nisse\" does not live at the North Pole, but perhaps in a forest nearby; the Danish lives on Greenland, and the Finnish (in Finland he is still called the \"Yule Goat\", although his animal features have disappeared) lives in Lapland; he does not come down the chimney at night, but through the front door, delivering the presents directly to the children, just like the Yule Goat did.\nModern adaptations.\nIn Hans Christian Andersen's collection of fairy tales, the \"nisse\" appears in \"The Goblin at the Grocer's\" as aforementioned, as well as \"The Goblin and the Woman\" () and \"Ole Luk\u00f8je\"; the church \"nisse\" also appears in his short fantasy \"The Travelling Companion\". \nAn angry tomte is featured in the popular children's book by Swedish author , (\"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils\"). The \"tomte\" turns the naughty boy Nils into a \"tomte\" at the beginning of the book, and Nils then travels across Sweden on the back of a goose.\nA \"tomte\" stars in one of author Jan Brett's children's stories, \"Hedgie's Surprise\". When adapting the mainly English-language concept of having helpers (sometimes in a workshop), can also correspond to the Christmas elf, either replacing it completely, or simply lending its name to the elf-like depictions in the case of translations.\nNisser/tomte often appear in Christmas calendar TV series and other modern fiction. In some versions the tomte are portrayed as very small; in others they are human-sized. The nisse usually exist hidden from humans and are often able to use magic.\nThe 2018 animated series Hilda, as well as the graphic novel series it is based on, features nisse as a species. One nisse named Tontu is a recurring character, portrayed as a small, hairy humanoid who lives unseen in the main character's home.\nGarden gnome.\nThe appearance traditionally ascribed to a nisse or tomte resembles that of the garden gnome figurine for outdoors, which are in turn, also called in Swedish, in Danish, in Norwegian and in Finnish.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of Joseph Stalin's closest allies and one of the most prominent figures in the Soviet government during his rule. In addition to serving as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars from 1930 to 1941, he held office as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1939 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1956.\nAn Old Bolshevik, Molotov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906 and was arrested and internally exiled twice before the October Revolution of 1917. He briefly headed the party's Secretariat before supporting Stalin's rise to power in the 1920s, becoming one of his closest associates. Molotov was made a full member of the Politburo in 1926 and became premier in 1930, overseeing Stalin's agricultural collectivization (and resulting famine) and his Great Purge. Following his appointment as Foreign Minister in 1939, he signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact which led to the Soviet Union's joint occupation of Poland alongside Nazi Germany and its ensuing annexation of the Baltic states. During World War II, he became deputy chairman of the State Defense Committee as well as Stalin's main negotiator with the Allies. Upon the war's end in 1945, he began to lose favour, losing his ministership in 1948 before being criticized by Stalin at the 19th Party Congress in 1952.\nMolotov was reappointed foreign minister after Stalin's death in 1953. However, his staunch opposition to leader Nikita Khrushchev's de-Stalinization policy led him to join a failed coup against Khrushchev in 1957. Subsequently, he was dismissed from all his offices and sent to Mongolia as an ambassador. By 1961, he was expelled from the party altogether. He continued to defend Stalin's legacy until his own death in 1986.\nEarly life and career.\nMolotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin in the village of Kukarka, Yaransk Uyezd, Vyatka Governorate (now Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast), the son of a merchant. Contrary to a commonly-repeated error, he was not related to the composer Alexander Scriabin.\nThroughout his teenager years, he was described as \"shy\" and \"quiet\" and always assisted his father with his business. He was educated at a secondary school in Kazan, where he became friends with fellow revolutionary Aleksandr Arosev. Molotov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1906, and soon gravitated toward the organisation's radical Bolshevik faction, which was led by Vladimir Lenin.\nSkryabin took the pseudonym \"Molotov\", derived from the Russian word \"molot\" (sledge hammer) since he believed that the name had an \"industrial\" and \"proletarian\" ring to it. He was arrested in 1909 and spent two years in exile in Vologda.\nIn 1911, he enrolled at St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute. Molotov joined the editorial staff of a new underground Bolshevik newspaper, \"Pravda\", and met Joseph Stalin for the first time in association with the project. That first association between the two future Soviet leaders proved to be brief, however, and failed to lead to an immediate close political association.\nMolotov worked as a so-called \"professional revolutionary\" for the next several years, wrote for the party press, and attempted to improve the organisation of the underground party. He moved from St. Petersburg to Moscow in 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War. It was in Moscow the following year that Molotov was again arrested for his party activity and was this time deported to Irkutsk, in eastern Siberia. In 1916, he escaped from his Siberian exile and returned to the capital city, which had been renamed Petrograd by the Tsarist regime \u2013 it being thought that the old name sounded too German.\nMolotov became a member of the Bolshevik Party's committee in Petrograd in 1916. When the February Revolution occurred in 1917, he was one of the few Bolsheviks of any standing in the capital. Under his direction, \"Pravda\" took to the \"left\" to oppose the Provisional Government formed after the revolution. When Joseph Stalin returned to the capital, he reversed Molotov's line, but when Lenin arrived, he overruled Stalin. However, Molotov became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of and a close adherent to Stalin, an alliance to which he owed his later prominence. Molotov became a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee, which planned the October Revolution and effectively brought the Bolsheviks to power.\nIn 1918, Molotov was sent to Ukraine to take part in the Russian Civil War, which had broken out. Since he was not a military man, he took no part in the fighting. In summer 1919, he was sent on a tour by steamboat of the Volga and Kama rivers, with Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya to spread Bolshevik propaganda. On his return, he was appointed chairman of the Nizhny Novgorod provincial executive, where the local party passed a vote of censure against him, for his alleged fondness for intrigue. He was transferred to Donetsk, and in November 1920, he became secretary to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party and married the Soviet politician Polina Zhemchuzhina.\nLenin recalled Molotov to Moscow in 1921, elevated him to full membership of the Central Committee and Orgburo, and put him in charge of the party secretariat. Molotov was voted in as a non-voting member of the Politburo in 1921 and held the office of Responsible Secretary. Alexander Barmine, a minor communist official, visited Molotov in his office near the Kremlin while he was running the secretariat, and remembered him as having \"a large and placid face, the face of an ordinary, uninspired, but rather soft and kindly bureaucrat, attentive and unassuming.\"\nMolotov was criticised by Lenin and Leon Trotsky, with Lenin noting his \"shameful bureaucratism\" and \"stupid behaviour\". On the advice of Molotov and Nikolai Bukharin, the Central Committee decided to reduce Lenin's work hours. In 1922, Stalin became General Secretary of the Bolshevik Party with Molotov as the \"de facto\" Second Secretary. As a young follower, Molotov admired Stalin but did not refrain from criticising him. Under Stalin's patronage, Molotov became a full member of the Politburo in January 1926.\nDuring the power struggles after Lenin's death in 1924, Molotov remained a loyal supporter of Stalin against his various rivals: first Leon Trotsky, later Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev, and finally Nikolai Bukharin. In January 1926, he led a special commission sent to Leningrad (St Petersburg) to end Zinoviev's control over the party machine in the province. In 1928, Molotov replaced Nikolai Uglanov as First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party and held that position until 15 August 1929.\nPersonality.\nTrotsky and his supporters underestimated Molotov, and the same went for many others. Trotsky called him \"mediocrity personified,\" and Molotov himself pedantically corrected comrades referring to him as \"Stone Arse\" by saying that Lenin had actually dubbed him \"Iron Arse.\" However, that outward dullness concealed a sharp mind and great administrative talent. He operated mainly behind the scenes and cultivated an image of a colourless bureaucrat.\nMolotov was reported to be a vegetarian and teetotaler by the American journalist John Gunther in 1938. However, Milovan Djilas claimed that Molotov \"drank more than Stalin\" and did not note his vegetarianism although they had attended several banquets.\nMolotov and his wife had two daughters: Sonia, adopted in 1929, and Svetlana, born in 1930.\nSoviet Premier.\nAddressing a Moscow communist party conference on 23 February 1929, Molotov emphasised the need to undertake \"the most rapid possible growth of industry\" both for economic reasons and because, he claimed, the Soviet Union was in permanent, imminent danger of attack. The argument over how fast to expand industry was behind the rift between Stalin and the right, led by Bukharin and Rykov, who feared that too rapid a pace would cause economic dislocation. With their defeat, Molotov emerged as the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union. During the Central Committee plenum of 19 December 1930, Molotov succeeded Alexey Rykov as the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, the equivalent of a Western head of government.\nIn that post, Molotov oversaw the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan for rapid industrialisation. Despite the great human cost, the Soviet Union under Molotov's nominal premiership made large strides in the adoption and the widespread implementation of agrarian and industrial technology. Germany secretly purchased munitions that spurred a modern armaments industry in the USSR. Ultimately, that arms industry, along with American and British aid, helped the Soviet Union prevail in the Second World War.\nRole in collectivisation.\nMolotov also oversaw agricultural collectivisation under Stalin's regime. He was the main speaker at the Central Committee plenum in 10\u201317 November 1929, at which the decision was made to introduce collective farming in place of the thousands of small farms owned by peasants, a process that was bound to meet resistance. Molotov insisted that it must begin the following year, and warned officials to \"treat the kulak as the most cunning and still undefeated enemy.\" In the four years that followed, millions of 'kulaks' (land-owning peasants) were forcibly moved onto special settlements to be used as slave labour. In 1931 alone almost two million were deported. In that year, Molotov told the Congress of Soviets \"We have never refuted the fact that healthy prisoners capable of normal labour are used for road building and other public works. This is good for society; it is also good for the peasants themselves.\" The famine caused by the disruption of agricultural output and the emphasis on exporting grain to pay for industrialisation, and the harsh conditions of forced labour killed an estimated 11 million people. \nDespite the famine, in September 1931, Molotov sent a secret telegram to communist leaders in the North Caucasus telling them the collection of grain for export was going \"disgustingly slowly.\" In December, he travelled to Kharkiv, then the capital of Ukraine, and, ignoring warnings from local communist leaders about a grain shortage, told them that their failure to meet their target for grain collection was due to their incompetence. He returned to Kharkiv in July 1932, with Lazar Kaganovich, to tell the local communists that there would be no \"concessions or vacillations\" in the drive to meet targets for exporting grain. This was the first of several actions that led a Kyiv Court of Appeal in 2010 to find Molotov, and Kaganovich, guilty of genocide against the Ukrainian people. On 25 July, the same two men followed up the meeting with a secret telegram ordering the Ukrainian leadership to intensify grain collection.\nTemporary rift with Stalin.\nBetween the assassination of Sergei Kirov, the head of the Party organization in Leningrad, in December 1934, and the start of the Great Purge, there was a significant but unpublicised rift between Stalin and Molotov. In 1936, Trotsky, in exile, noted that when lists of party leaders appeared in Soviet press reports, Molotov's name sometimes appeared as low as fourth in the list \"and he was often deprived of his initials\", and that when he was photographed receiving a delegation, he was never alone, but always flanked by his deputies, Janis Rudzutaks and Vlas Chubar. \"In Soviet ritual all these are signs of paramount importance,\" Trotsky noted. Another startling piece of evidence was that the published transcript of the first Moscow Show Trial in August 1936, the defendants \u2013 who had been forced to confess to crimes of which they were innocent \u2013 said that they had conspired to kill Stalin and seven other leading Bolsheviks, but not Molotov. According to Alexander Orlov, an NKVD officer who defected to the west, Stalin personally crossed Molotov's name out of the original script.\nIn May 1936, Molotov went to the Black Sea on an extended holiday under careful NKVD supervision until the end of August, when Stalin apparently changed his mind and ordered Molotov's return.\nTwo explanations have been put forward for Molotov's temporary eclipse. On 19 March 1936 Molotov gave an interview with the editor of \"Le Temps\" concerning improved relations with Nazi Germany. Although Litvinov had made similar statements in 1934 and even visited Berlin that year, Germany had not then reoccupied the Rhineland. Derek Watson believed that it was Molotov's statement on foreign policy that offended Stalin. Molotov had made it clear that improved relations with Germany could develop only if its policy changed and stated that one of the best ways for Germany to improve relations was to rejoin the League of Nations. However, even that was not sufficient since Germany still had to give proof \"of its respect for international obligations in keeping with the real interests of peace in Europe and peace generally.\" Robert Conquest and others believe that Molotov \"dragged his feet\" over Stalin's plans to purge the party and put Old Bolsheviks like Zinoviev and Kamenev on trial.\nRole in the Great Purge.\nAfter his return to favor, in August, Molotov supported Stalin throughout the purge, during which, in 1938 alone, 20 out of 28 People's Commissars in Molotov's Government were executed. After his deputy, Rudzutak, had been arrested, Molotov visited him in prison, and recalled years later that... \"Rudzutak said he had been badly beaten and tortured. Nevertheless he held firm. Indeed, he seemed to have been cruelly tortured\" ...but he did not intervene. \nDuring the Great Purge, he approved 372 documented execution lists, more than any other Soviet official, including Stalin. Molotov was one of the few with whom Stalin openly discussed the purges. When Stalin received a note denouncing the deputy chairman of Gosplan, G.I.Lomov, he passed it to Molotov, who wrote on it: \"For immediate arrest of that bastard Lomov.\"\nBefore the Bolshevik revolution, Molotov had been a \"very close friend\" of a Socialist Revolutionary, Alexander Arosev, who shared his exile in Vologda. In 1937, fearing arrest, Arosev tried three times to ring Molotov, who refused to speak to him. He was arrested and shot. In the 1950s, Molotov gave Arosev's daughter his signed copies of her father's books, but later wished he had kept them. \"It appears that it was not so much the loss of his 'very close friend' but the loss of part of his own book collection ... that Molotov continued to regret.\"\nLate in life, Molotov described his role in purges of the 1930s, arguing that despite the overbreadth of the purges, they were necessary to avoid Soviet defeat in World War II:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Socialism demands immense effort. And that includes sacrifices. Mistakes were made in the process. But we could have suffered greater losses in the war \u2013 perhaps even defeat \u2013 if the leadership had flinched and had allowed internal disagreements, like cracks in a rock. Had leadership broken down in the 1930s we would have been in a most critical situation, many times more critical than actually turned out. I bear responsibility for this policy of repression and consider it correct. Admittedly, I have always said grave mistakes and excesses were committed, but the policy on the whole was correct.\nMinister of Foreign Affairs.\nIn 1939, Adolf Hitler's invasion of the rest of Czechoslovakia, in violation of the 1938 Munich Agreement, made Stalin believe that Britain and France, which had signed the agreement, would not be reliable allies against German expansion. That made him decide instead to seek to conciliate Nazi Germany. In May 1939, Maxim Litvinov, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, was dismissed; Molotov was appointed to succeed him. \nRelations between Molotov and Litvinov had been bad. Maurice Hindus in 1954 stated in his book \"Crisis in the Kremlin\":\nIt is well known in Moscow that Molotov always detested Litvinov. Molotov's detestation for Litvinov was purely of a personal nature. No Moscovite I have ever known, whether a friend of Molotov or of Litvinov, has ever taken exception to this view. Molotov was always resentful of Litvinov's fluency in French, German and English, as he was distrustful of Litvinov's easy manner with foreigners. Never having lived abroad, Molotov always suspected that there was something impure and sinful in Litvinov's broad-mindedness and appreciation of Western civilisation.\nLitvinov had no respect for Molotov, regarding him as a small-minded intriguer and accomplice in terror.\n Molotov was succeeded in his post as premier by Stalin.\nAt first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet diplomatic hints that Stalin desired a treaty; but in early August 1939, Hitler allowed Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August, and on 22 August Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to conclude a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the treaty is known as the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, it was Stalin and Hitler, not Molotov and Ribbentrop, who decided the content of the treaty.\nThe most important part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of Poland, Finland and the Baltic States between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia (then part of Romania, now Moldova). The protocol gave Hitler the green light for his invasion of Poland, which began on 1 September.\nThe pact's terms gave Hitler authorisation to occupy two thirds of Western Poland and the whole of Lithuania. Molotov was given a free hand in relation to Finland. In the Winter War, a combination of fierce Finnish resistance and Soviet mismanagement resulted in Finland losing much of its territory but not its independence. The pact was later amended to allocate Lithuania to the Soviets in exchange for a more favourable border in Poland for Germany. The annexations led to horrific suffering and loss of life in the countries occupied and partitioned by both dictatorships. On 5 March 1940, Lavrentiy Beria gave Molotov, along with Anastas Mikoyan, Kliment Voroshilov and Stalin, a note proposing the execution of 25,700 Polish anti-Soviet officers in what has become known as the Katyn massacre.\nIn November 1940, Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop and Hitler. In January 1941, British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden visited Turkey in an attempt to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allies' side. The purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German, rather than anti-Soviet, but Molotov assumed otherwise. In a series of conversations with Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviets would soon be faced with an Anglo\u2013Turkish invasion of the Crimea. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that, in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain, rather than Germany, as the principal threat.\nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet\u2013German relations until June 1941, when Hitler turned east and invaded the Soviet Union. Molotov was responsible for telling the Soviet people of the attack when he, instead of Stalin, announced the war. His speech, broadcast by radio on 22 June, characterised the Soviet Union in a role similar to that articulated by Winston Churchill in his early wartime speeches. The State Defence Committee was established soon after Molotov's speech. Stalin was elected chairman and Molotov was elected deputy chairman.\nAfter the German invasion, Molotov conducted urgent negotiations with the British and then the Americans for wartime alliances. He took a secret flight to Scotland, where he was greeted by Eden. The risky flight in a high-altitude Tupolev TB-7 bomber flew over German-occupied Denmark and the North Sea. From there, he took a train to London to discuss the possibility of opening a second front against Germany.\nAfter signing the Anglo\u2013Soviet Treaty of 1942 on 26 May, Molotov left for Washington. He met US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and agreed on a lend-lease plan. Both the British and the Americans only vaguely promised to open a second front against Germany. On his flight back to the Soviet Union, his plane was attacked by German fighters and later mistakenly by Soviet fighters.\nThere is no evidence that Molotov ever persuaded Stalin to pursue a different policy from that on which he had already decided. Volkogonov could not find one case where any of the elite in government openly disagreed with Stalin.\nThere is some evidence that, although Stalin realised he needed Molotov, Stalin did not like him. Stalin's one-time bodyguard, Amba, stated: \"More general dislike for this statesman robot and for his position in the Kremlin could scarcely be wished and it was apparent that Stalin himself joined in this feeling\". Amba asked the question: \"What then has made Stalin collaborate so closely with him? There are many more talented people in the Soviet Union and Stalin no doubt had the means to find them. Is he afraid of close collaboration with a more human and sympathetic assistant?\"At a jolly party, Amba recalled an incident whereby Poskryobyshev approached Stalin and whispered in his ear. Stalin replied, \"Does it have to be right away?\" Everybody realised at once that the conversation was regarding Molotov. In half an hour, Stalin was informed of Molotov's arrival. Although the whispered conversation between Molotov and Stalin only lasted five minutes, the merriment of the gathering evaporated as everybody talked in hushed tones. Amba stated, \"Then the blanket left. Instantly the gaiety returned\". Vareykis said that \"a gentle angel has flown past\": a Russian expression for when a sudden silence descends. Breaking the tension, Laurentyev quipped in a harsh Georgian accent, \"Go, friendly soul\". Out of those in attendance, Stalin laughed the loudest at Laurentyev's joke.\nStalin could be rude to Molotov. In 1942, Stalin took Molotov to task for his handling of the negotiations with the Allies. He cabled Molotov on 3 June:\"[I am] dissatisfied with the terseness and reticence of all your communications. You convey to us from your talks with Roosevelt and Churchill only what you yourself consider is important, and omit all the rest. Meanwhile, the instance [Stalin] would like to know everything. What you consider important and what you think unimportant. This refers to the draft of the communiqu\u00e9 as well. You have not informed us whose draft it is, whether it has been agreed with the British in full and why, after all, there could not be two communiqu\u00e9s, one concerning the talks in Britain and one concerning the talks in the USA. We are having to guess because of your reticence. We further consider it expedient that both communiqu\u00e9s should mention among other things the creation of a second front in Europe and that full understanding has been reached in this matter. We also consider that it is absolutely necessary both communiqu\u00e9s should mention the supply of war materials to the Soviet Union from Britain and the USA. In all the rest we agree with the contents of the draft communiqu\u00e9 you sent us\".\nWhen Beria told Stalin about the Manhattan Project and its importance, Stalin handpicked Molotov to be the man in charge of the Soviet atomic bomb project. However, under Molotov's leadership, the bomb and the project itself developed very slowly, and he was replaced by Beria in 1944 on the advice of Igor Kurchatov. When Roosevelt's successor as U.S. President Harry S. Truman told Stalin that the Americans had created a bomb never seen before, Stalin relayed the conversation to Molotov and told him to speed up development. On Stalin's orders, the Soviet government substantially increased investment in the project. In a collaboration with Kliment Voroshilov, Molotov contributed both musically and lyrically to the 1944 version of the Soviet national anthem. Molotov asked the writers to include a line or two about peace. The role of Molotov and Voroshilov in the making of the new Soviet anthem was, in the words of the historian Simon Sebag-Montefiore, acting as music judges for Stalin.\nMolotov accompanied Stalin to the Teheran Conference in 1943, the Yalta Conference in 1945, and, after the defeat of Germany, the Potsdam Conference. He represented the Soviet Union at the San Francisco Conference, which created the United Nations. In April 1945, shortly after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Molotov engaged in talks with the new American President Harry S. Truman; these talks, despite not being hostile, came to be mythologised decades later as an early crack in US-Soviet relations harbingering the beginning of the Cold War. Even during the wartime alliance, Molotov was known as a tough negotiator and a determined defender of Soviet interests. Molotov lost his position of First Deputy chairman on 19 March 1946, after the Council of People's Commissars had been reformed as the Council of Ministers.\nFrom 1945 to 1947, Molotov took part in all four conferences of foreign ministers of the victorious states in the Second World War. In general, he was distinguished by an unco-operative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, at the direction of the Soviet government, condemned the Marshall Plan as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps: one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other Eastern Bloc nations, initiated what is known as the Molotov Plan. The plan created several bilateral relations between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and later evolved into the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA).\nIn the postwar period, Molotov's power began to decline. A clear sign of his precarious position was his inability to prevent the arrest for \"treason\" in December 1948 of his Jewish wife, Polina Zhemchuzhina, whom Stalin had long distrusted. Molotov initially protested the persecution against her by abstaining from the vote to condemn her, but later recanted, stating: \"I acknowledge my heavy sense of remorse for not having prevented Zhemchuzhina, a person very dear to me, from making her mistakes and from forming ties with anti-Soviet Jewish nationalists\", and divorced Zhemchuzhina.\nPolina Zhemchuzhina befriended Golda Meir, who arrived in Moscow in November 1948 as the first Israeli envoy to the Soviet Union. There are unsubstantiated claims that, being fluent in Yiddish, Zhemchuzhina acted as a translator for a diplomatic meeting between Meir and her husband, the Soviet foreign minister. However, this claim (of being an interpreter) is not supported by Meir's memoir \"My Life\". Presentation of her ambassadorial credentials was done in Hebrew, not in Yiddish. According to Meir's own account of the reception given by Molotov on 7 November, \"Mrs. Zhemchuzhina has spent significant time during this reception not only talking to Golda Meir herself but also in conversation with Mrs. Meir's daughter Sarah and her friend Yael Namir about their life as kibbutzniks. They have discussed the complete collectivization of property and related issues. At the end Mrs. Zhemchuzhina gave Golda Meir's daughter Sarah a hug and said: 'Be well. If everything goes well with you, it will go well for all Jews everywhere.'\u00a0\"\nZhemchuzhina was imprisoned for a year in the Lubyanka and was then exiled for three years in an obscure Russian city. She was sentenced to hard labour, spending five years in exile in Kazakhstan. Molotov had no communication with her except for the scant news that he received from Beria, whom he loathed. Zhemchuzhina was freed immediately after the death of Stalin.In 1949, Molotov was replaced as Foreign Minister by Andrey Vyshinsky but retained his position as First Deputy Premier and membership in the Politburo. Being appointed Foreign Minister by Stalin to replace the Jewish predecessor Maxim Litvinov to facilitate negotiations with Nazi Germany, Molotov was thus also dismissed from the same position at least in part because his wife was also of Jewish origin.\nMolotov never stopped loving his wife, and it is said he ordered his maids to make dinner for two every evening to remind him that, in his own words, \"she suffered because of me.\" According to Erofeev, Molotov said of her: \"She's not only beautiful and intelligent, the only woman minister in the Soviet Union; she's also a real Bolshevik, a real Soviet person.\" According to Stalin's daughter, Molotov became very subservient to his wife. Molotov was a yes-man to his wife just as he was to Stalin.\nPostwar career.\nAt the 19th Party Congress in 1952, Molotov was elected to the replacement for the Politburo, the Presidium, but was not listed among the members of the newly established secret body known as the Bureau of the Presidium, which indicated that he had fallen out of Stalin's favour. At the 19th Congress, Stalin said \"there has been criticism of comrade Molotov and Mikoyan by the Central Committee,\" mistakes that included letting the British ambassador publish \"bourgeois newspapers in our country\". Both Molotov and Mikoyan were falling out of favour rapidly, with Stalin telling Beria, Khrushchev, Malenkov and Nikolai Bulganin that he no longer wanted to see Molotov and Mikoyan around. At his 73rd birthday, Stalin treated both with disgust. In his speech to the 20th Party Congress in 1956, Khrushchev told delegates that Stalin had plans for \"finishing off\" Molotov and Mikoyan in the aftermath of the 19th Congress.\nFollowing Stalin's death, a realignment of the leadership strengthened Molotov's position. Georgy Malenkov, Stalin's successor in the post of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, reappointed Molotov as Minister of Foreign Affairs on 5 March 1953. Although Molotov was seen as a likely successor to Stalin in the immediate aftermath of his death, he never sought to become leader of the Soviet Union. A Troika was established immediately after Stalin's death, consisting of Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov, but ended when Malenkov and Molotov deceived Beria. Molotov supported the removal and later the execution of Beria on the orders of Khrushchev. The new Party Secretary, Khrushchev, soon emerged as the new leader of the Soviet Union. He presided over a gradual domestic liberalisation and a thaw in foreign policy, as was manifest in a reconciliation with Josip Broz Tito's government in Yugoslavia, which Stalin had expelled from the communist movement. Molotov, an old-guard Stalinist, seemed increasingly out of place in the new environment, but represented the Soviet Union at the Geneva Conference of 1955.\nMolotov's position became increasingly tenuous after February 1956, when Khrushchev launched an unexpected denunciation of Stalin at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party. Khrushchev attacked Stalin over the purges of the 1930s and the defeats of the early years of the Second World War, which he blamed on Stalin's overly-trusting attitude towards Hitler and the purges of the Red Army command structure. Molotov was the most senior of Stalin's collaborators still in government and had played a leading role in the purges, so it became evident that Khrushchev's examination of the past would probably result in the fall from power of Molotov, who became the leader of an old-guard faction that sought to overthrow Khrushchev.\nIn June 1956, Molotov was removed as Foreign Minister; on 29 June 1957, he was expelled from the Presidium (Politburo) after a failed attempt to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary. Although Molotov's faction initially won a vote in the Presidium 7\u20134 to remove Khrushchev, the latter refused to resign unless a Central Committee plenum decided so. In the plenum, which met from 22 to 29 June, Molotov and his faction were defeated. Eventually he was banished, being made ambassador to the Mongolian People's Republic. Molotov and his associates were denounced as \"the Anti-Party Group\" but notably were not subject to such unpleasant repercussions that had been customary for denounced officials in the Stalin years. In 1960, he was appointed Soviet representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which was seen as a partial rehabilitation. However, after the 22nd Party Congress in 1961, during which Khrushchev carried out his de-Stalinisation campaign, including the removal of Stalin's body from Lenin's Mausoleum, Molotov, along with Lazar Kaganovich, was removed from all positions and expelled from the Communist Party. In 1962, all of Molotov's party documents and files were destroyed by the authorities.\nIn retirement, Molotov remained unrepentant about his role under Stalin's rule. He suffered a heart attack in January 1962. After the Sino-Soviet split, it was reported that he agreed with the criticisms made by Mao Zedong of the supposed revisionism of Khrushchev's policies.\nLater life.\nIn 1968, United Press International reported that Molotov had completed his memoirs but that they would likely never be published. The first signs of Molotov's rehabilitation were seen during Leonid Brezhnev's rule, when information about him was again allowed to be included in Soviet encyclopaedias. His connection, support and work in the Anti-Party Group were mentioned in encyclopaedias published in 1973 and 1974, but eventually disappeared altogether by the mid-to-late-1970s. Later, Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko further rehabilitated Molotov. In 1984, Molotov was even allowed to seek membership in the Communist Party. A collection of interviews with Molotov from the period 1969 to 1986 was published in 1993 by Felix Chuev as \"\".\nIn June 1986 Molotov was hospitalised in Kuntsevo Hospital in Moscow, where he eventually died, during the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev, on 8 November 1986. During his life, Molotov had suffered seven heart attacks, but survived to the age of 96. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving major participant in the events of 1917. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\nLegacy.\nMolotov, like Stalin, was pathologically mistrustful of others; much crucial information has disappeared. As Molotov once said, \"One should listen to them, but it is necessary to check up on them. The intelligence officer can lead you to a very dangerous position... There are many provocateurs here, there, and everywhere.\" Molotov continued to claim in a series of published interviews that there never was a secret territorial deal between Stalin and Hitler during the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. Like Stalin, he never recognized the Cold War as an international event. He saw the Cold War as more or less the everyday conflict between communism and capitalism. He divided the capitalist countries into two groups: the \"smart and dangerous imperialists\" and the \"fools.\" Before his retirement, Molotov had proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the People's Republic of China. Molotov believed that socialist states were part of a larger, supranational entity. In retirement, Molotov criticized Nikita Khrushchev for being a \"right-wing deviationist.\"\nThe Molotov cocktail is a term coined by the Finns during the Winter War, as a generic name used for a variety of improvised incendiary weapons. During the Winter War, the Soviet air force made extensive use of incendiaries and cluster bombs against Finnish civilians, troops and fortifications. When Molotov claimed in radio broadcasts that they were not bombing but rather delivering food to the starving Finns, the Finns started to call the air bombs \"Molotov bread baskets\". Soon they responded by attacking advancing tanks with \"Molotov cocktails,\" which were \"a drink to go with the food.\" According to Montefiore, the Molotov cocktail was one part of Molotov's cult of personality that the vain Premier surely did not appreciate.\nWinston Churchill lists many meetings with Molotov in his wartime memoirs. Acknowledging him as a \"man of outstanding ability and cold-blooded ruthlessness,\" Churchill concluded: \"In the conduct of foreign affairs, Mazarin, Talleyrand, Metternich, would welcome him to their company, if there be another world to which Bolsheviks allow themselves to go.\" The former US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles said: \"I have seen in action all the great international statesmen of this century. I have never seen such personal diplomatic skill at so high a degree of perfection as Molotov's.\"\nMolotov was the only person to have shaken hands with Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler, Rudolf Hess, Hermann G\u00f6ring, and Heinrich Himmler. \nAt the end of 1989 the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union and Mikhail Gorbachev's government formally denounced the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.\nIn January 2010, a Ukrainian court accused Molotov and other Soviet officials of organizing a man-made famine in Ukraine in 1932\u201333. The same Court then ended criminal proceedings against them, as the trial would be posthumous.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "71491", "revid": "19014806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71491", "title": "Hepatitis C", "text": "Human viral infection\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nHepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver; it is a type of viral hepatitis. During the initial infection period, people often have mild or no symptoms. Early symptoms can include fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and jaundice. The virus persists in the liver, becoming chronic, in about 70% of those initially infected. Early on, chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop serious complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach.\nHCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with injection drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. In regions where blood screening has been implemented, the risk of contracting HCV from a transfusion has dropped substantially to less than one per two million. HCV may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread through breast milk, food, water, or casual contact such as hugging, kissing, and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.\nDiagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or viral RNA. In the United States, screening for HCV infection is recommended in all adults age 18 to 79 years old.\nThere is no vaccine against hepatitis C. Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who inject drugs, testing donated blood, and treatment of people with chronic infection. Chronic infection can be cured more than 95% of the time with antiviral medications such as sofosbuvir or simeprevir. Peginterferon and ribavirin were earlier generation treatments that proved successful in &lt;50% of cases and caused greater side effects. While access to the newer treatments was expensive, by 2022 prices had dropped dramatically in many countries (primarily low-income and lower-middle-income countries) due to the introduction of generic versions of medicines. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. Hepatitis C is one of the leading reasons for liver transplantation. However, the virus usually recurs after transplantation.\nAn estimated 58 million people worldwide were infected with hepatitis C in 2019. Approximately 290,000 deaths from the virus, mainly from liver cancer and cirrhosis attributed to hepatitis C, also occurred in 2019. The existence of hepatitis C \u2013 originally identifiable only as a type of non-A non-B hepatitis \u2013 was suggested in the 1970s and proven in 1989. Hepatitis C infects only humans and chimpanzees.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nAcute infection.\nAcute symptoms develop in some 20% of those infected. When this occurs, it is generally 4\u201312 weeks following infection (but it may take from 2 weeks to 6 months for acute symptoms to appear).\nSymptoms are generally mild and vague, and may include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, fever, muscle or joint pains, abdominal pain, decreased appetite and weight loss, jaundice (occurs in ~25% of those infected), dark urine, and clay-coloured stools. Acute liver failure due to acute hepatitis C is exceedingly rare. Symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of liver disease should prompt further tests and can thus help establish a diagnosis of hepatitis C infection early on.\nFollowing the acute phase, the infection may resolve spontaneously in 10\u201350% of affected people; this occurs more frequently in young people and females.\nChronic infection.\nAbout 70% of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection. This is defined as the presence of detectable viral replication for at least six months. Though most experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few decades of a chronic infection, chronic hepatitis C can be associated with fatigue and mild cognitive problems. After several years, chronic infection may cause cirrhosis or liver cancer. The liver enzymes measured from blood samples are normal in 7\u201353%. (Elevated levels indicate the virus or other disease is damaging liver cells). Late relapses after apparent cure have been reported, but these can be difficult to distinguish from reinfection.\nFatty changes to the liver occur in about half of those infected and are usually present before cirrhosis develops. Usually (80% of the time) this change affects less than a third of the liver. Worldwide hepatitis C is the cause of 27% of cirrhosis cases and 25% of hepatocellular carcinoma. About 10\u201330% of those infected develop cirrhosis over 30 years. Cirrhosis is more common in those also infected with hepatitis B, schistosoma, or HIV, in alcoholics, and in those of male sex. In those with hepatitis C, excess alcohol increases the risk of developing cirrhosis 5-fold. Those who develop cirrhosis have a 20-fold greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. This transformation occurs at a rate of 1\u20133% per year. Being infected with hepatitis B in addition to hepatitis C increases this risk further.\nLiver cirrhosis may lead to portal hypertension, ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen), easy bruising or bleeding, varices (enlarged veins, especially in the stomach and esophagus), jaundice, and a syndrome of cognitive impairment known as hepatic encephalopathy. Ascites occurs at some stage in more than half of those who have a chronic infection.\nExtrahepatic complications.\nThe most common problem due to hepatitis C but not involving the liver is mixed cryoglobulinemia (usually the type II form) \u2013 an inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels. Hepatitis C is also associated with autoimmune disorders such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, lichen planus, a low platelet count, porphyria cutanea tarda, necrolytic acral erythema, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy, autoimmune thyroiditis, and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. 20\u201330% of people infected have rheumatoid factor \u2013 a type of antibody. Possible associations include Hyde's prurigo nodularis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Cardiomyopathy with associated abnormal heart rhythms has also been reported. A variety of central and peripheral nervous system disorders has been reported. Chronic infection seems to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. People may experience other issues in the mouth such as dryness, salivary duct stones, and crusted lesions around the mouth.\nOccult infection.\nPeople who have been infected with hepatitis C may appear to clear the virus but remain infected. The virus is not detectable with conventional testing but can be found with ultra-sensitive tests. The original method of detection was by demonstrating the viral genome within liver biopsies. Still, newer methods include an antibody test for the virus' core protein and the detection of the viral genome after first concentrating the viral particles by ultracentrifugation. A form of infection with persistently moderately elevated serum liver enzymes but without antibodies to hepatitis C has also been reported. This form is known as cryptogenic occult infection.\nSeveral clinical pictures have been associated with this type of infection. It may be found in people with anti-hepatitis-C antibodies but with normal serum levels of liver enzymes; in antibody-negative people with ongoing elevated liver enzymes of unknown cause; in healthy populations without evidence of liver disease; and in groups at risk for HCV infection including those on hemodialysis or family members of people with occult HCV. The clinical relevance of this form of infection is under investigation. The consequences of occult infection appear to be less severe than with chronic infection but can vary from minimal to hepatocellular carcinoma.\nThe rate of occult infection in those apparently cured is controversial but appears to be low. 40% of those with hepatitis but with both negative hepatitis C serology and the absence of detectable viral genome in the serum have hepatitis C virus in the liver on biopsy. How commonly this occurs in children is unknown.\nVirology.\nThe hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small, enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. It is a member of the genus \"Hepacivirus\" in the family \"Flaviviridae\". There are seven major genotypes of HCV, which are known as genotypes one to seven. The genotypes are divided into several subtypes with the number of subtypes depending on the genotype. In the United States, about 70% of cases are caused by genotype 1, 20% by genotype 2, and about 1% by each of the other genotypes. Genotype 1 is also the most common in South America and Europe.\nThe half-life of the virus particles in the serum is around 3 hours and may be as short as 45 minutes. In an infected person, about 1012 virus particles are produced each day. In addition to replicating in the liver the virus can multiply in lymphocytes.\nTransmission.\nPercutaneous contact with contaminated blood is responsible for most infections; however, the method of transmission is strongly dependent on both geographic region and economic status. Indeed, the primary route of transmission in the developed world is injection drug use, while in the developing world the main methods are blood transfusions and unsafe medical procedures. The cause of transmission remains unknown in 20% of cases; however, many of these are believed to be accounted for by injection drug use.\nHCV is not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating or cooking utensils, nor is it transmitted through food or water.\nDrug use.\nInjection drug use (IDU) is a major risk factor for hepatitis C in many parts of the world. Of 77 countries reviewed, 25 (including the United States) were found to have a prevalence of hepatitis C of 60\u201380% among people who use injection drugs. Twelve countries had rates greater than 80%. It is believed that ten million people who use drugs intravenously are infected with hepatitis C; China (1.6 million), the United States (1.5 million), and Russia (1.3 million) have the highest absolute totals. \nOccurrence of hepatitis C among prison inmates in the United States is 10 to 20 times that of the occurrence observed in the general population; this has been attributed to high-risk behavior in prisons such as IDU and tattooing with non-sterile equipment. Shared intranasal drug use may also be a risk factor.\nHealthcare exposure.\nBlood transfusion, transfusion of blood products, or organ transplants without HCV screening carry significant risks of infection. The United States instituted universal screening in 1992, and Canada instituted universal screening in 1990. This decreased the risk from one in 200 units to between one in 10,000 to one in 10,000,000 per unit of blood. This low risk remains as there is about 11\u201370 days between the potential blood donor's acquiring hepatitis C and the blood's testing positive, depending on the method. Some countries do not screen for hepatitis C due to the cost.\nThose who have experienced a needle stick injury from someone who was HCV positive have about a 1.8% chance of subsequently contracting the disease themselves. The risk is greater if the needle is hollow and the puncture wound is deep. There is a risk from mucosal exposure to blood, but this risk is low, and there is no risk if blood exposure occurs on intact skin.\nHospital equipment has also been documented as a method of transmission of hepatitis C, including the reuse of needles and syringes, multiple-use medication vials, infusion bags, and improperly sterilized surgical equipment, among others. Limitations in the implementation and enforcement of stringent standard precautions in public and private medical and dental facilities are known to have been the primary cause of the spread of HCV in Egypt, the country which had the highest rate of infection in the world in 2012. In 2023, Egypt became the first country to achieve WHO validation on the path to elimination of hepatitis C.\nSexual intercourse.\nSexual intercourse is not the most common mode of transmission of hepatitis C, and the rate of transmission varies between different groups. Studies examining the risk of HCV transmission between heterosexual partners, when one is infected and the other is not, have found very low risks. Research has found higher rates of sexually transmitted HCV among people with multiple partners, and men who have sex with men at the highest risk of sexual transmission. Sexual practices that involve higher levels of trauma to the anogenital mucosa, such as anal penetrative sex, or that occur when there is a concurrent sexually transmitted infection, including HIV or genital ulceration, present greater risks. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs recommends condom use to prevent hepatitis C transmission in those with multiple partners, but not those in relationships that involve only a single partner.\nBody modification.\nTattooing is associated with two- to threefold increased risk of hepatitis C. This could be due to improperly sterilized equipment or contamination of the dyes used. Tattoos or piercings performed either before the mid-1980s, \"underground\", or nonprofessionally are of particular concern, since sterile techniques in such settings may be lacking. The risk also appears to be greater for larger tattoos. It is estimated that nearly half of prison inmates share unsterilized tattooing equipment. It is rare for tattoos in a licensed facility to be directly associated with HCV infection.\nMother-to-child transmission.\nMother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C occurs in fewer than 10% of pregnancies. There are no measures that alter this risk. It is not clear when transmission occurs during pregnancy, but it may occur both during gestation and at delivery. A long labor is associated with a greater risk of transmission. There is no evidence that breastfeeding spreads HCV; however, to be cautious, an infected mother is advised to avoid breastfeeding if her nipples are cracked and bleeding, or if her viral loads are high.\nFomites.\nA fomite () or fomes () is any inanimate object that, when contaminated with or exposed to infectious agents (such as pathogenic bacteria, viruses or fungi), can transfer disease to a new host.\nPersonal-care items such as razors, toothbrushes, and manicuring or pedicuring equipment can be contaminated with blood. Sharing such items can potentially lead to exposure to HCV. Appropriate caution should be taken regarding any medical condition that results in bleeding, such as cuts and sores.\nDiagnosis.\nThere are several diagnostic tests for hepatitis C, including HCV antibody enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), recombinant immunoblot assay, and quantitative HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCV RNA can be detected by PCR typically one to two weeks after infection. In contrast, antibodies can take substantially longer to form and thus be detected.\nDiagnosing patients is generally a challenge as patients with acute illness often present with mild, non-specific flu-like symptoms, while the transition from acute to chronic is sub-clinical. Chronic hepatitis C is defined as infection with the hepatitis C virus persisting for more than six months based on the presence of its RNA. Chronic infections are typically asymptomatic during the first few decades, and thus are most commonly discovered following the investigation of elevated liver enzyme levels or during a routine screening of high-risk individuals. Testing is not able to distinguish between acute and chronic infections. Diagnosis in infants is difficult as maternal antibodies may persist for up to 18 months.\nSerology.\nHepatitis C testing typically begins with blood testing to detect the presence of antibodies to the HCV, using an enzyme immunoassay. If this test is positive, a confirmatory test is then performed to verify the immunoassay and to determine the viral load. A recombinant immunoblot assay is used to verify the immunoassay, and the viral load is determined by an HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction. If there is no RNA and the immunoblot is positive, it means that the person tested had a previous infection but cleared it either with treatment or spontaneously; if the immunoblot is negative, it means that the immunoassay was wrong. It takes about 6\u20138 weeks following infection before the immunoassay will test positive. Several tests are available as point-of-care testing (POCT), which can provide results within 30 minutes.\nLiver enzymes are variable during the initial part of the infection and on average begin to rise seven weeks after infection. The elevation of liver enzymes does not closely follow disease severity.\nBiopsy.\nLiver biopsies are used to determine the degree of liver damage present; however, there are risks from the procedure. The typical changes seen are lymphocytes within the parenchyma, lymphoid follicles in portal triad, and changes to the bile ducts. There are many blood tests available that try to determine the degree of hepatic fibrosis and alleviate the need for biopsy.\nScreening.\nIt is believed that only 5\u201350% of those infected in the United States and Canada are aware of their status. Routine screening for those between the ages of 18 and 79 was recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2020. Previously, testing was recommended for those at high risk, including injection drug users, those who have received blood transfusions before 1992, those who have been incarcerated, those on long-term hemodialysis, and those with tattoos. Screening is also recommended for those with elevated liver enzymes, as this is frequently the only sign of chronic hepatitis. As of 2012[ [update]], the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a single screening test for those born between 1945 and 1965. In Canada, a one-time screening is recommended for those born between 1945 and 1975.\nPrevention.\nAs of 2022, no approved vaccine protects against contracting hepatitis C. A combination of harm reduction strategies, such as the provision of new needles and syringes and treatment of substance use, decreases the risk of hepatitis C in people using injection drugs by about 75%. The screening of blood donors is important at a national level, as is adhering to universal precautions within healthcare facilities. In countries where there is an insufficient supply of sterile syringes, medications should be given orally rather than via injection (when possible). Recent research also suggests that treating people with active infection, thereby reducing the potential for transmission, may be an effective preventive measure.\nHepatitis C vaccine phase 1 clinical trials are set to begin in the summer of 2023.\nTreatment.\nThose with chronic hepatitis C are advised to avoid alcohol and medications that are toxic to the liver. They should also be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B due to the increased risk if also infected. Use of acetaminophen is generally considered safe at reduced doses. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended in those with advanced liver disease due to an increased risk of bleeding. Ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma is recommended in those with accompanying cirrhosis. Regular, moderate coffee consumption, especially caffeinated, has been associated with a slower rate of liver scarring in those infected with HCV.\nMedications.\nMore than 95% of chronic cases are resolved with treatment. Treatment with antiviral medication is recommended for all people with proven chronic hepatitis C who are not at high risk of death from other causes. People with the highest complication risk, based on the degree of liver scarring, should be treated first. The initial recommended treatment depends on the type of hepatitis C virus, if the person has received previous hepatitis C treatment, and whether the person has cirrhosis. Direct-acting antivirals are the preferred treatment and have been validated by testing for virus particles in patients' blood.\nNo prior treatment.\nMore than 95% of people with chronic infection can be cured when treated with medications; however, there is some evidence to suggest that certain genotypes may be associated with lower levels of cure. Additionally, treatment costs may be cost prohibitive in certain settings, especially for GLE/PIB and SOF/VEL/VOX.However, generic versions of SOF/DAC and SOF/VEL are available at lower, more accessible prices. The combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir may be used in those who have previously been treated with sofosbuvir or other drugs that inhibit NS5A and were not cured.\nBefore 2011, treatments consisted of a combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin for a period of 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HCV genotype. This treatment produces cure rates of 70\u201380% for genotype 2 and 3, respectively, and 45\u201370% for genotypes 1 and 4. Adverse effects with these treatments were common, with 50\u201360% of those being treated experiencing flu-like symptoms and nearly a third experiencing depression or other emotional issues. Treatment during the first six months of infection (the acute stage) is more effective than when hepatitis C has entered the chronic stage. In those with chronic hepatitis B, treatment for hepatitis C results in reactivation of hepatitis B about 25% of the time.\nSurgery.\nCirrhosis due to hepatitis C is a common reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually (80\u201390% of cases) recurs afterwards. Infection of the graft leads to 10\u201330% of people developing cirrhosis within five years. Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin post-transplant decreases the risk of recurrence to 70%. A 2013 review found no clear evidence as to whether antiviral medication is useful if the graft became reinfected.\nAlternative medicine.\nSeveral alternative therapies are claimed by their proponents to be helpful for hepatitis C, including milk thistle, ginseng, and colloidal silver. However, no alternative therapy has been shown to improve outcomes for hepatitis C patients, and no evidence exists that alternative therapies have any effect on the virus.\nPrognosis.\nThe response to treatment is measured by \"sustained viral response\" (SVR), defined as the absence of detectable RNA of the hepatitis C virus in blood serum for at least 24 weeks after discontinuing treatment, and rapid virological response (RVR), defined as undetectable levels achieved within four weeks of treatment. Successful treatment decreases the future risk of hepatocellular carcinoma by 75%.\nBefore 2012, sustained response occurred in about 40\u201350% of those with HCV genotype 1 who received 48 weeks of treatment. A sustained response was seen in 70\u201380% of people with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 following 24 weeks of treatment. A sustained response occurs for about 65% of those with genotype 4 after 48 weeks of treatment. For those with HCV genotype 6, a 48-week treatment protocol of pegylated interferon and ribavirin results in a higher rate of sustained responses than for genotype 1 (86% vs. 52%). Further studies are needed to determine results for shorter 24-week treatments and those given at lower dosages.\nSpontaneous resolution.\nAround 30% (15\u201345%) of those with acute HCV infections will spontaneously clear the virus within six months before the infection is considered chronic. Spontaneous resolution following acute infection appears more common in females and younger patients and may be influenced by certain genetic factors. Chronic HCV infection may also resolve spontaneously months or years after the acute phase has passed, though this is unusual.\nEpidemiology.\nThe World Health Organization estimated in a 2021 report that 58 million people globally were living with chronic hepatitis C as of 2019. About 1.5 million people are infected per year, and about 290,000 people die yearly from hepatitis C\u2013related diseases, mainly from liver cancer and cirrhosis.\nHepatitis C infection rates increased substantially in the 20th century due to a combination of injection drug use and the reuse of poorly sterilized medical equipment. However, advancements in treatment have led to notable declines in chronic infections and deaths from the virus. As a result, the number of chronic patients receiving treatment worldwide has grown from about 950,000 in 2015 to 9.4 million in 2019. During the same period, hepatitis C deaths declined from about 400,000 to 290,000.\nPreviously, a 2013 study found high infection rates (&gt;3.5% population infected) in Central and East Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, intermediate infection rates (1.5\u20133.5%) in South and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Andean, Central and Southern Latin America, Caribbean, Oceania, Australasia and Central, Eastern and Western Europe; and low infection rates (&lt;1.5%) in Asia-Pacific, Tropical Latin America and North America.\nAmong those chronically infected, the risk of cirrhosis after 20 years varies between studies but has been estimated at ~10\u201315% for men and ~1\u20135% for women. The reason for this difference is not known. Once cirrhosis is established, the rate of developing hepatocellular carcinoma is ~1\u20134% per year. Rates of new infections have decreased in the Western world since the 1990s due to improved screening of blood before transfusion.\nIn Egypt, following Egypt's 2030 Vision, the country managed to bring down the infection rates of hepatitis C from 22% in 2011 to just 2% in 2021. It was believed that the high prevalence in Egypt was linked to a discontinued mass-treatment campaign for schistosomiasis, using improperly sterilized glass syringes.\nIn the United States, about 2% of people have chronic hepatitis C. In 2014, an estimated 30,500 new acute hepatitis C cases occurred (0.7 per 100,000 population), an increase from 2010 to 2012. The number of deaths from hepatitis C rose to 15,800 in 2008 having overtaken HIV/AIDS as a cause of death in the US in 2007. In 2014, it was the single greatest cause of infectious death in the United States. This mortality rate is expected to increase, as those infected by transfusion before HCV testing become apparent. In Europe, the percentage of people with chronic infections has been estimated to be between 0.13 and 3.26%.\nIn the United Kingdom, about 118,000 people were chronically infected in 2019. About half of the people using a needle exchange in London in 2017\u201318 tested positive for hepatitis C of which half were unaware that they had it. As part of a bid to eradicate hepatitis C by 2025, NHS England conducted a large procurement exercise in 2019. Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Gilead Sciences, and Abbvie were awarded contracts, which, together, are worth up to \u00a31 billion over five years.\nThe total number of people with this infection is higher in some countries in Africa and Asia. Countries with particularly high rates of infection include Pakistan (4.8%) and China (3.2%).\nSince 2014, extremely effective treatments have been available to eradicate the disease within 8\u201312 weeks in most people. In 2015, about 950,000 people were treated while 1.7 million new infections occurred, meaning that overall the number of people with HCV increased. These numbers differ by country and improved in 2016, with some countries achieving higher cure rates than new infection rates (mostly high-income countries). By 2018, twelve countries are on track to achieve HCV elimination. While antiviral agents will curb new infections, it is less clear whether they impact overall deaths and morbidity. Furthermore, for them to be effective, people need to be aware of their infection \u2013 it is estimated that worldwide only 20% of infected people are aware of their infection (in the US, fewer than half were aware).\nHistory.\nIn the mid-1970s, Harvey J. Alter, Chief of the Infectious Disease Section in the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, and his research team demonstrated how most post-transfusion hepatitis cases were not due to hepatitis A or B viruses. Despite this discovery, international research efforts to identify the virus, initially called \"non-A, non-B hepatitis\" (NANBH), failed for the next decade. In 1987, Michael Houghton, Qui-Lim Choo, and George Kuo at Chiron Corporation, collaborating with Daniel W. Bradley at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, used a novel molecular cloning approach to identify the unknown organism and develop a diagnostic test. In 1988, Alter confirmed the virus by verifying its presence in a panel of NANBH specimens, and Chiron announced its discovery at a Washington, D.C. press conference in May 1988.\nAt the time, Chiron was in talks with the Japanese health ministry to sell a biotech version of the hepatitis B vaccine. Simultaneously, Emperor Hirohito had developed cancer and required numerous blood transfusions. The Japanese health ministry placed a screening order for Chiron's experimental NANBH test. Chiron's Japanese marketing subsidiary, Diagnostic Systems KK, introduced the term \"Hepatitis C\" in November 1988 in Tokyo news reports publicizing the testing of the emperor's blood. Chiron sold a screening order to the Japanese health ministry in November 1988, earning the company US$60 million a year. However, because Chiron had not published any of its research and did not make a culture model available to other researchers to verify Chiron's discovery, hepatitis C earned the nickname \"The Emperor's New Virus.\"\nIn April 1989, the \"discovery\" of HCV was published in two articles in the journal \"Science\". Chiron filed for several patents on the virus and its diagnosis. A competing patent application by the CDC was dropped in 1990 after Chiron paid $1.9 million to the CDC and $337,500 to Bradley. In 1994, Bradley sued Chiron, seeking to invalidate the patent, have himself included as a co-inventor, and receive damages and royalty income. The court ruled against him, which was sustained on appeal in 1998.\nBecause of the unique molecular \"isolation\" of the hepatitis C virus, although Houghton and Kuo's team at Chiron had discovered strong biochemical markers for the virus and the test proved effective at reducing cases of post-transfusion hepatitis, the existence of a hepatitis C virus was essentially inferred. In 1992, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" reported that the virus had never been observed under an electron microscope. In 1997, the American FDA approved the first hepatitis C drug based on a surrogate marker called \"Sustained Virological Response.\" In response, the pharmaceutical industry established a nationwide network of \"Astro-Turf\" patient advocacy groups to raise awareness (and fear) of the disease.\nIn 2001 Muhamad Aly Rifai demonstrated the first evidence indicating a significant association between hepatitis C and psychiatric disorders (psychotic, affective, anxiety and substance use disorders) In 2002, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs commissioned a larger study to replicate these findings and confirmed the significant association between hepatitis C and psychiatric disorders. Muhamad Aly Rifai advocates for screening patients with psychiatric disorders for hepatitis C.\nHepatitis C was finally \"discovered\" in 2005 when a Japanese team was able to propagate a molecular clone in a cell culture called Huh7. This discovery enabled proper characterization of the viral particle and rapid research into the development of protease inhibitors replacing early interferon treatments. The first of these, sofosbuvir, was approved on December 6, 2013. These drugs are marketed as \"cures;\" however, because they were approved on the basis of surrogate markers and not clinical endpoints such as prolonging life or improving liver health, many experts question their value.\nAfter blood screening began, a notable hepatitis C prevalence was discovered in Egypt, which claimed six million individuals were infected by unsterile needles in a late 1970s mass chemotherapy campaign to eliminate schistosomiasis (snail fever).\nOn October 5, 2020, Houghton and Alter, together with Charles M. Rice, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work.\nSociety and culture.\nWorld Hepatitis Day, held on July 28, is coordinated by the World Hepatitis Alliance. The economic costs of hepatitis C are significant both to the individual and to society. In the United States, the average lifetime cost of the disease was estimated at US$33,407 in 2003 with the cost of a liver transplant as of 2011[ [update]] costing approximately US$200,000. In Canada, the cost of a course of antiviral treatment is as high as 30,000 CAD in 2003, while the United States costs are between 9,200 and US$17,600 in 1998. In many areas of the world, people cannot afford treatment with antivirals as they either lack insurance coverage or their insurance will not pay for antivirals. In the English National Health Service treatment rates for hepatitis C were higher among less deprived groups in 2010\u20132012.\nHepatitis C\u2013infected Spanish anaesthetist Juan Maeso was jailed for the maximum possible period of 20 years for infecting 275 patients between 1988 and 1997, as he used the same needles to give both himself and the patients opioids.\nSpecial populations.\nChildren and pregnancy.\nCompared with adults, infection in children is much less understood. Worldwide, the prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in pregnant women and children has been estimated to be 1\u20138% and 0.05\u20135%, respectively. The vertical transmission rate has been estimated to be 3\u20135% and there is a high rate of spontaneous clearance (25\u201350%) in the children. Higher rates have been reported for both vertical transmission (18%, 6\u201336%, and 41%) and prevalence in children (15%).\nIn developed countries, transmission around the time of birth is now the leading cause of HCV infection. In the absence of the Hepatitis C virus in the mother's blood, transmission is rare. Factors associated with an increased rate of infection include membrane rupture of longer than 6 hours before delivery and procedures exposing the infant to maternal blood. Cesarean sections are not recommended. Breastfeeding is considered safe if the nipples are not damaged. Infection around the time of birth in one child does not increase the risk in a subsequent pregnancy. All genotypes appear to have the same risk of transmission.\nHCV infection is frequently found in children who have previously been presumed to have non-A, non-B hepatitis and cryptogenic liver disease. The presentation in childhood may be asymptomatic or with elevated liver function tests. While the infection is commonly asymptomatic, both cirrhosis with liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma may occur in childhood.\nImmunosuppressed.\nThe rate of hepatitis C in immunosuppressed people is higher. This is particularly true in those with human immunodeficiency virus infection, recipients of organ transplants, and those with hypogammaglobulinemia. Infection in these people is associated with an unusually rapid progression to cirrhosis. People with stable HIV who never received medication for HCV may be treated with a combination of peginterferon plus ribavirin with caution due to the possible side effects.\nResearch.\nAs of 2011[ [update]], there are about one hundred medications in development for hepatitis C. These include vaccines to treat hepatitis, immunomodulators, and cyclophilin inhibitors, among others. These potential new treatments have come about due to a better understanding of the hepatitis C virus. There are several vaccines under development and some have shown encouraging results.\nThe combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir in one trial (reported in 2015) resulted in cure rates of 99%. More studies are needed to investigate the role of the preventive antiviral medication against HCV recurrence after transplantation.\nAnimal models.\nOne barrier to finding treatments for hepatitis C is the lack of a suitable animal model. Despite moderate success, research highlights the need for pre-clinical testing in mammalian systems such as mouse, particularly to develop vaccines in poorer communities. Chimpanzees remain the only living system to study, yet their use has ethical concerns and regulatory restrictions. While scientists have used human cell culture systems such as hepatocytes, questions have been raised about their accuracy in reflecting the body's response to infection.\nOne aspect of hepatitis research is to reproduce infections in mammalian models. A strategy is to introduce liver tissues from humans into mice, a technique known as xenotransplantation. This is done by generating chimeric mice and exposing the mice to HCV infection. This engineering process is known to create humanized mice and provide opportunities to study hepatitis C within the 3D architectural design of the liver and evaluate antiviral compounds. Alternatively, generating inbred mice with susceptibility to HCV would simplify the process of studying mouse models.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term 'nations' to describe the descendants is a standard English translation of the Hebrew word \"goyim\", following the c. 400 CE Latin Vulgate's \"nationes\", and does not have the same political connotations that the word entails today.\nThe list of 70 names introduces for the first time several well-known ethnonyms and toponyms important to biblical geography, such as Noah's three sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from which 18th-century German scholars at the G\u00f6ttingen school of history derived the race terminology Semites, Hamites, and Japhetites. Certain of Noah's grandsons were also used for names of peoples: from Elam, Ashur, Aram, Cush, and Canaan were derived respectively the Elamites, Assyrians, Arameans, Cushites, and Canaanites. Likewise, from the sons of Canaan: Heth, Jebus, and Amorus were derived Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites. Further descendants of Noah include Eber (from Shem), the hunter-king Nimrod (from Cush).\nAs Christianity spread across the Roman Empire, it carried the idea that all human peoples were descended from Noah. However, not all Mediterranean and Near Eastern peoples were covered in the biblical genealogy; Iranic peoples such as Persians, Indic people such as Mitanni, and other prominent early civilizations such as the Ancient Greeks, Macedonians, and Romans, Hurrians, Iberians, Illyrians, Kassites, and Sumerians are missing, as well as the Northern and Western European peoples important to the Late Roman and Medieval world, such as the Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, and Nordic peoples; nor were others of the world's peoples, such as Native Americans, sub-Saharan Africans, Turkic and Iranic peoples of Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Far East, and Australasia. Scholars later derived a variety of arrangements to make the table fit, with for example the addition of Scythians, which do feature in the tradition, being claimed as the ancestors of much of Northern Europe.\nAccording to the biblical scholar Joseph Blenkinsopp, the 70 names in the list express symbolically the unity of humanity, corresponding to the 70 descendants of Israel that followed Jacob into Egypt in and the 70 elders of Israel who visit God with Moses at the covenant ceremony in Exodus .\nTable of Nations.\nOn the family pedigrees contained in the biblical pericope of Noah, Saadia Gaon (892\u2013942) wrote: \nThe Scriptures have traced the patronymic lineage of the seventy nations to the three sons of Noah, as also the lineage of Abraham and Ishmael, and of Jacob and Esau. The blessed Creator knew that men would find solace at knowing these family pedigrees, since our soul demands of us to know them, so that [all of] mankind will be held in fondness by us, as a tree that has been planted by God in the earth, whose branches have spread out and dispersed eastward and westward, northward and southward, in the habitable part of the earth. It also has the dual function of allowing us to see the multitude as a single individual, and the single individual as a multitude. Along with this, man ought to contemplate also on the names of the countries and of the cities [wherein they settled].\"\nMoses Maimonides, echoing the same sentiments, wrote that the genealogy of the nations contained in the Law has the unique function of establishing a principle of faith, how that, although from Adam to Moses there was no more than a span of two-thousand five hundred years, and the human race was already spread over all parts of the earth in different families and with different languages, they were still people having a common ancestor and place of beginning.\nOther Bible commentators observe that the Table of Nations is unique compared to other genealogies since it depicts a \"broad network of cousins\", with a \"shallow chain of brotherly relationships\". Meanwhile, the other genealogies focus on \"narrow chains of father-son relationships\".\nBook of Genesis.\nChapters 1\u201311 of the Book of Genesis are structured around five \"toledot\" statements (\"these are the generations of...\"), of which the \"generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth\" is the fourth. Events before the Genesis flood narrative, the central toledot, correspond to those after: the post-Flood world is a new creation corresponding to the Genesis creation narrative, and Noah had three sons who populated the world. The correspondences extend forward as well: there are 70 names in the Table, corresponding to the 70 Israelites who go down into Egypt at the end of Genesis and to the 70 elders of Israel who go up the mountain at Sinai to meet with God in Exodus. The symbolic force of these numbers is underscored by the way the names are frequently arranged in groups of seven, suggesting that the Table is a symbolic means of implying universal moral obligation. The number 70 also parallels Canaanite mythology, where 70 represents the number of gods in the divine clan who are each assigned a subject people, and where the supreme god El and his consort, Asherah, has the title \"Mother/Father of 70 gods\", which, due to the coming of monotheism, had to be changed, but its symbolism lived on in the new religion.\nThe overall structure of the Table is:\nThe overall principle governing the assignment of various peoples within the Table is difficult to discern: it purports to describe all humankind, but in reality restricts itself to the Egyptian lands of the south, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and the Ionian Greeks, and in addition, the \"sons of Noah\" are not organized by geography, language family or ethnic groups within these regions. The Table contains several difficulties: for example, the names Sheba and Havilah are listed twice, first as descendants of Cush the son of Ham (verse 7), and then as sons of Joktan, the great-grandsons of Shem, and while the Cushites are North African in verses 6\u20137 they are unrelated Mesopotamians in verses 10\u201314.\nThe date of composition of Genesis 1\u201311 cannot be fixed with any precision, although it seems likely that an early brief nucleus was later expanded with extra data. Portions of the Table itself 'may' derive from the 10th century BCE, while others reflect the 7th century BCE and priestly revisions in the 5th century BCE. Its combination of world review, myth and genealogy corresponds to the work of the Greek historian Hecataeus of Miletus, active c.\u2009520\u00a0BCE.\nBook of Chronicles.\nI Chronicles 1 includes a version of the Table of Nations from Genesis, but edited to make clearer that the intention is to establish the background for Israel. This is done by condensing various branches to focus on the story of Abraham and his offspring. Most notably, it omits Genesis 10:9\u201314, in which Nimrod, a son of Cush, is linked to various cities in Mesopotamia, thus removing from Cush any Mesopotamian connection. In addition, Nimrod does not appear in any of the numerous Mesopotamian King Lists.\nBook of Jubilees.\nThe Table of Nations is expanded upon in detail in chapters 8\u20139 of the Book of Jubilees, sometimes known as the \"Lesser Genesis,\" a work from the early Second Temple period. Jubilees is considered pseudepigraphical by most Christian and Jewish denominations but thought to have been held in regard by many of the Church Fathers. Its division of the descendants throughout the world are thought to have been heavily influenced by the \"Ionian world map\" described in \"the Histories\" of Herodotus, and the anomalous treatment of Canaan and Madai are thought to have been \"propaganda for the territorial expansion of the Hasmonean state\".\nSeptuagint version.\nThe Hebrew bible was translated into Greek in Alexandria at the request of Ptolemy II, who reigned over Egypt 285\u2013246 BCE. Its version of the Table of Nations is substantially the same as that in the Hebrew text, but with the following differences:\n1 Peter.\nIn the First Epistle of Peter, 3:20, the author says that eight righteous persons were saved from the Great Flood, referring to the four named males, and their wives aboard Noah's Ark not enumerated elsewhere in the Bible.\nSons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\nThe Genesis flood narrative tells how Noah and his three sons (Shem, Ham, and Japheth), together with their wives, were saved from the Deluge to repopulate the Earth.\nBased on an old Jewish tradition contained in the Aramaic Targum of pseudo-Jonathan ben Uzziel, an anecdotal reference to the \"Origines Gentium\" in has been passed down, and which, in one form or another, has also been relayed by Josephus in his \"Antiquities\", repeated in the Talmud, and further elaborated by medieval Jewish scholars, such as in works written by Saadia Gaon, Josippon, and Don Isaac Abarbanel, who, based on their own knowledge of the nations, showed their migratory patterns at the time of their compositions:\n\"The sons of Japheth are Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tuval, and Meshech and Tiras, while the names of their diocese are Africa proper, and Germania, and Media, and Macedonia, and Bithynia, and Moesia (var. Mysia) and Thrace. Now, the sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, and Rifath and Togarmah, while the names of their diocese are Asia, and Parthia and the 'land of the barbarians.' The sons of Javan were Elisha, and Tarshish, Kitim and Dodanim, while the names of their diocese are Elis, and Tarsus, Achaia and Dardania.\" ---\n\"The sons of \u1e24am are K\u016b\u0161, and Mi\u1e63rayim, and F\u016b\u1e6d (Phut), and Kena\u02bban, while the names of their diocese are Arabia, and Egypt, and El\u012b\u1e25er\u016bq and Canaan. The sons of K\u016b\u0161 are Seb\u0101 and \u1e24aw\u012blah and Savtah and Ra\u02bbamah and Savte\u1e2b\u0101, [while the sons of Ra\u02bbamah are \u0160ev\u0101 and Dedan]. The names of their diocese are called S\u012bn\u012brae, and H\u012bnd\u012bq\u012b, Samarae, L\u016bbae, Zin\u011fae, while the sons of Mauretinos are [the inhabitants of] Zemar\u011fad and [the inhabitants of] Meza\u011f.\" ---\n\"The sons of Shem are Elam, and Ashur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. [And the children of Aram are these: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.] Now, Arphaxad begat Shelah (Salah), and Shelah begat Eber. Unto Eber were born two sons, the one named Peleg, since in his days the [nations of the] earth were divided, while the name of his brother is Joktan. Joktan begat Almodad, who measured the earth with ropes; Sheleph, who drew out the waters of rivers; and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab, all of whom are the sons of Joktan.\" \nProblems with identification.\nBecause of the traditional grouping of people based on their alleged descent from the three major biblical progenitors (Shem, Ham, and Japheth) by the three Abrahamic religions, in former years there was an attempt to classify these family groups and to divide humankind into three races called Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid (originally named \"Ethiopian\"), terms which were introduced in the 1780s by members of the G\u00f6ttingen school of history. It is now recognized that determining precise descent-groups based strictly on patrilineal descent is problematic, as nations are not stationary. People are often multi-lingual and multi-ethnic, and people sometimes migrate from one country to another - whether voluntarily or involuntarily. Some nations have intermingled with other nations and can no longer trace their paternal descent, or have assimilated and abandoned their mother's tongue for another language. In addition, phenotypes cannot always be used to determine one's ethnicity because of interracial marriages. A nation today is defined as \"a large aggregate of people inhabiting a particular territory united by a common descent, history, culture, or language.\" The biblical line of descent is irrespective of language, place of nativity, or cultural influences, as all that is binding is one's patrilineal line of descent. For these reasons, attempting to determine precise blood relation of any one group in today's Modern Age may prove futile. Sometimes people sharing a common patrilineal descent spoke two separate languages, whereas, at other times, a language spoken by a people of common descent may have been learnt and spoken by multiple other nations of different descent.\nAnother problem associated with determining precise descent-groups based strictly on patrilineal descent is the realization that, for some of the prototypical family groups, certain sub-groups have sprung forth, and are considered diverse from each other (such as Ismael, the progenitor of the Arab nations, and Isaac, the progenitor of the Israelite nation, although both family groups are derived from Shem's patrilineal line through Eber. The total number of other sub-groups, or splinter groups, each with its distinct language and culture is unknown.\nEthnological interpretations.\nIdentifying geographically defined groups of people in terms of their biblical lineage, based on the Generations of Noah, has been common since antiquity. By the end of the 19th century, the influential German encyclopaedia, \"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\", divided humanity into three major races called \"Caucasoid\", \"Mongoloid\", and \"Negroid\", each comprising various sub-races. While the \"Hamites\" of northern Africa were seen as \"Caucasoid\", \"Australians\", \"Melanesians\", and \"Negritoes\" were seen as \"Negroid\" sub-races, although living outside the African continent. The only sub-races attributed to Africa were the \"African Negroes\" and the \"Hottentots\".\nThe early modern biblical division of the world's \"races\" into Semites, Hamites, and Japhetites was coined at the G\u00f6ttingen school of history in the late 18th century, in parallel with the color terminology for race which divided mankind into five \"colored\" races (\"Caucasian or White\", \"Mongolian or Yellow\", \"Aethiopian or Black\", \"American or Red\", and \"Malayan or Brown\").\nExtrabiblical sons of Noah.\nThere exist various traditions in post-biblical and talmudic sources claiming that Noah had children other than Shem, Ham, and Japheth who were born before the Deluge.\nAccording to the Quran (\"Hud\" 42\u201343), Noah had another unnamed son who refused to come aboard the Ark, instead preferring to climb a mountain, where he drowned. Some later Islamic commentators give his name as either \"Yam\" or \"Kan'an\".\nAccording to Irish mythology, as found in the \"Annals of the Four Masters\" and elsewhere, Noah had another son named Bith who was not allowed aboard the Ark, and who attempted to colonise Ireland with 54 persons, only to be wiped out in the Deluge.\nSome 9th-century manuscripts of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" assert that \"Sceafa\" was the fourth son of Noah, born aboard the Ark, from whom the House of Wessex traced their ancestry; in William of Malmesbury's version of this genealogy (c.\u20091120), Sceaf is instead made a descendant of \"Strephius\", the fourth son born aboard the Ark (\"Gesta Regnum Anglorum\").\nAn early Arabic work known as \"Kitab al-Magall\" \"Book of Rolls\" (part of Clementine literature) mentions \"Bouniter\", the fourth son of Noah, born after the flood, who allegedly invented astronomy and instructed Nimrod. Variants of this story with often similar names for Noah's fourth son are also found in the c. fifth century Ge'ez work \"Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan\" (\"Barvin\"), the c. sixth century Syriac book \"Cave of Treasures\" (\"Yonton\"), the seventh century \"Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius\" (\"Ionitus\"), the Syriac \"Book of the Bee\" 1221 (\"Y\u00f4nat\u00f4n\"), the Hebrew \"Chronicles of Jerahmeel\", c. 12th\u201314th century (\"Jonithes\"), and throughout Armenian apocryphal literature, where he is usually referred to as \"Maniton\"; as well as in works by Petrus Comestor c.\u20091160 (\"Jonithus\"), Godfrey of Viterbo 1185 (\"Ihonitus\"), Michael the Syrian 1196 (\"Maniton\"), Abu al-Makarim c.\u20091208 (\"Abu Nai\u0163ur\"); Jacob van Maerlant c.\u20091270 (\"Jonitus\"), and Abraham Zacuto 1504 (\"Yoniko\"). \nMartin of Opava (c.\u20091250), later versions of the \"Mirabilia Urbis Romae\", and the \"Chronica Boemorum\" of Giovanni de' Marignolli (1355) make Janus (the Roman deity) the fourth son of Noah, who moved to Italy, invented astrology, and instructed Nimrod.\nAccording to the monk Annio da Viterbo (1498), the Hellenistic Babylonian writer Berossus had mentioned 30 children born to Noah after the Deluge, including Macrus, Iapetus Iunior (Iapetus the Younger), Prometheus Priscus (Prometheus the Elder), Tuyscon Gygas (Tuyscon the Giant), Crana, Cranus, Granaus, 17 Tytanes (Titans), Araxa Prisca (Araxa the Elder), Regina, Pandora Iunior (Pandora the Younger), Thetis, Oceanus, and Typhoeus. However, Annio's manuscript is widely regarded today as having been a forgery.\nHistorian William Whiston stated in his book \"A New Theory of the Earth\" that Noah, who is to be identified with Fuxi, migrated with his wife and children born \"after\" the deluge to China, and founded Chinese civilization.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 113,777. Its county seat is Leonardtown. The name is in honor of Mary, the mother of Jesus. St. Mary's County is part of the Lexington Park, MD Metropolitan Statistical Area, which also is included in the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area. It is part of the Southern Maryland region.\nThe county was the home to the first Maryland Colony, and the first capital of the Colony of Maryland. Settled by English Catholics, it is considered to be the birthplace of religious freedom in North America, at a time when the British colonies were settled primarily by Protestants. The county is home to the Patuxent River Naval Air Station and St. Mary's College of Maryland. Traditionally, St. Mary's County has been known for its unique and historic culture of Chesapeake Bay tidewater farming, fishing, and crabbing communities. But with the advent of the military bases, growth of an extensive defense contractor presence, and the growth of St. Mary's College of Maryland, as well as increasing numbers of long-distance Washington, D.C. commuters, it has been undergoing a decades-long transformation which has seen the county's population double since 1970.\nHistory.\nSettlement.\nThe settlement of Lord Baltimore's Maryland began with the arrival of passengers from England at St. Clement's Island in the Potomac River in what is now southwestern St. Mary's County on March 25, 1634, and the annual anniversary of this landing is celebrated as \"Maryland Day\". The passengers arrived in two vessels, the \"Ark\" and the \"Dove\" that had set sail from the Isle of Wight on November 22, 1633. The county is the site of the first Catholic Mass celebrated in one of the original thirteen colonies (after they had become English colonies). Earlier dates of masses being said were during 1526\u20131527 at San Miguel de Gualdape.\nDue to the small size of the island and its lack of resources, there was no intention to make a permanent settlement on the island. Instead St. Clement's was used as a base for the settlers while scouting for a more suitable site. This was how a bluff overlooking the nearby St. Mary's River was chosen for numerous reasons, and became the site of the first permanent settlement. It would soon be named, \"St. Mary's City\".\nSt. Mary's City, Maryland is the site of the first Maryland Capitol and remained so for more than 50 years, until 1695, when the state capital was moved to Annapolis.\nToday Historic St. Mary's City is a major attraction in Maryland with four museums, a reconstructed colonial village, and the reconstructed Maryland Dove settlers ship. It also has become one of the top archeological research sites in North America.\nSt. Mary's County was the first county established in Maryland, in 1637, probably by an order of the governor.\nIn 1649, Lord Baltimore, with the Maryland General Assembly, passed the Maryland Toleration Act, which provided religious freedom for any (Christian) sect and which was the first law of its kind in the New World. There is a statue in St. Mary's City commemorating this event, along with extensive museums, a reconstructed Colonial town, living history actors, and a replica of the Maryland Dove.\nHistoric buildings.\nSt. Mary's County has some of the oldest extant buildings in English North America. Many of these properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. These buildings range through many historical periods, from the 1600s to the 1800s. There are notable buildings of the early twentieth century, as well.\nMemorial.\nThe United States Colored Troops Memorial Statue is a memorial to the more than 700 African-American soldiers and sailors from St. Mary's County who served among the Union forces during the American Civil War. The memorial site includes an educational display and special celebrations are held there each year.\nPolitics and government.\nIn presidential elections, St. Mary's County leans strongly toward the Republican Party. No Democrat has won the county since Jimmy Carter did so in 1976. In 2020, Donald Trump received the lowest percentage for a Republican candidate since Bob Dole in 1996.\nSt. Mary's County is governed by county commissioners, the traditional form of county government in Maryland.\nCounty executive.\nThe county commissioners exercise such executive powers as exist in the government of the county.\nLaw enforcement.\nSt. Mary's County has the oldest documented sheriff's office in Maryland and one of the oldest in the United States. In 1637, James Baldridge was appointed sheriff. Since 1776, sheriffs in St. Mary's County have been determined by election. Steven A. Hall is the current sheriff. He was sworn in on December 5, 2022.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (%) is water. It is the second-largest county in Maryland by total area.\nLocated on the St. Mary's Peninsula, St. Mary's County is largely bordered by water: the Patuxent River (northeast), the Chesapeake Bay (east), the Potomac River (southwest), and the Wicomico River (west). Its coastline has many coves, tidal creeks, bays, and inlets. Many coastal areas are made up of mixed clay-and-sand cliffs and bluffs, which protect many parts of the county from storm surges, however, there are low-lying coastal areas with coarse sand or gravel beaches or tidal marshlands, as well. The county has a tiny exclave on the other side of the Potomac river due to the Maryland-Virginia border cutting through a beach near the little wicomico river.\nThe interior of much of the county is hilly to varying degrees, with forests and agricultural fields. There also are coastal plain areas, much of which are under agriculture or under new development. Residential development has been increasing steadily for decades.\nThe county's very extensive waters are mostly brackish, ranging from significant degrees of saltwater in tidal areas that are on or near the Chesapeake Bay, to a greater predominance of freshwater and lower-salt-concentrations in its interior tidal waterways and also further up its bordering rivers.\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the county has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\".) According to the Trewartha climate classification, the climate is \"Cf\" or oceanic (\"Do\") depending on whether eight or seven months average above ,) respectively. Average monthly temperatures in Leonardtown range from 36.3\u00a0\u00b0F in January to 78.1\u00a0\u00b0F in July.\nAdjacent counties.\nSt. Mary's County borders Virginia, across the Potomac River. St. Mary's County waters also are bordered by Virginia's territorial waters in Potomac tributary mouths on the Virginia side, tidal interface zones, and the Chesapeake Bay. Sometimes, water rights in all of these areas are still disputed.\nCore-based statistical area.\nOver time, St. Mary's County has been within several core-based statistical areas, as delineated by the Office of Management and Budget. Since July 2023, the Lexington Park, MD Metropolitan Statistical Area has consisted of St. Mary's County and Calvert County. From 2013 to 2023, the California-Lexington Park, MD Metropolitan Statistical Area was coterminous with St. Mary's County, and prior to that, the Lexington Park, MD Micropolitan Statistical Area was conterminous with the county.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 105,151\u00a0people, 37,604\u00a0households, and 27,084\u00a0families residing in the county.

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 24,620, making it the second-least populous county in Maryland. The county seat is Princess Anne. The county is part of the Lower Eastern Shore region of the state.\nThe county was named for Mary, Lady Somerset, the wife of Sir John Somerset and daughter of Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour (c. 1560\u20131639). She was also the sister of Anne Calvert, Baroness Baltimore (1615\u20131649), who later lent her name to Anne Arundel County, which was erected in 1650 as the Province of Maryland's third county.\nSomerset County is located on the state's Eastern Shore. It is included in the Salisbury, MD-DE Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nThe University of Maryland Eastern Shore is located in Princess Anne.\nHistory.\nInitial settlements.\nSomerset County was settled and established by English colonists in part due to a response to the Province/Dominion of Virginia passing a law in 1659/1660 requiring Quakers in the colony to convert to Anglicanism or leave the colony. A group of Virginia Quakers living in Accomack County, Virginia, on the southern tip of what later became known as the Delmarva Peninsula, petitioned Charles Calvert, third Lord Baltimore in 1661 to migrate to the Eastern Shore of Maryland to the territory under his governance. The governor considered this an opportunity to fortify the borders of his territory on the Delmarva Peninsula against the pressing encroachment of the Virginians.\nThe Royal Charter that Lord Baltimore had received from King Charles I in 1632 had granted Maryland the land north of the entire length of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel. Later surveys authorized by Baltimore on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay indicated that the southern boundary would continue across the peninsula at the mouth of the Pocomoke River. It was marked on the north shore by a rock outcropping labelled as \"Watkins' Point\". The Virginian Quakers settled just north of that point, on the southern bank of the Annemessex River in November 1662, A separate group of Anglican Virginian settlers were granted permission to make another settlement, further north along the Manokin River.\nIn conjunction with the two new settlements, Lord Baltimore set up a three-man commission for the Eastern Shore territory, made up of two Marylanders and one Virginian. Its purpose was ostensibly to oversee the territory, found new settlements, and maintain a detailed recording of all land and civic transactions in the area. Lord Baltimore intended to use the commission to reinforce Maryland's claim to the area and to monitor any encroachments by Virginians.\nInvasion from Virginia.\nIn 1663, activists from Virginia persuaded the Virginia Assembly to declare that the Virginia-Maryland border was north of the Pocomoke Sound, at the mouth of the Wicomico River. The Assembly tried to secure the allegiance to Virginia of all settlers south of the Wicomico River\u00a0\u2013 including the Annemessex and Manokin settlements. In early October 1663, a militia from Accomac County, Virginia led by a Colonel Edmund Scarborough arrived at the Annemessex settlement. They attempted to secure oaths of allegiance under threat of arrest and property confiscation. Scarborough was also on a personal mission to arrest http:// (born on Isle of Wight, England and immigrated to Northampton, Virginia, 1643), the leader of the anti-tax movement and a vocal critic of the colonial government. He along with fellow Northampton County residents http://, http://, and http:// signed the \"https://\" 1651.\nScarborough and his force of 40 mounted men reached Horsey's new residence on October 11, 1663, and presented the Commands of the Assembly of Virginia against him. Horsey was \"arrested\" by Scarborough, but Horsey refused to accompany the party back to Virginia, declaring that he was going to remain in Maryland and maintain allegiance to the King and Lord Baltimore. The settlers expelled Scarborough and his force from the settlement. The company moved on to the Manokin Settlement, where they were received much more favorably. Although the Anglican settlers there were willing to swear allegiance to the Virginia colonial government, they were not willing to take any action against Lord Baltimore's government. Scarborough returned to Virginia without success in taking over southern Somerset County for Virginia.\nEarly county leaders.\nThe new settlers established a government for Somerset County, the eighth in the Province of Maryland; it was formed from the southern part of Kent County. This had been organized in 1642 as the Province's second county, encompassing the entire Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake. Horsey was selected to sit on the first county court, which administered the new county. Charles Calvert appointed Stephen Horsey on December 11, 1665, along with http://, William Stevens, George Johnson, John Winder, James Jones and Henry Boston. Horsey sat as a regular member of the Somerset County Court through the winter and spring of 1666. He traveled across the Chesapeake Bay in 1665 with Captain Thorne to meet with Charles Calvert, who swore them in as county commissioners. Horsey established himself as a nonconformist and someone willing to stand up for his beliefs.\nBoundary disputes with Delaware.\nCounty boundary disputes continued, including of the northern boundary. Baltimore believed his Eastern Shore territory extended to the top of the peninsula, where the Delaware River meets the Bay. In the 1680s, William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania, claimed this territory as his own, based on a conflicting deed. Penn, Baltimore, and their heirs began a protracted legal battle to determine the boundaries. Their compromise was to split the Delmarva Peninsula; however, they disagreed as to whether the boundary line should be drawn at the location of Cape Henlopen or at Fenwick Island. There were few settlers in the frontier on either side to take issue. That boundary would finally be settled in 1763 when surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon incorporated the Transpeninsular Line (Mason\u2013Dixon line) as the definitive boundary between Delaware and Maryland.\nSettlement growth.\nThe territory continued to attract new settlers, primarily from Virginia, and by 1666, the territory had met the requirements to become established as a county in the province with its own local government. On August 22, 1666, Lord Baltimore issued a proclamation establishing the new county, including the establishment of a complete civil and military organization. The proclamation established a sheriff and a military commander for the county, and five surveyors charged with laying out a highway to serve the county. In January 1667, the county administration laid out the five initial districts, designated as \"Hundreds\", into which the county would be divided. Additional hundreds were added as additional knowledge of the area was surveyed.\nReligious communities.\nSettlement of the county generally proceeded from the Chesapeake Bay eastward, and from old Accomack County northward. The original settlers in the first two settlements were Quakers and Anglicans; and both groups continued to grow from ongoing immigration from the northern portions of the Virginia colony. In the 1670s, Scottish and Irish Presbyterians began to immigrate to the county, some from Virginia, some from the British Isles. In December 1680, a prominent member of the county and professed Anglican, William Stevens of Rehoboth settlement, sent a request to the Presbytery of Laggan in northern Ireland to consider sending a Presbyterian minister to Somerset county; and the first Presbyterian (Reformed) minister, Reverend Francis Makemie, arrived in early 1683, quickly followed by a growing list of additional Irish Presbyterian ministers and missionaries. The towns of Rehoboth and Snow Hill along the Pocomoke River in the eastern (seaside) portion of Somerset County became Presbyterian centers in the county. The work of these Presbyterian ministers and missionaries eventually led to the organization of the Presbytery in Philadelphia in 1706, the forerunner of American Presbyterianism.\nIn 1689, the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688 in England resulted in the exile of the Roman Catholic King James II. After conquest by invasion, the Protestant Dutch rulers William of Orange-Nassau and Mary of Orange (James II's Protestant daughter) later became King William III, (1650\u20131702) and Queen Mary II. The \"Protestant Revolution\" of 1689 in Maryland overthrew the Roman Catholic government, resulting in the reversion of Lord Baltimore's proprietary charter. The Province was converted into a Royal colony (with a later government controlled by the king and his ministers). The capital was moved from the Catholic stronghold at St. Mary's City in southern Maryland to the more central, newly renamed Annapolis on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, opposite Kent Island.\nIn 1692, the Provincial General Assembly established the Church of England as the \"established church\" of the Province. This put pressure on the Quakers and Presbyterians, who were excluded from political office for a period. Their numbers in the county began a slow decline until the American Revolution.\nFor more than a century, the county and much of the colony were developed by planters, with the labor of enslaved Africans, for tobacco as a commodity crop. For many years they prospered, but tobacco exhausted the soil. By the early 19th century, after the American Revolutionary War, some planters turned to mixed farming. The Eastern Shore remained primarily rural and steeped in slave society culture. Other parts of Maryland had an increasing proportion of free people of color, and more than half the blacks in the state were free before the Civil War.\nConnection to Napoleon.\nAfter the defeat of the French Empire at the hands of the Seventh Coalition in July 1815, emperor Napoleon I sought to flee to the United States to escape imprisonment. According to local legends, Napoleon's brother, Jerome Bonaparte, had previously married Elizabeth Patterson, an American socialite from Baltimore, and through her the Bonapartes had connections to the American gentry, such as the King family in Beverly. According to the 1944 book 'Rivers of the Eastern Shore' by Hulbert Footner, Nicholas Girod, former Mayor of New Orleans, attempted to rescue Napoleon from his exile in British Saint Helena in 1821, the plan being to hide Napoleon in Beverly House in Princess Anne, Somerset County, before transporting him to Napoleon House in New Orleans once the hunt for him subsided. However, Napoleon died before the plot could go ahead.\nNative Americans.\nAs the English colonies expanded, they encroached on Native American land. The coastal areas were occupied primarily by Algonquian language-speaking tribes. The population of the latter decreased, due to disease, warfare and social disruption. Some of the tribes migrated west to the Ohio River Valley or joined with neighboring tribes to the north, such as the Lenape.\nSome of the descendants of the tribes of Maryland remained. They intermarried with colonists, including white indentured servants, and African and African-American enslaved workers. Children of Native American mothers were generally absorbed and grew up in their culture, even if mixed-race. The Catholic Church recorded Native American families in southern Maryland. In the late 20th century, many groups of Native American began to reorganize, noting their community continuity. Several tribes have been recognized by the state.\nSubsequent counties.\nAfter the Dutch Anglo war, the Dutch Republic lost their North American lands along the North &amp; South Rivers (that is, along the Hudson &amp; the Delaware). The Dutch colony (2 miles X 20 miles) along the Delaware Bay, became Durham County Maryland, With the county seat being Lewes, 1665 until 1669. In 1669 it became part of Somerset County until 1683 when it given to William Penn.\nIn 1742, Worcester County to the east and the ocean, was organized as the thirteenth county of Maryland by separation from Somerset County. By 1867, portions of Somerset and Worcester counties were ceded to create a 22nd jurisdiction, Wicomico County. (The state in 1872 created a 23rd and final county in the far mountainous west, named Garrett.)\nThe county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (48%) is water.\nState protected area.\nThe State of Maryland Deal Island Wildlife Management Area, a protected area, is in the northwest quadrant of the county.

In 2012, it was one of only a handful of Southern counties to switch from the Republican McCain to the Democratic Obama, though in 2016 it swung strongly in favor of Donald Trump. In 2020, Somerset shifted even more toward Trump, the only county in Maryland to trend this way, in spite of Maryland as a whole voting more Democratic; Biden won Talbot and Frederick counties, two counties that were formerly solidly Republican in presidential elections. It has the longest streak of voting for every incumbent president seeking re-election; it has done so since at least 1980. If Gerald Ford, who was never elected president, is not counted as an incumbent, this streak can be traced back to 1948 (Trump in 2020, Obama in 2012, Bush in 2004, Clinton in 1996, H.W. Bush in 1992, Reagan in 1984, Carter in 1980, Nixon in 1972, Johnson in 1964, and Eisenhower in 1956).\nCounty commissioners.\nSomerset County is governed by county commissioners, the traditional form of county government in Maryland. Somerset County Commissioners are elected to four-year terms; all current commissioners' terms will expire in 2022.\nSheriffs.\nStephen Horsey was appointed by the Governor of Maryland as the first sheriff of Somerset County on August 22, 1666, and the Somerset County Sheriff's Office celebrated its 300th anniversary in 2011. The current sheriff is Ronald Howard (Republican), who has been serving as sheriff since 2014.\nCommunities.\nCensus-designated places.\nThe Census Bureau recognizes the following census-designated places (CDPs) in the county:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnincorporated communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "71508", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71508", "title": "Talbot County, Maryland", "text": "County in Maryland, United States\nTalbot County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2020 census, the population was 37,526. Its county seat is Easton. The county was named for Lady Grace Talbot, the wife of Sir Robert Talbot, an Anglo-Irish statesman, and the sister of Lord Baltimore. The county is part of the Mid-Eastern Shore region of the state.\nTalbot County comprises the Easton, MD Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Washington\u2013Baltimore\u2013Arlington, DC\u2013MD\u2013VA\u2013WV\u2013PA Combined Statistical Area.\nTalbot County is bordered by Queen Anne's County to the north, Caroline County to the east, Dorchester County to the south, and the Chesapeake Bay to the west.\nHistory.\nThe founding date of Talbot County is not known. It existed by February 12, 1661, when a writ was issued to its sheriff. It was initially divided into nine hundreds and three parishes: St. Paul's, St. Peter's and St. Michael's.\nIn 1667, the first Meeting of Commissions was held in a home on the Skipton Creek near the town of York. The town of York was vacated once the courthouse was planned to be built on Armstrongs Old Field in 1709 near Pitts' Bridge. The new courthouse designated because York was too far north in the county once Queen Anne's County received their charter and was lopped off of Talbot County. Pitts' Bridge was just north of the Quaker Meeting House, but most importantly, it faced the Indian trail (Washington Street \u2013 Easton).\nAfter the American Revolutionary War in 1786, Act to Assemble in Annapolis appointed John Needles to survey and \"to erect a town in Talbot County to be called Talbottown\"\u2014laying out a town around then existing court house with 118 number parcels of land and designated streets, alleys and lanes. Talbottown was to be known as the county seat of Easton. Another act was passed in 1789 to build a larger courthouse on the site of the old one. This court house was completed in 1794 and today parts of it still stand today inside of the present court house.\nLt. Col. Tench Tilghman, Gen. George Washington's aide-de-camp, was born on Fausley in Talbot County on December 25, 1744. He died on April 18, 1786, and is buried in Oxford, Maryland.\nFounding Father John Dickinson was born in Trappe in 1732. The abolitionist Frederick Douglass was born into slavery near Tuckahoe Creek around 1817 or 1818.\nThe first established hospital on the Eastern Shore was near McDaniel at Dr. Absolom Thompson farm, the old Mary's Delight Farm.\nThe county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGreat Seal symbology.\nThe Great Seal of Talbot County was adopted on July 26, 1966. The design reflects the Talbot coat of arms, chosen due to the county's namesake, Grace Talbot, daughter of George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore.\nThe seal features a rampant lion gules on a silver shield. Its background is purpure, a color assigned to Talbot County in 1694 by Maryland's royal governor, Sir Francis Nicholson. It bears the inscription, \"The Great Seal of Talbot County Maryland\" along the edge. Below the lion is the Latin motto, \"Tempus Praeteritum Et Futurum\", meaning \"Times, Past and Future.\"\nHistorical sites and monuments.\nThird Haven Meeting House.\nThe Third Haven Meeting House of Society of Friends was built in 1682 by Quakers. After Charles I was executed in England in 1649, then Virginia governor Berkley, who sympathized with the Royalists, drove Quakers out of Virginia for their religious beliefs. Lord Baltimore invited the refugees to Maryland Province to settle, and passed the Toleration Act. John Edmondson gave the Quakers land on which to settle near the Tred Avon River in what later became Easton, Maryland. The Meeting House sits on high ground surrounded by 3 wooded acres and is positioned along the Indian Trail (today known as Washington Street). George Fox, father of the Quaker movement visited several times. Upon his death, Third Haven Meeting House received his personal library and collection. The Third Haven Meeting House may be the oldest framed building for religious meeting in The United States. According to tradition, Lord Baltimore attended a sermon given there by William Penn.\nIn 1794, the rafters were extended on one side of the ridgepole. While this extension made more room inside the meeting house, it also made the building look lopsided. In 1879, a new Third Haven Meeting House was constructed out of brick, and still remains in use today. The ground floor now contains meeting rooms, and Sunday School is held on the second floor.\nSt. Joseph Roman Catholic Church.\nSt. Joseph Roman Catholic Church, which still holds weekly masses, is recognized as the oldest Roman Catholic Church on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Father Joseph Mosely, a Jesuit, established the church in 1765 on a farm north of Easton in Cordova. St. Joseph Church was the second Catholic Church in Talbot County; a chapel at Doncaster was the first.\nThe church had additions built in 1845 and in 1903 (the cloverleaf apse at the left where the altar is now). Father Mosley and other priests are buried under the church floor.\nSt. Joseph Church hosts an annual jousting tournament on the first Wednesday of August. The event has been held at St. Joseph for the past 142 years. The only time the event was canceled was in 1918, due to many of the riders' involvement in World War I.\nLongwoods School House.\nLongwoods School House or The Little Red School House is located on Longwoods Road (Route 662) just north of Easton. Longwoods School House is one of the few remaining one-room schoolhouses on the Eastern Shore. The school opened in 1865 with an average class size of about 30, and held its last class in 1967. It once had two outhouses: one for the boys and one for the girls, separated by a fence. Indoor plumbing was introduced in 1957 and electricity in 1936.\nThe Talbot Historical Society restored the schoolhouse to it original form, removing the electrical lights and the modern plumbing and added the outhouse to the back of the building.\nPoplar Island.\nPopeley Island (later Poplar Island) was one of Talbot County's first islands that was given a name and location on a map. Popeley Island was given its name by Captain William Claibourne after Lt. Richard Popeley. Popeley Island was the first land to be settled in 1632 by Captain William Claibourne. The first fields were planted in Talbot County on Popeley Island in 1634, and in 1635 Claibourne granted the whole island to his cousin Richard Thompson. During the summer of 1637, while Thompson was off the island on an expedition, Native Americans, the Nanticoke tribe, massacred Thompson's whole family and workers. Through the 1700s the name changed spelling from Popeleys to Poples to Poplar. Thompson went back to Virginia and never came back to his island. In 1654 Thomas Hawkins acquired Poplar Island and sold half to Seth Foster, Tilghman Island\u2019s founding father. Poplar Island is only accessible by boat today and is currently being rebuilt by the Army Corps of Engineers.\nWhite Marsh Church.\nIn 1691, King William and Queen Mary appointed Sir Lionel Copely as the first royal governor and told him that the colonists needed to become more religious. The Establishment Act of 1692 divided Talbot County into three parishes to serve the Church of England, and Old White Marsh was one of them. The location of the church was to be in Hambleton, with the decision based upon the trade routine of the time. It was between the two ports in Oxford and Dover (small town on the Choptank near where Dover Bridge today sits).\nThe original church is believed to have been built between 1662 and 1665; however, the first mention of the church is in 1690, although the Talbot County Court House has a record of repair made to the road to Old White Marsh Church in 1687.\nIn 1751, repairs were made to the church, and it was doubled in size due to the fact the membership was so large. Reverend Thomas Bacon was the cause of the large membership. Reverend Bacon was the writer of the Bacon's Laws. Membership decreased when Reverend Bacon left to assume leadership of Maryland's largest parish (at that time), All Saints Church in Frederick, Maryland, and services alternated between White Marsh and the new Christ Church in the growing county seat of Easton. Services finally ended at White Marsh, and the church was abandoned after it burned in brush fire during a cleanup operation in 1897. A few of the original items used at the church rest at the St. Paul's Church in Trappe: White Marsh's Bible, communion items and the old wooden alms box. The remaining brick wall can still be seen from U.S. Route 50 between Trappe and Easton.\nThe first rector, Reverend Daniel Maynadier, and his wife are buried in the floor of the church. Robert Morris Sr., merchant and father of founding father Robert Morris, is buried just outside the church to the left. Plaques show the graves of all three individuals.\nTalbot Boys monument.\nFrom 1916 to 2022, a statue honoring the Talbot County men who fought in the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War stood in front of the Talbot County Courthouse. The statue depicted a young boy holding and wrapped in a Confederate flag, and bears the inscription: \"To the Talbot Boys \u00b7 1861\u20131865 \u00b7 C.S.A.\". Talbot County also had over 300 Union soldiers in the war, but there has never been a monument to them.\nLike other Confederate monuments installed during the Jim Crow era, the monument drew increased opposition in the 21st century by those opposed to honoring the Confederacy and its defense of slavery. In 2015, the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter proposed removing the statue, but the County Council unanimously voted to keep it in place. In June 2020, a lengthy series of letters to the editor of \"The Talbot Spy\", a local newspaper, was published, all arguing for the removal of the statue. In August 2020, after the George Floyd protests led to a new wave of removals of Confederate monuments, the County Council voted down 3:2 a resolution to remove the statue, triggering loud public protests.\nBy 2021, the statue was the only remaining Confederate statue on public grounds in Maryland. In May 2021, the ACLU sued the county in federal court to demand its removal. In September 2021, the County Council voted 3:2 to remove the statue. It was removed on March 14, 2022, and relocated to the Cross Keys battlefield in Harrisonburg, Virginia, under the control of the nonprofit Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation.\nFrederick Douglass monument.\nNear the Talbot Boys monument, a statue of the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, born into slavery near Tuckahoe Creek, stands in front of the courthouse. Douglass had been held in jail at the rear of the courthouse after his aborted attempt to escape slavery on April 2, 1836.\nThe Douglass statue was proposed by the Talbot Historical Society in 2002. The County Council approved it in 2004, after some local opposition, with a majority of one vote. It did so on the condition that its height not exceed that of the Talbot Boys monument.\nOld Wye Church.\nA chapel of ease near the Wye River was likely built soon after the creation of Saint Paul's Parish in Centreville by the act of establishment of 1692. The present brick church of Georgian design was built between 1717 and 1721 by William Elbert. Altered in the mid-nineteenth century, the chapel was restored in Georgian Revival style in 1947-49 by the firm Perry, Shaw, and Hepburn (who also directed much of the early restoration of Colonial Williamsburg). The church is actively used today, one of two churches in Wye Parish. Old Wye Church (or Saint Luke's Church) is the oldest surviving brick church in Talbot County.\nEconomy.\nTalbot County is an important tourism hub with a historic, evolving maritime economy. It is the epicenter for financial services in the Eastern Shore region, with the fourth-largest bank in the state, Shore United Bank, headquartered in Easton. In 2028, the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health Center will open in Easton, making the county a regional healthcare hub.\nCap on tax revenue.\nTalbot County offers the lowest\nreal property tax rate in the state, the second lowest income tax rate, and no taxes on corporate income, sales, or business personal property. The tax revenue cap is one of the most restrictive in the state, making it extremely difficult to raise sufficient funds for certain initiatives, including key public safety projects and public schools. This has led to several local ballot measures in recent years.\nIn 1996, Talbot County voters approved a ballot measure to place a cap on income and property taxes.\nSince 2012, Talbot has exceeded the charter limitations on local property taxes to fund the approved budget of the local boards of education.\nIn 2018, Talbot County proposed temporarily overriding the property tax cap to raise $1.1 million in non-recurring education funds. Voters rejected the amendment.\nIn 2020, Talbot County voters amended a charter to temporarily raise residents' property taxes to fund public safety measures, with 59.5% in favor.\nIn 2024, Talbot County voters amended the charter to extend the temporary increase from 2020, with 50.93% in favor.\nPolitics and government.\nTalbot County was granted a charter form of government in 1973. The Talbot County Council has five members elected to four-year terms. The council president and vice president are elected yearly. As of 2022[ [update]] the current council president is Chuck Callahan (R), and the County Manager is Clay B. Stamp. The current sheriff is Joe Gamble.\nIn the years following the Civil War, Talbot was a swing county, divided between Unionists and Secessionists. Although it voted Democratic at every election between 1908 and 1924, it later took decisive steps towards the Republican Party. It surpassed Garrett County as the state's most Republican county in 1976. Barack Obama came within ten percentage points of reclaiming the county in 2008.\nIn 2020, Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry Talbot County since Lyndon Johnson's 1964 landslide and the second since Franklin Roosevelt in 1936. In the 2022 Maryland elections, Democratic governor Wes Moore and Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen also carried Talbot county while winning statewide. In 2024, Republican Donald Trump flipped back Talbot County, winning it by just 6 votes, the closest county in the whole nation.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (44%) is water. It is the third-smallest county in Maryland by land area.\nMajor highways.\nU.S. Route 50 is the largest highway serving Talbot County.\nRivers and creeks.\nThe Choptank River takes its name from a tribe of Algonquian-speaking Indians who inhabited both shores of this stream before its settlement by the English.\nTalbot County\u2019s Miles River was originally named St. Michael\u2019s River. In colonial times all grants of land from the Lords Baltimore were in the shape of leases subject to small and nominal ground rents, reserved by the Proprietary, and payable annually at Michaelmas, the Feast of St. Michael and All Angels. In the calendar of the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches this is observed on September 29. Because of this association, St. Michael was considered to be the patron saint of colonial Maryland, and as such was honored by the river being named for him. A large colony of Quakers were among the earliest settlers in Talbot County; as they had no reverence for saints, they persisted in dropping the word saint and calling the river Michaels River. It gradually became known as Miles.\nAs early as 1667, six years after the laying out of Talbot County, references to these names are found in the Proceedings of the Provincial Council of Maryland. A commission was issued by Charles Calvert, Esq., Captain General of all the forces within the Province of Maryland, to George Richard as captain of 10 troops of horse to march out of \"Choptanck and St. Miles rivers in Talbot County, aforesaid upon any expedition against any Indian enemy whatsoever,\" etc. At the same time, a similar commission was issued to Hopkin Davis, as Captain of foot in Choptanck and St. Miles rivers.\nWye River, which forms the northern boundary of Talbot County, was named by Edward Lloyd, a Welsh immigrant who took up large tracts of land along its southern shores before the laying out of Talbot County. He named it for the River Wye, noted for its sinuosity, whose source is near that of the River Severn, near a mountain in Wales. He named his homestead Wye House, which was owned by nine generations of Lloyds.\nTred Avon River is a corruption of \"Third Haven\", as the Third Haven Meeting House was built at the river's headwaters in 1682. \"Third Haven\" may be a corruption of \"Thread Haven\", an early name for the first port established at what is now Oxford, Maryland\nOf the thirteen Eastons in England, the most important town of that name is situated about from the head of the Lower Avon. The seat of Talbot County, located from the headwaters of Tred Avon River, changed its name from Talbot Court House to Easton in 1788 following the American Revolutionary War, as a reference to the English town. In colonial days, many merchant vessels traded between Oxford and Bristol, England, near which Easton is located.

With roots in the 16th century, British Israelism was inspired by several 19th century English writings such as John Wilson's 1840 \"Our Israelitish Origin\". From the 1870s onward, numerous independent British Israelite organizations were set up throughout the British Empire as well as in the United States; as of the early 21st century, a number of these organizations are still active. In the United States, the idea gave rise to the Christian Identity movement.\nThe central tenets of British Israelism have been regarded as pseudoscientific and refutable by archaeological, ethnological, genetic, and linguistic research by mainstream sources.\nHistory.\nEarliest recorded expressions.\nAccording to Brackney (2012) and Fine (2015), the French Huguenot magistrate M. le Loyer's \"The Ten Lost Tribes\", published in 1590, provided one of the earliest expressions of the belief that the Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Scandinavian, Germanic, and associated peoples are the direct descendants of the Old Testament Israelites. Anglo-Israelism has also been attributed to King James VI and I (1566\u20131625), who is reported to have believed he was the King of Israel. Adriaan van Schrieck (1560\u20131621), who influenced Henry Spelman (1562\u20131641) and John Sadler (1615\u201374), wrote in the early 17th century about his ideas on the origins of the Celtic and Saxon peoples. In 1649, Sadler published \"Rights of the Kingdom\", \"which argues for an 'Israelite genealogy for the British people'\".\nAspects of British Israelism and its influences have also been traced to Richard Brothers, who published \"A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophecies and Times\" in 1794, John Wilson's \"Our Israelitish Origin\" (1844), and John Pym Yeatman's \"The Shemetic Origin of the Nations of Western Europe\" (1879).\nFoundation.\nBritish Israelism arose in England, and then spread to the United States. Its adherents cite various supposedly-medieval manuscripts to claim an older origin, but British Israelism appeared as a distinct movement in the early 1880s:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although scattered British Israel societies are known to have existed as early as 1872, there was at first no real move to develop an organization beyond the small groups of believers which had arisen spontaneously. The beginnings of the movement as an identifiable religious force can, therefore, be more accurately placed in the 1880s, when the circumstances of the time were particularly propitious for the appearance of a movement so imperialistically-orientated.\nPeak of adherence to British Israelism \u2013 late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nThe extent to which the British clergy became aware of the existence of the movement may be gauged by the comment which Cardinal John Henry Newman (1801\u20131890) made when he was asked why he had left the Church of England in 1845 in order to join the Roman Catholic Church. He said that there was a very real danger that the movement \"would take over the Church of England.\"\nIn the late 19th century, Edward Hine, Edward Wheler Bird, and Herbert Aldersmith developed the British Israelite movement. Hine and Bird achieved a degree of \"doctrinal coherence\" by eliminating competing forms of the ideology: in 1878, the Anglo-Ephraim Association of London, which followed Wilson by accepting the broader community of western European Germanic peoples as fellow Israelites who were also favoured by God, was absorbed into Bird's Metropolitan Anglo-Israel Association, which espoused the Anglo-exclusive view promoted by Hine.\nBy 1886, the \"Anglo-Israel Association\" had 27 affiliated groups throughout Britain. Hine later departed for the United States, where he promoted the movement.\nThe 1906 edition of the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" stated that British Israelism's adherents \"are said to number 2,000,000 in England and the United States\", an unreliable figure if association membership and journal subscription numbers are any guide; the number of passive Protestant sympathisers is almost impossible to determine.\nBetween 1899 and 1902, members of the British-Israel Association of London dug up parts of the Hill of Tara in the belief that the Ark of the Covenant was buried there, doing much damage to one of Ireland's most ancient royal and archaeological sites. At the same time, British Israelism became associated with various pseudo-archaeological pyramidology theories, such as the notion that the Pyramid of Khufu contained a prophetic numerology of the British peoples.\nIn 1914, the thirty-fourth year of its publication, the \"Anglo-Israel Almanack\" listed the details of a large number of Kingdom Identity Groups which were operating independently throughout the British Isles as well as in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and the United States of America.\nIn 1919, the British-Israel-World Federation (BIWF) was founded in London, and Covenant Publishing was founded in 1922. William Pascoe Goard was the first director of the publishing house. During this time, several prominent figures patronized the BIWF organization and its publisher; Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone was its Patron-in-chief prior to World War II. One of its highest-profile members was William Massey, then Prime Minister of New Zealand. Due to the expansive nature of the British Empire, believers in British Israelism spread worldwide and the BIWF expanded its organization to the British Commonwealth. Howard Rand promoted the teaching, and he became the National Commissioner of the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America in 1928. He published \"The Bulletin\", later renamed \"The Messenger of the Covenant\". More recently, it was renamed \"Destiny\".\nA prolific author on British Israelism during the later 1930s and 40s was Alexander James Ferris.\nContemporary movement.\nThe BIWF continues to exist, with its main headquarters in Bishop Auckland, County Durham. It also has chapters in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and South Africa.\nIn 1968, one source estimated that there were between 3,000 and 5,000 British Israelists in Britain. There, a few small Pentecostal churches have taught British Israelism.\nThe post-Imperial era brought about a change in orientation for British Israelists, reflected in a corresponding change in the social class to which their membership predominantly belonged. During the years of its initial growth, it could depend on the spread of Christian fundamentalism within the country, the emotional appeal of imperialism, and a belief in the unrivaled power of the British economy to expand a middle-class membership that viewed it as the divine duty of the nation, as God's chosen people, to rule and civilize the world. By the mid-20th century, the dissipation of these factors changed the focus of the movement to one troubled by social and moral decline, including the degradation of class distinctions and of monarchical absolutism. Societal changes were viewed as portents of a coming apocalypse and as indications that the nation was in need of redemption. A fantasized society which practiced Victorian moral rectitude and imperialism, lacked socialism, bureaucrats, intellectuals, and income tax, would now come to be viewed by the movement which drew its support from the well-to-do as the ideal that modern British society should emulate.\nTenets.\nMost Israelites are not Jews.\nAdherents believe that the Twelve Tribes of Israel are the twelve sons of the patriarch Jacob (who was later named Israel). Jacob elevated the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh (the two sons of Joseph) to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the Tribe of Joseph.\nA division occurred among the twelve tribes in the days of Jeroboam and Rehoboam, with the three tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and, in part, Levi, forming the Kingdom of Judah, and the remaining ten tribes forming the Kingdom of Israel (Samaria). Thus, they argue, \"the great bulk of Israelites are not the Jews\". W. E. Filmer, writing in 1964, suggested that the fact that some Jews continue to search for the Ten Lost Tribes implies that their representatives are not found among modern-day multi-ethnic Jews. A number of British Israelites quote Josephus in order to support their claim that the lost tribes of Israel are not Jews: \"the entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country; wherefore there are but two tribes in Asia and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond the Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude.\"\nThe British are the descendants of the Lost Tribes.\nThe key component of British Israelism is its representation of the migrations of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. Adherents suggested that the Scythians, Cimmerians, and Goths were representatives of these lost tribes, and the progenitors of the later invaders of Britain. John Wilson would argue for the inclusion of all Western European Gothic peoples among the descendants of the Israelites, but under the later influence of Edward Hine, the movement would come to view only the peoples of the British Isles as having this ancestry.\nHerodotus reported that the ancient Persians called all of the Scythians \"Sacae\", but they called themselves \"Scoloti\". However, a modern comparison of the forms which are given in other ancient languages suggests that \"Skuda\" was their name. Ancient writers, such as Josephus and Jerome would associate the Scythians with the peoples of Gog and Magog, but British Israelist etymologists would see in \"Sacae\" a name derived from the biblical \"Isaac\", claiming that the appearance of the Scythians where they claimed the Lost Tribes were last documented also supported a connection. Further, British Israelists find support in the superficial resemblance between King Jehu's pointed headdress and that of the captive Saka king seen to the far right on the Behistun Rock. They continued the chain of etymological identification leading from Isaac to the \"Sacae\" to the Saxons (interpreted as \"Sac's sons\" \u2013 the sons of Isaac), who are portrayed as invading England from Denmark, the 'land of the Tribe of Dan'. They saw the same tribal name, left by the wanderers, in the Dar\"dan\"elles, the \"Dan\"ube, Mace\"don\"ia, \"Dun\"kirk, \"Dun\"glow in Ireland, \"Dun\"dee in Scotland, Swe\"den\", and Lon\"don\", and ascribed to this lost tribe the mythical Irish \"Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann\". In the name of the British they see \"berith\"ish, referring to the Hebrew covenant with God.\nBede (died 735) had linked the Picts to the Scythians, but British Israelists suggested that he had confused the two tribes of Scotland, and that it was the \"Scotti\" (Scots) who were one with the \"Scoloti\" (Scyths) of Herodotus. They drew particular support from the derivation of the Scots from the Scythians found in the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath, reflecting a tradition related in the 9th-century \"Historia Brittonum\" that the Scots descended from the union of a Scythian exile with Scota, daughter of a Pharaoh, a tale found in some form in several other early-14th-century historical and poetic sources. The Declaration begins:\n\"Most Holy Father and Lord, we know and from the chronicles and books of the ancients we find that among other famous nations our own, the Scots, has been graced with widespread renown. They journeyed from Greater Scythia by way of the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Pillars of Hercules, and dwelt for a long course of time in Spain among the most savage tribes, but nowhere could they be subdued by any race, however barbarous. Thence they came, twelve hundred years after the people of Israel crossed the Red Sea, to their home in the west where they still live today.\"\nBritish-Israel Associations cite the Declaration as evidence for the link between the Scots and the Scythians, and hence the Lost Tribes, as had been proposed by the early British Israelist etymologists.\nOther Celtic invaders would be given an analogous descent. In the Welsh (\"Cymry\") the British Israelists would see a direct connection through the Cimbri to the Cimmerians, the \"Gimirri\" of Assyrian annals, a name sometimes also given by the ancient Babylonians to the Scythians and Saka. Perceived similarity between this and the name by which the Assyrian annals referred to Israel, \"Bit Khumri\", would lead the British Israelists to claim that the Welsh too were members of the Lost Tribes.\nAccording to the Anglo-Israelists, these claimed connections would make the British the literal descendants of the Lost Tribes, and thus inheritors of the promises made to the Israelites in the Old Testament.\nThe British throne is a continuation of the Davidic throne.\nSome adherents further claim that the British royal family is of lineal descent from the house of King David via a daughter of Zedekiah, the last king of Judah. According to this legend, the prophet Jeremiah, and his scribe, Baruch, escaped with \"the king's daughters\" (Jer. 41:10; 43:6) to Egypt. They later travelled to Ireland, where one of the surviving Judahite princesses, Tea Tephi, married a local High King of Ireland. From this fabled union the Davidic throne was supposedly preserved, having been transferred to Ireland, then Scotland, and later England, whence the British monarchs are alleged to have descended. The Stone of Scone, which has been used in the coronations of Scottish, English, and British monarchs for centuries, is traditionally claimed to be the pillow stone on which the biblical patriarch, Jacob, slept, and the stone used in David's coronation.\nBritain and the United States are the inheritors of Jacob's birthright.\nA commonly held British-Israel doctrine is the belief that the Tribe of Ephraim and the Tribe of Manasseh can be identified as modern day Britain and the United States of America.\nPart of the foundation of the British-Israel doctrine is the theological claim that particular blessings were bestowed upon three of the tribes of Israel, in that the Tribe of Judah was to be the 'chief ruler' e.g. King David, and Ephraim was to receive the birthright (See Jacob and Esau). Adherents believe that these blessings have continued down through the ages to modern times, with the British Monarchy being identified as the continued blessing upon Judah, and both Britain (Ephraim) and the USA (Manasseh) as recipients of the national birthright blessing. They cite passages such as 1 Chron 5:1\u20132 and Gen 48:19\u201320 in order to support their claim.\nClaims and criticism.\nBritish Israelism has been criticized for its poor research and scholarship. In the 1910 edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,\" an article which summarizes the theology of British Israelism contains the statement that: \"The theory [of British-Israelism] rests on premises which are deemed by scholars\u2014both theological and anthropological\u2014to be utterly unsound\". Current scholarship is not consistent with the claims of British Israelism, with scholars drawing attention to its \"historical and linguistic inaccuracies\" in addition to its links to antisemitism. Hale (2015) refers to \"the overwhelming cultural, historical, and genetic evidence against it.\"\nResearch standards.\nCritics of British Israelism note that the arguments which are presented by promoters of the teaching are based on unsubstantiated and highly speculative, amateur research. Tudor Parfitt, author of \"The Lost Tribes: The History of a Myth\", states that the proof cited by adherents of British Israelism is \"of a feeble composition even by the low standards of the genre.\"\nHistorical linguistics.\nSome proponents of British Israelism have claimed that numerous links exist between historical linguistics, Ancient Hebrew, and various European place names and languages. This can be traced to the works of John Wilson in the 19th century. The self-trained Wilson looked for similarities in the sounds of words and argued that many Scottish, British, and Irish words stemmed from ancient Hebrew words. Wilson's publications inspired the development of British Israel language associations in Europe.\nModern scholarly linguistic analysis conclusively shows that the languages of the British Isles (English, Welsh, and Gaelic) belong in the Indo-European language family, while Hebrew belongs in the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family. In 1906, T. R. Lounsbury stated that \"no trace of the slightest real connection can be discovered\" between English and ancient Hebrew, while in 1993 Michael Friedman refuted claims that Hebrew was closely related to Celtic and Anglo-Saxon when he wrote that \"the actual evidence could hardly be any weaker\".\nOthers have addressed the specific word relationships proposed. Russell Spittler (1973) says of the \"disputable\" etymological claims made by the British Israelists that they \"have no ample basis in linguistic scholarship and are based on coincidences only.\" William Ingram (1995) would present arguments made by British Israelism as examples of \"tortured etymology\".\nScriptural interpretation.\nAdherents of British Israelism cite various scriptures in support of the argument that the \"lost\" Northern Israelite Tribes migrated through Europe to end up in Britain. Dimont (1933) argues that British Israelists misunderstand and misinterpret the meaning of these scriptures.\nOne such case is the distinction that British Israelists make between the \"Jews\" of the Southern Kingdom and the \"Israelites\" of the Northern Kingdom. They believe that the Bible consistently distinguishes the two groups. Dimont says that many of these scriptures are misinterpreted because after the captivities, the distinction between \"Jews\" and \"Israelites\" was lost over time.\nBritish Israelists believe that the Northern Tribes of Israel lost their identity after the captivity in Assyria and that this is reflected in the Bible. Dimont disagrees with this assertion and argues that only higher-ranking Israelites were deported from Israel and many Israelites remained. He cites examples after the Assyrian captivity, such as Josiah, King of Judah, who received money from the tribes of \"Manasseh, and Ephraim, and all the remnant of Israel\" (2 Chronicles 34:9), and Hezekiah, who sent invitations not only to Judah, but also to northern Israel for the attendance of a Passover in Jerusalem. (2 Chronicles 30); British Israelites interpret 2 Chronicles 34:9 as referring to \"Scythians\".\nDimont is also critical of the interpretations of biblical prophecy embraced by the movement, saying, \"Texts are torn from their context, and misapplied without the slightest regard to their original meaning.\"\nHistorical speculation.\nBritish Israelism rests on linking different ancient populations. This includes linking the \"lost\" tribes of Israel with the Scythians, Cimmerians, Celts, and modern Western Europeans such as the British. To support these links, some adherents believe that similarities exist between various cultural aspects of these population groups, and they argue that these links demonstrate the migration of the \"lost\" Israelites in a westerly direction. Examples given include burial customs, metalwork, clothing, dietary customs, and more. Dimont argues that the customs of the Scythians and the Cimmerians are in contrast to those of the Ancient Israelites, and he further dismisses the connection between these populations and the Saxons and Celts, particularly criticizing the then-current formulations of British Israelism that would interject Semites between the closely related English and Germans.\nThe Scythian origin of the Scots has been referred to as mythical. Algernon Herbert, writing in 1848, characterized the linguistic derivation of Scots from \"Scoloti\" as \"strictly impossible\", and Merrill (2005) referred to it as false etymology.\nAddressing their view on the fate of the exiled tribes, Frank Boys said of their voluminous output, \"All the effort to write these volumes might well have been saved on the premise that 'they were never lost,' which we believe to be the correct one.\"\nIdeology.\nParfitt suggests that the creation of British Israelism was inspired by numerous ideological factors, which included: a desire of its adherents, many of whom were from ordinary backgrounds, to prove that they had a glorious ancient past; emerging pride in Western imperialism and colonialism, and a belief in the \"racial superiority of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants\". Colin Kidd points out that British Israelism gave the spiritual component of rationalizing Anglo-Saxon superiority. He further considers that its theology represents a \"quasi-heresy\", which serves to \"blunt the universalist message apparent in the New Testament.\" Its role in fostering antisemitism in conservative Protestant Christianity has been noted by historians, along with its role in fostering a feeling of \"racial chauvinism\" which is \"not always covert\".\nSeparately, the mythology of British Israelism has been characterized as fostering \"nationalistic bellicosity\" by historians. To some adherents, British Israelism served as a justification for British imperialism and American settler colonialism (manifest destiny), along with the displacement of indigenous peoples which subsequently followed them.\nInfluences on other movements.\nMormonism.\nBritish Israelism was rapidly growing in England when the United States-based Latter Day Saint movement sent its first missionaries to England. British Israelist ideas clearly influenced Mormon thought by the 1850s, and by the 1870s, Mormon periodicals published in Britain were citing British Israelist proponents to promote the belief that most Mormons were of Anglo-Saxon and Israelite descent, concepts that would subsequently be synthesized into general Mormon discourse.\nPentecostalism.\nSeveral individuals who were influential in the founding of Pentecostalism embraced the tenets of British Israelism. The British-Israel-inspired self-identification of Anglo-Saxon peoples with the Jewish nation and the promises which were made to them by their god would significantly contribute to the belief that they would play a central role in the end times, a belief which was adhered to by several prominent proto- and early-pentecostals. Notable among them was John Alexander Dowie, who spoke about Anglo-Saxon Christians' plans to take control of Jerusalem in order to prepare for the Second Coming. This legacy was continued by Charles Fox Parham, but he believed that the Lost Tribes would join their Jewish brethren in order to reestablish the nation of Israel. His view of the Lost Tribes was more expansive than Dowie's view (see Nordic Israelism), in addition to encompassing Anglo-Saxons, it also encompassed Scandinavians, Danes, High Germans, and even Hindus and Japanese (see Japanese-Jewish common ancestry theory), who, according to Parham, had acquired the blood of Abraham through intermarriage and were hence eligible to take part in his end-time drama. British-Israelist beliefs would soon be marginalized in the movement, but their influences could still be seen in the teachings of several key leaders in the mid-20th-century.\nNoted Christian Identity minister Wesley A. Swift was first introduced to British Israelism via Pentecostalism in the early 1930s. Swift was a student at L.I.F.E. Bible College at the Angelus Temple, Aimee Semple McPherson's Pentecostal Foursquare Church, during the 1930s. Swift later served as a minister at the Angelus Temple during the 1930s and 1940s. This teaching was brought by Gerald Burton Winrod, an evangelist from Kansas, who was a speaker at Angelus Temple. Swift was a student of Rev. Philip Monson's Kingdom Bible School during the 1930s; Monson taught British Israelism and some of the racial teachings which Swift would later reformulate into Christian Identity theology. Swift was also exposed to Charles Parham's British Israel teachings at the Angelus Temple.\nIn Britain, the espousal of British Israelism by George Jeffreys, founder of the Elim Pentecostal Church, led to a schism which precipitated his resignation in 1939 and led to the formation of the Bible-Pattern Church Fellowship, which continues to teach the doctrine.\nArmstrongism.\nBeginning in the 1960s, Herbert W. Armstrong, founder and Pastor General of the Worldwide Church of God, vigorously promoted the teaching of British Israelism. Armstrong believed that the teaching was a key to understanding biblical prophecy: \"One might ask, were not biblical prophecies closed and sealed? Indeed they were\u2014until now! And even now they can be understood only by those who possess the master key to unlock them.\" Armstrong believed that God commanded him to proclaim the prophecies to the Lost Tribes of Israel before the \"end-times\".\nArmstrong founded his own church, first named the \"Radio Church of God\" and later renamed the \"Worldwide Church of God\". He described British Israelism as a \"central plank\" of his theology.\nAfter Armstrong's death, his former church abandoned its belief in British Israelism and in 2009, it changed its name to Grace Communion International (GCI). It offers an explanation for the doctrine's origin as well as an explanation for the church's renunciation of the doctrine on its official website. Church members who refused to accept these doctrinal changes left the Worldwide Church of God/GCI and founded their own offshoot churches. Many of these organizations still teach British Israelism, among them are the Philadelphia Church of God, the Living Church of God, and the United Church of God. Armstrong promoted other genealogical history theories, such as the belief that modern-day Germany represents ancient Assyria (see Assyria and Germany in Anglo-Israelism), writing, \"The Assyrians settled in central Europe, and the Germans, undoubtedly, are, in part, the descendants of the ancient Assyrians.\".\nChristian Identity.\nWhile early British Israelites such as Edward Hine and John Wilson were generally philosemites, an antisemitic strain also existed within the movement, such as the scientific racialism that led Wilson to deny the \"racial purity\" of modern-day Jews, leading some within the movement to adopt the belief that modern-day Jews were \"un-Semitic impostors\". Some American adherents of British Israelism would later adopt a racialized, strongly antisemitic theology that became known as Christian Identity, which has at its core the belief that non-Caucasian people have no souls and therefore, they cannot be saved. Since its emergence in the 1920s, Christian Identity has taught the belief that Jews are not descended from the Tribe of Judah. Instead, some Christian Identity adherents believe that Jews are descended from Satan and Lilith (see Serpent seed) while others believe that Jews are descended from Edomites or Khazars (see Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry). Their adoption of the British Israelist belief that the Israelite-derived Anglo-Saxons had been favoured by God over the 'impure' modern Jews meant that a reluctantly antisemitic Klansman \"could now maintain his anti-Semitism and at the same time revere a Bible cleansed of its Jewish taint.\"\nThe arrival of British Israelism in the United States contributed to the transmission of antisemitic notions into the Christian Identity movement. One of the leading proponents of the movement after World War II was Wesley A. Swift, who founded the Anglo-Saxon Christian Congregation, later renamed the Church of Jesus Christ\u2013Christian in about 1948, which became Christian Identity's main mouthpiece. British Israelism and Christian Identity have both been branded as intrinsically \"racial chauvinist\" doctrines, but while the Jews are protagonists of the apocalypse in British-Israelism, they are antagonists of the apocalypse in Christian Identity eschatology. Christian Identity adherents believed that the Jews used British Israelism as a platform to \"facilitate a Jewish monopoly on global power\", based on this belief, Christian Identity adherents accused British Israelites of being manipulated by Jews. Conversely, in January 2007, in its \"BIFW Newsletter\", the British-Israel-World Federation lamented the rise of antisemitic groups within British-Israelist circles in the US.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Inspired by the English band Skyclad and the Irish rock group Horslips, Cruachan sought to merge black metal with Irish folk music. Their debut album, Tuatha na Gael (1995), is considered a seminal work in the genre. Around the same time, other Irish bands like Primordial and Waylander also began exploring similar musical territories, each bringing their unique interpretations to the fusion of metal and Celtic music. These bands laid the foundation for what would become a vibrant subgenre within the metal community.\nOver the years, Celtic metal has expanded beyond Ireland, with bands from various countries incorporating Celtic elements into their music. Swiss band Eluveitie, for example, combines melodic death metal with Celtic melodies and instruments, even using lyrics in the ancient Gaulish language. Other notable bands include Spain's M\u00e4go de Oz, Germany's Suidakra, and Canada's Leah, each bringing their cultural perspectives to the genre. \nHistory.\nThe origins of Celtic metal can be traced to the earliest known exponent of folk metal, the English band Skyclad. Their \"ambitious\" and \"groundbreaking\" debut album \"The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth\" was released in 1990 with the song \"The Widdershins Jig\" acclaimed as \"particularly significant\" and \"a certain first in the realms of Metal\". This debut album made an impact on a young Keith Fay who had formed a Tolkien-inspired black metal band by the name of Minas Tirith.\nInspired by the music of Skyclad and Horslips, Keith Fay set out to combine black metal with the folk music of Ireland. He formed the Irish band Cruachan in 1992 with a demo recording released in 1993. Like Waylander, Keith Fay also credits the Irish rock band Horslips as a \"huge influence on Cruachan,\" further noting that \"what they were doing in the 70s is the equivalent of what we do now.\" Cruachan's debut album \"Tuatha na Gael\" was released in 1995 and the band has since been acclaimed as having \"gone the greatest lengths of anyone in their attempts to expand\" the genre of folk metal. With a specific focus on Celtic music and the use of Celtic mythology in their lyrics, Cruachan's style of folk metal is known today as Celtic metal.\nParallel to Cruachan, the black metal act Primordial also released a demo recording in 1993 and \"found themselves heralded as frontrunners in the burgeoning second-wave black metal movement.\" Irish music plays \"a very big role\" in Primordial but in \"a dark and subtle way\" through the chords and timings.\nThe year 1993 also saw the formation of Waylander. With vocalist Ciaran O'Hagan fronting the group, they released a demo recording in 1995. A debut album \"Reawakening Pride Once Lost\" was unveiled in 1998.\nO'Hagan notes that it was a coincidence that \"Primordial, Cruachan and Waylander sprang up within little more than a year of each other.\" Since then a few other bands from Ireland have emerged to perform Celtic metal including Geasa and Mael M\u00f3rdha.\nSince the turn of the millennium, the genre has expanded and many bands beyond the shores of Ireland can be found today performing Celtic metal. This includes Eluveitie from Switzerland, Ithilien from Belgium, M\u00e4go de Oz from Spain, Suidakra from Germany, Leah from Canada, Skiltron from Argentina, and Gun Ghaol - who perform entirely in Scottish Gaelic - from Scotland. \nDespite the Irish origins of the genre, Celtic metal is not known to be popular in Ireland. Ciaran O'Hagan of Waylander notes that while \"Primordial are Ireland's biggest Metal band in terms of sales and international profile\" the band would be \"lucky to sell much more than 500 copies of their albums in their own country or pull more than 300 punters to a gig.\" Bands in the genre have experienced a more enthusiastic reception elsewhere with M\u00e4go de Oz notably experiencing strong chart success in Latin America and their native Spain.\nCharacteristics.\nSimilar to its parent genre of folk metal, the music of Celtic metal is a diverse collection with bands pursuing different subgenres of heavy metal music. While bands such as Suidakra ply their trade with the more extreme subgenres of black or death metal, other groups like M\u00e4go de Oz and Skiltron prefer a more traditional or power metal sound, Leah performs a symphonic metal sound with world music influences, and Gun Ghaol perform modern metalcore.\nMany bands in the genre enhance their sound with the use of a folk instrument. Bagpipes are used by bands such as Skiltron and Ithilien. The fiddle is used by such bands as M\u00e4go de Oz, Ithilien and Eluveitie. The tin whistle and flute can be found in such bands as Cruachan, Ithilien, Waylander and Eluveitie, while the Irish bands of the genre make use of native instruments such as the uilleann pipe and bodhr\u00e1n.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 103,588. The county seat is Salisbury. The county was named for the Wicomico River, which in turn derives its name from the Algonquian language words , meaning \"a place where houses are built,\" apparently referring to a Native American town on the banks. The county is included in the Salisbury, MD-DE Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is part of the Lower Eastern Shore region of the state.\nHistory.\nWicomico County was created from Somerset and Worcester counties in 1867.\nPolitics and government.\nWicomico County was granted a charter form of government in 1964.\nIn the period after the Reconstruction era, Wicomico County became solidly Democratic due to its strong support for secession and state efforts to disenfranchise most blacks by raising barriers to voter registration. Independent insurgent white groups worked to intimidate and discourage black voters, especially in rural areas.\nNo Republican carried Wicomico County until 1928, when Herbert Hoover won due to anti-Catholic sentiment in the heavily Protestant county against Democratic candidate Al Smith. The popular general Dwight D. Eisenhower carried Wicomico in 1952. Eisenhower would again carry Wicomico in 1956, and Republican Richard Nixon would win it in 1960 against John F. Kennedy who, like Al Smith, was Catholic.\nNo Democratic presidential nominee has won Wicomico County since Lyndon Johnson\u2019s landslide in 1964, as white conservatives increasingly moved into the Republican Party. Bill Clinton, a son of the South, came within 384 votes of beating Bob Dole in 1996. The county trended Republican in 2000 and 2004, but Barack Obama obtained a higher proportion of the county vote in 2008 and 2012, likely benefiting from support from young, educated, or minority voters. In 2020, Joe Biden came extremely close to winning the county, with Donald Trump only edging him out by 890 votes. Biden obtained 47.7% of the county's vote, the highest percentage for any Democrat since 1964. Trump also won less than 50% of the vote, the first time a Republican had been held below a majority of the vote in Wicomico County since 1996.\nWicomico County's government, since 2006, uses a council-elected executive system where the voters elect members of the County Council and Executive. Prior to 2006, the county operated under a council-administrator system where voters elected council members who in turn appointed an administrator to oversee the government.\nCounty council.\nThe legislative functions of government are vested in the County Council. The County Council consists of seven members, five of whom are elected from single-member districts; the other two are elected at-large.\nCounty executive.\nThe county executive oversees the executive branch of the County government, which consists of a number of offices and departments. The executive branch is charged with implementing County law and overseeing the operation of County Government. The position of County Executive was established by a modification of the county's Charter in 2006. Day-to-day functions of the executive branch fall to the appointed Director of Administration, who also serves as the Acting County Executive during vacancies in the office of the County Executive. Upon the death of Robert L. \"Bob\" Culver Jr., on July 26, 2020, the Wicomico County Council appointed then-Director of Administration John D. Psota to that role in an acting capacity until the 2022 election cycle for the county executive seat.\nIn June 2024, the Wicomico County Council voted to approve a referendum for the 2024 elections on whether to restore Wicomico County to a council\u2013manager government, thereby abolishing the county executive position. The measure, which was not approved by voters, would have gone into effect at the conclusion of Julie Giordano's current term in late 2026.\nSheriff.\nLaw enforcement in the county is provided by the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office. The sheriff, Mike Lewis, a Republican, is an elected official. Municipal police agencies exist in the towns of Delmar and Pittsville, along with the cities of Fruitland and Salisbury.\nState's attorney.\nThe Wicomico County State's Attorney is responsible for prosecuting the felony, misdemeanor, and juvenile cases occurring in the county. The current elected State's Attorney is Jamie Dykes.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (6.4%) is water.\nThe county's boundary with Delaware is composed of the Mason-Dixon line and the Transpeninsular Line. The intersection of these two historical lines is the midpoint of the Transpeninsular Line, fixed by Mason and Dixon between 1763 and 1767. The midpoint is located about northwest of Salisbury, near the center of the Delmarva Peninsula. The county is generally flat, characteristic of the region, with a few small hills in the northeast. The lowest elevation is at sea level and the highest elevation is .\nClimate.\nThe county has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. According to the Trewartha climate classification, the subtropical boundary of eight months of daily averages of at least runs through the northern part of Wicomico County.

He played a prominent role in the Cretan resistance during the Second World War, and was widely seen as Britain's greatest living travel writer, on the basis of books such as \"A Time of Gifts\" (1977). A BBC journalist once termed him \"a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond and Graham Greene\".\nEarly life and education.\nLeigh Fermor was born in London, the son of Sir Lewis Leigh Fermor, a distinguished geologist, and Muriel Aeyleen (Eileen), daughter of Charles Taafe Ambler. His mother added the \"Leigh\" before \"Fermor\" in his surname, although it was not a true double-barrelled name. Shortly after his birth, his mother and sister left to join his father in India, leaving the infant Patrick in England with a family in Northamptonshire: first in the village of Weedon, and later in nearby Dodford. He did not meet his parents or his sister again until he was four years old. As a child Leigh Fermor had problems with academic structure and limitations, and was sent to a school for \"difficult\" children. He was later expelled from The King's School, Canterbury, after he was caught holding hands with a greengrocer's daughter. At school he also became friendly with another contemporary, Alan Watts.\nHis last report from The King's School noted that the young Leigh Fermor was \"a dangerous mixture of sophistication and recklessness\". He continued learning by reading texts on Greek, Latin, Shakespeare and history, with the intention of entering the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Gradually he changed his mind, deciding to become an author instead, and in the summer of 1933 relocated to Shepherd Market in London, living with a few friends. Soon, faced with the challenges of an author's life in London and rapidly draining finances, he decided to leave for Europe.\nEarly travels.\nAt the age of 18 Leigh Fermor decided to walk the length of Europe from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople (Istanbul). He set off on 8 December 1933 with a few clothes, several letters of introduction, the \"Oxford Book of English Verse\" and a Loeb volume of Horace's \"Odes\". He slept in barns and shepherds' huts, but was also invited by gentry and aristocracy into the country houses of Central Europe. He experienced hospitality in many monasteries along the way.\nTwo of his later travel books, \"A Time of Gifts\" (1977) and \"Between the Woods and the Water\" (1986), cover this journey, but at the time of his death, a book on the final part of his journey remained unfinished. This was edited and assembled from Leigh Fermor's diary of the time and an early draft he wrote in the 1960s. It was published as \"The Broken Road\" by John Murray in September 2013.\nLeigh Fermor arrived in Istanbul on 1 January 1935, then continued to travel around Greece, spending a few weeks in Mount Athos. In March he was involved in the campaign of royalist forces in Macedonia against an attempted Republican revolt. In Athens, he met Balasha Cantacuz\u00e8ne (\"B\u0103la\u015fa Cantacuzino\"), a Romanian Phanariote noblewoman, with whom he fell in love. They shared an old watermill outside the city looking out towards Poros, where she painted and he wrote. They moved on to B\u0103leni, Gala\u021bi, the Cantacuz\u00e8ne house in Moldavia, Romania, where he remained until the autumn of 1939. On learning that Britain had declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 Leigh Fermor immediately left Romania for home and enlisted in the army. He did not meet Cantacuz\u00e8ne again until 1965.\nSecond World War.\nAs an officer cadet Leigh Fermor trained alongside Derek Bond and Iain Moncreiffe. He later joined the Irish Guards. His knowledge of modern Greek gained him a commission in the General List in August 1940 and he became a liaison officer in Albania. He fought in Crete and mainland Greece. During the German occupation, he returned to Crete three times, once by parachute, and was among a small number of Special Operations Executive (SOE) officers posted to organise the island's resistance to the occupation. Disguised as a shepherd and nicknamed \"Michalis\" or \"Filedem\", he lived for over two years in the mountains. With Captain Bill Stanley Moss as his second in command, Leigh Fermor led the party that in 1944 captured and evacuated the German commander, Major General Heinrich Kreipe. There is a memorial commemorating Kreipe's abduction near Archanes in Crete.\nMoss featured the events of the Cretan capture in his book \"Ill Met by Moonlight\". (The 2014 edition contains an afterword on the context, written by Leigh Fermor in 2001.) It was adapted in a film by the same name, directed/produced by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger and released in 1957 with Leigh Fermor played by Dirk Bogarde. Leigh Fermor's own account \"Abducting A General \u2013 The Kreipe Operation and SOE in Crete\" appeared in October 2014.\nDuring periods of leave, Leigh Fermor spent time at Tara, a villa in Cairo rented by Moss, where the \"rowdy household\" of SOE officers was presided over by Countess Zofia (Sophie) Tarnowska.\nPost-war work.\nIn 1950 Leigh Fermor published his first book, \"The Traveller's Tree\", about his post-war travels in the Caribbean, which won the Heinemann Foundation Prize for Literature and established his career. The reviewer in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" wrote: \"Mr Leigh Fermor never loses sight of the fact, not always grasped by superficial visitors, that most of the problems of the West Indies are the direct legacy of the slave trade.\" It was quoted extensively in \"Live and Let Die\", by Ian Fleming. He went on to write several other books of his journeys, including \"\" and \"Roumeli,\" of his travels on mule and foot around remote parts of Greece.\nLeigh Fermor translated the manuscript \"The Cretan Runner\" written by George Psychoundakis, a dispatch runner on Crete during the war, and helped Psychoundakis get his work published. Leigh Fermor also wrote a novel, \"The Violins of Saint-Jacques\", which was adapted as an opera by Malcolm Williamson. His friend Lawrence Durrell recounts in his book \"Bitter Lemons\" (1957) how in 1955, during the Cyprus Emergency, Leigh Fermor visited Durrell's villa in Bellapais, Cyprus: After a splendid dinner by the fire he starts singing, songs of Crete, Athens, Macedonia. When I go out to refill the ouzo bottle... I find the street completely filled with people listening in utter silence and darkness. Everyone seems struck dumb. 'What is it?' I say, catching sight of Frangos. 'Never have I heard of Englishmen singing Greek songs like this!' Their reverent amazement is touching; it is as if they want to embrace Paddy wherever he goes.\nLater years.\nAfter living with her for many years, Leigh Fermor was married in 1968 to the Honourable Joan Elizabeth Rayner (n\u00e9e Eyres Monsell), daughter of the 1st Viscount Monsell. She accompanied him on many travels until her death in Kardamyli in June 2003, aged 91. They had no children. They lived part of the year in a house in an olive grove near Kardamyli in the Mani Peninsula, southern Peloponnese, and part of the year in Gloucestershire.\nIn 2007, he said that, for the first time, he had decided to work using a typewriter, having written all his books longhand until then.\nLeigh Fermor opened his home in Kardamyli to the local villagers on his saint's day, which was 8 November, the feast of Michael (he had assumed the name Michael while fighting with the Greek resistance). New Zealand writer Maggie Rainey-Smith (staying in the area while researching for her next book) joined in his saint's day celebration in November 2007, and after his death, posted some photographs of the event. The house at Kardamyli features in the 2013 film \"Before Midnight\".\nLeigh Fermor influenced a generation of British travel writers, including Bruce Chatwin, Colin Thubron, Philip Marsden, Nicholas Crane and Rory Stewart.\nDeath and funeral.\nLeigh Fermor was noted for his strong physical constitution, even though he smoked 80 to 100 cigarettes a day. Although in his last years he suffered from tunnel vision and wore hearing aids and an eyepatch, he remained physically fit up to his death and dined at table on the last evening of his life.\nFor the last few months of his life Leigh Fermor suffered from a cancerous tumour, and in early June 2011 he underwent a tracheotomy in Greece. As death was close, according to local Greek friends, he expressed a wish to visit England to bid goodbye to his friends, and then return to die in Kardamyli, though it is also stated that he actually wished to die in England and be buried next to his wife.\nLeigh Fermor died in England aged 96, on 10 June 2011, the day after his return. His funeral was held at St Peter's Church, Dumbleton, Gloucestershire, on 16 June 2011. A Guard of Honour was provided by serving and former members of the Intelligence Corps, and a bugler from the Irish Guards sounded the Last Post and Reveille. He is buried next to his wife in the churchyard there. The Greek inscription is a quotation from Cavafy translatable as \"In addition, he was that best of all things, Hellenic\".\nLegacy.\nA Patrick Leigh Fermor Society formed in 2014.\nThe National Archives in London holds copies of Leigh Fermor's wartime dispatches from occupied Crete in file number HS 5/728.\nA repository of many of his letters, books, postcards and other miscellaneous writings can be found within the Patrick Leigh Fermor Archive at the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh.\nSee also.\nOthers with or alongside the SOE in Crete:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 52,460. Its county seat is Snow Hill. The county is part of the Lower Eastern Shore region of the state.\nIt is the only county of Maryland that borders the Atlantic Ocean, and the only county bordering both Delaware and Virginia. The county was named for Mary Arundell, the wife of Sir John Somerset, a son of Henry Somerset, 1st Marquess of Worcester. She was sister to Anne Arundell (Anne Arundel County), wife of Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (Cecil County), the first Proprietor and Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland.\nWorcester County is included in the Salisbury, MD-DE Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county includes the entire length of the state's ocean and tidewater coast along the Intracoastal Waterway bordering Assawoman Bay, Isle of Wight Bay, Sinepuxent Bay, and Chincoteague Bay between the sand barrier islands of Fenwick Island and Assateague Island bordering the Atlantic Ocean coast. It is home to the popular vacation resort area of Ocean City, founded 1875, as well as wild habitats on the primitive wilderness areas on Assateague Island and in the Pocomoke River and Swamp.\nHistory.\nWorcester County was created by the division of the formerly larger Eastern Shore's Somerset County in 1742. The county seat, which was previously located near the confluence of Dividing Creek with the Pocomoke River, was later transferred to the river port of Snow Hill, at the head of navigation of the Pocomoke, now near the center of the new county.\nBoth the areas of Somerset and Worcester Counties were divided into old colonial divisions of \"hundreds\", from south to north: Mattapony, Pocomoke, Boquetenorton, Wicomico, and Baltimore Hundreds. Later subdivisions of these hundreds added Pitts Creek, Acquango, Queponco, and Buckingham &amp; Worcester Hundreds, all of which in turn eventually became election districts for the newly independent state following American independence. Competing territorial claims between the Proprietor family of the Calverts and the Lords Baltimore in the old Province of Maryland and the Penns of the neighboring Province of Pennsylvania to the north and of what later became the state of Delaware to the east led to the surveying of Worcester County's northern border, the \"Transpeninsular Line\" in 1751, though boundary disputes continued through the rest of the colonial period, not totally settled until the work of the famous Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon with their \"Mason\u2013Dixon line\". In 1779, Stephen Decatur, the famous United States Navy officer and hero of the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War in the early 1800s, and leading into the War of 1812, was born at Sinepuxent, near what is today the town of Berlin.\nOriginally settled by European immigrants of British and Irish stock, along with slaves of mainly West African descent, Worcester County was divided during the colonial period into several Church of England parishes, though Quakers, Presbyterians, and later Methodists also set up meeting houses. Like the border states in general, Worcester County had a high proportion of free people of color for many decades before the Civil War, due in part to the influence of initially Quakerism, and later Methodism. During the 1840s and 1850s, Worcester County, Maryland had the highest portion of free people of color per capita out of any county in Maryland. It was one of the few counties in the state with an active abolitionist movement. Most abolitionists in the county were Methodists, Quakers and Presbyterians, however the slave-owning community was overwhelmingly Baptist and Catholic. First-generation immigrants from England and Germany were also overwhelmingly abolitionists in Worcester County. During the civil war in Worcester County first generation immigrants from England and Germany were known for siding with the Union whereas first generation Irish Catholic immigrants from Ireland overwhelmingly sided with the Confederacy and were known for being some of the leaders of the Copperheads or \"Peace Democrats\" in Worcester County.\nWorcester County was primarily an agricultural area from its inception, first planting tobacco, but when the quality produced in the area's sandy soil could not compete with that produced elsewhere, they began growing wheat, corn, and livestock. Early industrial activity included the smelting of bog iron ore in a brick blast furnace to make pig iron at Furnacetown in the first half of the 19th century. The presence of large bald cypress swamps along the Pocomoke River led to logging, the manufacture of roofing shingles, and shipbuilding along the river at Newtown (later Pocomoke City). The arrival of steam-powered water transport and then the railroad opened urban markets to another of Worcester County's principal products: seafood, particularly shellfish. Oysters, clams, and crabs were shipped to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Soon after the Civil War (to each side of which Worcester County sent soldiers), parts of both Worcester and Somerset Counties were combined to create, in 1867, Wicomico County. Also in the later 19th century, the seaside resort of Ocean City was founded.\nTruck farming and the canning industry came to the fore during the early 20th century. However, both the seafood industry and truck farming declined after mid-century, due to overfishing on the one hand, and the opening of California's Central Valley to irrigated agriculture on the other, but the advent of the large-scale poultry industry filled this gap. The expansion of Ocean City since the 1960s has turned the northern part of the county from a summer resort to an expanding year-round community.\nTwo major storms influenced the course of Worcester County history in the 20th Century: the hurricane of August 1933, which badly damaged Ocean City and Public Landing, but also cut the Ocean City Inlet and passageway between the inner bays west of the sandy barrier islands of Assawoman Bay, Sinepuxent Bay and Assateague Channel and Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, and the later Ash Wednesday \"Nor'easter\" of 1962, which destroyed much of the residential development on Assateague Island and led to the creation of the National Seashore and State Park.\nThe county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.\nPolitics and government.\nWorcester County was granted home rule in 1976 under a state code under the amendments to the fourth Maryland Constitution of 1867. The Circuit Court of Maryland and District Court of Maryland are located in Snow Hill with two district courthouses. The county is governed by a Board of Commissioners elected from seven districts.\nThe members of the County Council as of 2022 are:\nWorcester County lies wholly in Senate District 38 and is served in the Maryland House of Delegates in Districts 38A and 38C. Members listed below as of 2018 are:\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (33%) is water. It is the second-largest county in Maryland by total area (behind Dorchester County) and the fourth-largest by land area.\nThe terrain is mostly level and coastal. The lowest elevation is sea level along the Atlantic Ocean and the highest elevation is in the northwestern part of the county along State Route 12 just south of the Wicomico County line.\nClimate.\nThe county has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\".) All monthly temperature averages are above freezing and eight months in most of the county are above .) Three months are above .)\nTransportation.\nFreight trains run from Snow Hill north to Berlin and the Delaware border on the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, and the main line (formerly Pennsylvania Railroad) from Philadelphia to Cape Charles, Virginia and Norfolk runs through the southwestern corner of the county, operated by the Delmarva Central Railroad. The Ocean City Municipal Airport is located near Ocean City, but has no scheduled service. The nearest airport with commercial air service is the Salisbury\u2013Ocean City\u2013Wicomico Regional Airport near Salisbury.\nShore Transit provides public transportation in Worcester County, operating bus routes connecting Pocomoke City, Snow Hill, Berlin, and Ocean City with Princess Anne and Salisbury. Ocean City Transportation operates bus service branded as Beach Bus in Ocean City. DART First State's Beach Bus Route 208 connects Ocean City with the Delaware Beaches in the summer months.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 51,454\u00a0people, 22,229\u00a0households, and 14,598\u00a0families residing in the county.

{"id": "71537", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71537", "title": "Coming out", "text": "Process of revealing one's sexual orientation or other attributes\nComing out of the closet, often shortened to coming out, is a metaphor mostly used to describe LGBTQ people's self-disclosure of their sexual orientation, romantic orientation, or gender identity. While mostly used in contexts involving sexual orientation or gender identity, it is sometimes used as a shorthand in other identity self-disclosure contexts, such as the revelation of atheism or irreligion, or of one's political affiliations.\nLGBTQ self-disclosure is often framed and debated as a privacy issue because the consequences may be very different for different individuals, some of whom may have their job security or personal security threatened by such disclosure. The act may be viewed as a psychological process or journey; decision-making or risk-taking; a strategy or plan; a mass or public event; a speech act and a matter of personal identity; a rite of passage; liberation or emancipation from oppression; an ordeal; a means toward feeling LGBTQ pride instead of shame and social stigma; or a career-threatening act. \nThe term \"coming out of the closet\" is the source of other gay slang expressions related to voluntary disclosure or lack thereof. LGBTQ people who have already revealed or no longer conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity are \"out of the closet\" or simply \"out\", i.e., openly LGBTQ. By contrast, LGBTQ people who have yet to come out or have opted not to do so are labelled as \"closeted\" or being \"in the closet\". Outing is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBTQ person's sexual orientation or gender identity by someone else, without the first individual's consent. By extension, \"outing oneself\" is self-disclosure. \"Glass closet\" refers to the open secret of a public figure widely thought to be LGBTQ even though the person has not officially come out.\nHistory.\nBetween 1864 and 1869, Karl Heinrich Ulrichs wrote a series of pamphlets\u00a0\u2013 as well as giving a lecture to the Association of German Jurists in 1867\u00a0\u2013 advocating decriminalization of sex acts between men, in which he was candid about his own homosexuality. Historian Robert Beachy has said of him, \"I think it is reasonable to describe [Ulrichs] as the first gay person to publicly out himself.\"\nIn early 20th-century Germany, \"coming out\" was labeled as \"self-denunciation\" and entailed serious legal and reputational risks. In his 1906 work, (The sexual life of our time in its relation to modern civilization), Iwan Bloch, a German-Jewish physician, entreated elderly homosexuals to self-disclose to their family members and acquaintances. In 1914, Magnus Hirschfeld revisited the topic in his major work \"The Homosexuality of Men and Women\", discussing the social and legal potential of several thousand homosexual men and women of rank, revealing their sexual orientation to the police in order to influence legislators and public opinion. Hirschfeld did not support 'self-denunciation' and dismissed the possibilities of a political movement based on open homosexuals.\nThe first prominent American to reveal his homosexuality was the poet Robert Duncan. In 1944, using his own name in the anarchist magazine \"Politics\", he wrote that homosexuals were an oppressed minority. The decidedly clandestine Mattachine Society, founded by Harry Hay and other veterans of the Wallace for President campaign in Los Angeles in 1950, moved into the public eye after Hal Call took over the group in San Francisco in 1953. Many gays emerged from the closet there.\nIn 1951, Donald Webster Cory published his landmark \"The Homosexual in America\", saying, \"Society has handed me a mask to wear\u00a0... Everywhere I go, at all times and before all sections of society, I pretend.\" Cory was a pseudonym, but his frank and openly subjective descriptions served as a stimulus to the emerging homosexual self-awareness and the nascent homophile movement.\nIn the 1960s, Frank Kameny came to the forefront of the struggle. Having been fired from his job as an astronomer for the Army Map service in 1957 for homosexual behavior, because it was considered to make people vulnerable to blackmail pressure and endanger secure positions, Kameny refused to go quietly. He openly fought his dismissal, eventually appealing it to the US Supreme Court. As a vocal leader of the growing movement, Kameny argued for unapologetic public actions. The cornerstone of his conviction was that, \"we must instill in the homosexual community a sense of worth to the individual homosexual\", which could only be achieved through campaigns openly led by homosexuals themselves.\nWith the spread of consciousness raising (CR) in the late 1960s, coming out became a key strategy of the gay liberation movement to raise political consciousness to counter heterosexism and homophobia. At the same time and continuing into the 1980s, gay and lesbian social support discussion groups, some of which were called \"coming-out groups\", focused on sharing coming-out \"stories\" (accounts) with the goal of reducing isolation and increasing LGBTQ visibility and pride.\nEtymology.\nThe present-day expression \"coming out\" is understood to have originated in the early 20th century from an analogy that likens homosexuals' introduction into gay subculture to a d\u00e9butante's \"coming-out party\". This is a celebration for a young upper-class woman who is making her d\u00e9but\u00a0\u2013 her formal presentation to society\u00a0\u2013 because she has reached adult age or has become eligible for marriage. As historian George Chauncey points out:\nGay people in the pre-war years [pre-WWI]\u00a0... did not speak of \"coming out of\" what we call \"the gay closet\" but rather of \"coming out into\" what they called \"homosexual society\" or the \"gay world\", a world neither so small, nor so isolated, nor, often, so hidden as \"closet\" implies.\nIn fact, as Elizabeth Kennedy observes, \"using the term 'closet' to refer to\" previous times such as \"the 1920s and 1930s might be anachronistic\".\nAn article on coming out in the online encyclopedia glbtq.com states that sexologist Evelyn Hooker's observations introduced the use of \"coming out\" to the academic community in the 1950s. The article continues by echoing Chauncey's observation that a subsequent shift in connotation occurred later on. The pre-1950s focus was on \"entrance\" into \"a new world of hope and communal solidarity\", whereas the post-Stonewall Riots overtone was an \"exit\" from the oppression of the closet. This change in focus suggests that \"coming out \"of the closet\"\" is a mixed metaphor that joins \"coming out\" with the closet metaphor: an evolution of \"skeleton in the closet\" specifically referring to living a life of denial and secrecy by concealing one's sexual orientation. The closet metaphor, in turn, is extended to the forces and pressures of heterosexist society and its institutions.\nIdentity issues.\nWhen coming out is described as a gradual process or a journey, it is meant to include becoming aware of and acknowledging one's gender identity, gender expression, or non-hetero-normative sexual orientation or attraction. This preliminary stage, which involves soul-searching or a personal epiphany, is often called \"coming out to oneself\" and constitutes the start of self-acceptance. Many LGBTQ people say that this stage began for them during adolescence or childhood, when they first became aware of their sexual orientation toward members of the same sex.\nComing out has also been described as a process because of a recurring need or desire to come out in new situations in which LGBTQ people are assumed to be heterosexual or cisgender, such as at a new job or with new acquaintances. A major frame of reference for those coming out has included using an inside/outside perspective, where some assume that the person can keep their identity or orientation a secret and separate from their outside appearance. This is not as simple as often thought, as Diana Fuss (1991) argues, \"the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric\u00a0... is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time\".\nLGBTQ identity development.\nEvery coming out story is the person trying to come to terms with who they are and their sexual orientation. Several models have been created to describe coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development, e.g., Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989. Of these models, the most widely accepted is the Cass identity model established by Vivienne Cass. This model outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: identity confusion, identity comparison, identity tolerance, identity acceptance, identity pride, and identity synthesis. However, not every LGBTQ person follows such a model. For example, some LGBTQ youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e., free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted. Regardless of whether LGBTQ youth develop their identity based on a model, the typical age at which youth in the United States come out has been dropping. High school students and even middle school students are coming out.\nEmerging research suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and other social networks, such as blogs, as they offer a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While further research is needed to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from those of heterosexuals in that these may be more likely to provide mental health benefits rather than consequences.\nTransgender identity and coming out.\nTransgender people vary greatly in choosing when, whether, and how to disclose their transgender status to family, close friends, and others. The prevalence of discrimination and violence against transgender people (in the United States, for example, transgender people are 28 percent more likely to be victims of violence) can make coming out a risky decision. Fear of retaliatory behavior, such as being removed from the parental home while underage, is a reason for transgender people to delay coming out to their families until they have reached adulthood. Parental confusion and lack of acceptance of a transgender child may result in parents treating a newly revealed gender identity as a \"phase\" or making efforts to change their children back to \"normal\" by using mental health services to alter the child's gender identity.\nThe internet can play a significant role in the coming out process for transgender people. Some come out in an online identity first, providing an opportunity to go through experiences virtually and safely before risking social sanctions in the real world. But, while many trans people find support online that they may not have in real life, others encounter bullying and harassment. According to a study published by Blumenfeld and Cooper in 2012, youth who identify as LGBTQ are 22 percent less likely to report online bullying because they may have parents who do not believe or understand them, or they fear having to come out in order to explain the incident. This further shows the barriers that trans individuals can have when coming out.\nComing out as transgender can be more complex than coming out as a sexual minority. Visible changes that can occur as part of changing one's gender identity\u00a0\u2013 such as wardrobe changes, hormone replacement therapy, and name changes\u00a0\u2013 can make coming out to other people less of a choice. Further, elements that accompany a change in gender can have financial, physical, medical, and legal implications. Additionally, transgender individuals can experience prejudice and rejection from sexual minorities and others in the LGBTQ community, in addition to the larger LGBTQ bias they can face from mainstream culture, which can feel isolating.\nAsexual and aromantic identity.\nAsexual and aromantic people might experience different challenges when coming out that other individuals in the LGBTQ community may not face. The 2018 National LGBT Survey in the United Kingdom found that only 17 percent of asexuals received positive responses when coming out, in comparison to over 40 percent for other LGBTQ people. A 2016 study found that asexual individuals commonly experienced skepticism and misunderstanding over the existence of their identity when coming out as asexual. A 2024 review by Michael Paramo noted that asexual and aromantic people are commonly tasked with educating people about their identities when coming out because of a lack of understanding over their existence.\nAsexual and aromantic people may face risks of sexual assault, coercion, or other pressures to conform to sexual or romantic behavior from their sexual or romantic partners or external to their relationships. They can also experience being rejected by a partner or love interest for being asexual or aromantic, which may make some asexual and aromantic people tentative to come out. A 2023 study co-authored by Yasmin Benoit found that asexual people in the UK were unlikely to reveal their identity within healthcare settings for fear of being pressured to conform to sexual behavior. Online role models may be helpful for asexual people when coming out because of a lack of representation surrounding asexuality.\nLegal issues.\nIn areas of the world where homosexual acts are penalized or prohibited, gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people can suffer negative legal consequences for coming out. In particular, where homosexuality is a crime, coming out may constitute self-incrimination. These laws still exist in 75 countries worldwide, including Egypt, Iran, and Afghanistan.\nPeople who decide to come out as non-binary or transgender often face more varied and different issues from a legal standpoint. Worldwide, legally changing your documented gender or name based on your identity is often prohibited or extremely difficult. A major negative effect of the inequality in regulations comes in the form of mental effects, as transgender people who have to legally announce a gender they do not identify with or their dead name can face uncomfortable situations and stress.\nEffects.\nIn the early stages of the LGBTQ identity development process, people can feel confused and undergo turmoil. In 1993, Michelangelo Signorile wrote \"Queer in America\", in which he explored the harm caused both to a closeted person and to society in general by being closeted.\nBecause LGBTQ people have historically been marginalized as sexual minorities, coming out of the closet remains a challenge for most of the world's LGBTQ population and can lead to a backlash of heterosexist discrimination and violence against LGBTQ people.\nStudies have found that concealing sexual orientation is related to poorer mental health, physical health, and relationship functioning. For example, it has been found that same-sex couples who have not come out are not as satisfied in their relationships as same-sex couples who have. Findings from another study indicate that the fewer people who know about a lesbian's sexual orientation, the more anxiety, less positive affectivity, and lower self-esteem she has. Further, Gay.com states that closeted individuals are reported to be at increased risk for suicide.\nDepending on the relational bond between parents and children, a child coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender can be positive or negative. Strong, loving relationships between children and their parents may be strengthened but if a relationship is already strained, those relationships may be further damaged or destroyed by the child coming out. If people coming out are accepted by their parents, it allows open discussions of dating and relationships and enables parents to help their children with coping with discrimination and to make healthier decisions regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Because parents, families, and close others can also reject someone coming out, the LGBTQ individual may not always enjoy positive effects from the decision. For example, teens who had parents who rejected them when they came out showed more drug use, depression, suicide attempts, and risky sexual behaviors later on as young adults. Some studies find that the health effects of coming out depend more on the reactions of parents than on the disclosure itself.\nA number of studies have been done on the effect of people coming out to their parents. A 1989 report by Robinson et al. of parents of out gay and lesbian children in the United States found that 21 percent of fathers and 28 percent of mothers had suspected that their child was gay or lesbian, largely based on gender atypical behavior during childhood. The 1989 study found that two-thirds of parents reacted negatively. A 1995 study (that used young people's reactions) found that half of the mothers of gay or bisexual male college students \"responded with disbelief, denial or negative comments\", while fathers reacted slightly better. 18 percent of parents reacted \"with acts of intolerance, attempts to convert the child to heterosexuality, and verbal threats to cut off financial or emotional support\".\nIf rejected by their families, many LGBTQ youth can become homeless during the coming out process. LGBTQ youth are among the largest population of homeless youth; this has typically been caused by the reaction of others, especially parents, to self-identification and acknowledgment of being gay, or identifying with the LGBTQ community. About 20 to 30 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ. Native and Indigenous LGBTQ youth make up the largest population to suffer homelessness: 44 percent, compared to any other race. 55 percent of homeless LGBTQ and 67 percent of homeless transgender youth were forced out of their homes by their parents or ran away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity and expression. Compared to transgender women and non-binary youth, transgender men have the highest percentage of housing instability. Homelessness among LGBTQ youth also affects many areas of an individual's life, leading to higher rates of victimization, depression, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, and participation in more illegal and dangerous activities. A 2016 study on homelessness pathways among Latino LGBTQ youth found that homelessness among LGBTQ individuals can also be attributed to structural issues such as systems of care, and sociocultural and economic factors.\nNew data was collected by Amit Paley, the CEO and executive director of the Trevor Project, in regards to how the COVID-19 pandemic affected LGBTQ youth. The 2021 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health shows that COVID-19 had made 80 percent of the LGBTQ youth housing situation much more stressful due to economic struggles, initially affecting their ability to have safe and secure housing.\nJimmie Manning performed a study in 2015 on positive and negative behavior performed during the coming out conversation. During his study, he learned that almost all of his participants would attribute negative behaviors only to themselves during the coming out conversations, and positive behaviors to the recipient of the conversation. Manning suggests further research into this to figure out a way for positive behaviors to be seen and performed equally by both the recipient and the individual coming out.\nIn/out metaphors.\nDichotomy.\nThe closet narrative sets up an implicit dualism between being \"in\" or being \"out\", wherein those who are \"in\" are often stigmatized as living false, unhappy lives. Likewise, philosopher and critical analyst Judith Butler (1991) states that the \"in/out\" metaphor creates a binary opposition which pretends that the closet is dark, marginal, and false, and that being out in the \"light of illumination\" reveals a true (or essential) identity. Nonetheless, Butler is willing to appear at events as a lesbian and maintains that \"it is possible to argue that\u00a0... there remains a political imperative to use these necessary errors or category mistakes\u00a0... to rally and represent an oppressed political constituency\".\nCriticisms.\nDiana Fuss (1991) explains, \"the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric\u00a0... is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time\". Further, \"To be out, in common gay parlance, is precisely to be no longer out; to be out is to be finally outside of exteriority and all the exclusions and deprivations such outsiderhood imposes. Or, put another way, to be out is really to be in\u00a0\u2013 inside the realm of the visible, the speakable, the culturally intelligible.\" In other words, coming out constructs the closet it supposedly destroys and the self it supposedly reveals, \"the first appearance of the homosexual as a 'species' rather than a 'temporary aberration' also marks the moment of the homosexual's disappearance\u00a0\u2013 into the closet\".\nFurthermore, Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999) argue that \"the closet\" may be becoming an antiquated metaphor in the lives of modern-day Americans for two reasons.\nHowever, when understood as an act of self-disclosure, coming out (like any self-disclosure) cannot be accomplished once, and for all. Eve Sedgwick writes in \"Epistemology of the Closet\": the deadly elasticity of heterosexist presumption means that \u2026 people find new walls springing up around them even as they drowse: every encounter with a new classful of students, to say nothing of a new boss, social worker, loan officer, landlord, doctor, erects new closets whose fraught and characteristic laws of optics and physics exact from at least gay people new surveys, new calculations, new draughts and requisitions of secrecy or disclosure.\nAs Tony Adams demonstrates in \"Narrating the Closet\", meeting new people makes for a new time to disclose one's sexuality.\nNational Coming Out Day.\nObserved annually on 11 October, by members of the LGBTQ communities and their allies, National Coming Out Day is an international civil awareness day for coming out and discussing LGBTQ issues among the general populace in an effort to give a familiar face to the LGBTQ rights movement. This day inspired the United States government to recognize October as LGBTQ History Month.\nThe day was founded in 1988, by Robert Eichberg, his partner William Gamble, and Jean O'Leary to celebrate the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights one year earlier, in which 500,000 people marched on Washington, DC, to promote gay and lesbian equality.\nIn the United States, the Human Rights Campaign manages the event under the National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBTQ individuals, couples, parents, and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of LGBTQ families living honest and open lives. Candace Gingrich became the spokesperson for the day in April 1995. Although still named \"\"National\" Coming Out Day\", this day is observed in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland also on 11 October, and in the United Kingdom on 12 October. To celebrate National Coming Out Day on 11 October 2002, Human Rights Campaign released an album bearing the same title as that year's theme: \"Being Out Rocks\". Participating artists include Kevin Aviance, Janis Ian, k.d. lang, Cyndi Lauper, Sarah McLachlan, and Rufus Wainwright.\nMedia.\nHighly publicized comings-out.\nAthletes.\nThe first US professional team-sport athlete to come out was David Kopay, a former NFL running back who had played for five teams (San Francisco, Detroit, Washington, New Orleans and Green Bay) between 1964 and 1972. He came out in 1975 in an interview in the \"Washington Star\".\nThe first professional athlete to come out while still playing was Czech-American tennis player Martina Navratilova, who came out as a lesbian during an interview with \"The New York Times\" in 1981. English footballer Justin Fashanu came out in 1990 and was subject to homophobic taunts from spectators, opponents and teammates for the rest of his career.\nIn 1995 while at the peak of his playing career, Ian Roberts became the first high-profile Australian sports person and first rugby footballer in the world to come out as gay. John Amaechi, who played in the NBA with the Utah Jazz, Orlando Magic and Cleveland Cavaliers (as well as internationally with Panathinaikos BC of the Greek Basketball League and Kinder Bologna of the Italian Basketball League), came out in February 2007 on ESPN's \"Outside the Lines\" program. He also wrote a memoir, \"Man in the Middle\", published by ESPN Books, which explores his professional and personal life as a closeted basketball player. He was the first NBA player (former or current) to come out.\nIn 2008, Australian diver Matthew Mitcham became the first openly gay athlete to win an Olympic gold medal. He achieved this at the Beijing Olympics in the men's 10-meter platform event.\nThe first Irish county GAA player to come out while still playing was hurler D\u00f3nal \u00d3g Cusack in October 2009, in previews of his autobiography. Gareth Thomas, who played international rugby union and rugby league for Wales, came out in a \"Daily Mail\" interview in December 2009 near the end of his career.\nIn 2013, American basketball player Jason Collins (a member of the Washington Wizards) came out as gay, becoming the first active male professional athlete in a major North American team sport to publicly come out as gay.\nOn 15 August 2013, WWE wrestler Darren Young came out, making him the first openly gay active professional wrestler.\nOn 9 February 2014, former Missouri defensive lineman Michael Sam came out as gay. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams on 10 May 2014, with the 249th overall pick in the seventh round, making him the first openly gay player to be drafted by an NFL franchise. He was released by St. Louis and waived by the Dallas Cowboys practice squad.

Her real-life coming out was echoed in the sitcom \"Ellen\" in \"The Puppy Episode\", in which her character Ellen Morgan outs herself over the airport public address system.\nOn 29 March 2010, Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin came out publicly in a post on his official web site, stating, \"I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man. I am very blessed to be who I am.\" Martin said that \"these years in silence and reflection made me stronger and reminded me that acceptance has to come from within and that this kind of truth gives me the power to conquer emotions I didn't even know existed.\" Singer Adam Lambert came out after pictures of him kissing another man were publicly circulated while he was a participant on the eighth season of \"American Idol\". In January 2013, while accepting the honorary Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, American actress and director Jodie Foster made the first public acknowledgment of her sexual orientation, saying; \"I already did my coming out a thousand years ago, in the Stone Age, in those very quaint days when a fragile young girl would open up to friends and family and co-workers then gradually to everyone that knew her, everyone she actually met.\"\nMilitary personnel.\nIn 1975, Leonard Matlovich, while serving in the United States Air Force, came out to challenge the US military's policies banning service by homosexuals. Widespread coverage included a \"Time\" magazine cover story and a television movie on NBC.\nIn 2011, as the US prepared to lift restrictions on service by openly gay people, Senior Airman Randy Phillips conducted a social media campaign to garner support for coming out. The video he posted on YouTube of the conversation in which he told his father he was gay went viral. In one journalist's summation, he \"masterfully used social media and good timing to place himself at the centre of a civil rights success story\".\nPastors.\nIn October 2010, megachurch pastor Bishop Jim Swilley came out to his congregation. The YouTube video of the service went viral. Interviews with \"People\" magazine, Joy Behar, Don Lemon ABC News and NPR focused on bullycides which Bishop Swilley said had prompted him to \"come out\". One year later, he confirmed the costs but also the freedom he has experienced. \"To be able to have freedom is something that I wouldn't trade anything for.\" \"Being married as yourself, preaching as yourself and living your life as yourself is infinitely better than doing those things as someone else.\"\nBishop Swilley's son, Jared Swilley, bass player and front man of Black Lips, said, \"It was definitely shocking, but I was actually glad when he told me. I feel closer to him now\". Bishop Swilley's second son, Judah Swilley, a cast member on the Oxygen show \"Preachers of Atlanta\", is confronting homophobia in the church.\nJournalists.\nIn August 2019, Nicky Bandini, a sportswriter and broadcaster contributing at \"The Guardian\" and ESPN came out as transgender, saying that she had previously written under the name Paolo Bandini. She posted a Twitter video and published an opinion piece in \"The Guardian\", saying that it took her several years to come out as transgender. Bandini said she had dealt with gender dysphoria for three-and-a-half decades before finally admitting her status as a trans woman to the world.\nDepictions of coming out.\nIn 1987, a two-part episode of the Quebec television series \"Avec un grand A\", \"Lise, Pierre et Marcel\", depicted a married closeted man who has to come out when his wife discovers that he has been having an affair with another man. In 1996, the acclaimed British film \"Beautiful Thing\" had a positive take in its depiction of two teenage boys coming to terms with their sexual identity.\nAuthor Rodger Streitmatter described Ellen DeGeneres's coming out in the media as well as a 1997 episode of \"Ellen\", \"The Puppy Episode\", as \"rank[ing], hands down, as the single most public exit in gay history\", changing media portrayals of lesbians in Western culture. In 1999, Russell T Davies's \"Queer as Folk\", a popular TV series shown on the UK's Channel 4, debuted and focused primarily on the lives of young gay men; in particular on a 15-year-old going through the process of revealing his sexuality to those around him. This storyline was also featured prominently in the US version of \"Queer as Folk\", which debuted in 2000.\nThe television show \"The L Word\", which debuted in 2004, focuses on the lives of a group of lesbian and bisexual women. The theme of coming out is prominently featured in the storylines of multiple characters.\nIn the Emmy Award-nominated episode \"Gay Witch Hunt\" of \"The Office\", Michael inadvertently outs Oscar to the whole office.\n\"Coming Out\", which debuted in 2013, is the first Quebec television program about being gay.\nAmazon's 2014 series \"Transparent\" features a trans woman who comes out to her adult children at the age of 75, and follows her social transition process. The show highlights various reactions from the woman's social circle to her coming out, as well as the many adjustments in language and gender expression that she uses to make her transition. Main character Maura is played by Jeffrey Tambor; the show was criticized by some for casting a cisgender man as a transgender woman.\nThe third season of the Norwegian teen drama series \"Skam\", released in 2015, focused on a main character coming out and his relationship with another boy.\nThe film \"Love, Simon\", based on the book \"Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda\", debuted in 2018. It is the first major studio film about a gay teenager coming out.\nIn 2020, a second adaption, called \"Love, Victor\", began airing on Hulu. The TV series refers to both the \"Love, Simon\" film and the \"Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda\" book. The series premiered its third season in 2022. The series continued and expanded its original story with another young and closeted student.\nExtended use in LGBTQ media, publishing and activism.\n\"Out\" is a common word or prefix used in the titles of LGBTQ-themed books, films, periodicals, organizations, and TV programs. Some high-profile examples are \"Out\" magazine, the defunct \"OutWeek\", and OutTV.\nNon-LGBTQ contexts.\nIn political, casual, or even humorous contexts, \"coming out\" means by extension the self-disclosure of a person's secret behaviors, beliefs, affiliations, tastes, identities, and interests that may cause astonishment or bring shame. Some examples include: \"coming out as an alcoholic\", \"coming out as a BDSM participant\", \"coming out of the broom closet\" (as a witch), \"coming out as a conservative\", \"coming out as disabled\", \"coming out as a liberal\", \"coming out as intersex\", \"coming out as multiple\", \"coming out as polyamorous\", \"coming out as a sex worker\", and \"coming out of the shadows\" as an undocumented immigrant within the United States. The term is also used by members of online body integrity dysphoria communities to refer to the process of telling friends and families about their condition.\nWith its associated metaphors, the figure of speech has also been extended to atheism, e.g., \"coming out as an atheist\". A public awareness initiative for freethought and atheism, entitled the \"Out Campaign\", makes ample use of the \"out\" metaphor. This campaign was initiated by Robin Elisabeth Cornwell, and is endorsed by prominent atheist Richard Dawkins, who stated \"there is a big closet population of atheists who need to 'come out'\".\nImpact of COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the order of people to whom LGBTQ children revealed their identity was impacted. Traditionally, children confide in friends before going to their families, but this order has been reversed. It is emphasized that even in these cases, children only tell their families first if they are accepting.\nThe shift in global circumstances during the pandemic has played a role in the coming out experience for a great number of LGBTQ people. Many were forced to be in unaccepting environments during this time. American LGBTQ people faced a higher risk for negative consequences from the pandemic than their straight counterparts. A lower percentage of these individuals have health coverage, a higher percentage smoke, and a higher percentage maintain employment in vulnerable industries. All of these factors contribute to worse consequences for this population during the pandemic.\nThe LGBTQ community saw increased feelings of isolation during this time, impacting their coming out experiences. Many individuals described how they lacked an avenue in which to connect with the LGBTQ community, reducing their ability to gain confidence in their identity. Researchers argue that this is seriously detrimental to an already isolated community. However, the ample time for reflection proved beneficial for some individuals regarding their self-image and discovery. Some people were able to come to terms with their identity and increase their confidence as a result. Others felt like the increase in the community's online presence has allowed for more interaction with the community than before.\nThe lack of in-person celebrations during Pride Month, which is typically held in June, affected the connectedness of the community. These circumstances affecting this important time for the community have reduced the confidence in which LGBTQ people feel comfortable sharing their identities. These face-to-face events are argued to be community-building events. Researchers argue that a crucial aspect of their support system has vanished without them.\nThese unprecedented global circumstances may have caused individuals to potentially postpone their coming out, influencing their unique stories. It describes how the pandemic has forced many LGBTQ youth to remain in non-accepting households. This, they argue, may also delay their coming out process as well. Mental health may also have been affected as a result of being stuck in these environments. LGBTQ adults faced unique challenges compared to their youth counterparts. Significant job loss compared to non-LGBTQ counterparts occurred, affecting their economic vitality, whereas much of the youth population was forced to remain at home.\nThere are several instances of the openness of the LGBTQ identity being a disadvantage in the pandemic setting among various countries. In the Philippines, a lesbian couple did not receive food aid during the pandemic because they did not fit the traditional definition of a family. In this instance, the disclosure of their identity did not prove to be in their best interests. The country also resorted to public humiliation when dealing with three gay men who broke the curfew rules.\nIn terms of gender minorities, several disruptions occurred within the medical environment hindering gender-affirming procedures. Many interruptions occurred with in-person appointments as well. Economic disparities have also played a role in the transgender experience.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are witches, who rode through the sky on the back of flying bucks provided to them by the Devil to rob and murder common people and church possessions. The trials against the buckriders differed from 'ordinary' criminal proceedings because in many cases a so-called 'ungodly oath' was involved (\"I renounce God and swear submission to the Devil\"). Once a year, they would visit their master, the Devil, on the 'Mook Heath. \nThroughout the 18th century, groups of thieves and other criminals adopted the belief to frighten the inhabitants of southern Limburg, a province in the southern part of the Netherlands and in parts of what has become since eastern Belgium. Using the name \"Bokkenrijders\" (buckriders), these criminal bands launched raids across a region that included Limburg, and parts of modern-day Germany. In response to the robberies towns in Limburg started to build defences like moats around them and farms started to develop a closed square building style. \nThe buckriders were feared and despised by the common people throughout the area because of the ruthlessness and violence the robberies were committed by. The belief existed that the buckriders could travel fast and vast distances through the skies to rob in a widespread area and be home before dawn to remain obscured in their crimes. \nCommonly, the buckriders raided small communities, parsonages, churches and more remote farms. Hundreds of buckriders were convicted and sentenced to death. \nBecause of the link to the occult and witchcraft, authorities accused a large number of potentially innocent men of being buckriders and the majority of suspects were tortured and subsequently convicted of crimes they initially denied having committed. The buckriders were considered both criminals and witches that made a pact with the devil. The witch trials and robbery trials can not be seen separately in that sense: the accusations always included both robbery and witchcraft.\nIt is estimated that about 1200 men were accused and at least between 425 and 468 men were executed between 1743 and 1796 on the conviction of being a Buckrider. The number of deaths might surpass 500 men due to suspects dying under torture when questioned.\nEtymology.\nFormally, the name \"Bokkenrijders\" (buckriders) was first publicly used in 1774, during the 'trial of Wellen', a town in what belonged then to the Southern Netherlands. Johan van Muysen slid a letter underneath the door of a farmer called Wouters. The letter contained a threat that Wouters's house would be burned down unless he paid up. Van Muyses claimed to be member of the buckriders and used the word Satan up to three times. In the trial of Wellen, the term \u201cbuckriders\u201d is openly used against Philip Mertens, who wrote a similar threat letter.'\nHistory.\nEarliest records mentioning the buckriders originate from a tome called \"Oorzaeke, bewys en ondekkinge van een goddelooze, bezwoorne bende nagtdieven en knevelaers binnen de landen van Overmaeze en aenpalende landstreeken\", which approximately translates to \"Causes, proof and discovery of a godless, averted gang of night thieves and gaggers within the lands of 'Overmaas' and adjacent regions.\" \nThis book was written in 1779 by S.J.P. Sleinada (real name Pastor A. Daniels). \nThis pastor, who lived in Landgraaf, knew several buckriders personally. The author tells us that these robbers made a pact with the Devil and rode their bucks at night. \nThe common people told stories about them flying through the sky, pronouncing the following spell: 'Over huis, over tuin, over staak, en dat tot Keulen in de wijnkelder!' (across houses, across gardens, across stakes (fences), even to Cologne into the wine cellar!). \nBoth worshiping and riding a goat have been associated with the Witches' Sabbath and other devilish practices for centuries. According to old folk tales, people who had made a pact with the devil moved at night on bucks.\nThe present interpretation is that a number of criminal gangs robbed houses and committed other crimes, using the myth to their advantage. Also, many of the buckriders that were arrested are thought to be innocent, as confessions were obtained through torture. The condemnation of people because of an impious oath or their alleged alliance with the devil can be compared to the witch trials in Europe between 1450 and 1750 with brutal persecutions. \nIn the Overmaasse trials the term 'buckriders' is only mentioned late, probably under the influence of the trial in Wellen. The word 'buck' does appear here in a lawsuit in 1773. In that trial, Mathijs Smeets from Beek claimed that he and 42 others had sat on large bucks at night and flown to Venlo to commit a robbery there.\nIn historiography, two opposing observations arise about the buckriders:\nThe first view is found among those who believed that the buckriders have really formed a large gang and had not yet been punished harshly enough. Critical historians, however, who do not accept the torture statements at face value, consider the punishment exaggerated. The pioneer of this trend, Attorney General Gaspard de Limpens, wrote in 1774 about the convicts: \"Their statements are full of contradictions, varying versions and violations of logic and the laws of gravity.\" \"They have been punished too harshly and the majority are innocent.\" \"The torture makes those questioned confess what the justice system wants to hear.\"\nBuckriders and witch-hunts.\nThe fact that the buckriders were tried and prosecuted for their pact with the devil, resembles the witch-hunts during the Early Modern Period. Historians place these buckrider-hunts alongside other prosecuted 'godless' people: heretics and witches. These kinds of fullscale trials last took place in Limburg.\nLimburg was the last European region where such superstitious legal excesses took place en masse.\nThe witches were a popular belief, but also in the eyes of the justice system witches were a reality. The accused were convicted on the basis of witchcraft as much as the robbery charges and they were in most cases executed when found guilty. It is unclear how many people were involved in the actual robberies and that were convicted for it, but the widespread area and long period of time these occurred suggests many smaller groups. This played into the belief that the buckriders could travel fast and vast distances through the skies to rob in a widespread area. \nThe trials against the buckriders differed from 'ordinary' criminal proceedings because in many cases a so-called 'ungodly oath' was involved (\"I renounce God and swear to the devil\"). This impious oath, typical of buckriders in this tradition, is said to have originated in the Lands of Overmaas (according to the trial of Hendrik Becx in Nieuwstadt in 1743) and then spread to Loon.\nDuring the 18th century there were seven buckrider trials. In the Wellen-Haspengouw trial, this is stated in black and white in the court documents. A common question there is: \"Aren't you a member of the gang from across the Meuse, the so-called buckriders?\" That is why people speak of buckriders in the sense that they are suspects and convicts of massive witch trials conducted in that sense. The witch trials and robbery trials can not seen separately in that sense: the accusations always included both.\nRaids and raiders.\nTrials against buckriders differed from 'common trials against common criminals' if the suspect had performed the god-denying oath: 'I forswear God ... etc.' This so-called oath of heresy is a stereotypical aspect of the buckriders myth. Since the convicts were accused of this oath and a pact with the devil, we can define this as a late form of witch-hunt. \nProsecution of buckriders were ruthless, even by those day's standards. More than 90% of the convicted received capital punishment. Many confessions were gained by means of torture, or by fear for it.\nThere are seven periods of different buckrider trials. The first took place during 1743 \u2013 1745, and the last during 1793 \u2013 1794.\nCultural Significance.\nIn Limburg, the buckriders are now embraced as part of cultural heritage.\nIn the 19th century, under the influence of Romanticism, a flood of stories about buckriders emerged, pioneered by the Sittard author Pieter Ecrevisse. As of 2015, more than 1,300 titles have been published on the subject. In the buckrider story, crime is strongly linked to magic and witchcraft. These popular themes resulted in a colorful collection of folk tales, in which the subject has become increasingly distant from historical facts.\nIn Valkenburg, the buck weeks take place every year in October with various activities, including the bokkem\u00e9rt (buck market) and the Witches' Kitchen is a reminder of the gang of robbers. The buckriders festival takes place in Klimmen each year.\nA plaque was installed in 1999 on the facade of the Museum Land van Valkenburg, formerly the town hall of Valkenburg and the scene of the Valkenburg buckrider trials in the 18th century, in memory of the many innocent convicts. The buckriders play a major role in Valkenburg folklore. For example, the residents of the Geul city are referred to as b\u00f6k (\"bucks\") during carnival time. In the park at Den Halder Castle there is a bronze statue of a buck that refers to the nickname of residents, not directly to the gang. Since October 2016, there has also been a monument in Klimmen that commemorates the miscarriage of justice where 60 executions took place in five years at the end of the 18th century. In the center of Schaesberg in the municipality of Landgraaf there is a statue of a buckrider, just like in Stein, Sint Joost, Geleen, in Herzogenrath (Germany) and in Maaseik, Wellen and Overpelt (Belgium).\nSeveral carnaval groups are named after the buckriders throughout the affected area.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In a typical infectious disease, the incubation period signifies the period taken by the multiplying organism to reach a threshold necessary to produce symptoms in the host.\nWhile \"latent\" or \"latency period\" may be synonymous, a distinction is sometimes made whereby the latent period is defined as the time from infection to infectiousness. Which period is shorter depends on the disease. A person may carry a disease, such as \"Streptococcus\" in the throat, without exhibiting any symptoms. Depending on the disease, the person may or may not be contagious during the incubation period.\nDuring latency, an infection is subclinical. With respect to viral infections, in incubation the virus is replicating. This is in contrast to viral latency, a form of dormancy in which the virus does not replicate. An example of latency is HIV infection. HIV may at first have no symptoms and show no signs of AIDS, despite HIV replicating in the lymphatic system and rapidly accumulating a large viral load. People with HIV in this stage may be infectious.\nIntrinsic and extrinsic incubation period.\nThe terms \"intrinsic incubation period\" and \"extrinsic incubation period\" are used in vector-borne diseases. The intrinsic incubation period is the time taken by an organism to complete its development in the definitive host. The extrinsic incubation period is the time taken by an organism to develop in the intermediate host.\nFor example, once ingested by a mosquito, malaria parasites must undergo development within the mosquito before they are infectious to humans. The time required for development in the mosquito ranges from 10 to 28 days, depending on the parasite species and the temperature. This is the extrinsic incubation period of that parasite. If a female mosquito does not survive longer than the extrinsic incubation period, then she will not be able to transmit any malaria parasites.\nBut if a mosquito successfully transfers the parasite to a human body via a bite, the parasite starts developing. The time between the injection of the parasite into the human and the development of the first symptoms of malaria is its intrinsic incubation period.\nDetermining factors.\nThe specific incubation period for a disease process is the result of multiple factors, including:\nExamples for diseases in humans.\nDue to inter-individual variation, the incubation period is always expressed as a range. When possible, it is best to express the mean and the 10th and 90th percentiles, though this information is not always available.\nFor many conditions, incubation periods are longer in adults than they are in children or infants.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for his work on stage and screen, he is arguably the most influential figure in the field of jazz dance in the twentieth century. He received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, three Primetime Emmy Awards, nine Tony Awards, and the Palme d'Or. \nFosse started his career acting in the musical productions of \"Call Me Mister\" (1947), \"Billion Dollar Baby\" (1951), and \"Pal Joey\" (1952). He transitioned into directing and choreographing musical works, winning Tony Awards for choreographing \"The Pajama Game\" (1954), \"Damn Yankees\" (1955), \"Redhead\" (1959), \"Little Me\" (1963), \"Sweet Charity\" (1966), \"Pippin\" (1972), \"Dancin\"' (1978), and \"Big Deal\" (1986), as well as for directing \"Pippin\". He also worked on \"Bells Are Ringing\" (1956), \"New Girl in Town\" (1958), \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\" (1961), and \"Chicago\" (1975). \nOn film he played Hortensio in the MGM musical \"Kiss Me Kate\" (1953) and had his directorial debut with the musical \"Sweet Charity\" (1969). He won the Academy Award for Best Director for the musical drama \"Cabaret\" (1972). He was Oscar-nominated for directing the dramas \"Lenny\" (1974) and \"All That Jazz\" (1979), the latter of which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. He is also known for directing the concert film \"Liza with a Z\" (1972), which earned him the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Special, and his final film \"Star 80\" (1983).\nFosse forged an uncompromising modern style, characterized by finger-snapping, tilted bowler hats, fishnet stockings, splayed gloved fingers, turned-in knees and toes, shoulder rolls, and jazz hands. Fosse's third wife was the actor\u2013dancer Gwen Verdon, with whom he collaborated on a number of theater and film projects.\nEarly life.\nFosse was born in Uptown, Chicago, Illinois, on June 23, 1927, to Norwegian-American father Cyril Kingsley Fosse, a traveling salesman for Hershey, and Irish-American mother Sarah Alice \"Sadie\" (n\u00e9e Stanton) Fosse. He was the fifth of six children.\nHe was drawn to dance and took lessons. When he was 13 years old, Fosse performed professionally in Chicago with Charles Grass as \"The Riff Brothers\". They toured vaudeville and movie houses in Chicago, as well as USO theaters and Eagles Clubs. Many of these performances included shows at burlesque clubs such as the Silver Cloud and Cave of Winds. Fosse himself is quoted with saying, \"I was sixteen years old, and I played the whole burlesque wheel.\" However, many of the women and promoters did not care that Fosse was underage working in adult clubs or that he would be exposed to sexual harassment from the burlesque women. Much of the erotica he saw would inspire his future work. In 1943 at the age of 15, Fosse would come to choreograph his first dance number and earn his first full credit as a choreographer in a film, \"Hold Evry'thing! A Streamlined Extravaganza in Two Parts\", which featured showgirls wearing strapless dresses and performing a fan dance, inspired by his time in burlesque houses.\nAfter graduating from Amundsen High School in 1945, Fosse was recruited into the U.S. Navy toward the end of World War II at Naval Station Great Lakes, where he was sent to be prepared for combat. Fosse petitioned his manager, Frederick Weaver, to advocate on his behalf to his superiors after his own failed attempts to be placed in the Special Services Entertainment Division. Fosse was soon placed in the variety show \"Tough Situation\", which toured military and naval bases in the Pacific Ocean.\nCareer.\n1947\u20131953: Contract with MGM.\nAfter his discharge, Fosse moved to New York City in 1947 with the ambition of being the new Fred Astaire. He began to study acting at the American Theatre Wing, where he met his first wife and dance partner, Mary Ann Niles (1923\u20131987). His first stage role was in \"Call Me Mister\", along with Niles. In 1948 Tony Charmoli danced in \"Make Mine Manhattan\" but gave the part to Fosse when the show toured nationally. Charmoli also found Fosse work as a dancer on the TV shows he was working on when Fosse returned from the tour.\nFosse and Niles were regular performers on \"Your Hit Parade\" in its 1950\u20131951 season. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis saw their act in New York's Pierre Hotel and scheduled the couple to appear on \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\" in 1951.\nFosse was signed to an MGM contract in 1953. His early screen appearances as a dancer included \"Give a Girl a Break\", \"The Affairs of Dobie Gillis\", and \"Kiss Me Kate\", all released in 1953. Fosse's choreography of a short dance sequence during \"From This Moment On\" in \"Kiss Me Kate\" and his dance with Carol Haney brought him to the attention of Broadway producers. In \"Kiss Me Kate\", Fosse starred alongside Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, and Ann Miller. Fosse played Hortensio within \"The Taming of the Shrew\" dance sequences.\n1954\u20131968: Work as a choreographer.\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, Fosse transitioned from film to theatre. Fosse told an interviewer, \"Jerry [Jerome Robbins] started me doing choreography. He gave me my first job as a choreographer [Pajama Game] and I'm grateful for that.\" \nIn 1954 Fosse choreographed his first stage musical, \"The Pajama Game\", followed by \"My Sister Eileen\" and George Abbott's \"Damn Yankees\" in 1955. It was during \"Damn Yankees\" when he first met rising star Gwen Verdon, whom he married in 1960. For her work in \"Damn Yankees\" in 1956 Verdon won her first Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. She had previously won a Tony for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical for \"Can-Can\" (1954). In 1957 Fosse choreographed \"New Girl in Town\", also directed by Abbott, and Verdon won her second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 1958.\nAlso in 1957 Fosse choreographed the film version of \"The Pajama Game\", starring Doris Day. The next year, Fosse appeared in and choreographed the film version of \"Damn Yankees,\" in which Verdon reprised her stage triumph as the character Lola. Fosse and Verdon were partners in the mambo number \"Who's Got the Pain\". In 1959 Fosse directed and choreographed the stage musical \"Redhead\". For his work on \"Redhead\" Fosse won the Tony Award for Best Choreography, while Verdon won her third Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. \"Redhead\" also won the Tony Award for Best Musical. Fosse's next feature was supposed to be the musical \"The Conquering Hero\", based on a book by Larry Gelbart, but he was replaced as director/choreographer.\nIn 1961 Fosse choreographed the satirical Broadway musical \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\", starring Robert Morse. The story revolves around an ambitious man, J. Pierrepont Finch (Morse), who, with the help of the book \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\", rises from window washer to chairman of the board of the World Wide Wicket Company. The musical was an instant hit. In 1963 Fosse was nominated for two Tony Awards, Best Choreography and Best Direction of a Musical for \"Little Me\", winning the former. He choreographed and directed Verdon in \"Sweet Charity\" in 1966.\n1969\u20131979: Transition as a film director.\nFosse directed five feature films. His first, \"Sweet Charity\" (1969), starring Shirley MacLaine, is an adaptation of the Broadway musical he had directed and choreographed. In 1972 Fosse directed his second theatrical film, \"Cabaret\", starring Liza Minnelli, Michael York, and Joel Grey. The film is based on the 1966 musical of the same name. In the traditional manner of musical theater, called an \"integrated musical\", every significant character in the stage version sings to express his or her own emotion and to advance the plot. In the film version, however, the musical numbers are entirely diegetic. The film focuses on a romance between Sally Bowles (Minnelli), who performs at the Kit Kat Klub, and a young British idealist, Brian Roberts, played by York, set during the final days of Weimar Germany. It was an immediate success among audiences and critics alike, winning eight Academy Awards, including Best Director. Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey both won Oscars for their roles. That same year, Fosse and Minnelli collaborated on the concert film \"Liza with a Z\", earning Fosse an Emmy Award for both direction and choreography.\nIn 1973 Fosse's work on \"Pippin\" won him the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical. He was director and choreographer of \"Chicago\" in 1975, which starred Verdon. In 1974 Fosse directed \"Lenny\", a biographical film about the controversial standup comedian Lenny Bruce, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman. Fosse was again nominated for Best Director; Hoffman also received a nomination for Best Actor. Fosse performed a number in Stanley Donen's 1974 film version of \"The Little Prince\". According to \"AllMusic\", \"Bob Fosse stops the show with a slithery dance routine.\" In 1977 Fosse had a small role in the romantic comedy \"Thieves\".\nIn 1979 Fosse co-wrote and directed a semi-autobiographical film, \"All That Jazz\" (1979), starring Roy Scheider, which portrayed the life of a womanizing, drug-addicted choreographer and director in the midst of triumph and failure. Ann Reinking appears in the film as the protagonist's lover, prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, and domestic partner. \"All That Jazz\" won four Academy Awards, earning Fosse his third Oscar nomination for Best Director. It also won the Palme d'Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" described the film as \"Mr. Fosse's answer to \"8\u00bd\" in which Federico Fellini wittily examined his own life at a point when he feared his creativity was at an end\".\nWriting for \"The New Yorker\" in 1974, Pauline Kael was fond of Fosse, mentioning that she didn't know of \"any other director who entered moviemaking so late in life and developed such technical proficiency\", going on to say that she found Fosse \"a true prodigy.\"\n1980\u20131986: Final works.\nFosse's final film, \"Star 80\" (1983), was a biographical movie, based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning article, about Dorothy Stratten, a \"Playboy\" Playmate who was murdered. The film was screened out of competition at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival. Critic Roger Ebert in his four-star review of the film wrote, \"Although his Broadway musicals have been upbeat entertainments, he seems to see the movie camera as a device for peering into our shames and secrets...This is an important movie. Devastating, violent, hopeless, and important, because it holds a mirror up to a part of the world we live in and helps us see it more clearly.\"\nIn 1986 Fosse wrote, choreographed, and directed the Broadway production of \"Big Deal\", which was nominated for five Tony awards, winning for Best Choreography, as well as five more for the revival of \"Sweet Charity\" at the nearby Minskoff Theater, winning a Tony Award for Best Revival. Fosse began work on a film about gossip columnist Walter Winchell that would have starred Robert De Niro. The \"Winchell\" script was written by Michael Herr. Fosse died before starting the project.\nInnovations.\nNotable distinctions of Fosse's style included the use of turned-in knees, the \"Fosse Amoeba\", sideways shuffling, rolled shoulders, and jazz hands. With Astaire as an influence, Fosse used props such as bowler hats, canes, and chairs. His trademark use of hats was also influenced by his own self-consciousness, according to Martin Gottfried in his biography of Fosse: \"His baldness was the reason that he wore hats, and was doubtless why he put hats on his dancers.\" Fosse used gloves in his performances because he did not like his hands. Some of his most popular numbers include \"Steam Heat\" (\"The Pajama Game\") and \"Big Spender\" (\"Sweet Charity\"). The \"Rich Man's Frug\" scene in \"Sweet Charity\" is another example of his signature style.\nFor \"Damn Yankees\", Fosse was inspired by the \"father of theatrical jazz dance\", Jack Cole. In 1957 Verdon and Fosse studied with Sanford Meisner to develop a better acting technique. According to Michael Joosten, Fosse once said: \"The time to sing is when your emotional level is too high to just speak anymore, and the time to dance is when your emotions are just too strong to only sing about how you 'feel.'\"\nIn \"Redhead\", Fosse used one of the first ballet sequences in a show that contained five different styles of dance: Fosse's jazz, a cancan, a gypsy dance, a march, and an old-fashioned English music hall number. During \"Pippin\", Fosse made the first television commercial for a Broadway show.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and relationships.\nFosse married dance partner Mary Ann Niles (1923\u20131987) on May 3, 1947, in Detroit. In 1952, a year after he divorced Niles, he married dancer Joan McCracken in New York City; they divorced in 1959.\nHis third wife was dancer and actress Gwen Verdon, whom he met choreographing \"Damn Yankees\", in which she starred. In 1963 they had a daughter, Nicole Fosse, who later became a dancer and actress. Fosse's extramarital affairs put a strain on the marriage and by 1971 they were separated, although they remained legally married until his death in 1987. Verdon never remarried. During their joint career, Fosse would continually take blame from critics while Gwen Verdon would get praise, no matter how much influence Verdon had on a production. However, Verdon always looked out for him and the Fosse family image, hosting grandiose cast parties and being Fosse's personal press secretary throughout their marriage.\nFosse met dancer Ann Reinking during the run of \"Pippin\" in 1972. According to Reinking, their romantic relationship ended \"toward the end of the run of \"Dancin'\"\" (1978). Reinking acted in his musical drama film \"All That Jazz\", which was loosely based on Fosse's life.\nFosse also dated actresses Jessica Lange and Dyan Cannon.\nIllness and substance abuse.\nIn 1961 Fosse's epilepsy was revealed when he had a seizure onstage during rehearsals for \"The Conquering Hero\".\nFosse's time outside of the rehearsal studio or theater was seldom spent alone. As stated in the biography \"Fosse\" by Sam Wasson, \"nights alone were murder on Fosse\". To alleviate loneliness and insomnia brought on by his prescribed amphetamines, Fosse would often contact dancers he would work with and try to date them, making it hard for many to refuse his advances, but also giving him the affirmation of success he sought.\nDeath.\nFosse died of a heart attack on September 23, 1987, at George Washington University Hospital while the revival of \"Sweet Charity\" was opening at the nearby National Theatre. He had collapsed in Verdon's arms near the Willard Hotel. As he had requested, Verdon and Nicole Fosse scattered his ashes in the Atlantic Ocean off Quogue, Long Island, where Fosse had been living with his girlfriend of four years. A month after his death, Verdon fulfilled Fosse's request for his friends to \"go out and have dinner on me\" by hosting a star-studded, celebrity-filled evening at Tavern on the Green with Verdon, Reinking, Jessica Lange, Roy Scheider, Ben Vereen, and E. L. Doctorow attending.\nAwards, honors, and legacy.\nAt the 1973 Academy Awards, Fosse won the Academy Award for Best Director for \"Cabaret\". That same year he won Tony Awards for directing and choreographing \"Pippin\" and Primetime Emmy Awards for producing, choreographing and directing Liza Minnelli's television special \"Liza with a Z\". Fosse was the only person to win all three major industry awards in the same year.\nFosse was inducted into the National Museum of Dance in Saratoga Springs, New York, on April 27, 2007. The Los Angeles Dance Awards, founded in 1994, were called the \"Fosse Awards\", and are now called the American Choreography Awards. The Bob Fosse\u2013Gwen Verdon Fellowship was established by their daughter, Nicole Fosse, in 2003 at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.\nReinking and Verdon kept Fosse's unique choreography alive after his death. Reinking played the role of Roxie Hart in the New York revival of \"Chicago\", which opened in 1996. She choreographed the dances in Fosse style for that revival. In 1999, Verdon served as artistic consultant on a Broadway musical designed to showcase examples of classic Fosse choreography. Called simply \"Fosse\", the three-act musical revue was conceived and choreographed by Chet Walker, directed and co-conceived by Richard Maltby, Jr., and co-directed, co-choreographed by co-conceived by Ann Reinking. Verdon and Fosse's daughter, Nicole, received a special thanks credit. The show won a Tony for best musical.\n\"Fosse/Verdon\" is an eight-part American miniseries starring Sam Rockwell as Fosse and Michelle Williams as Verdon. The series, which tells the story of the couple's troubled personal and professional relationship, is based on the biography \"Fosse\" by Sam Wasson. It premiered in eight parts on April 9, 2019, on FX. At the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, \"Fosse/Verdon\" received seventeen nominations, including Outstanding Limited Series and acting nominations for Rockwell, Williams, and Qualley. Williams won the Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a Limited Series.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "71574", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71574", "title": "Viking metal", "text": "Subgenre of heavy metal\nViking metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by a lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age. Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some consider it more a cross-genre term than a genre, but it is typically heard as black metal with influences from Nordic folk music. Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both sung and harsh vocals, a reliance on folk instrumentation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect.\nViking metal emerged from black metal during the late 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an opposition to Christianity, but rejecting Satanism and occult themes in favor of the Vikings and paganism. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part of the broader modern Pagan movements, as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities.\nThough artists such as Led Zeppelin, Yngwie Malmsteen, Heavy Load, Manowar, and many others had previously dealt with Viking themes, Bathory from Sweden is generally credited with pioneering the style with its albums \"Blood Fire Death\" (1988) and \"Hammerheart\" (1990), which launched a renewed interest in the Viking Age among heavy metal musicians. Enslaved, from Norway, followed up on this burgeoning Viking trend with \"Hordanes Land\" (1993) and \"Vikingligr Veldi\" (1994). Burzum, Emperor, Einherjer, and Helheim, among others, helped further develop the genre in the early and mid-1990s. As early as 1989 with the founding of the German band Falkenbach, Viking metal began spreading from the Nordic countries to other nations with Viking history or an even broader Germanic heritage and has since influenced musicians across the globe. The death metal bands Unleashed, Amon Amarth, and Ensiferum, which emerged in the early 1990s, also adopted Viking themes, broadening the style from its primarily black metal origin.\nBackground.\nVikings.\nViking metal features the Vikings as its subject matter and for evocative imagery. The Vikings were Northern European seafarers and adventurers who, during the Middle Ages, relied on sailing vessels such as longships, \"knerrir\", and \"karvi\" to explore, raid, pirate, trade, and settle along the North Atlantic, Baltic, Mediterranean, Black Sea, and Caspian coasts and Eastern European river systems. The Viking Age is generally cited as beginning in 793, when a Viking raid struck Lindisfarne, and concluding in 1066, with the death of Harald Hardrada and the Norman conquest of England. During this two-hundred-year period, the Vikings ventured west as far as Ireland and Iceland in the North Atlantic and Greenland and what is now Newfoundland in North America, south as far as the Kingdom of Nekor (Morocco), Italy, Sicily, and Constantinople in the Mediterranean, and southeast as far as what are now Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine in Eastern Europe, Georgia in the Caucasus, and Baghdad in the Middle East.\nThe Vikings originated from the Nordic countries and the Baltic states, and consisted mostly of Scandinavians, though Finns, Estonians, and Curonians, went on voyages as well. S\u00e1mi people also closely interacted with the Scandinavian Norse and engaged in widespread trade expeditions. While otherwise disparate peoples, they shared some commonalities in that they were not considered \"civilized\" and were not, at first, adherents to Christianity, instead following their indigenous Nordic and Finnic religions. They often adopted Christianity upon settling in an area, intermixing the faith with their own pagan traditions, and by the end of the Viking Age, all Scandinavian kingdoms were Christianized and what remained of Viking cultures was absorbed into Christian Europe.\nNordic folk music.\nNordic folk music encompasses traditions from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and the dependent countries \u00c5land, Faroe Islands, and Greenland, and nearby regions. Specific instruments vary between countries and regions, but some common instruments include the lur, s\u00e4ckpipa, Hardanger fiddle, keyed fiddle, willow flute, harp, mouth harp, and animal horns. Common genres in Nordic folk include ballads, herding music, and dance music, genres which trace back to the medieval era. Often, Nordic melodies will contain the phrase C2-B-G.\nIn Swedish folk music, songs are monophonic, unemotional, and solemn in character, though working and festive songs might be more lively and rhythmic. Danish songs melodies tend to lean toward the major. In Icelandic folk music, the \"r\u00edmur\", a form of epic poem dating back to the medieval era and Viking Age, is prominent. Faroese music contains dances directly descended from medieval ballad and epic poems, particularly from literature in the Icelandic tradition, and often follows unusual time signatures. Many Norwegian folk ballads follow a four-stanza structure known as stev. Stev alternate a trochaic tetrameter with a trimeter, and lines typically rhyme following an ABCB scheme, though stev are not standardized. Finnish folk music tends to be based on Karelian traditions and the meter and thematic material found in the \"Kalevala\". These themes include magic, mysticism, shamanism, Viking sea voyages, Christian legends, and ballads and dance songs. The older \"runo\" song tradition follows meters such as , , or . Under Swedish and German influence, a newer, round-dance tradition based on the \"runo\" emerged \u2013 the \"rekilaulu\" \u2013 and these usually follow a or time. S\u00e1mi music traditions (music from the S\u00e1mi people throughout Fennoscandia) historically were rather insular, exerting little influence on the music of surrounding cultures. S\u00e1mi music is known for joiking, improvised singing particular to the performer. These songs are often sung accompanied by a drum.\nBlack metal.\nBlack metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that, mostly in Europe, emerged from speed metal and thrash metal in the 1980s. A \"first wave\" began in the early to mid-1980s, through the work of bands such as Venom, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Mercyful Fate, and Bathory. The name black metal is taken from the 1982 album of the same name by Venom, while Bathory's 1984 self-titled release is generally regarded as the first true black metal record. A \"second wave\" developed in part as a reaction to the burgeoning death metal genre, and in part inspired by the Teutonic thrash metal scene. It was headed by the early Norwegian black metal scene, through artists such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon, Thorns, Ulver, and Gorgoroth. The early Norwegian scene became infamous for murders, assaults, and numerous church arsons committed by members of the scene. Black metal lyrical themes are focused on Satan and Satanism, which many first-wave bands used with a tongue-in-cheek approach, contrary to the more serious beliefs and vehement anti-Christian sentiment of many second-wave bands.\nMusically, the first wave of bands were just considered to be playing heavier forms of metal \u2013 Venom was part of the new wave of British heavy metal, Celtic Frost was variously described as thrash metal or death metal, and Quorthon of Bathory simply labeled his music \"heavy metal\". It was not until the second wave that black metal was more clearly defined. A key development during that period was a guitar playing style featuring fast, un-muted tremolo picking or \"buzz picking\", introduced by Euronymous of Mayhem and Snorre Ruch (\"Blackthorn\") of Thorns. Other common traits for guitar playing include a high-pitched or treble guitar tone and heavy distortion. Solos and dropped tunings are rare. Overall, the guitar sound tends to be \"thin and brittle\" compared to other heavy metal genres, with the idea of \"heaviness\" conveyed through harshness and timbral density rather than low frequency. The bass guitar tends to be buried under the guitar tones, even non-existent. Drums and even vocals are likewise often mixed low, with these production techniques resulting in a blurred \"wash\" of sound. Vocals are usually high-pitched and raspy shrieks, screams, and snarls, and rarely gutturals and death growls are also employed. The use of keyboards is also frequent.\nThe influence of Scandinavian folk music within Norwegian black metal is apparent in the use by some guitarists belonging to that scene of drones and modal melodies reminiscent of the folk tradition. Terje Bakken of Windir explained that ancient Nordic folk is easily integrated into metal idiom due to the \"sad atmosphere\" the two genres have in common. Production values within black metal are often raw and lo-fidelity. Originally, this was merely because many early second-wave bands lacked the resources to record properly, but the practice was continued by successful bands in order to identify with their genre's underground origins. Though featuring these common traits, black metal spawned diverse musical approaches and subgenres, with some bands taking more experimental and avant-garde directions. Other bands, such as Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir, embraced a more commercial sound and production aesthetic instead.\nPrecursors.\nThe use of Viking themes and imagery in hard rock and heavy metal music predates the advent of Viking metal. For instance, the lyrics to Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song\" (1970) and \"No Quarter\" (1973) feature allusions to Viking voyages, violence, and exploration, the former being inspired by the band's visit to Iceland while on tour. The Swedish band Heavy Load often wrote Viking-themed songs, such as the 1978 song \"Son of the Northern Light\" and the 1983 songs \"Singing Swords\" and \"Stronger than Evil\" from their album \"Stronger Than Evil\" (which features an imagined Norse warrior on the cover art), the latter song which music journalist Eduardo Rivadavia claims establishes a case for Heavy Load as the first Viking metal group. Silver Mountain, another Swedish group, according to Rivadavia possessed better \"Viking metal credentials\" than any other predecessors to the genre; they released the song \"Vikings\" in 1983 on their album \"Shakin' Brains\".\nMany other bands in the early and mid-1980s featured Viking-themed music. Two British groups released Viking-themed songs: Iron Maiden released \"Invaders\", a song about Norse marauders from their album \"The Number of the Beast\", and A II Z released \"Valhalla Force\" on their extended play \"No Fun After Midnight\". In 1985, the American group Pantera released the song \"Valhalla\" on their album \"I Am the Night\", and the American band Crimson Glory released a song of the same name a year later on their self-titled debut. Swedish neoclassical metal guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen sometimes featured themes of hyper-masculinity, heroic warriors, and Vikings; for example, on his 1985 album\" Marching Out\". The British band Blitzkrieg's 1985 album \"A Time of Changes\" frequently references Viking themes with songs such as \"Ragnorak\" and \"Vikings\". Elixir, also from Britain, titled their 1986 debut \"The Son of Odin\", an album which includes a song of the same name that urges listeners to put their faith in Odin.\nThe German band Grave Digger and American band Manowar, both of which formed in 1980, drew upon Norse myth as envisioned in Richard Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\". Faithful Breath \u2013 which wore fur and horned helmet costumes \u2013 and TNT also experimented with Viking themes. Manowar adopted Viking imagery much more heavily than other bands, turning out copious amounts of songs devoted to Viking lore, and became known as the \"champions of the furry loincloth\"; they met with ridicule even within the metal community but attracted a cult following. Unlike the later Viking metal bands, Manowar did not bother with the historicity of popular Viking image, and did not in any way identify with the Vikings, religiously or racially. Trafford and Pluskowski explain that \"the Manowar version of the Vikings owes as much to Conan the Barbarian as it does to history, saga, or Edda: What matters to Manowar is untamed masculinity, and the Vikings are for them merely the archetypal barbarian males.\" Similarly, Vlad Nichols of Ultimate Guitar states that on Heavy Load's \"Stronger Than Evil\", which might be the earliest contribution to the idea of Viking metal, most of the songs have as much to do with historical Vikings as the 1958 \"The Vikings\" film; that is, the portrayal of Norsemen is of warmongering invaders at best, and more so uses the Vikings as a means to sing about macho, loin-cloth wearing barbarians.\nCharacteristics.\nMusical traits.\nThe term \"Viking metal\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \"slow black metal\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \"folk to black to death metal\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \"swift, galloping pace\". These artists often add \"local cultural flourishes\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls.\nOverall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal. Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \"etiquette\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly shifting, as trends and fads emerge and fade.\" From its origins in black metal, Viking metal \"has diversified (at least in aural terms), and now covers a range of styles that run the gamut between black metal and what one might justifiably term classic rock\". Christopher McIntosh writes that Viking metal, Viking rock, pagan metal, folk metal, neofolk, and more could all fall under a broader genre term of \"neo-Nordic.\"\nStarting with the album \"Blood Fire Death\", one of the first definitive Viking metal releases, Bathory incorporated a diverse range of musical elements. While retaining the noise and chaos of previous recordings, the band took a more sorrowful and melodic approach, working in ballads based on Germanic and Norse folklore, shanty-like melodies, ambience, choral intros, acoustic instruments, anthemic sections, and folk music elements such as bourdon sounds, Jew's harps, and fifes. Bathory added natural found sounds, such as ocean waves, thunder, and wild animal noises, in a style similar to that of \"musique concr\u00e8te\". Instruments were sometimes used to create onomatopoeic effects such as drum sounds imitating thunder or a sledgehammer. The songs typically featured multi-sectional formal structures, following a pattern of three instrumental sections\u00a0\u2013 introduction, bridge, and finale\u00a0\u2013 and two vocal sections\u00a0\u2013 stanza and refrain.\nEnslaved, a formative band in Viking metal, performs primarily a black metal style, but has over time become more progressive. Eduardo Rivadavia described the hallmarks of Enslaved as \"Viking themes, razor sharp guitars, blastbeat drums, and an ear for orchestration resulting in complex structures, bountiful harmonies and time changes.\" The band evolved significantly with every album since \"Mardraum \u2013 Beyond the Within\" (2000).\nThe Faroese band T\u00fdr has a standard rock band lineup with electric instruments, but makes extensive use of traditional Faroese music in its songs. Faroese ballads typically involve unusual time signatures, most commonly or the alternative rhythms or . In an attempt to replicate these uneven signatures, T\u00fdr often places the accent on the weak beat of the bar. In songs based on old Faroese ballads, T\u00fdr usually play in harmonic or melodic minor scale or else in mixolydian mode.\nInfluence from sea shanties and popular media.\nMulvany states that \"Viking metal\u00a0... is much less concerned with traditional aural materials like instruments and melodies. Instead, Viking bands limit themselves mainly to the use of Norse mythology as a textual source, which they often augment with stylized shanty-like melodies that are meant to evoke apropos images\". He elaborates: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although the majority of Viking metal bands\u00a0... limit themselves primarily to textual borrowings, many others can be additionally classified as musically evocative of the Vikings. Unlike folk metal bands drawing from other mythologies, bands using Norse mythology as text have no musical-historical examples to augment their illusion. This has led to the creation of an ahistorical 'Viking music' that is used in tandem with the metal style to conjure up appropriate images. According to Mulvany, Viking metal draws heavily on sea shanties and media images of pirates and Vikings, an influence evident in two basic forms of the genre. The first type \"is largely stepwise in motion with many repeated note figures\", is frequently in minor key, and is primarily sung in unison. The second type uses an \"arching ascent-descent structure\" and is less dependent on lyrics, making it \"more evocative of rolling waves on the open sea\". As examples of the first type, Mulvany examined the structures of sea shanties such as \"Drunken Sailor\", the 1934 and 1996 film soundtrack versions of \"Dead Man's Chest\", Mario Nascimbene's \"Viking\" song for the 1958 film \"The Vikings\", and the chant from Monty Python's \"Spam\" sketch, and found similar structures in compositions by Viking and black metal bands such as Einherjer, Mithotyn, Naglfar, and Vargevinter. The second type, that of arching ascent and descent, Mulvany noticed in compositions by Einherjer and Borknagar.\nThe shanty influence results from stereotyping in which certain aural associations are equated with \"images of sailors, sea-borne marauders, and Vikings\", and \"though rooted in traditional sea shanties, these aural images have been perpetuated through the media of pirate movies and television shows, and they have been extended\u00a0\u2013 by association\u00a0\u2013 to Vikings\". Ashby and Schofield agree with Mulvany that musically, Viking metal bands generally are unconnected with a real Viking past, but instead connote a broader sense of the maritime, presuming that \"this conflation of maritime contexts is a knowing one, but one nonetheless felt to be somehow evocative.\"\nKeith Fay of the folk metal band Cruachan has also noted the influence of sea shanties on Viking metal, although disparagingly. In an interview with British magazine \"Terrorizer\", he said that there is \"no real defined 'Viking music', so all these Nordic bands use 'sea shanty' type tunes to match their music. A lot of these bands, especially the bigger ones, are called folk metal but they don't really understand what real folk music is; though I know this is not true for all of them.\"\nThematic and lyrical focus.\nThematically, Viking metal draws extensively on elements of black metal, but the lyrics and imagery are pagan and Norse rather than anti-Christian or Satanic. It combines the exaltation of violence and virility through weapons and battlefields, which is common to many death and black metal bands, with an interest in ancestral roots, particularly a pre-Christian heritage, which is expressed through Viking mythology and imagery of northern landscapes. Some bands such as Sorhin keep the Satanic elements of black metal but musically are influenced by more recent folk tunes.\nVisuals such as album art, band photos, website design, and merchandise all highlight the dark and violent outlook of Viking metal lyrics and themes. Seascapes and Viking ships are commonly invoked by Viking metal artists. For example, the cover to \"Blodhemn\" (1998) by Enslaved, which features the band as Viking warriors with their boat anchored behind them, or the cover to \"D\u00f6dsf\u00e4rd\" (2003) by M\u00e5negarm, which features a stereotypical Viking funeral. The art on albums by Viking metal artists frequently depicts Viking Age archeological finds: Thor's hammers are especially common, but other artifacts such as Oseberg posts, runestones, and even the Sutton Hoo helmet have appeared (though this last artifact is neither Viking nor from the Viking age). Some bands incorporate far more ancient, pre-medieval imagery, such as the Finnish band Moonsorrow's use of prehistoric rock carvings and megaliths. Other Finnish bands, such as Ensiferum, Turisas, and Korpiklaani, focus on S\u00e1mi traditions and shamanism, further stretching the definition of Viking metal. Not all bands rely on Viking-related visuals or other ancestral images to aid their musical character: for instance, the members of T\u00fdr do not wear Viking costumes on stage, and only their folk-influenced music and lyrical themes distinguish them from other heavy metal bands.\nWhile heavy metal throughout its history has referenced the occult, Viking metal bands use a very specific mythology, which informs their textual choices, album imagery, and, frequently, musical compositions. Despite a whole pantheon of Norse gods to choose from, Viking metal bands typically focus on Odin, the god of war, and on Thor and his hammer. Alcohol, particularly mead, is also a common lyrical focus. Viking metal bands tend to follow one of two approaches. The first is one of romanticism and escapist ideas, where bands cultivate an image of strength and barbarism and quote passages from various poems and sagas. For example, English professor Heather Lusty writes that the lyrical content of Amon Amarth is historically inaccurate and is misappropriated to glorify drinking and pillaging. The second approach emphasizes historical accuracy, typically relying on Norse mythology as the sole focus of lyricism and identity. The multi-national group Heilung include excerpts of texts from the Viking Age and broader Germanic Iron Age in their song lyrics. Many Viking metal bands identify first with local roots\u00a0\u2013 for instance, Moonsorrow with Finland, Einherjer with Norway, Sk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld with Iceland\u00a0\u2013 with a wider northern European identity coming second.\nMany songs are composed in English, but Viking metal bands often write lyrics in other languages, usually of the North Germanic family\u00a0\u2013 Norwegian, Old Norse, Swedish, Danish and, less commonly, Icelandic and Faroese\u00a0\u2013 and also in Finnish, which is non-Germanic and of the Finno-Ugric family. Other historic and contemporary European languages, such as the Germanic languages Old English, German, Old High German, Proto-Norse, Dutch, Gothic, and West Frisian, as well as Latin, S\u00e1mi languages, or Gaulish are sometimes used. Heavy metal fans around the world sometimes learn languages such as Norwegian or Finnish in order to understand the lyrics of their favorite bands and improve their appreciation of the music. Irina-Maria Manea considers this preference to sing in a native language, along with the imagery of album covers, and stage performances which often involve warrior costumes, weapons, and sometimes reenactments, a demonstration of a v\u00f6lkisch aspect to Viking metal. Specifically, the thematic focus of Viking metal bands conceptualizes ethnicity as uniform, unchanged history from \"time immemorial,\" which is, state Manea, \"precisely in the \"v\u00f6lkisch\" framework.\"\nPaganism and opposition to Christianity.\nThe imagery in Viking metal draws upon the material culture created during the Viking Age, but \u2014 according to Trafford and Pluskowski \u2014 it also \"encompasses the broad semiotic system favored by many black and death metal bands, not least of all the exultation of violence and hyper-masculinity expressed through weapons and battlefields\". In Viking metal this semiotic system is melded with an interest in ancestral roots, specifically a pre-Christian heritage, \"expressed visually through Viking mythology and the aesthetics of northern landscapes\". Extreme and obsessive loathing of Christianity had long been the norm for black and death metal bands, but in the 1990s Bathory and many other bands began turning away from Satanism as the primary opposition to Christianity, instead placing their faith in the Vikings, Norse pantheon figures such Odin, Thor, and Loki, and trolls and beasts. Many artists claim affiliation to the modern Pagan religion of Heathenry, treating Christianity as a foreign influence that was forcibly imposed, and therefore as a wrong to be righted.\nSome members of the Norwegian black metal scene were motivated to take violent action against this influence \u2013 for instance, the church burnings by black metal musicians Varg Vikernes, Samoth, Faust, and J\u00f8rn Inge Tunsberg, among others. While most bands or individuals did not go that far, an undercurrent of racism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism continues to permeate parts of the black metal scene. Many Viking metal artists, including bands such as Enslaved and Einherjer, simply express interest in Vikings and Norse mythology and entirely reject the Satanic inclination of black metal, writing almost exclusively on Norse themes, without any racist or anti-Semitic undertones. Whereas black metal during the 1990s took a militant and destructive stance toward the status quo, Viking metal looked to the past and took a populist, anti-system approach which eschewed violence. Viking metal is both pre-Christian and post-apocalyptic\u00a0\u2013 it looks to a pre-Christian past and imagines a post-Christian future. While opposition to Christianity drove the formation of Viking metal, some bands that play, or have played, Viking metal, such as Slechtvalk, Drottnar, Vard\u00f8ger, and Holy Blood, subscribe to Christian beliefs.\nDavid Keevill argues that the explicitly anti-Christian attitude of most Viking metal artists is an anachronistic view of the Viking Age. Keevill explains that \"while bands have used [Viking mythology] as the basis for their musical existence\u00a0... the historical reality of the Viking Age (late 8th century to the 11th century) is a chequered backdrop of a multitude of belief systems and disparate political mechanisms\". As an historical example, he cites the raid on Lindisfarne in 793, an event considered the beginning of the Viking Age and celebrated by Enslaved in its song \"793 (Slaget Om Lindisfarne)\". He contends that this attack was merely an opportunistic raid, not a concerted attack on the growing power of Christianity, and that the terms \"heathen\" and \"pagan\" historically did not necessarily mean \"anti-Christian\", but that the people in question did not fit under a denominational label. Furthermore, Norse religion and Christianity intermingled and influenced each other throughout the era, and Christianity was often imposed through monarchical regimes such as Harald Klak and Harald Bluetooth or conversion movements such as those initiated by Ansgar. Keevill concludes that, \"It's not that bands like Amon Amarth shouldn't flout their Norse heritage, the bellicose nature of the ancestors or the kind of practices that would have taken place in far flung tribal societies, it's just that ruling out the presence of an overbearing Christian influence on the Viking Age is incredibly close-minded.\"\nRelationship to pagan metal.\nViking metal has been considered the progenitor of the pagan metal genre, with Bathory's \"Hammerheart\" as the first pagan metal recording. Weinstein writes that \"it is fitting that pagan metal began with Viking metal, given that the Vikings were Europe's last Pagans, converted slowly and with reluctance to Christianity\". Imke von Helden explains some key differences: \"[Pagan metal] deals mainly with Pagan religions and lies in a broader context where not only Old Norse mythology is dealt with, but also Celtic myths and history, fairy tales and other elements of folklore. Traditional instruments like the violin or flute are used more often in pagan than in Viking metal music.\" The idea of incorporating and revering exclusively national or regional myths, stories, and tales first took root in the work of artists such as Adorned Brood, Falkenbach, Black Messiah, Enslaved or Einherjer, but, as a musical phenomenon, has grown far beyond Europe into a global trend in which artists express their affinity with an ethnic heritage. Viking metal, along with pagan and folk metal, forms part of a trend within cultural heritage movements toward wider acceptance of the heritage of ordinary and the everyday life, not just nationally significant and the iconic imagery, and also a trend to explore the outer reaches of heritage, where the definitions of heritage and heritage communities are stretched and contested. Baldrs Drauma, a West Frisian band, stated in an interview that they \"find it important that people in general (so, not only Frisians but everyone around the world) know where they come from, what their history is, who they are and what led to this point in history. We find that during this digital age, people are searching for their identity, and what better way to research that than with the awesome tunes that we provide?\" \nMasculinity, heroism, and racial identity.\nAccording to music studies scholar Catherine Hoad, the Viking image in popular understanding is that of hypermasculinity, and thus Viking metal is inherently patriarchal. While some bands, such as Kivimets\u00e4n Druidi, Storm, and Irminsul, have included female members, and female fans comprise a substantial part of Viking metal's audience, it is argued that women are subordinated within the Viking metal scene, and are rarely present in the production of Viking metal music, which can be seen as a form of \"nation-building\": while women may participate in the nation building process, it is still controlled by men. Within Viking metal, themes of war and masculinity predominate. Hoad also contends that black and Viking metal express whiteness through a confluence of notions of nation, nature, monstrosity, and masculinity. Per Hoad, constructions of \"authentic\" nationhood continue to be directly informed by conceptions of race. The ethnoromantic fantasy of Vikings and pagans as premodern people subsisting off of the land is informed by the confluence of nationalism, racialism, and masculinity. \"Unknowable\" land is valorized, econationalism is fiercely advocated, and wilderness is prized as simultaneously impermeable to, yet under threat, from globalization. \"Authentic\" Nordic whiteness is contested against what is perceived as the colonizing force of Christianity and the weakening of society via modernism. Hoad argues that \"the ethnonationalism of Norwegian metal then emerges through textual representations of Norway, and Norwegian whiteness, as terrifying and discomforting; yet ancient, pure, elite and unique.\" Whiteness, writes Hoad, is embedded within a wider national effort of \"maintaining Norwegianness in an increasingly globalised context.\" Hoad does not believe that this understanding of Norwegian metal means that these scenes are inherently racist or fascist, but rather acknowledges that representations of Nordic history within both metal music and broader nationalist discussions exist within a dominant structure of power which can and has been used to support the cultural hegemony of whiteness.\nSome artists, such as Burzum, link manliness with Norse tradition and gender ideals, and thus see the Viking male as representing traditional masculinity. Most of the Norse references in black metal are heroic, masculine, and militaristic in theme\u00a0\u2013 Mj\u00f6lnir, Odin, the Iron Cross, and berserkers and einherjar. Conversely, Jesus, though a male figure, is seen in songs such as \"Jesu d\u00f8d\" by Burzum as cold, dark, and life-extinguishing. Christianity is viewed as stigmatizing and suppressing the natural \"dark\" sides of men, and so, from the perspective of black metal, true masculinity is achieved through exploring the dark sides of man's nature\u00a0\u2013 warfare and killing. Sociologist Karl Spracklen notes that the folk music band Wardruna does not play black metal at al yet was nonetheless immediately accepted by black metal fans both because some black metal artists had transitioned from black metal to neofolk, drone, or ambient music and because Wardruna is \"heroic, masculine and associated with the well-worn epic trope of Viking metal\".\nCultural historian Nina Witoszec found that within Norway, images of nature are often symbolic with cultural affiliation to Norway. Witoszec traces the roots of this ideal to Tacitus's German-heathen identity narrative which romanticized the Germanic people as superior through their connection with nature, and whose brutality and belligerence opposed the apathetic and decadent Roman elite. Within black metal, Norse imagery is used to build a view of natural and authentic masculinity to counter the oppressive force of the Judeo-Christian tradition.\nHistory.\nBathory.\nThe roots of Viking metal are generally found in Scandinavian metal, particularly the death and black metal scenes of the late 1980s. Inspired by the Viking themes used by Manowar, some bands identified with the Vikings far more completely than Manowar. At the forefront of this movement stood the Swedish band Bathory, which influenced the emergence not only of Viking metal but also of folk metal, medieval folk, and neofolk. The band's fourth album \"Blood Fire Death\", released in 1988, includes two early examples of Viking metal\u00a0\u2013 the songs \"A Fine Day to Die\" and \"Blood Fire Death\". The cover to \"Blood Fire Death\" even features \"The Wild Hunt of Odin\", a painting by Norwegian artist Peter Nicolai Arbo which depicts the Norse god Odin on a Wild Hunt. Vlad Nichols writes that while the parts of the album that were dedicated to Viking themes had more in common with Wagnerian imagination than Nordic music, the album \"came closer to an intuited essence of a 'Viking feel' in music than any before\". Bathory followed up on this Viking theme in 1990 with the release of \"Hammerheart\", a concept album fully devoted to Vikings. Like its predecessor, this album features a Viking-themed painting, this time \"The Funeral of a Viking\" by Sir Frank Dicksee. Following up this release were 1991's \"Twilight of the Gods\", titled after Wagner's opera of the same name, and \"Blood on Ice\", recorded in 1988\u20131989 but released in 1996. \"Hammerheart\" is considered a landmark that introduced the metal world to the Viking metal archetype. With this album, Quorthon, the band's founder, inspired a generation of Nordic teens, and seeded a deep anti-Christian sentiment which culminated in the violence and hate crimes committed by members of the Norwegian black metal community in the early 1990s. The artistic choices by Quorthon contain v\u00f6lkisch elements which emphasize a return to heathen Europe rather than a \"destructive\" Christianity. Quorthon later explained, in the liner notes to \"Blood on Ice\", that his shift to Viking themes was an intentional move away from Satanism: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I came to the personal conclusion that this whole Satanic bit was a fake: a hoax created by another hoax\u00a0\u2013 the Christian church, the very institution they were attempting to attack using Satanic lyrics in the first place. Since I am an avid fan of history, the natural step would be to find something in history that could replace a thing like the dark side of life. And what could be more simple and natural than to pick up on the Viking era? Being Swedish and all, having a personal relation to, and linked by blood to, that era at the same time as it was an internationally infamous moment in history, I sensed that here I might just have something. Especially well suited was it since it was an era that reached its peak just before the Christian circus came around northern Europe and Sweden in the tenth century, establishing itself as the dictatorial way of life and death. And so that Satan and hell type of soup was changed for proud and strong nordsmen, shiny blades of broadswords, dragon ships and party-'til-you-puke type of living up there in the great halls.\u2014\u200a\nBathory's Viking metal features Wagnerian-style epics, ostentatious arrangements, choruses, and ambient keyboards. Mulvany notes that Bathory's 1990s work marks the beginning of a Viking-themed trend initially slow, even confusing, in formation. For example, the Austrian black metal band Abigor incorporated Viking themes and Germanic paganism in \"Unleashed Axe-Age\", the first track on its 1994 album \"Nachthymnen\", but said it \"should not be seen as a part of the upcoming Viking trend\". According to Mulvany, \"The Viking trend presaged by Abigor was actually taking place around them, and it remains more 'true' to how black metal is often defined than the folk influenced metal that followed. Its folk elements are predominantly textual or musically evocative rather than musically-historically accurate.\"\nEnslaved.\nEnslaved, formed in Norway in 1991, has also been cited as the first truly Viking metal band, with the 1993 EP by the band, \"Hordanes Land\", named as the first true Viking metal release. A review of \"Eld\" (1997) noted that \"Among the countless bands who were inspired by Bathory's seminal Viking metal, arguably none were as true to its gospel as Norway's Enslaved, whose utmost commitment even extended to donning vintage Norse armor and outfits on-stage\". The band's 1994 debut album \"Vikingligr Veldi\" had \"many melodies being borrowed from ethnic Scandinavian folk music to lend additional authenticity to the vicious, fast-paced black metal\". Inspired by Bathory, Enslaved set out to \"create Viking metal devoted to retelling Norway's legends and traditions of old\u00a0\u2013 not attacking Christianity by means of its own creation: Satan.\" Its second album \"Frost\", also released in 1994, served as \"an important release for the extreme music subgenre of Viking metal\". Though the previous recordings by Enslaved all featured the same thematic material, \"Frost\" was the first album that Enslaved described as Viking metal. This album also defined the band's lyrical approach. \"Decibel\" explains that on \"Frost\", bassist and vocalist Grutle Kjellson \"knew it was time to reclaim the gods and goddesses of his ancestors, especially if it meant his version of things would inevitably clash with the Christianized fairytales so often associated with Nordic myth.\"\nBurzum.\nIdeologically, Varg Vikernes's one-man project Burzum helped inspire the Viking metal scene through his strongly held racist, nationalistic, and anti-Judeo-Christian beliefs, and his longing for a return to paganism. In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, \"His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in \"The Lord of the Rings\", and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'.\" They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes \"cloak his actions in an O\u00f0inic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning\". While in prison, Vikernes released the book \"Vargsm\u00e5l\", which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the \"H\u00e1vam\u00e1l,\" though with \"an eye on \"Mein Kampf\"\". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, \"proving both that it is not just the early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator\".\nVikernes himself has connected the church burnings to an idea of resurgent Viking paganism. The first such burning, that of Fantoft Church on June 6, 1992, was thought by many to be related to Satanism, since the burning occurred on the sixth day of the week, on day six of the sixth month and was thus a reference to the Number of the Beast. Vikernes contends that the date June 6 was really picked because the first recorded Viking raid (upon Lindisfarne) occurred, according to Vikernes, on June 6, 793. Quorthon acknowledged that nationalist elements had always been present in the Viking metal scene, and, in the early 1990s, these elements hardened into explicit racism and anti-Semitism, particularly among Heathen adherents. By the late 1990s, Viking metal pulled back from the neo-Nazi direction toward which it was headed, once many musicians from the Oslo scene died or were jailed.\nOther pioneers.\nBesides Bathory, Enslaved, and Burzum, several other artists are credited as pioneers of the style. The original bassist for Emperor, H\u00e5vard Ellefsen, also known as Mortiis, was \"an indispensable force in the genesis of Norway's epic Viking metal sound.\" Despite Ellefsen's short tenure in the band, it was his musical interests that catalyzed the band to mix chaotic black metal with synthesizer melodies based on Norwegian folk music.\nHelheim was another major pioneer in the early scene. Helheim emerged on the scene before other bands such as Einherjer and Thyrfing, when even Enslaved was in its infancy. Not only was Helheim one of the first bands to meld black metal with Viking themed-music, but one of the first to include stylistically unconventional instruments such as horns and violins. Robert M\u00fcller of \"Metal Hammer\" \"Germany\" argues that Viking metal never solidified as a genre, and attributes this to \"Jormundgand\", Helheim's 1995 debut album. \"Jormundgand\" included an ambitious track \u2013 \"Galder\" \u2013 but that song was considered incompatible with metal, and audiences, looking for a specific musical style, merged with the pagan metal scene, which had no particular \"Viking\" identity.\nOther highly influential Viking metal bands are Borknagar, Darkwoods My Betrothed, Einherjer, Ensiferum, Moonsorrow, Thyrfing, and Windir. Trafford and Pluskowski regard Einherjer, Moonsorrow, Thyrfing, and Windir as the \"most influential\" Viking metal bands, with Einherjer's album covers, which include many images of Viking artifacts, giving Einherjer the most Viking feel of all bands except Enslaved. Einherjer's artwork spans the full chronology of Viking art: 8th- and 9th-century Oseberg to 11th- and 12th-century Urnes.\nAmon Amarth and Unleashed.\nAmon Amarth and Unleashed's music could be described as death metal, but it incorporates Viking lyrical themes and thus the bands are considered to have broadened the scope of Viking metal. While Norse myths were mostly important for black metal, especially the early 1990s Norwegian scene, as well as for the younger pagan metal genre, bands as the Swedish Unleashed started fitting these myths into death metal even before Amon Amarth appeared. Unleashed set a precedent for many of the coming black metal bands by shying away from the common death metal theme of gore and instead focusing on pre-Christian Swedish heathenism, particularly the Viking Age and old Norse religion. Amon Amarth and Unleashed resist the Viking metal label. Amon Amarth claims that they are merely a melodic death metal band with Viking-inspired lyrics. Johan Hegg from that band stated, \"It's weird to label a band after the lyrical content because, in that case, Iron Maiden is a Viking metal band, Black Sabbath is a Viking metal band, Led Zeppelin is a Viking metal band.\" Johnny Hedlund of Unleashed maintains that the band has always played and always will play death metal, commenting, \"The Viking lyrics you will find on about three to five songs on every Unleashed album from 1991 and on. I don't think that fact alone re-defines our style in some way.\"\nSpread outside the Nordic countries.\nSome members of the Viking metal scene believe that it is impossible for someone to be a Viking unless they themselves are of northern European descent. According to Trafford and Pluskowski, the members of practically all Viking metal bands claim Viking ancestry, and after its inception in Scandinavia, Viking metal spread to areas historically settled by Vikings, including England, Russia, and Normandy. Viking metal bands have even formed in the United States and Canada, with their members claiming Viking descent either directly from Scandinavia or through England. The scene also spread to other parts of Northern Europe in areas united by a common Germanic heritage, such as Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. For instance, the Austrian band Valhalla makes extensive use of Viking iconography, including horned helmets. Another Austrian example is Amestigon, which on the cover of its promotional album \"Remembering Ancient Origins\" depicts a wood carved scene of Sigurd killing Regin, an image taken from a panel held in Hylestad Stave Church.\nOne of the first non-Nordic Viking metal bands was the German project Falkenbach. Formed in 1989 and primarily the work of front-man Vratyas Vakyas, Falkenbach performs a mixture of black metal and folk music, with lyrics drawing from Western and Northern European mythologies, religions, and folk traditions. The Dutch bands Heidevolk, Slechtvalk, and Fenris have also been labeled as Viking metal, though Heidevolk's former vocalist Joris Boghtdrincker claims that Heidevolk has never tried to \"play the Viking card or the Pan-Germanic card\", instead choosing to write about local Dutch history. The Swiss band Eluveitie has been referred to as \"Celtic Viking metal\" and the band itself jokingly calls its music \"the new wave of folk metal\". Vocalist Chrigel Glanzmann explains was because the \"whole folk metal thing was still quite new back then, and the scene and the music press was looking for new labels for that kind of music, so they came up with Forest Metal, Viking Metal, Heathen Metal, Pagan Metal, blah blah blah, and we just felt like it was really really ridiculous.\"\nCatherine Hoad finds the issue of national and racial identity central to Viking metal. For instance, she writes that when Trafford and Pluskowski claim that Manowar could not claim religious or racial identity with the Vikings when the band had a bandleader with the \"'less than wholly Scandinavian name of Joey di Maio', [Trafford and Pluskowski] are approaching a more complex and racially-charged issue than their offhandedness would suggest.\" While Viking imagery may be readily appropriated, according to Hoad the definition of a \"true\" Viking is quite rigid, a rigidity which non-Nordic, and especially non-White, musicians must contend with. As an example, she cites the Brazilian band Viking Throne, which claims legitimacy through European ancestry and historical references to explorations of South America by Nordic countries, and quotes their front-man, Count Nidhogg: \"Some people understand perfectly that it doesn't matter where you live, what's really important is your heritage and ancestry. Even living in a South American country as Brazil we all have European blood.\" Hoad argues that Viking Throne illustrates the cultural importance of claiming Viking ancestry, a culture that operates on largely geographic lines. In contrast to Viking Throne, she cites the band Slechtvalk, which is well known for its brand of Christian Viking metal, but is rarely criticized as inauthentic by the scene. Hoad speculates that the European ethnicity of the band is enough to compensate for its otherwise counter-intuitive music.\nInfluence on pagan metal and modern pagan movements.\nThe German literary scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein list Viking metal as one of the many influences on Heathenry and popular images of Nordic myth and religion, influences that have even shaped academic discourse on Nordic myth. According to Weinstein, \"Viking metal has travelled further than any Viking ship. Self-defined pagan metal bands who describe their music as Viking metal can be found in the United States, Brazil and Uruguay, among other places.\" The sensationalism of the early Norwegian black metal scene might be responsible for some of this popularity, but Weinstein considers the genre's greatest influence to be \"the inspiration it has given to others to explore their own roots\". This impact was particularly strong in the Baltic states, where Viking metal influenced the development of a distinct pagan metal scene known as \"Baltic war metal\". The Lithuanian band Obtest, formed as a black metal band in 1993 with Lithuanian lyrics, birthed the war metal scene with the 1997 album \"T\u016bkstantmetis.\" Michael F. Strmiska comments that despite the claim that Scandinavia was home to the last pagans in Europe, within the scene: \"A point of particular pride is the knowledge that Lithuania was the last country in all of Europe to officially abandon its native Pagan traditions and convert to Christianity in 1387.\" Another Baltic band influenced by Viking metal is the Latvian project Skyforger, which composes its lyrics in the Latvian language. A third example of the influence of Viking metal on pagan metal is the national socialist black metal band Graveland from Poland, which on its second album, \"Thousand Swords\", released in 1995, featured a variety of folk styles mixed in with the band's black metal sound, and introduced lyrics about Polish history and Slavic gods. Viking metal has also influenced the Russian Rodnoverie movement, particularly the texts of Varg Vikernes, many of which have been translated into Russian. Though some of his readers within Rodnoverie distance themselves from the racism and political statements within Vikernes' work, other followers have embraced racist and National Socialist ideas. More broadly, metal music, especially, pagan and Viking metal have helped introduce the movement to new followers. Contemporaneous to the rise of Viking metal has been the emergence of Celtic metal in Ireland, France, and even Germany, a style which sounds essentially like Viking metal, apart from the addition of harps, but with lyrics celebrating Celtic gods and myths.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This contrasts with using solids such as optical fiber cable.\nThe technology is useful where the physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considerations.\nHistory.\nOptical communications, in various forms, have been used for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks used a coded alphabetic system of signalling with torches developed by Cleoxenus, Democleitus and Polybius. In the modern era, semaphores and wireless solar telegraphs called heliographs were developed, using coded signals to communicate with their recipients.\nIn 1880, Alexander Graham Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter created the photophone, at Bell's newly established Volta Laboratory in Washington, DC. Bell considered it his most important invention. The device allowed for the transmission of sound on a beam of light. On June 3, 1880, Bell conducted the world's first wireless telephone transmission between two buildings, some apart.\nIts first practical use came in military communication systems many decades later, first for optical telegraphy. German colonial troops used heliograph telegraphy transmitters during the Herero Wars starting in 1904, in German South-West Africa (today's Namibia) as did British, French, US or Ottoman signals.\nDuring the trench warfare of World War I when wire communications were often cut, German signals used three types of optical Morse transmitters called \"\", the intermediate type for distances of up to at daylight and of up to at night, using red filters for undetected communications. Optical telephone communications were tested at the end of the war, but not introduced at troop level. In addition, special blinkger\u00e4ts were used for communication with airplanes, balloons, and tanks, with varying success.\nA major technological step was to replace the Morse code by modulating optical waves in speech transmission. Carl Zeiss, Jena developed the \" 80/80\" (literal translation: optical speaking device) that the German army used in their World War\u00a0II anti-aircraft defense units, or in bunkers at the Atlantic Wall.\nThe invention of lasers in the 1960s revolutionized free-space optics. Military organizations were particularly interested and boosted their development. In 1973, while prototyping the first laser printers at PARC, Gary Starkweather and others made a duplex 30 Mbit/s CAN optical link using astronomical telescopes and HeNe lasers to send data between offices; they chose the method due partly to less strict regulations (at the time) on free-space optical communication by the FCC. However, laser-based free-space optics lost market momentum when the installation of optical fiber networks for civilian uses was at its peak.\nMany simple and inexpensive consumer remote controls use low-speed communication using infrared (IR) light. This is known as consumer IR technologies.\nUsage and technologies.\nFree-space point-to-point optical links can be implemented using infrared laser light, although low-data-rate communication over short distances is possible using LEDs. Infrared Data Association (IrDA) technology is a very simple form of free-space optical communications. On the communications side the FSO technology is considered as a part of the optical wireless communications applications. Free-space optics can be used for communications between spacecraft.\nUseful distances.\nThe reliability of FSO units has always been a problem for commercial telecommunications. Consistently, studies find too many dropped packets and signal errors over small ranges (). This is from both independent studies, such as in the Czech Republic, as well as internal studies, such as one conducted by MRV FSO staff.\nMilitary based studies consistently produce longer estimates for reliability, projecting the maximum range for terrestrial links is of the order of . All studies agree the stability and quality of the link is highly dependent on atmospheric factors such as rain, fog, dust and heat. Relays may be employed to extend the range for FSO communications.\nTMEX USA ran two eight-mile links between Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico from 1998 to 2002. The links operated at 155\u00a0Mbit/s and reliably carried phone calls and internet service.\nExtending the useful distance.\nThe main reason terrestrial communications have been limited to non-commercial telecommunications functions is fog. Fog often prevents FSO laser links over from achieving a year-round availability sufficient for commercial services. Several entities are continually attempting to overcome these key disadvantages to FSO communications and field a system with a better quality of service. DARPA has sponsored over US$130 million in research toward this effort, with the ORCA and ORCLE programs.\nOther non-government groups are fielding tests to evaluate different technologies that some claim have the ability to address key FSO adoption challenges. As of October 2014[ [update]], none have fielded a working system that addresses the most common atmospheric events.\nFSO research from 1998 to 2006 in the private sector totaled $407.1 million, divided primarily among four start-up companies. All four failed to deliver products that would meet telecommunications quality and distance standards:\nOne private company published a paper on November 20, 2014, claiming they had achieved commercial reliability (99.999% availability) in extreme fog. There is no indication this product is currently commercially available.\nExtraterrestrial.\nThe massive advantages of laser communication in space have multiple space agencies racing to develop a stable space communication platform, with many significant demonstrations and achievements.\nOperational systems.\nThe first gigabit laser-based communication was achieved by the European Space Agency and called the European Data Relay System (EDRS) on November 28, 2014. The system is operational and is being used on a daily basis.\nIn December 2023, the Australian National University (ANU) demonstrated its Quantum Optical Ground Station at its Mount Stromlo Observatory. QOGS uses adaptive optics and lasers as part of a telescope, to create a bi-directional communications system capable of supporting the NASA Artemis program to the Moon.\nDemonstrations.\nA two-way distance record for communication was set by the Mercury laser altimeter instrument aboard the \"MESSENGER\" spacecraft. It was able to communicate across a distance of , as the craft neared Earth on a fly-by in May 2005. The previous record had been set with a one-way detection of laser light from Earth by the Galileo probe, of in 1992.\nIn January 2013, NASA used lasers to beam an image of the Mona Lisa to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter roughly away. To compensate for atmospheric interference, an error correction code algorithm similar to that used in CDs was implemented.\nIn the early morning hours of October 18, 2013, NASA's Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) transmitted data from lunar orbit to Earth at a rate of 622 megabits per second (Mbit/s). LLCD was flown aboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft, whose primary science mission was to investigate the tenuous and exotic atmosphere that exists around the Moon.\nBetween April and July 2014 NASA's OPALS instrument successfully uploaded 175 megabytes in 3.5 seconds and downloaded 200\u2013300\u00a0MB in 20\u00a0s. Their system was also able to re-acquire tracking after the signal was lost due to cloud cover.\nOn December 7, 2021 NASA launched the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD), which aims to relay data between spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit and ground stations. LCRD is NASA's first two-way, end-to-end optical relay. LCRD uses two ground stations, Optical Ground Station (OGS)-1 and -2, at Table Mountain Observatory in California, and Haleakal\u0101, Hawaii. One of LCRD's first operational users is the Integrated LCRD Low-Earth Orbit User Modem and Amplifier Terminal (ILLUMA-T), on the International Space Station. The terminal will receive high-resolution science data from experiments and instruments on board the space station and then transfer this data to LCRD, which will then transmit it to a ground station. After the data arrives on Earth, it will be delivered to mission operation centers and mission scientists. The ILLUMA-T payload was sent to the ISS in late 2023 on SpaceX CRS-29, and achieved first light on December 5, 2023.\nOn April 28, 2023, NASA and its partners achieved 200 gigabit per second (Gbit/s) throughput on a space-to-ground optical link between a satellite in orbit and Earth. This was achieved by the TeraByte InfraRed Delivery (TBIRD) system, mounted on NASA's Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator 3 (PTD-3) satellite.\nCommercial use.\nVarious satellite constellations that are intended to provide global broadband coverage, such as SpaceX Starlink, employ laser communication for inter-satellite links. This effectively creates a space-based optical mesh network between the satellites.\nLEDs.\nIn 2001, Twibright Labs released RONJA Metropolis, an open-source DIY 10\u00a0Mbit/s full-duplex LED FSO system that can span .\nIn 2004, a visible light communication consortium was formed in Japan. This was based on work from researchers that used a white LED-based space lighting system for indoor local area network (LAN) communications. These systems present advantages over traditional UHF RF-based systems from improved isolation between systems, the size and cost of receivers/transmitters, RF licensing laws and by combining space lighting and communication into the same system. In January 2009, a task force for visible light communication was formed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers working group for wireless personal area network standards known as . A trial was announced in 2010, in St. Cloud, Minnesota.\nAmateur radio operators have achieved significantly farther distances using incoherent sources of light from high-intensity LEDs. One reported in 2007. However, physical limitations of the equipment used limited bandwidths to about 4 kHz. The high sensitivities required of the detector to cover such distances made the internal capacitance of the photodiode used a dominant factor in the high-impedance amplifier which followed it, thus naturally forming a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency in the 4\u00a0kHz range. Lasers can reach very high data rates which are comparable to fiber communications.\nProjected data rates and future data rate claims vary. A low-cost white LED (GaN-phosphor) which could be used for space lighting can typically be modulated up to 20\u00a0MHz. Data rates of over 100 Mbit/s can be achieved using efficient modulation schemes and Siemens claimed to have achieved over 500\u00a0Mbit/s in 2010. Research published in 2009, used a similar system for traffic control of automated vehicles with LED traffic lights.\nIn September 2013, pureLiFi, the Edinburgh start-up working on Li-Fi, also demonstrated high speed point-to-point connectivity using any off-the-shelf LED light bulb. In previous work, high bandwidth specialist LEDs have been used to achieve the high data rates. The new system, the Li-1st, maximizes the available optical bandwidth for any LED device, thereby reducing the cost and improving the performance of deploying indoor FSO systems.\nEngineering details.\nTypically, the best scenarios for using this technology are:\nThe light beam can be very narrow, which makes FSO hard to intercept, improving security. Encryption can secure the data traversing the link. FSO provides vastly improved electromagnetic interference (EMI) behavior compared to using microwaves.\nRange-limiting factors.\nFor terrestrial applications, the principal limiting factors are:\nThese factors cause an attenuated receiver signal and lead to higher bit error ratio (BER). To overcome these issues, vendors found some solutions, like multi-beam or multi-path architectures, which use more than one sender and more than one receiver. Some state-of-the-art devices also have larger fade margin (extra power, reserved for rain, smog, fog). To keep an eye-safe environment, good FSO systems have a limited laser power density and support laser classes 1 or 1M. Atmospheric and fog attenuation, which are exponential in nature, limit practical range of FSO devices to several kilometers. However, free-space optics based on 1550\u00a0nm wavelength, have considerably lower optical loss than free-space optics using 830\u00a0nm wavelength, in dense fog conditions. FSO using wavelength 1550\u00a0nm system are capable of transmitting several times higher power than systems with 850\u00a0nm and are safe to the human eye (1M class). Additionally, some free-space optics, such as EC SYSTEM, ensure higher connection reliability in bad weather conditions by constantly monitoring link quality to regulate laser diode transmission power with built-in automatic gain control.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For HCV, it is used in combination with other medications, such as simeprevir, sofosbuvir, peginterferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2a. It can also be used for viral hemorrhagic fevers\u2014specifically, for Lassa fever, Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infections (with exceptions for Ebola or Marburg virus diseases). Ribavirin is usually taken orally (by mouth) or inhaled. Despite widespread usage, it has faced scrutiny in the 21st century because of lack of proven efficacy in treating viral infections for which it has been prescribed in the past.\nIts common side effects include fatigue, headache, nausea, fever, muscle pains, and an irritable mood. Serious side effects include red blood cell breakdown, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Its use during pregnancy can bring harm to the developing fetus. Effective birth control is recommended for both males and females for at least seven months during and after use. The mechanism of action of ribavirin is not entirely clear.\nRibavirin was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1986. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.\nMedical uses.\nRibavirin is primarily used to treat chronic hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers (an orphan indication in most countries). Its efficacy for these purposes has been questioned in light of its Food and Drug Administration boxed warning against its use as monotherapy for chronic hepatitis C. Thus, it may be prescribed in the United States only as an adjunct to one or more other medications. Its efficacy against viruses other than HCV, including those that cause viral hemorrhagic fever, has not been conclusively demonstrated. In effect, it is not approved in the United States for treatment of viruses other than HCV.\nHepatitis C.\nFor chronic HCV infection, the oral (capsule or tablet) form of ribavirin is used only in combination with pegylated interferon alfa. Statins may improve this combination's efficacy in treating hepatitis C. When possible, genotyping of the specific viral strain is done; and ribavirin is only used as a dose-escalating adjuvant to specific combinations of genotypes and other medications.\nAcute hepatitis C infection (within the first 6 months) often does not require immediate treatment, as many infections eventually resolve without treatment. When the decision is made to treat acute hepatitis C, ribavirin may be used as an adjunct to several drug combinations. However, other medications are still preferred.\nViral hemorrhagic fever.\nRibavirin is the only known treatment for a variety of viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection, although data regarding these infections are scarce and the drug might be effective only in early stages. It is noted by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) that \"Ribavirin has poor \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\" activity against the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and the flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, and Kyasanur forest disease)\" The aerosol form has been used in the past to treat respiratory syncytial virus-related diseases in children, although the evidence to support this is rather weak.\nDespite questions surrounding its efficacy, ribavirin remains the only antiviral known to be effective in treating Lassa fever.\nIt has been used (in combination with ketamine, midazolam, and amantadine) in treatment of rabies.\nExperimental uses.\nExperimental data indicate that ribavirin may have useful activity against canine distemper and poxviruses. Ribavirin has also been used as a treatment for herpes simplex virus. One small study found that ribavirin treatment reduced the severity of herpes outbreaks and promoted recovery, as compared with placebo treatment. Another study found that ribavirin potentiated the antiviral effect of acyclovir.\nSome interest has been seen in its possible use as a treatment for cancers with elevated eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as in head and neck cancers. Ribavirin targeted eIF4E in AML patients in monotherapy and combination studies and this corresponded to objective clinical responses including complete remissions. Ribavirin resistance in AML patients arose leading to loss of eIF4E targeting and relapse. Resistance was caused by deactivation of ribavirin through its glucuronidation in AML cells or impaired drug entry/retention in the AML cells. There may be additional forms of ribavirin resistance displayed by cancer cells. In HPV related oropharyngeal cancers, ribavirin reduced levels of phosphorylated form of eIF4E in some patients. The best response here was stable disease but another head and neck study had more promising results.\nAdverse effects.\nThe medication has two FDA \"black box\" warnings: One raises concerns that use before or during pregnancy by either sex may result in birth defects in the baby, and the other is regarding the risk of red blood cell breakdown.\nRibavirin should not be given with zidovudine because of the increased risk of anemia; concurrent use with didanosine should likewise be avoided because of an increased risk of mitochondrial toxicity.\nMechanisms of action.\nIt is a guanosine (ribonucleic) analog used to stop viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping, thus, it is a nucleoside analog. Ribavirin is a prodrug, which when metabolized resembles purine RNA nucleotides. In this form, it interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral replication. Over five direct and indirect mechanisms have been proposed for its mechanism of action. The enzyme inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) dephosphorylates ribavirin triphosphate \"in vitro\" to ribavirin monophosphate, and ITPase reduced enzymatic activity present in 30% of humans potentiates mutagenesis in hepatitis C virus.\nRNA viruses.\nRibavirin's amide group can make the native nucleoside drug resemble adenosine or guanosine, depending on its rotation. For this reason, when ribavirin is incorporated into RNA, as a base analog of either adenine or guanine, it pairs equally well with either uracil or cytosine, inducing mutations in RNA-dependent replication in RNA viruses. Such hypermutation can be lethal to RNA viruses.\nDNA viruses.\nNeither of these mechanisms explains ribavirin's effect on many DNA viruses, currently the mechanism is not fully known, especially given the complete inactivity of ribavirin's 2' deoxyribose analogue, which suggests that the drug functions only as an RNA nucleoside mimic, and never a DNA nucleoside mimic. Ribavirin 5'-monophosphate inhibits cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thereby depleting intracellular pools of GTP.\neIF4E targeting in cancer.\nThe eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E plays multiple roles in RNA metabolism with translation being the best described. Biophysical and NMR studies first revealed that ribavirin directly bound the eIF4E,\u00a0providing another mechanism for its action. 3H Ribavirin also interacts with eIF4E in cells. While inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) presumably only binds the ribavirin monophosphate metabolite (RMP), eIF4E can bind ribavirin and with higher affinity ribavirin's phosphorylated forms. In many cell lines, studies into steady state levels of metabolites indicate that ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is more abundant than the RMP metabolite which is the IMPDH ligand. RTP binds to eIF4E in its cap-binding site as observed by NMR. Ribavirin inhibits eIF4E activities in cells including in its RNA export, translation and oncogenic activities lines. In AML patients treated with ribavirin, ribavirin blocked the nuclear import of eIF4E through interfering with its interaction with its nuclear importer, Importin 8, thereby impairing its nuclear activities. Clinical relapse in AML patients corresponded to loss of ribavirin binding leading to nuclear re-entry of eIF4E and re-emergence of its nuclear activities.\nHistory and culture.\nRibavirin was first made in 1972 under the National Cancer Institute's Virus-Cancer program. This was done by researchers from International Chemical and Nuclear Corporation including Roberts A. Smith, Joseph T. Witkovski and Roland K. Robins. It was reported that ribavirin was active against a variety of RNA and DNA viruses in culture and in animals, without undue toxicity in the context of cancer chemotherapies. By the late 1970s, the Virus-Cancer program was widely considered a failure, and the drug development was abandoned.\nAfter the US Government announced that AIDS was caused by a retrovirus in 1984, drugs examined during the Virus-Cancer program and its focus on retroviruses were re-examined. Although the FDA first approved ribavirin as an antiviral in 1986, it was not indicated to treat HIV or AIDS. As a result, many people with AIDS sought to obtain black market ribavirin via buyer's clubs. The drug was approved for investigational use against hantavirus in the United States in 1993, but the results from a non-randomized uncontrolled trial were not encouraging: 71% of recipients became anemic and 47% died.\nIn 2002 with the SARS outbreak, early speculation focused on ribavirin as a possible anti-SARS agent. Early protocols adopted in Hong Kong adopted a \"Hit Hard Hit Early\" approach treating SARS with high doses of off-label steroids and Ribavirin. Unfortunately, it later turned out this haphazard approach was at best ineffective and at worst fatal, with many deaths attributed to SARS caused by ribavirin toxicity.\nNames.\nRibavirin is the INN and USAN, whereas tribavirin is the BAN. Brand names of generic forms include Copegus, Ribasphere, Rebetol.\nDerivatives.\nRibavirin is possibly best viewed as a ribosyl purine analogue with an incomplete purine 6-membered ring. This structural resemblance historically prompted replacement of the 2' nitrogen of the triazole with a carbon (which becomes the 5' carbon in an imidazole), in an attempt to partly \"fill out\" the second ring--- but to no great effect. Such 5' imidazole riboside derivatives show antiviral activity with 5' hydrogen or halide, but the larger the substituent, the smaller the activity, and all proved less active than ribavirin. Note that two natural products were already known with this imidazole riboside structure: substitution at the 5' carbon with OH results in pyrazofurin, an antibiotic with antiviral properties but unacceptable toxicity, and replacement with an amino group results in the natural purine synthetic precursor 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), which has only modest antiviral properties.\nTaribavirin.\nThe most successful ribavirin derivative to date is the 3-carboxamidine derivative of the parent 3-carboxamide, first reported in 1973 by J. T. Witkowski et al., and now called taribavirin (former names \"viramidine\" and \"ribamidine\"). This drug shows a similar spectrum of antiviral activity to ribavirin, which is not surprising as it is now known to be a pro-drug for ribavirin. Taribavirin, however, has useful properties of less erythrocyte-trapping and better liver-targeting than ribavirin. The first property is due to taribavirin's basic amidine group which inhibits drug entry into RBCs, and the second property is probably due to increased concentration of the enzymes which convert amidine to amide in liver tissue. Taribavirin completed phase III human trials in 2012.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Medieval metal is mostly restricted to Germany where it is known as ' or '. The genre emerged from the middle of the 1990s with contributions from Subway to Sally, In Extremo and Schandmaul. The style is characterised by the prominent use of a wide variety of traditional folk and medieval instruments.\nHistory.\nPrecursors.\nThe medieval folk band Corvus Corax was formed in 1989 and released a debut album in the same year.\nThe group relies on period instruments that include the cister, hurdy-gurdy, biniou, buccina, davul, riq and cornetto curvo with the most prominent being the shawm and bagpipes. They describe their approach as \"louder, dirtier and more powerful than any interpretation of medieval music before.\" The result has been associated more with medieval taverns and pubs rather than the royal courts or church.\nWhile medieval metal is a German phenomenon, one of the inspirations for the genre is the English folk metal band Skyclad. Formed in 1990 as a thrash metal band, they added violins from session musician Mike Evans on several tracks from their debut album, \"The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth\", with the song \"The Widdershins Jig\" was acclaimed as \"particularly significant\" and \"a certain first in the realms of Metal\". The band added a full time violinist to their ranks and has since been credited not only as the originators and pioneers of folk metal but also as a direct inspiration for medieval metal bands.\nOrigins.\nThe East German band Subway to Sally was formed in 1992 as a folk rock band, singing in English and incorporating Irish and Scottish influences in their music. With their second album \"MCMXCV\" released in 1995, the band adopted a \"more traditional approach\" and started singing in German. Taking Skyclad as an influence, Subway to Sally performs a blend of hard rock and heavy metal music \"enriched with medieval melodies enmeshed in the songs via bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, lute, mandoline, shalm [\"sic\"], fiddle and flute\" and combined with \"romantic-symbolic German-speaking poetry\" in their lyrics. With chart success in their native Germany, they have since been credited as the band \"that set off the wave of what is known as medieval rock.\"\nIn the year 1994, a concert was organised in Berlin that featured a collaboration between a rock band known as Noah and members of the aforementioned medieval group Corvus Corax. The result of this mix of medieval and rock music saw the group Noah turning into In Extremo. They began with two acoustic medieval albums before releasing a metal album \"Weckt die Toten!\" in 1998. They have since found chart success in Germany with their \"medieval style stage garb and unashamed usage of such bizarre instruments as the Scottish bagpipes.\"\nCorvus Corax also joined in the fray with the release of an EP in 1996 that featured metal music with bagpipes. The EP was titled Tanzwut and the group has since continued exploring medieval metal as a side project by that name. Their style blends not only medieval music and heavy metal but also industrial and electronic beats.\nThe year 1999 also saw the release of Schandmaul's debut album. Describing themselves as the \"minstrels of today,\" the Bavarian outfit employs a musical arsenal that includes the bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, shawm, violin and mandolin. Like Subway to Sally and In Extremo, Schandmaul has experienced chart success in their native Germany. Other groups that also emerged during the late 1990s and early 2000s included Letzte Instanz, Morgenstern, Saltatio Mortis and Schattentantz.\n21st century.\nBands have found continued success throughout the 21st century. In 2005, In Extremo's \"Mein rasend Herz\" ranked number three in Germany. Their next album \"S\u00e4ngerkrieg\" (2008) achieved the top spot on the German charts. Schandmaul's \"Unendlich\" (2014) reached number two on the German charts and was later certified gold in Germany. Other groups such as Feuerschwanz and \"Folkstone\" continued to emerge as older groups achieved more mainstream success.\nMusical characteristics.\nLike its parent genre, medieval rock features the same typical instruments found in heavy metal music: guitars, bass, drums and vocalist. Bands in the genre are known to supplement their sound with a wide range of folk and traditional instruments. Woodwind instruments like the bagpipes, flutes and shawm can be found in the music of Corvus Corax, Tanzwut, In Extremo, Schandmaul, Morgernstern, Schattentantz and Subway to Sally while string instruments like the violin, lute, hurdy-gurdy, cello, harp and mandolin are employed by Subway to Sally, In Extremo, Schandmaul, Morgenstern, and Schattentantz. Many bands also dress in stylized medieval era costumes on stage.\nBands adopt musical styles from many medieval era source material. Corvus Corax pulls from many styles such as viking music, celtic music, nordic music, as well as from fantasy stories such as \"Lord of the Rings.\" Their 2005 album \"Cantus Buranus\" was written using the text from \"Carmina Burana.\" To contrast, other bands take a more modern approach to their songwriting while still including traditional medieval or ancient instruments.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Infrared ports for this purpose have been implemented in portable electronic devices such as mobile telephones, laptops, cameras, printers, and medical devices. The main characteristics of this kind of wireless optical communication are short-range, physically secure and bidirectional data transfer, at serial cable speeds, with a line-of-sight using point-and-shoot principles. IrDA has been made dormant by newer improved technologies like Bluetooth.\nHistory.\nThe protocols and specifications of the standard were developed by the Infrared Data Association (abbreviated IrDA, giving the name to the standard itself), an industry-driven interest group that was founded in 1993 by around 50 companies. Before IrDA, a number of proprietary standards existed for data exchange using infrared beams but the new association aimed to create an industry standard. The IrDA specifications were published in June 1994. In November 1995, Microsoft announced that it will support in Windows 95. The majority of PCs shipped in 1996 included an infrared port to utilize IrDA connectivity and the same year the first digital camera (Sony's DSC-F1) was released for infrared connectivity with a PC or printer.\nThe Infrared Data Association released the IrDA 1.0 specification in June 1994. In October 1995, IrDA 1.1 was specified that included improved theoretical data transmission speeds. IrDA 1.2 was approved in October 1997 designed to be low power, reducing costs. Version 1.3 was released in 1998 and the IrDA 1.4 implementation was released in 2001.\nDevelopment of the standard slowed because of the competing radio wave based Bluetooth standard. Between 2000 and 2002 several members of the Infrared Data Association, including Apple, IBM and Nokia, left the organisation and had joined the Bluetooth Special Interest Group. However the organisation continued to build on the technology and published the Ultra Fast (UFIR) IrDA standard in 2006 with a net data rate of 96 Mbps. In 2009, the Infrared Data Association (IrDA) published Giga-IR which aims for data speeds of 512 Mbps or 1 Gbps.\nThe association also adopted new standard called IrSimple in August 2005. The development of IrSimple is credited to NTT Docomo, Sharp, ITX E-globaledge and Waseda University. IrSimple provides significantly faster data transmission but maintains backward compatibility with the existing IrDA-enabled protocols. The IrSimple protocols provide sub-1-second transfers of pictures between cell phones, printers, and display devices. For example, some Pentax DSLRs (K-x, K-r) incorporated IrSimple for image transfer and gaming.\nUsage.\nIrDA was popular on PDAs, laptops and some desktops from the late 1990s through the early 2000s. It was a cable-free way for applications such as transferring files, printing, or tethering.\nHowever, IrDA has been displaced by other wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi, favored because they don't need a direct line of sight and can therefore support hardware like mice and keyboards. However, for some time IrDA hardware was still less expensive and didn't share the same security problems encountered with the likes of Bluetooth. It is still used in some environments where interference makes radio-based wireless technologies unusable.\nTechnical specifications.\nIrPHY.\nThe mandatory IrPHY (Serial Infrared Physical Layer Specification) is the physical layer of the IrDA specifications. It comprises optical link definitions, modulation, coding, cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and the framer. Different data rates use different modulation/coding schemes:\nFurther characteristics are:\nThe frame size depends on the data rate mostly and varies between 64\u00a0B and 64\u00a0kB. Additionally, bigger blocks of data can be transferred by sending multiple frames consecutively. This can be adjusted with a parameter called \"window size\" (1\u2013127). Finally, data blocks up to 8\u00a0MB can be sent at once. Combined with a low bit error rate of generally &lt;10-9, that communication could be very efficient compared to other wireless solutions.\nIrDA transceivers communicate with infrared pulses (samples) in a cone that extends at least 15 degrees half angle off center. The IrDA physical specifications require the lower and upper limits of irradiance such that a signal is visible up to one meter away, but a receiver is not overwhelmed with brightness when a device comes close. In practice, there are some devices on the market that do not reach one meter, while other devices may reach up to several meters. There are also devices that do not tolerate extreme closeness. The typical sweet spot for IrDA communications is from away from a transceiver, in the center of the cone. IrDA data communications operate in half-duplex mode because while transmitting, a device's receiver is blinded by the light of its own transmitter, and thus full-duplex communication is not feasible. The two devices that communicate simulate full-duplex communication by quickly turning the link around. The primary device controls the timing of the link, but both sides are bound to certain hard constraints and are encouraged to turn the link around as fast as possible.\nIrLAP.\nThe mandatory IrLAP (Infrared Link Access Protocol) is the second layer of the IrDA specifications. It lies on top of the IrPHY layer and below the IrLMP layer. It represents the data link layer of the OSI model.\nThe most important specifications are:\nOn the IrLAP layer the communicating devices are divided into a \"primary device\" and one or more \"secondary devices\". The primary device controls the secondary devices. Only if the primary device requests a secondary device to send, is it allowed to do so.\nIrLMP.\nThe mandatory IrLMP (Infrared Link Management Protocol) is the third layer of the IrDA specifications. It can be broken down into two parts.\nFirst, the LM-MUX (Link Management Multiplexer), which lies on top of the IrLAP layer. Its most important achievements are:\nSecond, the LM-IAS (Link Management Information Access Service), which provides a list, where service providers can register their services so other devices can access these services by querying the LM-IAS.\nTiny TP.\nThe optional Tiny TP (Tiny Transport Protocol) lies on top of the IrLMP layer. It provides:\nIrCOMM.\nThe optional IrCOMM (Infrared Communications Protocol) lets the infrared device act like either a serial or parallel port. It lies on top of the IrLMP layer.\nOBEX.\nThe optional OBEX (Object Exchange) provides the exchange of arbitrary data objects (e.g., vCard, vCalendar or even applications) between infrared devices. It lies on top of the Tiny TP protocol, so Tiny TP is mandatory for OBEX to work.\nIrLAN.\nThe optional IrLAN (Infrared Local Area Network) provides the possibility to connect an infrared device to a local area network. There are three possible methods:\nAs IrLAN lies on top of the Tiny TP protocol, the Tiny TP protocol must be implemented for IrLAN to work.\nIrSimple.\nIrSimple achieves at least four to ten times faster data transmission speeds by improving the efficiency of the infrared IrDA protocol. A 500\u00a0KB normal picture from a cell phone can be transferred within one second.\nIrSimpleShot.\nOne of the primary targets of IrSimpleShot (IrSS) is to allow the millions of IrDA-enabled camera phones to wirelessly transfer pictures to printers, printer kiosks and flat-panel TVs.\nInfrared Financial Messaging.\nInfrared Financial Messaging (IrFM) is a wireless payment standard developed by the Infrared Data Association. It was thought to be logical because of the excellent privacy of IrDA, which does not pass through walls.\nPower meters.\nMany modern (2021) implementations are used for semi-automated reading of power meters. This high-volume application is keeping IrDA transceivers in production. Lacking specialized electronics, many power meter implementations utilize a bit-banged SIR phy, running at 9600 BAUD using a minimum-width pulse (i.e. 3/16 of a 115.2KBAUD pulse) to save energy. To drive the LED, a computer-controlled pin is turned on and off at the right time. Cross-talk from the LED to the receiving PIN diode is extreme, so the protocol is half-duplex. To receive, an external interrupt bit is started by the start bit, then polled a half-bit time after following bits. A timer interrupt is often used to free the CPU between pulses. Power meters' higher protocol levels abandon IrDA standards, typically using DLMS/COSEM instead. With IrDA transceivers (a package combining an IR LED and PIN diode), even this crude IrDA SIR is extremely resistant to external optical noise from incandescents, sunlight, etc.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOfficial\nOther"}

Portugal was the leading country in the European exploration of the world in the 15th century. The Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 divided the Earth outside Europe into Castilian and Portuguese global territorial hemispheres for exclusive conquest and colonization. Portugal colonized parts of South America (Brazil, Uruguay), but also made some unsuccessful attempts to colonize North America (Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia in Canada).\nSettlements in North America.\nBased on the terms defined in the Treaty of Tordesillas, the Portuguese Crown claimed it had territorial rights in the area visited by the explorer John Cabot in 1497 and 1498 on behalf of the Crown of England. To that end, in 1499 and 1500, the Portuguese mariner Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador visited the northeast Atlantic coast and Greenland, which accounts for the appearance of \"Labrador\" on topographical maps of the period. Subsequently, in 1501 and 1502, the Corte-Real brothers explored and charted Greenland and what is today the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, claiming these lands as part of the Portuguese Empire. Fragmentary evidence also suggests a previous expedition in 1473 by Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte-Real, their father, with other Europeans, to \"Terra Nova do Bacalhau\" (\"New Land of the Codfish\") in North America. The possible voyage of 1473 and several other possible pre-Columbian expeditions to North America in the 15th century, mostly from the Azores in the case of the Portuguese (included in donation royal letters), remain matters of great controversy for scholars. Their existence is based on brief or fragmentary historical documents that are unclear concerning the destinations of voyages. \nIn 1506, King Manuel I of Portugal created taxes for the cod fisheries in Newfoundland waters. Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Fagundes and Pero de Barcelos established fishing outposts in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia around 1521. These were later abandoned, however, when Portuguese colonizers began to focus their efforts mainly on South America. Nonetheless, the Portuguese-founded towns of Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, St. Peter's, St. John's, Conception Bay and surrounding areas of east Canada remain important as a cultural region, even today.\nColonization of Brazil.\nIn April 1500, the second Portuguese India Armada, headed by Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral, with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and Nicolau Coelho, encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large \"volta do mar\" to avoid becalming in the Gulf of Guinea. On 21 April 1500, a mountain was seen that was named \"Monte Pascoal\", and on 22 April, Cabral landed on the coast, in Porto Seguro. Believing the land to be an island, he named it Ilha de Vera Cruz (Island of the True Cross). The previous expedition of Vasco da Gama to India already recorded several signs of land near its western open Atlantic Ocean route, in 1497. It has also been suggested that Duarte Pacheco Pereira may have discovered the coasts of Brazil in 1498, possible its northeast, but the exact area of the expedition and the explored regions remain unclear. On the other hand, some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the \"volta do mar\" (in the Southwest Atlantic), hence the insistence of King John II in moving the line west of the line agreed upon in the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Landing in the New World and reaching Asia, the expedition connected four continents for the first time in history.\nIn 1501\u20131502, an expedition led by Gon\u00e7alo Coelho (or Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves and/or Gaspar de Lemos), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day Rio de Janeiro. Among his crew was the Florentine Amerigo Vespucci. According to Vespucci, the expedition reached the latitude \"South Pole elevation 52\u00b0 S\" in the \"cold\" latitudes of what is now Patagonia, near the Strait of Magellan, before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest-south, following \"a long, unbending coastline\". This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter (stating that around 32\u00b0 S, they made a shift to open sea, to south-southeast), maintaining, however, that they reached a similar 50\u00b0 S latitude.\nAmerigo Vespucci participated as observer in four Spanish and Portuguese exploratory voyages. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504. His last two voyages to the east and southern east coasts of South America, by Portugal, especially the expedition of 1501\u20131502 to Brazil and beyond, and its meeting with Cabral's ships and men (who had touched the South American, African and Asian continents) on the African coast, at Bezeguiche (the bay of Dakar, Senegal), listening the accounts of its sailors (then returning to Portugal), were the most decisive for his \"New World\" hypothesis. Vespucci suggested that the newly discovered lands (especially what is today South America/Brazil) were not the Indies but a \"New World\", the \"Mundus novus\", Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, which had become widely popular in Europe.\nAround 1508 or 1511\u20131512, Portuguese captains reached and explored the River Plate estuary in the present-day Uruguay and Argentina, and went as far south as the present-day Gulf of San Matias at 42\u00b0S (recorded in the \"Newen Zeytung auss Pressilandt\" meaning \"New Tidings from the Land of Brazil\").\nSome historians have attributed this voyage to Coelho and Vespucci years before, but a good part of historians and researchers, through the sparse and comparative documentation, identify the captains and the experienced pilot of the \"India run\" (\"the best Pilot of Portugal\" and a \"best friend\" of the Fugger's Agent), with Diogo Ribeiro, Estev\u00e3o Frois and the pilot Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa. The explorers also reported that after going by the 40th parallel to south, along the coast, they found a \"land\" or \"point extending into the sea\", and further south, a Gulf.\nThis and the following expeditions of Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Jacques to the River Plate and into the Parana River in 1521; and of Martim Afonso de Sousa and his brother Pero Lopes de Sousa, in 1530\u20131532, from the Amazon River, to Lagoa dos Patos and to the rivers Plate and Paran\u00e1, reinforced and demonstrated Portuguese interest in the River Plate.\nPermanent habitation in Brazil did not begin until S\u00e3o Vicente was founded in 1532 by Martim Afonso de Sousa, although temporary trading posts were established earlier to collect brazilwood, used as a dye. S\u00e3o Vicente, by its \"democratic\" municipal prerogatives (in the tradition of Portuguese municipalism since the Middle Ages) and by the general elections to its first \"C\u00e2mara\" (City Council) on August 22, 1532, is symbolically considered the birthplace of democracy in the Americas.\nFrom 1534 to 1536, 15 Captaincy colonies were created in Portuguese America. The captaincies were autonomous, and mostly private, colonies of the Portuguese Empire, each owned and run by a Captain-major.\nIn 1549, due to their failure and limited success, the Captaincy Colonies of Brazil were united into the Governorate General of Brazil. The captaincy colonies were reorganized as provincial districts to the Governorate. The captaincies continued to be ruled by their hereditary captain-majors but they now reported to the Governor-General of Brazil. The new system was implemented so that Portuguese America could be managed correctly and provide a steady and wealthy income for the Portuguese Empire. The capital of the new governorate established its capital at S\u00e3o Salvador and the first Jesuits arrived the same year.\nWith permanent settlement came the establishment of the sugar cane industry and its intensive labor demands which were met with Native and later African slaves.\nFrom 1565 through 1567, Mem de S\u00e1, the third Governor General of Brazil, successfully destroyed a ten-year-old French colony called France Antarctique, at Guanabara Bay. He and his nephew, Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1, then founded the city of Rio de Janeiro in March 1567.\nIn 1621, Philip II of Portugal divided the Governorate General of Brazil into two separate and autonomous colonies, the State of Maranh\u00e3o and the State of Brazil. Regarding this period it is preferable to refer to \"Portuguese America\" rather than \"Portuguese Brazil\" or \"Colonial Brazil\", as the states were two separate colonies, each with their own governor general and government.\nBetween 1630 and 1654, the Netherlands came to control part of Brazil's Northeast region, with their capital in Recife. The Portuguese won a significant victory in the Second Battle of Guararapes in 1649. By 1654, the Netherlands had surrendered and returned control of all Brazilian land to the Portuguese.\nIn 1751, the State of Maranh\u00e3o was restructured into the State of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o, with a new capital and government.\nIn 1772, the State of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o was split into two new states, the State of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Rio Negro and the State of Maranh\u00e3o and Piau\u00ed. The new states would fare poorly and only last 3 years.\nIn 1775, the three colonies of Portuguese America (the State of Brazil, the State of Maranh\u00e3o and Piau\u00ed; and the State of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 and Rio Negro) were united into a singular colony, under the State of Brazil. This arrangement would last until the end of Colonial Brazil. As a result, Brazil did not split into several countries, as happened to its Spanish-speaking neighbors.\nCaribbean merchants.\nPortuguese merchants have been trading in the West Indies. To such an extent, that, for instance, for the Portuguese town of P\u00f3voa de Varzim, most of its seafarers dying abroad, most of the deaths occurred in the Route of the Antilles, in the West Indies. At the turn of the 17th century, with the union with Castile, the Spanish kings favored the free movement of the people, and other lands of the New World, such as Peru and the Gulf of Mexico, were open to the Portuguese merchants.\nColonization of Uruguay.\nThe Portuguese founded the first Uruguayan city, Col\u00f3nia do Sacramento.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some systems include history tracking where a log of the various versions created and modified by different users is recorded. The term has some overlap with the concepts of content management systems. It is often viewed as a component of enterprise content management (ECM) systems and related to digital asset management, document imaging, workflow systems and records management systems.\nHistory.\nWhile many electronic document management systems store documents in their native file format (Microsoft Word or Excel, PDF), some web-based document management systems are beginning to store content in the form of HTML. These HTML-based document management systems can act as publishing systems or policy management systems. Content is captured either by using browser based editors or the importing and conversion of not HTML content. Storing documents as HTML enables a simpler full-text workflow as most search engines deal with HTML natively. DMS without an HTML storage format is required to extract the text from the proprietary format making the full text search workflow slightly more complicated.\nSearch capabilities including boolean queries, cluster analysis, and stemming have become critical components of DMS as users have grown used to internet searching and spend less time organizing their content.\nComponents.\nDocument management systems commonly provide storage, versioning, metadata, security, as well as indexing and retrieval capabilities. Here is a description of these components:\nStandardization.\nMany industry associations publish their own lists of particular document control standards that are used in their particular field. Following is a list of some of the relevant ISO documents. Divisions ICS 01.140.10 and 01.140.20. The ISO has also published a series of standards regarding the technical documentation, covered by the division of 01.110.\nDocument control.\nGovernment regulations typically require that companies working in certain industries control their documents. A Document Controller is responsible to control these documents strictly. These industries include accounting (for example: 8th EU Directive, Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act), food safety (for example the Food Safety Modernization Act in the US), ISO (mentioned above), medical device manufacturing (FDA), manufacture of blood, human cells, and tissue products (FDA), healthcare (\"JCAHO\"), and information technology (\"ITIL\").\nSome industries work under stricter document control requirements due to the type of information they retain for privacy, warranty, or other highly regulated purposes. Examples include protected health information (PHI) as required by HIPAA or construction project documents required for warranty periods. An information systems strategy plan (ISSP) can shape organisational information systems over medium to long-term periods.\nDocuments stored in a document management system\u2014such as procedures, work instructions, and policy statements\u2014provide evidence of documents under control. Failing to comply can cause fines, the loss of business, or damage to a business's reputation.\nDocument control includes:\nThese document control requirements form part of an organisation's compliance costs alongside related functions such as a data protection officer and internal audit.\nIntegrated DM.\nIntegrated document management comprises the technologies, tools, and methods used to capture, manage, store, preserve, deliver and dispose of 'documents' across an enterprise. In this context 'documents' are any of a myriad of information assets including images, office documents, graphics, and drawings as well as the new electronic objects such as Web pages, email, instant messages, and video.\nDocument management software.\nPaper documents have long been used in storing information. However, paper can be costly and, if used excessively, wasteful. Document management software is not simply a tool but it lets a user manage access, track and edit information stored. Document management software is an electronic cabinet that can be used to organize all paper and digital files. The software helps the businesses to combine paper to digital files and store it into a single hub after it is scanned and digital formats get imported. One of the most important benefits of digital document management is a \u201cfail-safe\u201d environment for safeguarding all documents and data. In the heavy construction industry specifically, document management software allows team members to securely view and upload documents for projects they are assigned to from anywhere and at any time to help streamline day-to-day operations.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The occurrence of infant mortality in a population can be described by the infant mortality rate (IMR), which is the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Similarly, the \"child mortality rate\", also known as the \"under-five mortality rate,\" compares the death rate of children up to the age of five.\nIn 2013, the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States was birth defects. Other leading causes of infant mortality include birth asphyxia, pneumonia, neonatal infection, diarrhea, malaria, measles, malnutrition, term birth complications such as abnormal presentation of the fetus, umbilical cord prolapse, or prolonged labor. One of the most common preventable causes of infant mortality is smoking during pregnancy. Lack of prenatal care, alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and drug use also cause complications that may result in infant mortality. Many situational factors contribute to the infant mortality rate, such as the pregnant woman's level of education, environmental conditions, political infrastructure, and level of medical support. Improving sanitation, access to clean drinking water, immunization against infectious diseases, and other public health measures can help reduce rates of infant mortality.\nIn 1990, 8.8 million infants younger than one-year-old died globally out of 12.6 million child deaths under the age of five. More than 60% of the deaths of children under-five are seen as avoidable with low-cost measures such as continuous breastfeeding, vaccinations, and improved nutrition. The global under-five mortality rate in 1950 was 22.5%, which dropped to 4.5% in 2015. Over the same period, the infant mortality rate declined from 65 deaths per 1,000 live births to 29 deaths per 1,000. Globally, 5.4 million children died before their fifth birthday in 2017; by 2021 that number had dropped to 5 million children.\nThe child mortality rate (not the infant mortality rate) was an indicator used to monitor progress towards the Fourth Goal of the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations for the year 2015. A reduction in child mortality was established as a target in the Sustainable Development Goals\u2014Goal Number 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. As of January 2022[ [update]], an analysis of 200 countries found 133 already meeting the SDG target, with 13 others trending towards meeting the target by 2030. Throughout the world, the infant mortality rate (IMR) fluctuates drastically, and according to Biotechnology and Health Sciences, education and life expectancy in a country are the leading indicators of IMR. This study was conducted across 135 countries over the course of 11 years, with the continent of Africa having the highest infant mortality rate of any region studied, with 68 deaths per 1,000 live births.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClassification.\nInfant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of deaths per 1,000 live births of children under one year of age. The rate for a given region is the number of children dying under one year of age, divided by the number of live births during the year, multiplied by 1,000.\nForms of infant mortality:\nCauses.\nCauses of infant mortality, or direct causes of death, differ from contributions to the IMR, as contributing factors raise the risk of death, but do not directly cause death. Environmental and social barriers that prevent access to basic medical resources contribute to an increased infant mortality rate, 86% of infant deaths are caused by infections, premature births, complications during delivery, perinatal asphyxia, and birth injuries. Many of these common causes are preventable with low-cost measures. While 99% of infant deaths occur in developing countries, the greatest percentage reduction in infant mortality occurs in countries that already have low rates of infant mortality. In the United States, a primary source of infant mortality risk is infant birth weight, with lower birth weights increasing the risk; the causes of low birth weight include socioeconomic, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors.\nMain causes.\nThere are three main leading causes of infant mortality: conditions related to preterm birth, congenital anomalies, and SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). In North Carolina between 1980 and 1984, 37.5% of infant deaths were due to prematurity, congenital anomalies accounted for 17.4% and SIDS accounted for 12.9%.\nPremature birth.\nPremature, or preterm birth (PTB), is defined as birth before a gestational age of 37 weeks, as opposed to full term birth at 40 weeks. This can be further sub-divided in various ways, one being: \"mild preterm (32\u201336 weeks), very preterm (28\u201331 weeks) and extremely preterm (&lt;28 weeks)\". A lower gestational age increases the risk of infant mortality.\nBetween 1990 and 2010 prematurity was the second leading cause of worldwide mortality for neonates and children under the age of five. The overall PTB mortality rate in 2010 was 11.1% (15 million deaths) worldwide and was highest in low to middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia (60% of all PTBs), compared with high-income countries in Europe or the United States. Low-income countries also have limited resources to care for the needs of preterm infants, which increases the risk of infant mortality. The survival rate in these countries for infants born before 28 weeks of gestation is 10%, compared with a 90% survival rate in high-income countries. In the United States, the period from 1980 to 2000 saw a decrease in the total number of infant mortality cases, despite a significant increase in premature births.\nBased on distinct clinical presentations, there are three main subgroups of preterm births: those that occur due to spontaneous premature labor, those that occur due to spontaneous membrane (amniotic sac) rupture, and those that are medically induced. Both spontaneous factors are viewed to be a result of similar causes; hence, two main classifications remain: spontaneous and medically induced causes. The risk of spontaneous PTB increases with \"extremes of maternal age (both young and old), short inter-pregnancy intervals, multiple gestations, assisted reproductive technology, prior PTB, family history, substance abuse, cigarette use, low maternal socioeconomic status, late or no prenatal care, low maternal prepregnancy weight, bacterial vaginosis, periodontal disease, and poor pregnancy weight gain.\" Medically induced preterm birth is often conducted when continuing pregnancy poses significant risks to the pregnant parent or fetus; the most common causes include preeclampsia, diabetes, maternal medical conditions, fetal distress, or developmental problems. Despite these risk factors, the underlying causes of premature infant death are often unknown, and approximately 65% of all cases are not associated with any known risk factor.\nInfant mortality caused by premature birth is mainly attributed to developmental immaturity, which impacts multiple organ systems in the infant's body. The main body systems affected include the respiratory system, which may result in pulmonary hypoplasia, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (a chronic lung disease), and apnea. Other body systems that fully develop at a later gestational age include the gastrointestinal system, the skin, the immune system, the cardiovascular system, and the hematologic system. Poor development of these systems increases the risk of infant mortality.\nUnderstanding the biological causes and predictors of PTB is important for identifying and preventing premature birth and infant mortality. While the exact mechanisms responsible for inducing premature birth are often unknown, many of the underlying risk factors are associated with inflammation. Approximately \"80% of preterm births that occur at &lt;1,000 g or at &lt;28 to 30 weeks of gestation\" have been associated with inflammation. Biomarkers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein, ferritin, various interleukins, chemokines, cytokines, defensins, and bacteria, have been shown to be associated with increased risks of infection or inflammation-related preterm birth. Biological fluids have been utilized to analyze these markers in hopes of understanding the pathology of preterm birth, but they are not always useful if not acquired at the appropriate gestational time-frame. For example, biomarkers such as fibronectin are accurate predictors of premature birth at over 24 weeks of gestation but have poor predictive values before then. Additionally, understanding the risks associated with different gestational ages is a helpful determiner of Gestational age-specific mortality.\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant less than one year of age with no cause detected after a thorough investigation. SIDS is more common in Western countries. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report SIDS to be the leading cause of death in infants aged one month to one year of life. Even though researchers are not sure what causes SIDS, they have found that putting babies to sleep on their backs, instead of their stomachs, lowers the risk. Campaigns like Back to Sleep have used this research to lower the SIDS death rate by 50%. Though the exact cause is unknown, the \"triple-risk model\" presents three factors that together may contribute to SIDS: smoking while pregnant, the age of the infant, and stress from conditions such as prone sleeping, co-sleeping, overheating, and covering of the face or head. In the early 1990s, it was argued that immunizations could contribute to an increased risk of SIDS; however, more recent support the idea that vaccinations reduce the risk of SIDS.\nIn the United States, approximately 3,500 infant deaths are sleep-related, a category that includes SIDS. To reduce sleep-related infant deaths, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends providing infants with safe-sleeping environments, breastfeeding, and immunizing according to the recommended immunization schedule. They recommend against the use of a pacifier and recommend avoiding exposure to smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs during and after pregnancy.\nCongenital malformations.\nCongenital malformations are present at birth and include conditions such as cleft lip and palate, Down Syndrome, and heart defects. Some congenital malformations may be more likely when the mother consumes alcohol, but they can also be caused by genetics or unknown factors.\nCongenital malformations have had a significant impact on infant mortality, but malnutrition and infectious diseases remain the main causes of death in less developed countries. For example, in the Caribbean and Latin America in the 1980s, congenital malformations only accounted for 5% of infant deaths, while malnutrition and infectious diseases accounted for 7% to 27% of infant deaths. In more developed countries, such as the United States, there was a rise in infant deaths due to congenital malformations, mostly heart and central nervous system problems. In the 20th century, there was a decrease in the number of infant deaths from heart conditions, from 1979 to 1997, there was a 39% decline.\nMedicine and biology.\nCauses of infant mortality and deaths that are related to medical conditions include: low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, malnutrition, congenital malformations, infectious diseases, and low income for health care, including neglected tropical diseases.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants need multiple doses of vaccines such as diphtheria\u2013tetanus\u2013acellular pertussis vaccine, \"Haemophilus influenzae\" type b (Hib) vaccine, hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), and pneumococcal vaccine (PCV). Research conducted by the Institute of Medicine's Immunization Safety Review Committee concluded that there is no relationship between these vaccines and the risk of SIDS in infants.\nLow birth weight.\nLow birth weight makes up 60\u201380% of the infant mortality rate in developing countries. \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" stated that \"The lowest mortality rates occur among infants weighing . For infants born weighing or less, the mortality rate rapidly increases with decreasing weight, and most of the infants weighing or less die. As compared with normal-birth-weight infants, those with low weight at birth are almost 40 times more likely to die in the neonatal period; for infants with very low weight at birth the relative risk of neonatal death is almost 200 times greater.\" Infant mortality due to low birth weight is usually a direct cause stemming from other medical complications such as preterm birth, poor maternal nutritional status, a lack of prenatal care, maternal sickness during pregnancy, and unhygienic home environments. Birth weight and the length of gestation are the two most important predictors of an infant's chances of survival and their overall health.\nAccording to the \"New England Journal of Medicine\", \"in the past two decades, the infant mortality rate (deaths under one year of age per thousand live births) in the United States has declined sharply.\" The rate of low birth weights among African Americans remains twice as high as the rate for white people. Low birth weight, the leading cause of infant deaths, is preventable by effective programs to help prevent low birth weight are a combination of health care, education, the environment, and public policy. Preterm birth is the leading cause of newborn deaths worldwide. Even though America has a higher survival rate for premature infants, the percentage of Americans who deliver prematurely is comparable to those in developing countries. Reasons for this include teenage pregnancy, an increase in pregnancy after the age of 35, an increase in the use of in vitro fertilisation (which increases the risk of multiple births), obesity, and diabetes. Also, pregnant people who do not have access to health care are less likely to visit a doctor, therefore increasing their risk of delivering prematurely.\nMalnutrition.\nMalnutrition or undernutrition is defined as inadequate intake of nourishment, such as proteins and vitamins, which adversely affects the growth, energy, and development of people all over the world. It is especially prevalent during pregnancy and in infants and children under 5 who live in developing countries within the poorer regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Children are especially vulnerable as they have yet to fully develop a strong immune system and are dependent on their parents to provide the necessary food and nutritional intake. It is estimated that about 3.5 million children die each year as a result of childhood or maternal malnutrition, with stunted growth, low body weight, and low birth weight accounting for about 2.2 million associated deaths. Socioeconomic and environmental factors contribute to malnutrition, as do gender, location, and cultural practices surrounding breastfeeding. It is difficult to assess the most pressing factor as they can intertwine and vary among regions.\nChildren suffering from malnutrition can become underweight, and experience stunting or wasting. In Africa, the number of stunted children has risen, while Asia has the most children under 5 suffering from wasting. Inadequate nutrients adversely affect physical and cognitive development, increasing susceptibility to severe health problems. Micronutrient deficiency has been linked to anemia, fatigue, blindness, goiter, poor brain development, and death. Malnutrition also decreases the immune system's ability to fight infections, resulting in higher rates of death from diseases such as malaria, respiratory disease, and diarrhea.\nFolic acid during pregnancy is one way to combat iron deficiency. A few public health measures used to lower levels of iron deficiency anemia include added iodine to salt or drinking water and including vitamin A and multivitamin supplements in the diet. A deficiency of this vitamin causes certain types of anemia (low red blood cell count).\nInfectious diseases.\nBabies born in low- to middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia are at the highest risk of neonatal death. Bacterial infections of the bloodstream, lungs, and the brain's covering (meningitis) are responsible for 25% of neonatal deaths worldwide. Newborns can acquire infections during birth from bacteria present in the birth canal, the person may not be aware of the infection, or they may have an untreated pelvic inflammatory disease or a sexually transmitted disease. These bacteria can also move up the vaginal canal into the amniotic sac surrounding the baby causing in utero transmission. Maternal blood-borne infection is another route of bacterial infection. Neonatal infection is more likely with the premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) of the amniotic sac.\nSeven out of ten childhood deaths are due to infectious diseases like acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, measles, and malaria. Acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis account for 30% of childhood deaths; 95% of pneumonia cases occur in the developing world. Diarrhea is the second-largest cause of childhood mortality in the world, while malaria causes 11% of childhood deaths. Measles is the fifth-largest cause of childhood mortality.\nEnvironmental.\nThe infant mortality rate is one measure of a nation's health and social conditions. Its causes are a composite of a number rates that each have their own separate relationships with each other and with various other social factors. As such, IMR can often be seen as an indicator to measure the level of socioeconomic disparity within a country.\nOrganic water pollution is a better indicator of infant mortality than health expenditures per capita. Water contaminated by animal waste houses various pathogens including a host of parasitic and microbial infections. Areas of low socioeconomic status are more prone to inadequate plumbing infrastructure and poorly maintained facilities. Climate and geography often play a role in sanitation conditions. For example, the inaccessibility of clean water exacerbates poor sanitation conditions.\nThe burning of inefficient fuels doubles the rate of acute respiratory tract infections in children under 5 years old. People who live in areas where particulate matter air pollution is higher tend to have more health problems regardless of age. The short and long-term effects of air pollution are associated with an increased mortality rate, including infant mortality. Air pollution is consistently associated with postnatal mortality due to respiratory effects and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Specifically, air pollution is highly associated with SIDS in the United States during the post-neonatal stage. High infant mortality is exacerbated because newborns are a vulnerable subgroup that is affected by air pollution. Newborns who were born into these environments are no exception, and pregnant women exposed to greater air pollution on a daily basis should be closely watched by their doctors, including after the baby is born. Babies who live in areas with less air pollution have a greater chance of living until their first birthday, meaning babies who live in environments with more air pollution are at greater risk for infant mortality. Areas that have higher air pollution also have a greater chance of having a higher population density, higher crime rates, and lower income levels, all of which can lead to higher infant mortality rates.\nA key pollutant in infant mortality rates is carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can kill, and is especially dangerous to infants because of their immature respiratory systems.\nAnother major pollutant that can have detrimental effects on a fetus is second-hand smoke.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[I]n 2006, more than 42,000 Americans died of secondhand smoke-attributable diseases, including more than 41,000 adults and nearly 900 infants. Fully 36% of the infants who died of low birth weight caused by exposure to maternal smoking in utero were black, as were 28% of those dying of respiratory distress syndrome, 25% dying of other respiratory conditions, and 24% dying of sudden infant death syndrome.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Compared with nonsmoking women having their first birth, women who smoked less than one pack of cigarettes per day had a 25% greater risk of mortality, and those who smoked one or more packs per day had a 56% greater risk. Among women having their second or higher birth, smokers experienced 30% greater mortality than nonsmokers.\u2014\u200a\nModern research in the United States into racial disparities in infant mortality suggests a link between institutionalized racism and high rates of African American infant mortality. In synthesis of this research, it has been observed that \"African American infant mortality remains elevated due to the social arrangements that exist between groups and the lifelong experiences responding to the resultant power dynamics of these arrangements.\"\nIt is important to note that infant mortality rates do not decline among African Americans if their socio-economic status improves. Parker Dominguez at the University of Southern California has made some headway in determining the reasons behind this, claiming black women in the US are more prone to psychological stress than women of other races. Stress is a leading factor in the start of labor, and therefore, high levels of stress during pregnancy could lead to premature births that have the potential to be fatal for the infant.\nEarly childhood trauma.\nEarly childhood trauma includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse of a child from birth to five years old. Trauma in early childhood has an extreme impact over the course of a lifetime and is a significant contributor to infant mortality. Developing organs are fragile, when an infant is shaken, beaten, strangled, or raped, the impact is exponentially more destructive than when the same abuse occurs to a fully developed body. Studies estimate that 1\u20132 per 100,000 U.S. children are fatally injured annually, and it is reasonable to assume that these statistics underrepresent actual mortality. Almost three-quarters (70.6%) of child fatalities in FFY 2018 involved children younger than 3 years, and children younger than 1 year accounted for half (49.4%) of all fatalities. In particular, correctly identifying deaths due to neglect is problematic, and children with sudden, unexpected deaths or deaths from apparently unintentional causes often have preventable risk factors that are substantially similar to those in families with maltreatment.\nThere is a direct relationship between the age at which maltreatment or injury occurs and the risk of death. The younger an infant is, the more dangerous the maltreatment.\nFamily configuration, child gender, social isolation, lack of support, maternal youth, marital status, poverty, parental adverse childhood experiences, and parenting practices are all thought to contribute to increased risk.\nSocio-economic factors.\nSocial class is a major factor in infant mortality, both historically and today. Between 1912 and 1915, the Children's Bureau in the United States examined data across eight cities and nearly 23,000 live births. They discovered that lower incomes tended to correlate with higher infant mortality. In cases where the father had no income, the rate of infant mortality was 357% higher than that for the highest income earners ($1,250+). Differences between races were also apparent. African-American mothers experience infant mortality at a rate 44% higher than average; however, research indicates that socio-economic factors do not totally account for the racial disparities in infant mortality.\nWhile infant mortality is normally negatively correlated with GDP, there may be some beneficial short-term effects from a recession. A 2009 study in \"The Economist\" showed that economic slowdowns reduce air pollution, which results in a lower infant mortality rate. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the recession's impact on air quality was estimated to have saved around 1,300 US babies. It is only during deep recessions that infant mortality increases. According to Norbert Schady and Marc-Fran\u00e7ois Smitz, recessions when per capita GDP drops by 15% or more increase IMR.\nSocial class dictates which medical services are available to an individual. Disparities due to socioeconomic factors have been highlighted by advances in medical technology. Developed countries, most notably the United States, have seen a divergence in IMR between those living in poverty who cannot afford medically advanced resources, and those who can.\nDeveloping nations with democratic governments tend to be more responsive to public opinion, social movements, and special interest groups on issues like infant mortality. In contrast, non-democratic governments are more interested in corporate issues than in health issues. Democratic status affects the dependency a nation has on its economic state via exports, investments from multinational corporations, and international lending institutions.\nLevels of socioeconomic development and global integration are inversely related to a nation's infant mortality rate, meaning that as they increase, IMR decreases. A nation's internal impact is highly influenced by its position in the global economy, which has adverse effects on the survival of children in developing countries. Countries can experience disproportionate effects from trade and stratification within the global system, which contributes to the global division of labor, and distorts the domestic economies of developing nations. The dependency of developing nations can reduce the rate of economic growth, increase income inequality inter- and intra-nationally, and adversely affect the wellbeing of a nation's population. Collective cooperation between countries plays a role in development policies in the poorer countries of the world.\nThese economic factors present challenges to governments' public health policies. If the nation's ability to raise its own revenues is compromised, governments will lose funding for their health service programs, including those that aim to decrease infant mortality rates. Less developed countries face higher levels of vulnerability to the possible negative effects of globalization and trade in relation to more developed countries.\nEven with a strong economy and economic growth (measured by a country's gross national product), the advances of medical technologies may not be felt by everyone, increasing social disparities. In England, from 2014 to 2017, a rise in infant mortality was disproportionately experienced by the poorest regions, where the previously declining trend was reversed and an additional 24 infant deaths per 100,000 live births occurred annually.\nWar.\nInfant mortality rates correlate with war, political unrest, and government corruption. In most cases, war-affected areas will experience a significant increase in infant mortality rates. Having a war take place when planning pregnancy is not only stressful on the mother and fetus but also has several detrimental effects.\nMany other significant factors influence infant mortality rates in war-torn areas. Health care systems in developing countries in the midst of war often collapse, and obtaining basic medical supplies and care becomes increasingly difficult. During the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, Bosnia experienced a 60% decrease in child immunizations. Preventable diseases can quickly become epidemics during war.\nMany developing countries rely on foreign aid for basic nutrition, and transport of aid becomes significantly more difficult in times of war. In most situations, the average weight of a population will drop substantially. Expectant mothers are affected even more by a lack of access to food and water. During the Yugoslav Wars in Bosnia, the number of premature babies born increased and the average birth weight decreased.\nThere have been several instances in recent years of systematic rape as a weapon of war. People who become pregnant as a result of war rape face even more significant challenges in bearing a healthy child. Studies suggest that people who experience sexual violence before or during pregnancy are more likely to experience infant death. Causes of infant mortality after abuse during pregnancy range from physical side effects of the initial trauma to psychological effects that lead to poor adjustment to society. Many people who became pregnant by rape in Bosnia were isolated from their hometowns, making life after childbirth exponentially more difficult.\nCulture.\nHigh rates of infant mortality occur in developing countries where financial and material resources are scarce, and where there is a high tolerance for infant deaths. There are a number of developing countries where certain cultural situations, such as favoring male babies over female babies, are the norm. In developing countries such as Brazil, infant mortality rates are commonly not recorded due to not registering for death certificates. Another cultural reason for infant mortality, such as what is happening in Ghana, is that \"besides the obvious, like rutted roads, there are prejudices against wives or newborns leaving the house.\" This makes it even more difficult for pregnant women and newborns to get the needed treatment that is available to them.\nIn the United States cultural influences and lifestyle habits can account for some infant deaths. Examples include teenage pregnancy, obesity, diabetes, and smoking. All are possible causes of premature births, which constitute the second-highest cause of infant mortality. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, \"the post neonatal mortality risk (28 to 364 days) was highest among continental Puerto Ricans\" compared to non-Hispanic babies. Ethnic differences are accompanied by a higher prevalence of behavioral risk factors and sociodemographic challenges that each ethnic group faces.\nMale sex favoritism.\nHistorically, males have had higher infant mortality rates than females, with the difference being dependent on environmental, social, and economic conditions. More specifically, males are biologically more vulnerable to infections and conditions associated with prematurity and development. Before 1970, the reasons for male infant mortality were infections and chronic degenerative diseases. However, since 1970, male sex favoritism in certain cultures has led to a decrease in the infant mortality gap between males and females. Also, medical advances have resulted in a greater effect on the survival rate of male infants than female infants, due to the initial high infant mortality rate of males.\nGenetic components result in newborn females being at a biological advantage when it comes to surviving their first birthday, versus newborn males, who have lower chances of surviving infancy. As infant mortality rates decreased globally, the gender ratios changed from males being at a biological disadvantage to females facing a societal disadvantage. Some developing nations have social and cultural patterns that favor boys over girls for their future earning potential. A country's ethnic composition, homogeneous or heterogeneous, has been suggested by Fuse and Crenshaw to partly explain social attitudes and practices. According to their ecological study, heterogeneous levels may be protective against male-biased sex discrimination in terms of infant mortality.\nBirth spacing.\nBirth spacing is the time between births. Births spaced at least three years apart are associated with the lowest rate of mortality. The longer the interval between births, the lower the risk of having complications at birth, or of infant, childhood, or maternal mortality. Conception less than six months after a birth, abortion, or miscarriage is associated with higher rates of preterm births and low birth weight, and also increases the chances of chronic and general undernutrition. In 55 developing countries 57% of reported pregnancies had birth spaces of less than three years, and 26% of less than two years. While only 20% of new parents report wanting another birth within two years, only 40% are taking steps like family planning to achieve this.\nUnplanned pregnancies and birth intervals of less than twenty-four months are known to correlate with low birth weights and delivery complications. Also, mothers who are already small in stature tend to deliver smaller than average babies, perpetuating a cycle of being underweight.\nPrevention and outcomes.\nTo reduce infant mortality rates across the world, health practitioners, governments, and non-governmental organizations have worked to create institutions, programs, and policies to generate better health outcomes. Current efforts focus on the development of human resources, strengthening health information systems, health service delivery, etc. Improvements in such areas aim to increase regional health systems and aid efforts to reduce mortality rates.\nPolicy.\nReductions in infant mortality are possible at any stage of a country's development. Rate reductions are evidence that a country is advancing in human knowledge, social institutions, and physical capital. Governments can reduce mortality rates by addressing the combined need for education (such as universal primary education), nutrition, and access to basic maternal and infant health services. Focused policies has the potential to aid those most at risk for infant and childhood mortality, including rural, poor, and migrant populations.\nReducing the chances of babies being born at low birth weights and contracting pneumonia can be accomplished by improving air quality. Improving hygiene can prevent infant mortality. Home-based technology to chlorinate, filter, and use solar disinfection for organic water pollution could reduce cases of diarrhea in children by up to 48%. Improvements in food supplies and sanitation have been shown to work for the most vulnerable populations in the US, including among African Americans.\nPromoting behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap, can significantly reduce the rate of infant mortality from respiratory and diarrheal diseases. According to UNICEF, hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save children's lives by reducing deaths from diarrhea and acute respiratory infections.\nFocusing on preventing preterm and low birth weight deliveries throughout all populations can help eliminate cases of infant mortality and decrease health care disparities within communities. In the United States, these two goals have decreased regional infant mortality rates, but there has yet to be further progress on a national level.\nIncreasing human resources such as physicians, nurses, and other health professionals will increase the number of skilled attendants and the number of people able to give out immunizations against diseases such as measles. Increasing the number of skilled professionals is correlated with lower maternal, infant, and childhood mortality. With the addition of one physician per 10,000 people, there is a potential for 7.08 fewer infant deaths per 10,000.\nIn certain parts of the US, specific programs aim to reduce levels of infant mortality. One such program is the \"Best Babies Zone\" (BBZ), based at the University of California, Berkeley. The BBZ uses the life course approach to address the structural causes of poor birth outcomes and toxic stress in three US neighborhoods. By employing community-generated solutions, the Best Babies Zone's ultimate goal is to achieve health equity in communities that are disproportionately impacted by infant mortality.\nPrenatal care and maternal health.\nCertain steps can help to reduce the chance of complications during pregnancy. Attending regular prenatal care check-ups will help improve the baby's chances of being delivered in safer conditions and surviving. Additionally, taking supplementation, including folic acid, can help reduce the chances of birth defects, a leading cause of infant mortality. Many countries have instituted mandatory folic acid supplementation in their food supply, which has significantly reduced the occurrence of a birth defect known as spina bifida in newborns. Similarly, the fortification of salt with iodine, called salt iodization, has helped reduce negative birth outcomes associated with low iodine levels during pregnancy.\nAbstinence from alcohol can also decrease the chances of harm to the fetus as drinking any amount of alcohol during pregnancy may lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) or other alcohol related birth defects. Tobacco use during pregnancy has also been shown to significantly increase the risk of a preterm or low birth weight birth, both of which are leading causes of infant mortality. Pregnant women should consult with their doctors to best manage any pre-existing health conditions to avoid complications to both their health as well as the fetus's. Obese people are at an increased risk of developing complications during pregnancy, including gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia. Additionally, they are more likely to experience a pre-term birth or have a child with birth defects.\nNutrition.\nAppropriate nutrition for newborns and infants can help keep them healthy, and can help avoid health complications during early childhood. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding infants for the first 6 months of life, and continuing breastfeeding as other sources of food are introduced through the next 6 months of life (up to 1 year of age). Infants under 6 months of age who are exclusively breastfed have a lower risk of mortality compared to infants who are breastfed part of the time or not at all. For this reason, breast feeding is favored over formula feeding by healthcare professionals.\nVaccinations.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines infants as those 1 month of age to 1 year of age. For these infants, the CDC recommends the following vaccinations: hepatitis B (HepB), rotavirus (RV), haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB), pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), inactivated poliovirus (IPV &lt; 18 yrs), influenza, varicella, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTapP &lt; 7yrs). Each of these vaccinations are given at particular age ranges depending on the vaccination and are required to be done in a series of 1 to 3 doses over time depending on the vaccination.\nThe efficacy of these vaccinations can be seen immediately following their introduction to society. Following the advent of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in the United States in the year 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports studies done in 2004 had shown a 57% decline in invasive penicillin resistant strains of the disease and a 59% reduction in multi drug resistant strains. This reduction was even greater for children under 2 years of age with studies finding an 81% reduction in those same strains.\nAs mentioned in a previous section, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of infant mortality between 1 month and 1 year of age. Immunizations, when given in accordance to proper guidelines, have shown to reduce the risk of SIDS by 50%. For this reason, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) both recommend immunizations in accordance to their guidelines.\nSocio-economic factors.\nIt has been well documented that increased education among mothers, communities, and local health workers results in better family planning, improvement in children's health, and lower rates of children's deaths. High-risk areas, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, have demonstrated that an increase in women's educational attainment leads to a reduction in infant mortality by about 35%. Similarly, coordinated efforts to train community health workers in diagnosis, treatment, malnutrition prevention, reporting and referral services has reduced infant mortality in children under 5 by as much as 38%. Public health campaigns centered around the First 1000 days of life have been successful in providing cost-effective supplemental nutrition programs, as well as assisting young mothers in sanitation, hygiene and breastfeeding. Increased intake of nutrients and better sanitation habits have a positive impact on health, especially for developing children. Educational attainment and public health campaigns provide the knowledge and means to practice better habits and lead to lower infant mortality rates.\nA decrease in GDP results in increased rates of infant mortality. A reduction in household income reduces the amount being spent on food and healthcare, affecting the quality of life, and reduces access to medical services that ensure full development and survival. Likewise, increased household income translates to more access to nutrients and healthcare, reducing the risks associated with malnutrition and infant mortality. Moreover, increased aggregate household incomes will produce better health facilities, water and sewer infrastructures for the entire community.\nDifferences in measurement.\nThe infant mortality rate correlates very strongly with the likelihood of state failure, and is among the best predictors thereof. IMR is therefore also a useful indicator of a country's level of health (development), and is a component of the physical quality of life index.\nThe method of calculating IMR often varies widely between countries, as it is based on how they define a live birth and how many premature infants are born in the country. Depending on a nation's live birth criterion, vital registration system, and reporting practices, reporting may be inconsistent or understated. The reported IMR provides one statistic which reflects the standard of living in each nation. Changes in the infant mortality rate \"reflect enduring social and technical capacities that become attached to a population\". The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a live birth as any infant born demonstrating independent signs of life, including breathing, heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation or definite movement of voluntary muscles. This definition is used in Austria, and is also used in Germany, but with one slight modification: muscle movement is not considered to be a sign of life. Many countries, including certain European states (e.g. France) and Japan, only count cases where an infant breathes at birth as a live birth, which makes their reported IMR numbers somewhat lower and increases their rates of perinatal mortality. In other countries, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, for instance, requirements for live birth are even higher.\nAlthough many countries have vital registration systems and specific reporting practices, there are often inaccuracies in the statistics, particularly in rural communities in developing countries. In those communities, some other alternative methods for calculating infant mortality rate are used, for example, popular death reporting and household survey. Studies have shown that when comparing three information sources\u2014official registries, household surveys, and popular reporters\u2014the popular death reporters are the most accurate; popular death reporters include midwives, gravediggers, coffin builders, priests, and others, essentially people who knew the most about the child's death. In developing nations, access to vital registries, and other government-run systems which record births and deaths, is difficult for poor families for several reasons. These struggles force families to take drastic measures, like having unofficial death ceremonies for their deceased infants. As a result, government statistics will inaccurately reflect a nation's infant mortality rate. Popular death reporters have first-hand information, and, provided this information can be collected and collated, can provide reliable, accurate death counts for a nation, as well as meaningful causes of deaths that can be measured and studied.\nUNICEF uses a statistical methodology to account for reporting differences among countries:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;UNICEF compiles infant mortality country estimates derived from all sources and methods of estimation obtained either from standard reports, direct estimation from micro data sets, or from UNICEF's yearly exercise. In order to sort out differences between estimates produced from different sources, with different methods, UNICEF developed, in coordination with WHO, the WB and UNSD, an estimation methodology that minimizes the errors embodied in each estimate and harmonize trends along time. Since the estimates are not necessarily the exact values used as input for the model, they are often not recognized as the official IMR estimates used at the country level. However, as mentioned before, these estimates minimize errors and maximize the consistency of trends along time.\nAnother challenge in comparing infant mortality rates is the practice of counting frail or premature infants who die before the normal due date as miscarriages, or counting those who die during or immediately after childbirth as stillbirths. Therefore, the quality of a country's documentation of perinatal mortality can greatly affect the accuracy of its infant mortality statistics. This point is reinforced by the demographer Ansley Coale, who finds the high ratios of reported stillbirths to infant deaths in Hong Kong and Japan in the first 24 hours after birth dubious. As this pattern is consistent with the high male to female sex ratios recorded at birth in those countries it suggests two things: that many female infants who die in the first 24 hours are misreported as stillbirths rather than infant deaths; and that those countries do not follow WHO recommendations for the reporting of live births versus infant deaths.\nAnother seemingly paradoxical finding is that when countries with poor medical services introduce new medical centers and services, instead of declining, the reported IMRs often increase for a time. This is mainly because improvement in access to medical care is often accompanied by improvement in the registration of births and deaths. Deaths that might have occurred in a remote or rural area, and not been reported to the government, might now be reported by the new medical personnel or facilities. Thus, even if the new health services reduce the actual IMR, the reported IMR may increase.\nThe country-to-country variation in child mortality rates is huge, and growing wider despite progress in decreasing the overall IMR. Among the world's roughly 200 nations, only Somalia showed no decrease in the under-5 mortality rate over the past two decades. In 2011 the global rate of under-5 deaths was 51 deaths per 1,000 births. Singapore had the lowest rate at 2.6, while Sierra Leone had the highest at 185 child deaths per 1,000 births. In the U.S., the rate was 8 under-5 deaths per 1,000 births.\nInfant mortality rate (IMR) is not only a statistic but also a reflection of socioeconomic development, as such it effectively represents the presence of medical services in a country. IMR is an effective resource for health departments making decisions on medical resource allocation, and also formulates global health strategies and helps evaluate their success. The use of IMR helps solve the inadequacies of other vital statistic systems for global health as most neglect infant mortality rates among the poor. There remains a certain amount of unrecorded infant death in rural area as they either do not have the concept of reporting early infant death, or they do not know about the importance of the IMR.\nEurope and US.\nThe inclusion or exclusion of high-risk neonates from the reported IMRs can cause problems in making comparisons. Many countries, including the United States, Sweden and Germany, count any birth exhibiting any sign of life as alive, no matter the month of gestation or neonatal size. All of the countries named in the table adopted the WHO definitions in the late 1980s or early 1990s, and they are used throughout the European Union. However, in 2009, the US CDC issued a report that stated that the American rates of infant mortality were affected by the high rates of premature babies in the United States compared to European countries. It also outlined the differences in reporting requirements between the United States and Europe, noting that France, the Czech Republic, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Poland do not report all live births under 500\u00a0g and/or 22 weeks of gestation. However, differences in reporting are unlikely to be the primary explanation for the high rate of infant mortality in the United States compared to countries at a similar level of economic development. Rather, the report concluded that the primary reason for the higher infant mortality rate in the US compared to Europe was the much higher number of preterm births.\nUntil the 1990s, Russia and the Soviet Union did not count, either as a live birth or as an infant death, extremely premature infants that were born alive but failed to survive for at least seven days (infants born weighing less than 1,000\u00a0g, of less than 28 weeks gestational age, or less than 35\u00a0cm in length, who that breathed, had a heartbeat, or exhibited voluntary muscle movement). Although such extremely premature infants typically accounted for only about 0.5% of all live-born children, their exclusion led to an estimated 22%\u201325% lower reported IMR. In some cases, too, hospitals or regional health departments were held accountable for lowering the IMR in their catchment area, infant deaths that occurred in the 12th month were \"transferred\" statistically to the 13th month (i.e., the second year of life), and thus no longer classified as an infant death.\nBrazil.\nIn certain rural developing areas, such as northeastern Brazil, infant births are often not recorded, resulting in the discrepancies between the infant mortality rate (IMR) and the actual number of infant deaths. Access to vital registry systems for infant births and deaths is an extremely difficult and expensive task for poor parents living in rural areas. Government and bureaucracies tend to show an insensitivity to these parents and produce broad disclaimers in the IMR reports that the information has not been properly reported, resulting in discrepancies. Little has been done to address the underlying structural problems with the vital registry systems regarding the lack of reporting in rural areas, which has created a gap between the official and popular meanings of child death.\nIt is also argued that the bureaucratic separation of vital death recording from cultural death rituals is to blame for the inaccuracy of the infant mortality rate (IMR). Vital death registries often fail to recognize the cultural implications and importance of infant deaths. These systems can be an accurate representation of a region's socio-economic situation, if the statistics are valid, which is unfortunately not always the case. An alternate method of collecting and processing statistics on infant and child mortality is via \"popular death reporters\" who are culturally linked to infants and may be able to provide more accurate statistics. According to ethnographic data, \"popular death reporters\" refers to people who had inside knowledge of \"anjinhos\", including the grave-digger, gatekeeper, midwife, popular healers etc.\u2014all key participants in mortuary rituals. Combining the methods of household surveys, vital registries, and asking \"popular death reporters\" can increase the validity of child mortality rates. However there remain barriers that affect the validity of statistics of infant mortality, including political economic decisions: numbers are exaggerated when international funds are being doled out; and underestimated during reelection.\nThe bureaucratic separation of vital death reporting and cultural death rituals stems, in part, from structural violence. Individuals living in rural areas of Brazil need funds for lodging and travel in order to report births to a Brazilian Assistance League office, this deters registration as often these individuals are of lower income and cannot afford such expenses, similar barriers exist when choosing to report infant mortality. Financial constraints such as reliance on food supplementations may also lead to skewed infant mortality data.\nIn developing countries such as Brazil the deaths of impoverished infants are regularly not recorded into the countries vital registration system, which skews statistics. Culturally validity and contextual soundness can be used to ground the meaning of mortality from a statistical standpoint. In northeast Brazil they have accomplished this standpoint while conducting an ethnographic study combined with an alternative method to survey infant mortality. These types of techniques can develop quality data that will lead to a better portrayal of the IMR of a region.\nPolitical economic reasons have been seen to skew the infant mortality data in the past when governor Ceara devised his presidency campaign on reducing the infant mortality rate during his term in office. By using this new way of surveying, these instances can be minimized and removed, overall creating accurate and sound data.\nEpidemiology.\nGlobal IMR, as well as the IMR for both less developed countries (LDCs) and more developed countries (MDCs), declined significantly between 1960 and 2001. According to the State of the World's Mothers report by Save the Children, the world IMR declined from 126 in 1960 to 57 in 2001. The global neonatal mortality rate, NMR, decreased from 36.6 in 1990 to 18.0 in 2017.\nHowever, IMR was, and remains, higher in LDCs. In 2001, the IMR for 91 LDCs was about 10 times as large as it was for 8 MDCs. On average, for LDCs, the IMR is 17 times higher than that of MDCs. Also, while both LDCs and MDCs made significant reductions in IMR, the reduction rate has been lower in less developed countries than among the more developed countries. Among many low- and middle-income countries, there is also substantial variation in infant mortality rate at a subnational level.\nAs the lowest rate, in Monaco, is 1.80, and the highest IMR, in Afghanistan, is 121.63, a factor of about 67 separates them.\nUnited Kingdom.\nA study published in the British Medical Journal in 2019 found that the rate of infant mortality in England had increased with an additional 24 infant deaths per 100,000 live births per year. There was no significant change from the pre-existing trend in the most affluent areas, thus the rise disproportionately affected the poorest areas of the country, and was attributed largely to rising child poverty, as a result of sustained reductions in the welfare benefits available to families with children.\nUnited States.\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, which ranks 227 entities\u2014including sovereign nations, dependent territories, and other recognized regions\u2014the United States ranks 173rd in infant mortality, with a rate of 5.1 deaths per 1,000 live births as of 2024. Significant racial and socio-economic differences in the United States affect the IMR, in contrast with other developed countries with more homogeneous populations. In particular, IMR varies greatly by race in the US. The average IMR for the country as a whole is therefore not a fair representation of the wide variations that exist between segments of the population. Many theories have been explored as to why these racial differences exist, with socio economic factors usually coming out as a reasonable explanation. However, more studies have been conducted around this matter, and the largest advancement is around the idea of stress and how it affects pregnancy.\nIn the 1850s, the infant mortality rate in the United States was estimated at 216.8 per 1,000 white babies and 340.0 per 1,000 African American babies, but rates have significantly declined in modern times. This declining rate has been mainly due to modern improvements in basic health care and technology, as well as medical advances. In the last century, the infant mortality rate has decreased by 93%. Overall, the rates per 1,000 births have decreased drastically from 20 deaths in 1970 to 6.9 deaths in 2003. In 2003, the leading causes of infant mortality in the United States were congenital anomalies, disorders related to immaturity, AIDS, and maternal complications. Smoking during pregnancy declined to 10.2% with 12.4% of these births being low birth weights, compared with 7.7% of births being low birth weights for non-smokers. Overall, babies born with low birth weight increased to 8.1% between 2003 and 2004. According to the \"New York Times\", \"the main reason for the high rate is preterm delivery, and there was a 10% increase in such births from 2000 to 2006.\" Between 2007 and 2011, however, the preterm birth rate has decreased every year. In 2011, 11.73% of babies were born before the 37th week of gestation, down from a high of 12.80% in 2006.\nEconomic expenditures on labor and delivery and neonatal care are relatively high in the United States. A conventional birth averages US$9,775 with a C-section costing US$15,041. Preterm births in the US have been estimated to cost $51,600 per child, with a total yearly cost of $26.2 billion. Despite this spending, several reports state that infant mortality rate in the United States is significantly higher than in other developed nations. Estimates vary; the CIA's \"World Factbook\" ranks the US 55th internationally in 2014, with a rate of 6.17, while the UN figures from 2005 to 2010 place the US 34th.\nDifferences in measurement could play a substantial role in the disparity between the US and other nations. A non-viable birth in the US could be registered as a stillbirth in similarly developed nations like Japan, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France, thereby reducing their IMR. Neonatal intensive care is also more likely to be applied in the US to marginally viable infants, although such interventions have been found to increase both costs and disability. A study following the implementation of the Born Alive Infant Protection Act of 2002 found universal resuscitation of infants born between 20 and 23 weeks increased the neonatal spending burden by $313.3 million while simultaneously decreasing quality-adjusted life years by 329.3.\nThe vast majority of research conducted in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century indicates that African-American infants are more than twice as likely to die in their first year of life than white infants. Although a decline occurred from 13.63 deaths in 2005 to 11.46 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2010, non-Hispanic black parents continued to report a rate 2.2 times as high as that for non-Hispanic white parents.\nContemporary research findings have demonstrated that nationwide racial disparities in infant mortality are linked to the experiences of the postpartum parent and that these disparities cannot be totally accounted for by socio-economic, behavioral or genetic factors. The Hispanic paradox, an effect observed in other health indicators, appears in the infant mortality rate, as well. Hispanic postpartum parents see an IMR comparable to non-Hispanic white postpartum parents, even with lower educational attainment and economic status. According to Mustillo's CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study, \"self reported experiences of racial discrimination were associated with pre-term and low-birthweight deliveries, and such experiences may contribute to black-white disparities in prenatal outcomes.\" A study in North Carolina, for example, concluded that \"white women who did not complete high school have a lower infant mortality rate than black college graduates.\" Likewise, dozens of population-based studies indicate that \"the subjective, or perceived experience of racial discrimination is strongly associated with an increased risk of infant death and with poor health prospects for future generations of African Americans.\"\nAfrican American.\nWhile earlier parts of this article have addressed racial differences in the infant death rate, a closer look into the effects of racial differences within the country is necessary to view discrepancies. Non-Hispanic Black women have the highest infant mortality rate with a rate of 11.3, while the IMR among white women is 5.1.\nWhile the popular argument is that due to the trend of black women being of a lower socio-economic status there is in an increased likelihood of a child suffering, and while this does correlate, the theory is not congruent with the data on Latino IMR in the United States. Latino people are almost as likely to experience poverty as blacks in the U.S., however, the infant mortality rate of Latinos is much closer to white women than it is to black women. The poverty rate for blacks is 24.1% and for Latinos it is 21.4%; if there is a direct correlation, then the IMR of these two groups should be rather similar, however, blacks have an IMR double that of Latinos. Also, for black women who move out of poverty, or never experienced it in the first place, their IMR is not much lower than their counterparts experiencing higher levels of poverty.\nTyan Parker Dominguez at the University of Southern California offers a theory to explain the disproportionally high IMR among black women in the United States. She says African American women experience stress at much higher rates than any other group in the country. Stress produces particular hormones that can induce labor and contribute to other pregnancy problems. Considering premature birth is one of the leading causes of death of infants under the age of one, early labor is a legitimate concern. The idea of stress as a factor in IMR spans socio-economic status as Parker Dominguez says that for lower-class women stress comes from an unstable family life and chronic worry over poverty, while for middle-class women, battling racism, real or perceived, can be an extreme stressor.\nOthers believe black women are predisposed to a higher IMR, meaning ancestrally speaking, all women from African descent should experience an elevated rate. This theory is quickly disproven by looking at foreign-born African immigrants, these women come from a completely different social context and are not prone to the higher IMR experienced by American-born black women.\nArline Geronimus, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health calls the phenomenon \"weathering\". She claims constantly dealing with disadvantages and racial prejudice causes black women's birth outcomes to deteriorate with age. Therefore, younger black women may experience stress with pregnancy due to social and economic factors, but older women experience stress at a compounding rate and therefore have pregnancy complications aside from economic factors.\nMary O. Hearst, a professor in the Department of Public Health at Saint Catherine University, researched the effects of segregation on the African American community to see if it contributed to the high IMR in black children. Hearst claims that residential segregation contributes to the high rates because of the political, economic, and health implications it poses on black mothers regardless of their socioeconomic status. Racism, economic disparities, and sexism in segregated communities are all examples of the daily stressors that pregnant black women face, and are risk factors for conditions that can affect their pregnancies such as pre-eclampsia and hypertension.\nStudies have also shown that high IMR is due to the inadequate care that pregnant African Americans receive compared to other women in the country. In another study, it was shown that Black patients were more likely to receive ibuprofen after surgery instead of oxycodone. This unequal treatment stems from the idea that there are racial medical differences and is also rooted in racial biases and controlled images of black women. Because of this unequal treatment, research on maternal and prenatal care received by African American women and their infants, finds that black women do not receive the same urgency in medical care; they are also not taken as seriously regarding pain they feel or complications they think they are having, as exemplified by the complications tennis-star Serena Williams faced during her delivery.\nSeveral peer-reviewed articles have documented a difference in the levels of care a black patient receives regardless of whether they have insurance. For white women IMR drops after age 20, and remains the same until she is in her 40s; for black women IMR does not decrease when accounting for higher education, nor change based on age, suggesting that there is a racial element. There is another element that must be considered: the effect of the intersection of race and gender. Misogynoir is a commonly cited and overlooked issue. Black feminists have often been cited as the backbone of numerous Civil Rights events, but they feel overlooked when it comes to meaningful change that positively changes the lives of Black women specifically. During the June 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, many black feminists criticized the movement for excluding them. When examined through this lens, the increased rates of IMR of African American women becomes a matter of equity and an issue of social justice.\nStrides have been made, however, to combat this epidemic. In Los Angeles County, health officials have partnered with non-profits around the city to help black women after the delivery of their child. One non-profit that has made a large impact on many lives is Great Beginnings For Black Babies in Inglewood. The non-profit centers around helping women deal with stress by forming support networks, keeping an open dialogue around race and family life, and also finding these women a secure place in the workforce.\nSome research argues that to end the high infant mortality rate of black children, the country needs to fix the social and societal issues that plague African Americans, such as institutional racism, mass incarceration, poverty, and health care disparities that are present amongst the African American population. Following this theory, if institutional inequalities are addressed and repaired by the United States Government, this will reduce daily stressors for African Americans, and African American women in particular, and lessen the risk of complications in pregnancy and infant mortality. Others argue that increasing diversity in the health care industry can help reduce the IMR as more representation can tackle deep-rooted racial biases and stereotypes that exist towards African American women. Another attempt to reduce high IMR among black children is the use of doulas throughout pregnancy.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1900s, countries around the world started to notice that there was a need for better child health care services; first in Europe, and then with the United States creating a campaign to decrease the infant mortality rate. With this program, they were able to lower the IMR from 100 deaths to 10 deaths per every 1,000 births. When infant mortality began being noticed as a national problem it was viewed a social problem, and middle class American women with an educational background started to create a movement to provide housing for families of a lower social class. Through this movement they were able to establish public health care and government agencies, which in turn made more sanitary and healthier environments for infants. Medical professionals helped further the cause for infant health by creating the field of pediatrics, which is devoted to the medical care of children.\nUnited States.\nIn the 20th century decreases in infant mortality around the world were linked to several common trends, including social programs, improved sanitation, improved access to healthcare, and improved education, as well as scientific advancements like the discovery of penicillin and the development of safer blood transfusions. By improving sanitation, especially access to safe drinking water, the United States dramatically decreased infant mortality, which had been a growing concern in the United States since the 1850s. During this time the United States also endeavored to increase education and awareness regarding infant mortality. Pasteurization of milk also helped the United States combat infant mortality in the early 1900s, as it helped curb disease in infants. These factors, on top of a general increase in the standard of living in urban areas, helped the United States make dramatic improvements to their rates of infant mortality in the early 20th century.\nAlthough the overall infant mortality rate was sharply dropping during this time, within the United States infant mortality varied greatly among racial and socio-economic groups. Between 1915 and 1933 the change in infant mortality per 1,000 births was, for the white population, 98.6 down to 52.8 per 1,000, and for the black population, 181.2 to 94.4 per 1,000 - studies imply that this has a direct correlation with relative economic conditions between these populations. Additionally, infant mortality in southern states was consistently 2% higher than other regions in the US across a 20-year period starting in 1985. Southern states also tend to perform worse on predictors for higher infant mortality, such as per capita income and poverty rate.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, a focus on greater access to medical care for women spurred declines in infant mortality in the United States. The implementation of Medicaid, granting wider access to healthcare, contributed to a dramatic decrease in infant mortality, as did greater access to legal abortion and family-planning care, such the IUD and the birth control pill.\nBy 1984, the United States' decreasing infant mortality slowed. Funding for the federally subsidized Medicaid and Maternal and Infant Care programs was reduced, and availability of prenatal care decreased for low-income parents.\nChina.\nThe growth of medical resources in the People's Republic of China's during the latter half of the 20th century partly explains its dramatic improvement regarding infant mortality during this time. The Rural Cooperative Medical System, which was founded in the 1950s, granted healthcare access to previously underserved rural populations, and is estimated to have covered 90% of China's rural population throughout the 1960s. The Cooperative Medical System achieved an infant mortality rate of 25.09 per 1,000; while it was later defunded, leaving many rural populations to rely on an expensive fee-for-service system, the rate continued to decline. As the Cooperative Medical System was replaced, the change caused a socio-economic gap in accessibility to medical care in China, however this was not reflected in its declining infant mortality rate; prenatal care was increasingly used, and delivery assistance remained accessible.\nChina's one-child policy, adopted in the 1980s, negatively impacted its infant mortality. Women carrying unapproved pregnancies faced state consequences and social stigma and were thus less likely to use prenatal care. Additionally, economic realities and long-held cultural factors incentivized male offspring, leading some families who already had sons to avoid prenatal care or professional delivery services, and causing China to have unusually high female infant mortality rates during this time.\nSee also.\nRelated statistical categories:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "71624", "revid": "1280258685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71624", "title": "JPEG File Interchange Format", "text": "Image file format with multiple editions\nThe JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF) is an image file format standard published as ITU-T Recommendation T.871 and ISO/IEC 10918-5. It defines supplementary specifications for the container format that contains the image data encoded with the JPEG algorithm. The base specifications for a JPEG container format are defined in Annex B of the JPEG standard, known as JPEG Interchange Format (JIF). JFIF builds over JIF to solve some of JIF's limitations, including unnecessary complexity, component sample registration, resolution, aspect ratio, and color space. Because JFIF is not the original JPG standard, one might expect another MIME type. However, it is still registered as \"image/jpeg\" (indicating its primary data format rather than the amended information).\nJFIF is mutually incompatible with the newer Exchangeable image file format (Exif).\nPurpose.\nJFIF defines a number of details that are left unspecified by the JPEG Part 1 standard (ISO/IEC 10918-1, ITU-T Recommendation T.81.)\nComponent sample registration.\nJPEG allows multiple components (such as Y, Cb, and Cr) to have different resolutions, but it does not define how those differing sample arrays (which render bitmaps) should be aligned. This pixel-producing information is rendered with the expectation of indicating rectangles by their centroid, rather than being pixel data directly, or being 'first corner and flood', etc. which is uncommon.\nResolution and aspect ratio.\nThe JPEG standard does not include any method of coding the resolution or aspect ratio of an image. JFIF provides resolution or aspect ratio information using an application segment extension to JPEG. It uses Application Segment #0, with a segment header consisting of the null-terminated string spelling \"JFIF\" in ASCII followed by a byte equal to 0, and specifies that this must be the first segment in the file, hence making it simple to recognize a JFIF file. Exif images recorded by digital cameras generally do not include this segment, but typically comply in all other respects with the JFIF standard.\nColor space.\nThe JPEG standard used for the compression coding in JFIF files does not define which color encoding is to be used for images. JFIF defines the color model to be used: either Y for greyscale, or YCbCr derived from RGB color primaries as defined in CCIR 601 (now known as Rec. ITU-R BT.601), except with a different \"full range\" scaling of the Y, Cb and Cr components. Unlike the \"studio range\" defined in CCIR 601, in which black is represented by Y=16 and white by Y=235 and values outside of this range are available for signal processing \"headroom\" and \"footroom\", JFIF uses all 256 levels of the 8-bit representation, so that Y=0 for black and Y=255 for peak white. The RGB color primaries defined in JFIF via CCIR 601 also differ somewhat from what has become common practice in newer applications (e.g., they differ slightly from the color primaries defined in sRGB). Moreover, CCIR 601 (before 2007) did not provide a precise definition of the RGB color primaries; it relied instead on the underlying practices of the television industry.\nColor interpretation of a JFIF image may be improved by embedding an ICC profile, colorspace metadata, or an sRGB tag, and using an application that interprets this information.\nFile format structure.\nA JFIF file consists of a sequence of markers or marker segments (for details refer to JPEG, Syntax and structure). The markers are defined in part 1 of the JPEG Standard. Each marker consists of two bytes: an codice_1 byte followed by a byte which is not equal to codice_2 or codice_1 and specifies the type of the marker. Some markers stand alone, but most indicate the start of a marker segment that contains data bytes according to the following pattern:\ncodice_4\nThe bytes \"s1\" and \"s2\" are taken together to represent a big-endian 16-bit integer specifying the length of the following \"data bytes\" plus the 2 bytes used to represent the length. In other words, \"s1\" and \"s2\" specify the number of the following \"data bytes\" as formula_1.\nAccording to part 1 of the JPEG standard, applications can use APP marker segments and define an application specific meaning of the data. In the JFIF standard, the following APP marker segments are defined:\nThey are described below.\nThe JFIF standard requires that the JFIF APP0 marker segment immediately follows the SOI marker. If a JFIF extension APP0 marker segment is used, it must immediately follow the JFIF APP0 marker segment. So a JFIF file will have the following structure:\nJFIF APP0 marker segment.\nIn the mandatory JFIF APP0 marker segment the parameters of the image are specified. Optionally an uncompressed thumbnail can be embedded.\nJFIF extension APP0 marker segment.\nImmediately following the JFIF APP0 marker segment may be a JFIF extension APP0 marker segment. This segment may only be present for JFIF versions 1.02 and above. It allows to embed a thumbnail image in 3 different formats.\nThe thumbnail data depends on the thumbnail format as follows:\nCompatibility.\nThe newer Exchangeable image file format (Exif) is comparable to JFIF, but the two standards are mutually incompatible. This is because both standards specify that their particular application segment (APP0 for JFIF, APP1 for Exif) must immediately follow the SOI marker. In practice, many programs and digital cameras produce files with both application segments included. This will not affect the image decoding for most decoders, but poorly designed JFIF or Exif parsers may not recognise the file properly.\nJFIF is compatible with Adobe Photoshop's JPEG \"Information Resource Block\" extensions, and IPTC Information Interchange Model metadata, since JFIF does not preclude other application segments, and the Photoshop extensions are not required to be the first in the file. However, Photoshop generally saves CMYK buffers as four-component \"Adobe JPEGs\" that are not conformant with JFIF. Since these files are not in a YCbCr color space, they are typically not decodable by Web browsers and other Internet software.\nHistory.\nDevelopment of the JFIF document was led by Eric Hamilton of C-Cube Microsystems, and agreement on the first version was established in late 1991 at a meeting held at C-Cube involving about 40 representatives of various computer, telecommunications, and imaging companies. Shortly afterwards, a minor revision was published \u2014 JFIF 1.01. For nearly 20 years, the latest version available was v1.02, published September 1, 1992.\nIn 1996, RFC 2046 specified that the image format used for transmitting JPEG images across the Internet should be JFIF. The MIME type of \"image/jpeg\" must be encoded as JFIF.

Producing over one thousand original works during his fifty-year career, Reid is regarded as one of the most significant Northwest Coast artists of the late twentieth century. The Bill Reid Gallery of Northwest Coast Art celebrates his legacy through the curation of contemporary Indigenous art.\nReid was a matrilineal descendant of K'aadaas Gaa K'iigawaay, who belong to \u1e34ayx\u0331al, the Raven matrilineages of the Haida Nation. This matrilineage traces its origins to T'aanuu Llnagaay. His names are Iljuuwas (Princely One), Kihlguulins (One Who Speaks Well), and Yaahl SG\u0331waansing (Solitary Raven).\nSome of his major works were featured on the Canadian $20 banknote of the Canadian Journey series (2004\u20132012).\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nWilliam Ronald Reid Jr., was born 12 January 1920 in Victoria, British Columbia. His father was William Ronald Reid Sr., an American of Scottish-German descent. His mother, Sophie Gladstone, was Haida, from the Raven/Wolf Clan of T'anuu (). Gladstone, born in the Haida village of Skidegate, attended residential school in Sardis, British Columbia, and consequently did not pass on her Haida heritage to her son. Reconnecting with his Haida heritage became a driving force behind Reid's life and art.\nWhen Reid was in his early twenties, he visited his ancestral home of Skidegate for the first time since he was an infant. He desired to connect with his relatives and his Indigenous identity, later commenting that \"in turning to his ancestors, in reclaiming his heritage for himself, he was . . . looking for an identity which he had not found in modern western society.\" In Skidegate Reid spent time with his maternal grandfather, Charles Gladstone, a traditional Haida silversmith. Gladstone first taught Reid about Haida art, and through him, Bill inherited his tools from his great-great-uncle Charles Edenshaw, a renowned chief and artist who died the year Reid was born.\nIn 1944, Reid married his first wife, Mabel van Boyen. In 1948, the couple moved to Toronto, where Reid further developed his keen interest in Haida art while working as a radio announcer for CBC Radio and studying jewelry making at the Ryerson Institute of Technology. During his spare time, he made regular trips to the Royal Ontario Museum and admired the carved Haida pole installed in the main stairwell, which originated from his grandmother's village of T'aanuu. Upon completing his studies, Reid made his first Haida-inspired piece of jewelry, a bracelet resembling the ones he saw his maternal aunt wear when he was a child.\nIn 1951, Reid returned to Vancouver, where he eventually established a studio on Granville Island. He became greatly interested in the works of his great-great uncle Edenshaw, working to understand the symbolism of his work, much of which had been lost along with many Haida traditions. During this time Reid also worked on salvaging artifacts, including many intricately carved totem poles, which were then moldering in abandoned village sites. He assisted in the partial reconstruction of a Haida village in the University of British Columbia Museum of Anthropology (MOA). In 1986, Reid's work was featured in an exhibit at the MOA, \"Beyond the Essential Form\" curated by William McClennan. The exhibit catalog was later published by the University of British Columbia Press as \"Bill Reid: Beyond the Essential Form\" by Karen Duffek, Curator: Contemporary Visual Arts &amp; Pacific Northwest. \nWorking in the traditional forms and modern media (usually gold, silver and argillite), Reid began by making jewellery. He gradually explored larger sculptures in bronze, red cedar and Nootka Cypress (yellow cedar), usually portraying figures, animals, and scenes from Haida mythology. He intended to express his ancestors' visual traditions into a contemporary form.\nMajor works and awards.\nReid's most popular works are three large bronze sculptures. Two depict a canoe filled with human and animal figures: one black, \"The Spirit of Haida Gwaii\", is at the Canadian Embassy, Washington, D.C., in the United States; and one green, \"The Jade Canoe\", is at Vancouver International Airport, in British Columbia. The third sculpture, \"Chief of the Undersea World\", depicts a breaching orca and is installed at the Vancouver Aquarium. Plaster casts of these sculptures are held by the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Canada.\nHis 1965 painting \"Smallpox\" is exhibited at the \"Canadian Museum of History.\" Reid's \"Raven and the First Men\" carving based on the Haida legend was unveiled at the University of British Columbia Museum of Anthropology (MOA) in April 1986.\nIn 1975, a dialog between Reid and art historian, Bill Holm in conjunction with a Northwest Coast Indian art exhibition, organized by the Institute for the Arts, Rice University, Houston was published as \"Form and Freedom: A Dialogue on Northwest Coast Indian Art\"\".\"\nLegacy and honours.\nReid received many honours in his life, including honorary degrees from the University of British Columbia, the University of Toronto, the University of Victoria, the University of Western Ontario, York University, and Trent University. He received the National Aboriginal Achievement Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1994, and was made a member of the Order of British Columbia and an Officer of France's Order of Arts and Letters. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.\nOn 30 April 1996 Canada Post issued 'The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, 1986\u20131991, Bill Reid' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on the sculpture \"The Spirit of Haida Gwaii\" (1991) by William Ronald Reid in the Canadian Embassy, Washington, United States. The 90\u00a2 stamps are perforated 12.5 x 13\u00a0 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.\nTwo of his sculptures, \"The Raven and the First Men\" and \"Spirit of Haida Gwaii\", are prominently featured on the $20 note in the Bank of Canada's new \"Canadian Journey\" (2004) issue, paired with a quotation from author Gabrielle Roy.\nHe was the subject of Alanis Obomsawin's 2022 documentary film \"Bill Reid Remembers\".\nLater years.\nReid participated in the Haida-led blockades of logging roads that helped save the rain forests of Gwaii Haanas (South Moresby). He stopped work on the sculpture in Washington during this period to protest the destruction of the forests of Haida Gwaii, then known as the Queen Charlotte Islands. In 1981, he married Martine de Widerspach-Thor (Mormanne), a French anthropologist.\nReid died on 13 March 1998, of Parkinson's disease, in Vancouver. In July 1998 friends and relatives paddled Lootaas, a large cedar canoe carved by Reid for Expo 86, on a two-day journey along the Pacific coast to bring his ashes to Tanu Island in Haida Gwaii, the site of his mother's village of New Clew.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Thus, to a certain degree, it may be seen as a successor of \"Physische Anthropogeographie\" (English: \"physical anthropogeography\")\u2014a term coined by University of Vienna geographer Albrecht Penck in 1924\u2014and geographical cultural or human ecology (Harlan H. Barrows 1923). Integrated geography in the United States is principally influenced by the schools of Carl O. Sauer (Berkeley), whose perspective was rather historical, and Gilbert F. White (Chicago), who developed a more applied view.\nIntegrated geography describes and explains the spatial aspects of interactions between human individuals or societies and their natural environment, called coupled human\u2013environment systems.\nFocus.\nThe links between human and physical geography were once more apparent than they are today. As human experience of the world is increasingly mediated by technology, the relationships between humans and the environment have often become obscured. Thereby, integrated geography represents a critically important set of analytical tools for assessing the impact of human presence on the environment. This is done by measuring the result of human activity on natural landforms and cycles. Methods for which this information is gained include remote sensing, and geographic information systems. Integrated geography helps us to ponder the environment in terms of its relationship to people. With integrated geography we can analyze different social science and humanities perspectives and their use in understanding people environment processes. Hence, it is considered the third branch of geography, the other branches being physical and human geography.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

That is, after trying every possible key, there should be just one decipherment that makes sense, i.e. expected amount of ciphertext needed to determine the key completely, assuming the underlying message has redundancy.\nClaude Shannon defined the unicity distance in his 1949 paper \"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\".\nConsider an attack on the ciphertext string \"WNAIW\" encrypted using a Vigen\u00e8re cipher with a five letter key. Conceivably, this string could be deciphered into any other string\u2014RIVER and WATER are both possibilities for certain keys. This is a general rule of cryptanalysis: with no additional information it is impossible to decode this message.\nOf course, even in this case, only a certain number of five letter keys will result in English words. Trying all possible keys we will not only get RIVER and WATER, but SXOOS and KHDOP as well. The number of \"working\" keys will likely be very much smaller than the set of all possible keys. The problem is knowing which of these \"working\" keys is the right one; the rest are spurious.\nRelation with key size and possible plaintexts.\nIn general, given particular assumptions about the size of the key and the number of possible messages, there is an average ciphertext length where there is only one key (on average) that will generate a readable message. In the example above we see only upper case English characters, so if we assume that the plaintext has this form, then there are 26 possible letters for each position in the string. Likewise if we assume five-character upper case keys, there are K=265 possible keys, of which the majority will not \"work\".\nA tremendous number of possible messages, N, can be generated using even this limited set of characters: N = 26L, where L is the length of the message. However, only a smaller set of them is readable plaintext due to the rules of the language, perhaps M of them, where M is likely to be very much smaller than N. Moreover, M has a one-to-one relationship with the number of keys that work, so given K possible keys, only K \u00d7 (M/N) of them will \"work\". One of these is the correct key, the rest are spurious.\nSince M/N gets arbitrarily small as the length L of the message increases, there is eventually some L that is large enough to make the number of spurious keys equal to zero. Roughly speaking, this is the L that makes KM/N=1. This L is the unicity distance.\nRelation with key entropy and plaintext redundancy.\nThe unicity distance can equivalently be defined as the minimum amount of ciphertext required to permit a computationally unlimited adversary to recover the unique encryption key.\nThe expected unicity distance can then be shown to be:\n formula_1\nwhere \"U\" is the unicity distance, \"H\"(\"k\") is the entropy of the key space (e.g. 128 for 2128 equiprobable keys, rather less if the key is a memorized pass-phrase). \"D\" is defined as the plaintext redundancy in bits per character.\nNow an alphabet of 32 characters can carry 5 bits of information per character (as 32 =\u00a025). In general the number of bits of information per character is log2(N), where \"N\" is the number of characters in the alphabet and log2 is the binary logarithm. So for English each character can convey log2(26) \n 4.7 bits of information.\nHowever the average amount of actual information carried per character in meaningful English text is only about 1.5 bits per character. So the plain text redundancy is \"D\" =\u00a04.7\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.5 =\u00a03.2.\nBasically the bigger the unicity distance the better. For a one time pad of unlimited size, given the unbounded entropy of the key space, we have formula_2, which is consistent with the one-time pad being unbreakable.\nUnicity distance of substitution cipher.\nFor a simple substitution cipher, the number of possible keys is 26! \n 4.0329 \u00d7 1026 \n 288.4, the number of ways in which the alphabet can be permuted. Assuming all keys are equally likely, \"H\"(\"k\") \n log2(26!) \n 88.4 bits. For English text \"D\" \n 3.2, thus \"U\" \n 88.4/3.2 \n 28.\nSo given 28 characters of ciphertext it should be theoretically possible to work out an English plaintext and hence the key.\nPractical application.\nUnicity distance is a useful theoretical measure, but it does not say much about the security of a block cipher when attacked by an adversary with real-world (limited) resources. Consider a block cipher with a unicity distance of three ciphertext blocks. Although there is clearly enough information for a computationally unbounded adversary to find the right key (simple exhaustive search), this may be computationally infeasible in practice.\nThe unicity distance can be increased by reducing the plaintext redundancy. One way to do this is to deploy data compression techniques prior to encryption, for example by removing redundant vowels while retaining readability. This is a good idea anyway, as it reduces the amount of data to be encrypted.\nCiphertexts greater than the unicity distance can be assumed to have only one meaningful decryption. Ciphertexts shorter than the unicity distance may have multiple plausible decryptions. Unicity distance is not a measure of how much ciphertext is required for cryptanalysis, but how much ciphertext is required for there to be only one reasonable solution for cryptanalysis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Humans and other primates serve as natural hosts. The 11 species in this genus include \"human betaherpesvirus 5\" (HCMV, human cytomegalovirus, HHV-5), which is the species that infects humans. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonia, and congenital CMV in infants can lead to variety of birth defects, including those involving the eyes, ears, liver, and spleen.\nIn the medical literature, most mentions of CMV without further specification refer implicitly to human CMV. Human CMV is the most studied of all cytomegaloviruses.\nMX2/MXB protein was identified as a restriction factor for herpesviruses, which acts at a very early stage of the replication cycle and MX2/MXB restriction of herpesvirus requires GTPase activity.\nTaxonomy.\nWithin the \"Herpesviridae\", CMV belongs to the \"Betaherpesvirinae\" subfamily, which also includes the genera \"Muromegalovirus\" and \"Roseolovirus\" (human herpesvirus 6 and human herpesvirus 7). It is also related to other herpesviruses within the \"Alphaherpesvirinae\" subfamily, which includes herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 and varicella-zoster virus, and the \"Gammaherpesvirinae\" subfamily, which includes Epstein\u2013Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.\nSeveral species of \"Cytomegalovirus\" have been identified and classified for different mammals. The most studied is \"Human cytomegalovirus\" (HCMV), which is also known as \"Human betaherpesvirus 5\" (HHV-5). Other primate CMV species include \"Chimpanzee cytomegalovirus\" (CCMV) that infects chimpanzees and orangutans, and \"Simian cytomegalovirus\" (SCCMV) and \"Rhesus cytomegalovirus\" (RhCMV) that infect macaques; CCMV is known as both \"Panine beta herpesvirus 2\" (PaHV-2) and \"Pongine betaherpesvirus 4\" (PoHV-4). SCCMV is called \"cercopithecine betaherpesvirus 5\" (CeHV-5) and RhCMV, \"Cercopithecine betaherpesvirus 8\" (CeHV-8). A further two viruses found in the night monkey are tentatively placed in the genus \"Cytomegalovirus\", and are called \"Herpesvirus aotus 1\" and \"Herpesvirus aotus 3\". Rodents also have viruses previously called cytomegaloviruses that are now reclassified under the genus \"Muromegalovirus\"; this genus contains \"Mouse cytomegalovirus\" (MCMV) is also known as \"Murid betaherpesvirus 1\" (MuHV-1) and the closely related \"Murid betaherpesvirus 2\" (MuHV-2) that is found in rats.\nSpecies.\nThe following 11 species are assigned to the genus in ICTV 2022:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nStructure.\nViruses in \"Cytomegalovirus\" are enveloped, with icosahedral, spherical to pleomorphic, and round geometries, and T=16 symmetry. The diameter is around 150\u2013200\u00a0nm. Genomes are linear and nonsegmented, around 200 kb in length.\nGenome.\nHerpesviruses have some of the largest genomes among human viruses, often encoding hundreds of proteins. For instance, the double\u2011stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome of wild-type HCMV strains has a size of around 235 kb and encodes at least 208 proteins. It is thus longer than all other human herpesviruses and one of the longest genomes of all human viruses in general. It has the characteristic herpesvirus class E genome architecture, consisting of two unique regions (unique long UL and unique short US), both flanked by a pair of inverted repeats (terminal/internal repeat long TRL/IRL and internal/terminal repeat short IRS/TRS). Both sets of repeats share a region of a few hundred bps, the so-called \"a sequence\"; the other regions of the repeats are sometimes referred to as \"b sequence\" and \"c sequence\".\nLife cycle.\nViral replication is nuclear and lysogenic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the dsDNA bidirectional replication model. DNA templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear egress and budding. Humans and monkeys serve as the natural hosts. Transmission routes are dependent on coming into contact with bodily fluids (such as saliva, urine, and genital secretions) from an infected individual.\nAll herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals.\nGenetic engineering.\nThe CMV promoter is commonly included in vectors used in genetic engineering work conducted in mammalian cells, as it is a strong promoter and drives constitutive expression of genes under its control.\nHistory.\n\"Cytomegalovirus\" was first observed by German pathologist Hugo Ribbert in 1881 when he noticed enlarged cells with enlarged nuclei present in the cells of an infant. Years later, between 1956 and 1957, Thomas Huckle Weller together with Smith and Rowe independently isolated the virus, known thereafter as \"cytomegalovirus\". In 1990, the first draft of human cytomegalovirus genome was published, the biggest contiguous genome sequenced at that time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 2001, it evolved into the Green Party of the United States.\nFounding.\nIn the aftermath of the first Green presidential campaign in 1996, 62 Greens from 30 states gathered over the weekend of November 16\u201317, 1996 to found the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP). The meeting was held at the historic Glen-Ora Farm in Middleburg, Virginia, where Jack Kennedy had his weekend retreat in his administration's early days (rented to the president by the mother of ASGP meeting host and Nader supporter Elaine Broadhead.)\nGreen Parties from 13 states were the founding members, and approved an initial set of bylaws that set out the ASGP's purpose: (1) Assist in the development of State Green Parties and (2) Create a legally structured national Green Party. The founding meeting also established a national newsletter Green Pages, which carries forward today as the newspaper of the GPUS. The founding editor was Mike Feinstein.\nSubsequent ASGP meetings occurred in Portland, OR (April 5\u20136, 1997), Topsham, ME (October 3\u20135, 1997), Santa Fe, NM (April 24\u201326, 1998), Moodus, CT (June 5\u20136, 1999), and Hiawassee, GA (December 8\u201310, 2000). Ralph Nader appeared in Moodus to talk about running for president the next year.\nThe concept of the ASGP came out of the 1991 national Greens Gathering in Elkins, West Virginia, where a committee was tasked with examining what an eventual Green Party might look like. The committee produced a report with contributions from six authors, among them Greg Gerritt from Maine. Gerritt's suggestion was for the creation of an Association of State Green Parties based on sovereign state parties, essentially as he argued, how all parties end up structured in the US. The reaction within the GPUSA was, according to Gerritt, to throw him out of the GPUSA. But that did not kill the concept. Instead it was shared by those involved in the establishment of the Green Politics Network in 1992, and what was founded in 1996 in Middleburg very closely reflected the proposal Gerritt originally submitted.\nASGP and the Greens/Green Party USA.\nThe ASGP was predominantly focused on establishing state Green Parties and running and electing Greens for public office, even while its member state parties and the individual Greens involved remained involved in issue activism. From 1997 to 1999, as more state Green Parties continued to form, a highly competitive environment between the ASGP and the Greens/Green Party USA (G/GPUSA) began to develop in terms of who would affiliate with which organization, and ultimately who would become the definitive national Green Party. To some extent this divide reflected philosophical differences within U.S. Greens that went back to the late 1980s and early 1990s, around how a Green political party should be organized - based upon state parties, or upon dues-paying local Green groups.\nIn December 1999, Santa Monica, California, Green City Councilmember Mike Feinstein and New York Green Howie Hawkins met in New Paltz, New York, during the state meeting of the Green Party of New York State and crafted the 'Plan for a Single National Green Party, which was more generally known as the Feinstein/Hawkins Proposal, meant to create a single national Green Party from among the ASGP and GPUSA by Earth Day, April 2000. The proposal found quick support within the ASGP, but not within the Greens/GPUSA in time for Earth Day.\nBoston Proposal.\nInstead it would be in October 2000 that the Feinstein/Hawkins proposal was revisited, negotiated further and renamed the 'Boston Proposal' or 'Boston Agreement' (so named because it was negotiated in Boston on October 1\u20132 in the days before the first 2000 presidential debate).\nThe negotiators for the Association of State Green Parties were Tony Affigne, David Cobb, Robert Franklin, Greg Gerritt, Anne Goeke, Stephen Herrick, and Tom Sevigny; and for the Greens/Green Party USA: Starlene Rankin, John Stith, Jeff Sutter, Steve Welzer, Rich Whitney, and Julia Willebrand.\nThe Boston Proposal was approved by the ASGP at its December 2000 meeting in Hiawasee, GA, but did not pass at the July 2001 G/GPUSA Congress in Carbondale, CO. This caused a schism in G/GPUSA membership from which it never recovered. The next week on July 29 in Santa Barbara, CA the ASGP voted to become the Green Party of the United States, held a press conference in Santa Monica on July 30 to announce it, and was subsequently recognized as having National Committee status by the Federal Election Commission.\nText of the Boston Proposal:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nASGP and Nader 2000 presidential campaign.\nIn September 1998, the New Mexico Green Party proposed that an ASGP Presidential Exploratory Committee be established for the 2000 elections. The ASGP Coordinating Committee passed the proposal on October 30, and on December 20 the ASGP Steering Committee appointed a seven-person committee, chaired by then Texas Green David Cobb. On February 22, 1999, the Committee sent a letter and questionnaire to prospective presidential and vice presidential candidates, asking if they were interested in running on the Green Party ticket in 2000 and if so, how would they envision conducting the campaign: Wendell Berry, Jerry Brown, Lester Brown, Noam Chomsky, Ron Daniels, Ron Dellums, Lani Guinier, Dan Hamburg, Woody Harrelson, Paul Hawken, Jim Hightower, Molly Ivins, Winona LaDuke, Bill McKibben, Cynthia McKinney, Toni Morrison, Ralph Nader, Ron Ouellette (requested the questionnaire), John Robbins and Jan Schlichtmann. On May 10 the committee also sent the letter and questionnaire to: Harry Belafonte, Julian Bond, Joycelyn Elders, Kurt Schmoke, Studs Terkel, Myrlie Evers-Williams and Gen. George Lee Butler.\nBrown, McKibben, Chomsky, Guinier, Hawken, Miller wrote back declining, but all graciously thanking the ASGP for its outreach, and offering sympathetic statements of support for the Green Party project.\nNader also replied: \"If I seek the nomination - a decision that will not be made until next year- and receive that designation, I will pursue a dedicated and thorough campaign that meets the Federal Election Commission requirements. Such an active campaign will have the objective of strengthening our nation\u2019s democracy by strengthening the Green Party movement at the local, state and national levels; by emphasizing the problems of, and remedies for, the excessive concentration of corporate power and wealth in our country, by highlighting the important tools of democracy needed for the American people as voters/citizens, workers, consumers, taxpayers, and small savers/investors. If there are Greens who support my seeking the nomination, I encourage them to expand the number of volunteers and increase the time spent working to build the Green Party this year in order to advance the Party\u2019s \u201cKey Values\u201d and to increase the likelihood of ballot access in all fifty states.\"\n At it June 23\u201325 convention in Denver, the ASGP nominated Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke for president and vice-president. The pair appeared on 44 state ballots and received 2,883,105 votes, or 2.7 percent of all votes cast. Nader's strong showing in several states solidified the changes in the Green Party, transforming it from an \"anti-party party\" to an organization primarily dedicated to electoral campaigns. In particular, that was the widespread understanding of thousands of recruits to the party, as it went through an unprecedented rate of growth.\nInternational.\nIn April 2001, the ASGP was represented at the founding congress of the Global Greens by Mike Feinstein, Annie Goeke and John Rensenbrink. The ASGP was also a founding member party of the Federac\u00edon de Partidos Verdes de las Americas in 1998."}

An attacker can see the user's name, CHAP challenge, CHAP response, and any other information associated with the PPP session. The attacker can then mount an offline dictionary attack in order to obtain the original password. When used in PPP, CHAP also provides protection against replay attacks by the peer through the use of a challenge which is generated by the authenticator, which is typically a network access server.\nWhere CHAP is used in other protocols, it may be sent in the clear, or it may be protected by a security layer such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). For example, when CHAP is sent over RADIUS using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), any attacker who can see the RADIUS packets can mount an offline dictionary attack, as with PPP.\nCHAP requires that both the client and server know the clear-text version of the password, although the password itself is never sent over the network. Thus when used in PPP, CHAP provides better security as compared to Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) which is vulnerable for both these reasons.\nBenefits of CHAP.\nWhen the peer sends CHAP, the authentication server will receive it, and obtain the \"known good\" password from a database, and perform the CHAP calculations. If the resulting hashes match, then the user is deemed to be authenticated. If the hashes do not match, then the user's authentication attempt is rejected.\nSince the authentication server has to store the password in clear-text, it is impossible to use different formats for the stored password. If an attacker were to steal the entire database of passwords, all of those passwords would be visible \"in the clear\" in the database.\nAs a result, while CHAP can be more secure than PAP when used over a PPP link, it prevents more secure storage \"at rest\" than with other methods such as PAP.\nVariants.\nMS-CHAP is similar to CHAP but uses a different hash algorithm, and allows for each party to authenticate the other.\nWorking cycle.\nCHAP is an authentication scheme originally used by Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) servers to validate the identity of remote clients. CHAP periodically verifies the identity of the client by using a three-way handshake. This happens at the time of establishing the initial link (LCP), and may happen again at any time afterwards. The verification is based on a shared secret (such as the client's password).\nCHAP packets.\nThe ID chosen for the random challenge is also used in the corresponding response, success, and failure packets. A new challenge with a new ID must be different from the last challenge with another ID. If the success or failure is lost, the same response can be sent again, and it triggers the same success or failure indication. For MD5 as hash the response value is codice_1, the MD5 for the concatenation of ID, secret, and challenge.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An attacker can see the users name, password, and any other information associated with the PPP session. Some additional security can be gained on the PPP link by using CHAP or EAP. However, there are always tradeoffs when choosing an authentication method, and there is no single answer for which is more secure.\nWhen PAP is used in PPP, it is considered a weak authentication scheme. Weak schemes are simpler and have lighter computational overhead than more complex schemes, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), but they are much more vulnerable to attack. Weak schemes are used where the transport layer is expected to be physically secure, such as a home DSL link. Where the transport layer is not physically secure a system such as TLS or Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is used instead.\nOther uses of PAP.\nPAP is also used to describe password authentication in other protocols such as RADIUS and Diameter. However, those protocols provide for transport or network layer security, and therefore that usage of PAP does not have the security issues seen when PAP is used with PPP.\nBenefits of PAP.\nWhen the client sends a clear-text password, the authentication server will receive it, and compare it to a \"known good\" password.

Starting with the PCMCIA card in 1990 (the name later simplified to \"PC Card\"), it created various standards for peripheral interfaces designed for laptop computers.\nHistory.\nPCMCIA was based on the original initiative of the British mathematician and computer scientist Ian H. S. Cullimore, one of the founders of the Sunnyvale-based Poqet Computer Corporation, who was seeking to integrate some kind of memory card technology as storage medium into their early MS-DOS-based palmtop PCs, when traditional floppy drives and harddisks were found to be too power-hungry and large to fit into their battery-powered handheld devices. When in July 1989, Poqet contacted Fujitsu for their existing but still non-standardized SRAM memory cards, and Intel for their flash technology, the necessity and potential of establishing a worldwide memory card standard became obvious to the parties involved. This led to the foundation of the PCMCIA organization in September 1989.\nBy early 1990, some thirty companies had joined the initiative already, including Poqet, Fujitsu, Intel, Mitsubishi, IBM, Lotus, Microsoft and SCM Microsystems (now Identiv).\nFrom 1990 onwards, the association published and maintained a sequence of standards for parallel communication peripheral interfaces in laptop computers, notably the PCMCIA card, later renamed to PC Card, and succeeded by ExpressCard (2003), all of them now technologically obsolete.\nThe PCMCIA association was dissolved in 2009 and all of its activities have since been managed by the USB Implementers Forum, according to the PCMCIA website.\nAs of 2023, PCMCIA is now little used in new hardware, with most removable devices using USB instead. The Linux kernel project is now moving toward removing obsolete PCMCIA drivers from the mainline kernel.\nName.\nPCMCIA stands for \"Personal Computer Memory Card International Association\", the group of companies that defined the standard. \nIt has been described 'probably one of the most mocked acronyms of the industry'. This acronym was difficult to say and remember, and was sometimes jokingly referred to as \"People Can't Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms\". To recognize increased scope beyond memory, and to aid in marketing, the association acquired the rights to the simpler term \"PC Card\" from IBM. This was the name of the standard from version 2 of the specification onwards. These cards were used for wireless networks, modems, and other functions in notebook PCs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Historically, the largest meal used to be eaten around midday, and called dinner. Especially among the elite, it gradually migrated to later in the day over the 16th to 19th centuries. The word has different meanings depending on culture, and may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of day. In particular, it is still sometimes used for a meal at noon or in the early afternoon on special occasions, such as a Christmas dinner. In hot climates, the main meal is more likely to be eaten in the evening, after the temperature has fallen.\nEtymology.\nThe word is from the Old French (c.\u20091300) , meaning \"dine\", from the stem of Gallo-Romance \"desjunare\" (\"to break one's fast\"), from Latin (which indicates the opposite of an action) + Late Latin \"ieiunare\" (\"to fast\"), from Latin (\"fasting, hungry\"). The Romanian word and the French retain this etymology and to some extent the meaning (whereas the Spanish word and Portuguese are related but are exclusively used for breakfast). Eventually, the term shifted to referring to the heavy main meal of the day, even if it had been preceded by a breakfast meal (or even both breakfast and lunch).\nTime of day.\nPre-Modern.\nReflecting the typical custom of the 17th century, Louis XIV dined at noon, and had supper at 10:00 pm. But in Europe, dinner began to move later in the day during the 1700s, due to developments in work practices, lighting, financial status, and cultural changes. The fashionable hour for dinner continued to be incrementally postponed during the 18th century, to two and three in the afternoon, and, in 1765, King George III dined at 4:00 pm, though his infant sons had theirs with their governess at 2:00 pm, leaving time to visit the queen as she dressed for dinner with the king. But in France Marie Antoinette, when still Dauphine of France in 1770, wrote that when at the Ch\u00e2teau de Choisy the court still dined at 2:00 pm, with a supper after the theatre at around 10:00 pm, before bed at 1:00 or 1:30 am.\nAt the time of the First French Empire an English traveler to Paris remarked upon the \"abominable habit of dining as late as seven in the evening\". By about 1850 English middle-class dinners were around 5:00 or 6:00 pm, allowing men to arrive back from work, but there was a continuing pressure for the hour to drift later, led by the elite who did not have to work set hours, and as commutes got longer as cities expanded. In the mid-19th century the issue was something of a social minefield, with a generational element. John Ruskin, once he married in 1848, dined at 6:00 pm, which his parents thought \"unhealthy\". Mrs Gaskell dined between 4:00 and 5:00 pm. The fictional Mr Pooter, a lower middle-class Londoner in 1888\u201389 and a diner at 5:00 pm, was invited by his son to dine at 8:00 pm, but \"[he] said we did not pretend to be fashionable people, and would like the dinner earlier\".\nThe satirical novel \"Living for Appearances\" (1855) by Henry Mayhew and his brother Augustus begins with the views of the hero on the matter. He dines at 7:00 pm, and often complains of \"the disgusting and tradesman-like custom of early dining\", say at 2:00 pm. The \"Royal hour\" he regards as 8:00 pm, but he does not aspire to that. He tells people \"Tell me when you dine, and I will tell you what you are\", in apparent reference to Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin's famous, \"Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.\"\nModern.\nIn many modern usages, the term \"dinner\" refers to the evening meal, which is now typically the largest meal of the day in most Western cultures. When this meaning is used, the preceding meals are usually referred to as breakfast, lunch and perhaps a tea. Supper is now often an alternative term for dinner; originally this was always a later secondary evening meal, after an early dinner.\nThe divide between different meanings of \"dinner\" is not cut-and-dried based on either geography or socioeconomic class. The term for the midday meal is most commonly used by working-class people, especially in the English Midlands, North of England and the central belt of Scotland. Even in systems in which dinner is the meal usually eaten at the end of the day, an individual dinner may still refer to a main or more sophisticated meal at any time in the day, such as a banquet, feast, or a special meal eaten on a Sunday or holiday, such as Christmas dinner or Thanksgiving dinner. At such a dinner, the people who dine together may be formally dressed and consume food with an array of utensils. These dinners are often divided into three or more courses. Appetizers consisting of options such as soup or salad, precede the main course, which is followed by the dessert.\nDinner times.\nUnited States.\nDinner time in the United States peaks at 6:19\u00a0p.m., according to an American Time Use Survey analysis, with most households eating dinner between 5:07\u00a0p.m. and 8:19\u00a0p.m. According to the data from 2018 to 2022, the states that ate the earliest were Pennsylvania (5:37\u00a0p.m. peak) and Maine (5:40\u00a0p.m. peak), while the states that ate the latest were Texas and Mississippi (both a 7:02\u00a0p.m. peak) and Washington, D.C., which ate at 7:10\u00a0p.m. peak.\nUnited Kingdom.\nA survey by Jacob's Creek, an Australian winemaker, found the average evening meal time in the U.K. to be 7:47pm.\nParties.\nA dinner party is a social gathering at which people congregate to eat dinner. Dinners exist on a spectrum, from a basic meal to a state dinner.\nAncient Roman.\nDuring the times of Ancient Rome, a dinner party was referred to as a \"convivium\", and was a significant event for Roman emperors and senators to congregate and discuss their relations.\nEnglish.\nIn London (c.\u20091875\u2013c.\u20091900), dinner parties were formal occasions that included printed invitations and formal RSVPs. The food served at these parties ranged from large, extravagant food displays and several meal courses to more simple fare and food service. Activities sometimes included singing and poetry reciting, among others.\nFormal.\nThe general guidelines of a formal dinner include the following:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was motivated by collective Palestinian frustration over Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as it approached a twenty-year mark, having begun in the wake of the 1967 Arab\u2013Israeli War. The uprising lasted from December 1987 until the Madrid Conference of 1991, though some date its conclusion to 1993, the year the Oslo Accords were signed.\nThe Intifada began on 9 December 1987 in the Jabalia refugee camp after an Israeli truck driver collided with parked civilian vehicles, killing four Palestinian workers, three of whom were from the refugee camp. Palestinians charged that the collision was a deliberate response for the killing of an Israeli in Gaza days earlier. Israel denied that the crash, which came at time of heightened tensions, was intentional or coordinated. The Palestinian response was characterized by protests, civil disobedience, and strikes, with excessive violence in response from Israeli security forces. There was graffiti, barricading, and widespread throwing of stones and Molotov cocktails at the Israeli army and its infrastructure within the West Bank and Gaza Strip. These contrasted with civil efforts including general strikes, boycotts of Israeli Civil Administration institutions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, an economic boycott consisting of refusal to work in Israeli settlements on Israeli products, refusal to pay taxes, and refusal to drive Palestinian cars with Israeli licenses.\nIsrael deployed some 80,000 soldiers in response. Israeli countermeasures, which initially included the use of live rounds frequently in cases of riots, were criticized by Human Rights Watch as disproportionate, in addition to Israel's excessive use of lethal force. In the first 13 months, 332 Palestinians and 12 Israelis were killed. Images of soldiers beating adolescents with clubs then led to the adoption of firing semi-lethal plastic bullets. During the whole six-year intifada, the Israeli army killed at least 1,087 Palestinians, of which 240 were children.\nAmong Israelis, 100 civilians and 60 Israeli soldiers were killed, often by militants outside the control of the Intifada's UNLU, and more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and 1,700 soldiers were injured. Intra-Palestinian violence was also a prominent feature of the Intifada, with widespread executions of an estimated 822 Palestinians killed as alleged Israeli collaborators (1988\u2013April 1994). At the time Israel reportedly obtained information from some 18,000 Palestinians who had been compromised, although fewer than half had any proven contact with the Israeli authorities. Years later, the Second Intifada took place from September 2000 to 2005.\nBackground.\nAccording to Mubarak Awad, a Palestinian American clinical psychologist, the Intifada was a protest against Israeli repression including \"beatings, shootings, killings, house demolitions, uprooting of trees, deportations, extended imprisonments, and detentions without trial\". In the years prior to the Intifada, Awad had been \"among the keenest advocates for nonviolent struggle\", founding the Palestinian Center for the Study of Nonviolence. After Israel's capture of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Sinai Peninsula, and Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt in the Six-Day War in 1967, frustration grew among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories. Israel opened its labor market to Palestinians in the newly occupied territories, who were recruited mainly to do unskilled or semi-skilled labor jobs Israelis did not want. By the time of the Intifada, over 40 percent of the Palestinian workforce worked in Israel daily. Additionally, Israeli expropriation of Palestinian land, high birthrates in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the limited allocation of land for new building and agriculture created conditions marked by growing population density and rising unemployment, even for those with university degrees. At the time of the Intifada, only one in eight college-educated Palestinians could find degree-related work. This was coupled with an expansion of a Palestinian university system catering to people from refugee camps, villages, and small towns, generating a new Palestinian elite from a lower social strata that was more activistic and confrontational with Israel. According to Israeli historian and diplomat Shlomo Ben-Ami in his book \"Scars of War, Wounds of Peace\", the Intifada was also a rebellion against the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Ben-Ami describes the PLO as uncompromising and reliant on international terrorism, which he says exacerbated Palestinian grievances.\nThe Israeli Labor Party's Yitzhak Rabin, then Defense Minister, added deportations in August 1985 to Israel's \"Iron Fist\" policy of cracking down on Palestinian nationalism. This, which led to 50 deportations in the following four years, was accompanied by economic integration and increasing Israeli settlements, such that the Jewish settler population in the West Bank alone nearly doubled from 35,000 in 1984 to 64,000 in 1988, reaching 130,000 by the mid-nineties. Referring to the developments, Israeli minister of Economics and Finance, Gad Ya'acobi, stated that \"a creeping process of \"de facto\" annexation\" contributed to a growing militancy in Palestinian society.\nDuring the 1980s a number of mainstream Israeli politicians referred to policies of transferring the Palestinian population out of the territories, leading to Palestinian fears that Israel planned to evict them. Public statements calling for transfer of the Palestinian population were made by Deputy Defense Minister Michael Dekel, Cabinet Minister Mordechai Tzipori and government Minister Yosef Shapira among others. Describing the causes of the Intifada, Benny Morris refers to the \"all-pervading element of humiliation\", caused by the protracted occupation which he says was \"always a brutal and mortifying experience for the occupied\" and was \"founded on brute force, repression and fear, collaboration and treachery, beatings and torture chambers, and daily intimidation, humiliation, and manipulation.\"\nTrigger for the uprising.\nWhile the catalyst for the First Intifada is generally dated to a truck incident involving several Palestinian fatalities at the Erez Crossing in December 1987, Mazin Qumsiyeh argues, against Donald Neff, that it began with multiple youth demonstrations earlier in the preceding month. Some sources consider that the perceived IDF failure in late November 1987 to stop a Palestinian guerrilla operation, the Night of the Gliders, in which six Israeli soldiers were killed, helped catalyze local Palestinians to rebel.\nMass demonstrations had occurred a year earlier when, after two Gaza students at Birzeit University had been shot by Israeli soldiers on campus on 4 December 1986, the Israelis responded with harsh punitive measures, involving summary arrest, detention, and systematic beatings of handcuffed Palestinian youths, ex-prisoners and activists, some 250 of whom were detained in four cells inside a converted army camp, known popularly as Ansar 11, outside Gaza City. A policy of deportation was introduced to intimidate activists in January 1987. Violence simmered as a schoolboy from Khan Yunis was shot dead by Israeli soldiers pursuing him in a Jeep. Over the summer the IDF's Lieutenant Ron Tal, who was responsible for guarding detainees at Ansar 11, was shot dead at point-blank range while stuck in a Gaza traffic jam. A curfew forbidding Gaza residents from leaving their homes was imposed for three days, during the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha. In two incidents on 1 and 6 October 1987, the IDF ambushed and killed seven Gaza men, reportedly affiliated with Islamic Jihad, who had escaped from prison in May. Some days later, a 17-year-old schoolgirl, Intisar al-'Attar, was shot in the back while in her schoolyard in Deir al-Balah by a settler in the Gaza Strip, who claimed the girl had been throwing stones. The Arab summit in Amman in November 1987 focused on the Iran\u2013Iraq War, and the Palestinian issue was shunted to the sidelines for the first time in years.\nTimeline of the Intifada.\nIsrael's occupation and Palestinian unrest.\nIsrael's drive into the occupied territories had occasioned spontaneous acts of resistance, but the administration, pursuing an \"iron fist\" policy of collective punishment including deportations, demolition of homes, curfews, collective punishment, and the suppression of political and educational institutions, was confident that Palestinian resistance was exhausted. The assessment that the unrest would collapse proved to be mistaken.\nOn 8 December 1987, an Israeli truck crashed into a row of cars containing Palestinians returning from working in Israel, at the Erez checkpoint. Four Palestinians, three of them residents of the Jabalya refugee camp, the largest of the eight refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, were killed and seven others seriously injured. The traffic incident was witnessed by hundreds of Palestinian labourers returning home from work. The funerals, attended by 10,000 people from the camp that evening, quickly led to a large demonstration. Rumours swept the camp that the incident was an act of intentional retaliation for the stabbing to death of an Israeli businessman, killed while shopping in Gaza two days earlier. The next day, December 9, Palestinian teenagers threw stones and, according to the IDF, also gasoline bombs, at military vehicles. The soldiers started shooting in response, killing 17 year-old Hatem Al-Sesi and wounding 16 others.\nOn 9 December, several popular and professional Palestinian leaders held a press conference in West Jerusalem with the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights in response to the deterioration of the situation. While they convened, reports came in that demonstrations at the Jabalya camp were underway and that a 17-year-old Palestinian had been shot to death by Israeli soldiers (after, as the IDF claimed, a group of Palestinians threw gasoline bombs at an IDF vehicle). He would later become known as the first martyr of the Intifada. Protests rapidly spread into the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Youths took control of neighbourhoods, closed off camps with barricades of garbage, stone and burning tires, meeting soldiers who endeavoured to break through with petrol bombs. Palestinian shopkeepers closed their businesses, and labourers refused to turn up to their work in Israel. Israel defined these activities as 'riots', and justified the repression as necessary to restore 'law and order'. Within days the occupied territories were engulfed in a wave of demonstrations and commercial strikes on an unprecedented scale. Specific elements of the occupation were targeted for attack: military vehicles, Israeli buses and Israeli banks. None of the dozen Israeli settlements were attacked and there were no Israeli fatalities from stone-throwing at cars at this early period of the outbreak. Equally unprecedented was the extent of mass participation in these disturbances: tens of thousands of civilians, including women and children. The Israeli security forces used the full panoply of crowd control measures to try and quell the disturbances: cudgels, nightsticks, tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets, and live ammunition. But the disturbances only gathered momentum.\nSoon there was widespread rock-throwing, road-blocking and tire burning throughout the territories. By 12 December, six Palestinians had died and 30 had been injured in the violence. The next day, rioters threw a gasoline bomb at the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem, though no one was hurt. The Israeli police and military response also led to a number of injuries and deaths. The IDF killed many Palestinians at the beginning of the Intifada, the majority killed during demonstrations and riots. Since initially a high proportion of those killed were civilians and youths, Yitzhak Rabin adopted a fallback policy of 'might, power and beatings'. Israel used mass arrests of Palestinians, engaged in collective punishments like closing down West Bank universities for most years of the Intifada, and West Bank schools for a total of 12 months. Hebron University was closed by the army from January 1988 to June 1991. Round-the-clock curfews were imposed over 1600 times in just the first year. Communities were cut off from supplies of water, electricity and fuel. At any one time, 25,000 Palestinians would be confined to their homes. Trees were uprooted on Palestinians farms, and agricultural produce blocked from being sold. In the first year over 1,000 Palestinians had their homes either demolished or blocked up. Settlers also engaged in private attacks on Palestinians. Palestinian refusals to pay taxes were met with confiscations of property and licenses, new car taxes, and heavy fines for any family whose members had been identified as stone-throwers.\nCasualties.\nIn the first year in the Gaza Strip alone, 142 Palestinians were killed, while no Israelis died. 77 were shot dead, and 37 died from tear-gas inhalation. 17 died from beatings at the hand of Israeli police or soldiers. During the whole six-year intifada, the Israeli army killed from 1,087 to 1,204 (or 1,284) Palestinians, 241/332 being children. Tens of thousands were arrested (some sources said 57,000; others said 120,000), 481 were deported while 2,532 had their houses razed to the ground. Between December 1987 and June 1991, 120,000 were injured, 15,000 arrested and 1,882 homes demolished. One journalistic calculation reports that in the Gaza Strip alone from 1988 to 1993, some 60,706 Palestinians suffered injuries from shootings, beatings or tear gas. In the first five weeks alone, 35 Palestinians were killed and some 1,200 wounded. Some regarded the Israeli response as encouraging more Palestinians into participating. B'Tselem calculated 179 Israelis killed, while official Israeli statistics place the total at 200 over the same period. 3,100 Israelis, 1,700 of them soldiers, and 1,400 civilians suffered injuries. By 1990 Ktzi'ot Prison in the Negev held approximately one out of every 50 West Bank and Gazan males older than 16 years. Gerald Kaufman remarked: \"[F]riends of Israel as well as foes have been shocked and saddened by that country's response to the disturbances.\" In an article in the London Review of Books, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt asserted that IDF soldiers were given truncheons and encouraged to break the bones of Palestinian protesters. The Swedish branch of Save the Children estimated that \"23,600 to 29,900 children required medical treatment for their beating injuries in the first two years of the Intifada\", one third of whom were children under the age of ten years.\nIsrael adopted a policy of arresting key representatives of Palestinian institutions. After lawyers in Gaza went on strike to protest their inability to visit their detained clients, Israel detained the deputy head of its association without trial for six months. Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, the head of the Gaza Medical Association, was likewise arrested and held for a similar period of detention, as were several women active in Women's Work Committees. During Ramadan, many camps in Gaza were placed under curfew for weeks, impeding residents from buying food, and Al-Shati, Jabalya and Burayj were subjected to saturation bombing by tear gas. During the first year of the Intifada, the total number of casualties in the camps from such bombing totalled 16.\nBetween 1988 and 1992, intra-Palestinian violence claimed the lives of nearly 1,000. By June 1990, according to Benny Morris, \"[T]he Intifada seemed to have lost direction. A symptom of the PLO's frustration was the great increase in the killing of suspected collaborators.\" Roughly 18,000 Palestinians, compromised by Israeli intelligence, are said to have given information to the other side. Collaborators were threatened with death or ostracism unless they desisted, and if their collaboration with the Occupying Power continued, were executed by special troops such as the \"Black Panthers\" and \"Red Eagles\". An estimated 771 (according to Associated Press) to 942 (according to the IDF) Palestinians were executed on suspicion of collaboration during the span of the Intifada.\nPalestinian leadership.\nThe Intifada was not initiated by any single individual or organization. Local leadership came from groups and organizations affiliated with the PLO that operated within the Occupied Territories; Fatah, the Popular Front, the Democratic Front and the Palestine Communist Party. The PLO's rivals in this activity were the Islamic organizations, Hamas and Islamic Jihad as well as local leadership in cities such as Beit Sahour and Bethlehem. However, the Intifada was predominantly led by community councils led by Hanan Ashrawi, Faisal Husseini and Haidar Abdel-Shafi, that promoted independent networks for education (underground schools as the regular schools were closed by the military in reprisal), medical care, and food aid. The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) gained credibility where the Palestinian society complied with the issued communiques. There was a collective commitment to abstain from lethal violence, a notable departure from past practice, which, according to Shalev arose from a calculation that recourse to arms would lead to an Israeli bloodbath and undermine the support they had in Israeli liberal quarters. The PLO and its chairman Yassir Arafat had also decided on an unarmed strategy, in the expectation that negotiations at that time would lead to an agreement with Israel. The First Intifada was mostly peaceful and non-violent, and it has been described as a \"quiet revolution\" by Mary King. Pearlman attributes the non-violent character of the uprising to the movement's internal organization and its capillary outreach to neighborhood committees that ensured that lethal revenge would not be the response even in the face of Israeli state repression. Hamas and Islamic Jihad cooperated with the leadership at the outset, and throughout the first year of the uprising conducted no armed attacks, except for stabbing of a soldier in October 1988 and the detonation of two roadside bombs, which had no impact.\nPivot to the two-state solution.\nLeaflets publicizing the Intifada's aims demanded the complete withdrawal of Israel from the territories it had occupied in 1967: the lifting of curfews and checkpoints; it appealed to Palestinians to join in civic resistance, while asking them not to employ arms, since military resistance would only invite devastating retaliation from Israel; it also called for the establishment of the Palestinian state on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, abandoning the standard rhetorical calls, still current at the time, for the \"liberation\" of all of Palestine.\nHamas.\nDuring the First Intifada the goal of Hamas was to destroy Israel and replace it with an Islamist Palestinian state, the group had very poor relations with the PLO and UNLU due to the PLO recognition of Israel, and was their main competitor for power.\nHamas both participated in protests organized by the UNLU and organized its own protests, mainly organizing around mosques while jockeying for influence with the PLO and UNLU. They also engaged in armed combat operations targeting Israeli soldiers and civilians. During the 1st year of the Intifada there were only 10 attacks which were limited to detonating explosives and shooting at patrols, but over time these attacks increased in frequency with the 2nd year seeing 32 attacks including the kidnapping of 2 Israeli soldiers within the Green Line. In response to this Israel began to arrest and kill many Hamas leaders including Ahmad Yassin, but by this point Hamas was too big for Israel to destroy easily so the group survived these counterattacks. By the end of the Intifada the groups had emerged as the biggest winner with them gaining significant political and military power both within Palestine and abroad.\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad.\nThroughout the First Intifada the goal of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was the establishment of an Islamist Palestinian state spanning the whole of former Mandatory Palestine and the destruction of Israel. In this and other aspects the groups ideology similar to Khomeinism. During the Intifada the PIJ would use both terrorism and civil resistance throughout the Intifada. During the early stages of the Intifada it seemed likely that the group would merge with the PLO largely due to their mutual disapproval of violence at the time. But this never happened because the UNLU disliked the PIJ and prevented the merger, though the groups still cooperated periodically.\nAt the beginning of the Intifada the PIJ had only 300 members but they have far more ideological supporters which gave them outsized influence for their size. In the first month of the Intifada it was very active in organizing and calling for protests but after the start of 1988 the groups decreased in activity and was crippled in March 1988 when the IDF arrested many of the leaders and members. It took the group until Fall of 1988 to regroup and after it did it took on a more militant approach and ended its relationship with the PLO.\nOther notable events.\nAssassination of Abu Jihad.\nOn 16 April 1988, a leader of the PLO, Khalil al-Wazir, \"nom de guerre\" Abu Jihad or 'Father of the Struggle', was assassinated in Tunis by an Israeli commando squad. Israel claimed he was the 'remote-control \"main organizer\" of the revolt', and perhaps believed that his death would break the back of the Intifada. During the mass demonstrations and mourning in Gaza that followed, two of the main mosques of Gaza were raided by the IDF and worshippers were beaten and tear-gassed. In total between 11 and 15 Palestinians were killed during the demonstrations and riots in Gaza and West Bank that followed al-Wazir's death. In June of that year, the Arab League agreed to support the Intifada financially at the 1988 Arab League summit. The Arab League reaffirmed its financial support in the 1989 summit.\nIsraeli defense minister Yitzhak Rabin's response was: \"We will teach them there is a price for refusing the laws of Israel.\" When time in prison did not stop the activists, Israel crushed the boycott by imposing heavy fines and seizing and disposing of equipment, furnishings, and goods from local stores, factories and homes.\n1990 Temple Mount killings.\nOn 8 October 1990, 22 Palestinians were killed by Israeli police during the 1990 Temple Mount killings at Al-Aqsa. This led the Palestinians to adopt more lethal tactics, with three Israeli civilians and one IDF soldier stabbed in Jerusalem and Gaza two weeks later. Incidents of stabbing persisted. The Israeli state apparatus carried out contradictory and conflicting policies that were seen to have injured Israel's own interests, such as the closing of educational establishments (putting more youths onto the streets) and issuing the Shin Bet list of collaborators. Suicide bombings by Palestinian militants started on 16 April 1993 with the Mehola Junction bombing, carried at the end of the Intifada.\nResponse by the United Nations.\nThe large number of Palestinian casualties provoked international condemnation. In subsequent resolutions, including 607 and 608, the Security Council demanded Israel cease deportations of Palestinians. In November 1988, Israel was condemned by a large majority of the UN General Assembly for its actions against the Intifada. The resolution was repeated in the following years.\nSecurity Council.\nOn 17 February 1989, the UN Security Council drafted a resolution condemning Israel for disregarding Security Council resolutions, as well as for not complying with the fourth Geneva Convention. The United States, put a veto on a draft resolution which would have strongly deplored it. On 9 June, the US again put a veto on a resolution. On 7 November, the US vetoed a third draft resolution, condemning alleged Israeli violations of human rights\nOn 14 October 1990, Israel openly declared that it would not abide Security Council Resolution 672 because it did not pay attention to attacks on Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall. Israel refused to receive a delegation of the Secretary-General, which would investigate Israeli violence. The following Resolution 673 made little impression and Israel kept on obstructing UN investigations.\nReactions and outcome.\nImpact on Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe Intifada was recognized as an occasion where the Palestinians acted cohesively and independently of their leadership or assistance of neighboring Arab states. It transformed the conflict, helping bring about the Madrid Conference of 1991 and the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993.\nThe success of the Intifada gave Arafat and his followers the confidence they needed to moderate their political program. At the meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiers in mid-November 1988, Arafat won a majority for the historic decision to recognize Israel's legitimacy, accept all the relevant UN resolutions going back to 29 November 1947, and adopt the principle of a two-state solution based on 1967 borders.\nReflecting on the impact of the Intifada, former United States President Jimmy Carter wrote that, \"The Palestinians' nonviolent resistance in the First Intifada ... contested military occupation from a store of classic methods used on every continent in today's world, as people fight for human rights and justice with concern for the connection between the ends and means.\" He added that, \"the use of concerted nonviolent action offers a basis for transformation of conflict to peace building.\"\nThe founder of the Palestinian Center for the Study of Nonviolence, Jerusalem-born Mubarak Awad, played a major role in advocating for and organizing civil disobedience campaigns against the Israel's occupation in the years prior to the First Intifada. Following the outbreak of the Intifada, Israel arrested and deported Awad in 1988, despite opposition from the Reagan administration. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ordered Awad's expulsion on grounds of inciting a \"civil uprising\" and distributing leaflets that advocated for non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.\nPalestinian politician and leader of the Palestinian National Initiative party, Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, attributed the foundations of the First Intifada to the rise of grassroots, local committees across the occupied Palestinian territories in the 1970s. He argued that, \"Hamas became radicalized by the brutality of the Occupation, by the violence used to repress the first Intifada.\" Barghouti has contended the \"militarization\" of the Second Intifada, which began in 2000, was a mistake, and he criticized Fatah for failing to condemn suicide bombings at the time.\nMary Elizabeth King (2009) wrote that the nonviolence of the First Intifada \"neither lifted the military occupation nor stopped the implanting of Israeli settlements in lands set aside for the Palestinians by the United Nations. Nevertheless, the uprising's nonviolent sanctions achieved more than had decades of armed attacks on largely civilian targets. ... Israeli agents provocateurs in Arab disguise ... joined demonstrations and sought to incite demonstrators to use violence. The local committee [organizing the nonviolent demonstrations] prevented such provocations from instigating lethal escalations.\" The First Intifada disintegrated \"into violence after Israel's incarceration, deportation, or discrediting of the very activist intellectuals who had sustained the uprising's nonviolent character\".\nImpact on Israel's reputation.\nThe Intifada broke the image of Jerusalem as a united Israeli city. There was unprecedented international coverage, and the Israeli response was criticized in media outlets and international fora.&lt;ref name=\"res_43/21\"&gt;UNGA, http:// . 3 November 1988 (doc.nr. A/RES/43/21).&lt;/ref&gt; The impact on the Israeli services sector, including the important Israeli tourist industry, was notably negative.\nJordan severs ties with the West Bank.\nJordan severed its residual administrative and financial ties to the West Bank in the face of sweeping popular support for the PLO. The failure of the \"Iron Fist\" policy, Israel's deteriorating international image, Jordan cutting legal and administrative ties to the West Bank, and the U.S.'s recognition of the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people forced Rabin to seek an end to the violence though negotiation and dialogue with the PLO.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "71717", "revid": "8524693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71717", "title": "Second Intifada", "text": "2000\u20132005 Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation\nThe Second Intifada (; ), also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada, was a major uprising by Palestinians against Israel and its occupation from 2000. Starting as a civilian uprising in Jerusalem and Israel proper, Israeli security responded with extreme violence, killing over 100 Palestinian protesters within the first few weeks. This led to the uprising devolving into a period of heightened violence in Palestine and Israel. This violence, including shooting attacks, suicide bombings, and military operations continued until the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005, which ended hostilities.\nThe general triggers for the unrest are speculated to have been centered on the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit, which was expected to reach a final agreement on the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process in July 2000. An uptick in violent incidents started in September 2000, after Israeli politician Ariel Sharon made a provocative visit to the Temple Mount; the visit itself was peaceful, but, as anticipated, sparked protests and riots that Israeli police put down with rubber bullets, live ammunition, and tear gas. Within the first few days of the uprising, the Israeli military fired one million rounds of ammunition.\nDuring the first few weeks of the uprising, the ratio of Palestinians to Israelis killed was around 20 to 1. Israeli security forces engaged in gunfights, targeted killings, tank attacks, and airstrikes; Palestinians engaged in gunfights, stone-throwing, and rocket attacks. The approximate 138 suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian militant factions after March 2001 became one of the prominent features of the Intifada and mainly targeted Israeli civilians. With a combined casualty figure for combatants and civilians, the violence is estimated to have resulted in the deaths of approximately 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis, as well as 64 foreign nationals.\nThe Second Intifada ended with the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005, as Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and Sharon, by then Israel's prime minister, agreed to take definitive steps to de-escalate the hostilities. They also reaffirmed their commitment to the \"roadmap for peace\" that had been proposed by the Quartet on the Middle East in 2003. Additionally, Sharon agreed to release 900 Palestinian prisoners and further stated that Israeli troops would withdraw from those parts of the West Bank that they had re-occupied while fighting Palestinian militants during the uprising.\nEtymology.\nSecond Intifada refers to a second Palestinian uprising, following the first Palestinian uprising, which occurred between December 1987 and 1993. \"Intifada\" () translates into English as \"uprising\". Its root is an Arabic word meaning \"the shaking off\". It has been used in the meaning of \"insurrection\" in various Arab countries; the Egyptian riots of 1977, for example, were called the \"bread intifada\". The term refers to a revolt against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.\nAl-Aqsa Intifada refers to Al-Aqsa, the main name for the mosque compound constructed in the 8th century CE atop the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, and also known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif.\nThe Intifada is sometimes called the Oslo War (\u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5\u05e1\u05dc\u05d5) by some Israelis who consider it to be the result of concessions made by Israel following the Oslo Accords, and Arafat's War, after the late Palestinian leader whom some blamed for starting it. Others have named what they consider disproportionate response to what was initially a popular uprising by unarmed demonstrators as the reason for the escalation of the Intifada into an all-out war.\nBackground.\nOslo Accords.\nUnder the Oslo Accords, signed in 1993 and 1995, Israel committed to the phased withdrawal of its forces from parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, and affirmed the Palestinian right to self-government within those areas through the creation of a Palestinian Authority. For their part, the Palestine Liberation Organization formally recognised Israel and committed to adopting responsibility for internal security in population centres in the areas evacuated. Palestinian self-rule was to last for a five-year interim period during which a permanent agreement would be negotiated. However, the realities on the ground left both sides deeply disappointed with the Oslo process. Palestinian freedom of movement reportedly worsened from 1993 to 2000. Israelis and Palestinians have blamed each other for the failure of the Oslo peace process. In the five years immediately following the signing of the Oslo accords, 405 Palestinians and 256 Israelis were killed.\nFrom 1996 Israel made extensive contingency plans and preparations, collectively code-named \"Musical Charm\", in the eventuality that peace talks might fail. In 1998, after concluding that the 5-year plan stipulated in the Oslo Talks would not be completed, the IDF implemented an Operation Field of Thorns plan to conquer towns in Area C, and some areas of Gaza, and military exercises at regimental level were carried out in April 2000 to that end. Palestinian preparations were defensive, and small-scale, more to reassure the local population than to cope with an eventual attack from Israel. The intensity of these operations led one Brigadier General, Zvi Fogel to wonder whether Israel's military preparations would not turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nIn 1995, Shimon Peres took the place of Yitzhak Rabin, who had been assassinated by Yigal Amir, a Jewish extremist opposed to the Oslo peace agreement. In the 1996 elections, Israelis elected a right-wing coalition led by the Likud candidate, Benjamin Netanyahu who was followed in 1999 by the Labor Party leader Ehud Barak.\nCamp David Summit.\nFrom 11 to 25 July 2000, the Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David was held between the United States President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat. The talks ultimately failed with each side blaming the other. There were five principal obstacles to agreement: borders and territorial contiguity, Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, Palestinian refugees and their right of return, Israeli security concerns and Israeli settlements. Disappointment at the situation over the summer led to a significant fracturing of the PLO as many Fatah factions abandoned it to join Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\nOn 13 September 2000, Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Legislative Council postponed the planned unilateral declaration of an independent Palestinian state.\nIsraeli settlements.\nWhile Peres had limited settlement construction at the request of US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, Netanyahu continued construction within existing Israeli settlements and put forward plans for the construction of a new neighbourhood, Har Homa, in East Jerusalem. However, he fell far short of the Shamir government's 1991\u201392 level and refrained from building new settlements, although the Oslo agreements stipulated no such ban. Construction of housing units before Oslo, 1991\u201392: 13,960; after Oslo, 1994\u201395: 3,840; 1996\u20131997: 3,570.\nTo marginalise the settlers' more militant wing, Barak courted moderate settler opinion, securing agreement for the dismantlement of 12 new outposts that had been constructed since the Wye River Agreement of November 1998, but the continued expansion of existing settlements with plans for 3,000 new houses in the West Bank drew strong condemnation from the Palestinian leadership. Though construction within existing settlements was permitted under the Oslo agreements, Palestinian supporters contend that any continued construction was contrary to its spirit, prejudiced the outcome of final status negotiations, and undermined Palestinian confidence in Barak's desire for peace.\nTimeline.\n2000.\nThe Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David, from 11 to 25 July 2000, took place between the United States President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat. It failed with the latter two blaming each other for the failure of the talks. There were four principal obstacles to agreement: territory, Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, Palestinian refugees and the right of return, and Israeli security concerns.\nAriel Sharon visits the Temple Mount.\nOn 28 September, Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon and a Likud party delegation guarded by hundreds of Israeli riot police visited the Temple Mount, which is widely considered the third holiest site in Islam. Israel has claimed sovereignty over the Mount and the rest of East Jerusalem since 1980, and the compound is the holiest site in Judaism.\nThe Israeli Interior Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, who permitted Sharon's visit, later claimed that he had telephoned the Palestinian Authority's security chief Jibril Rajoub before the visit and gotten his reassurances that as long as Sharon didn't enter the mosques his visit wouldn't cause any problems. Rajoub vociferously denied having given any such reassurances.\nShortly after Sharon left the site, angry demonstrations by Palestinian Jerusalemites outside erupted into rioting. The person in charge of the waqf at the time, Abu Qteish, was later indicted by Israel for using a loud-speaker to call on Palestinians to defend Al-Aqsa, which action Israeli authorities claimed was responsible for the subsequent stone-throwing in the direction of the Wailing Wall. Israeli police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, while protesters hurled stones and other projectiles, injuring 25 policemen, of whom one was seriously injured and had to be taken to hospital. At least three Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets.\nThe stated purpose for Sharon's visit of the compound was to assert the right of all Israelis to visit the Temple Mount; however, according to Likud spokesman Ofir Akunis, the actual purpose was to \"show that under a Likud government [the Temple Mount] will remain under Israeli sovereignty.\" Ehud Barak in the Camp David negotiations had insisted that East Jerusalem, where the Haram was located, would remain under complete Israeli sovereignty. In response to accusations by Ariel Sharon of government readiness to concede the site to the Palestinians, the Israeli government gave Sharon permission to visit the area. When alerted of his intentions, senior Palestinian figures, such as Yasser Arafat, Saeb Erekat, and Faisal Husseini, all asked Sharon to call off his visit.\nTen days earlier the Palestinians had observed their annual memorial day for the Sabra and Shatila massacre, where thousands of Lebanese and Palestinian Muslims were massacred by Lebanese Forces supported by the Israeli military. The Israeli Kahan Commission had concluded that Ariel Sharon, who was the Israeli Defense Minister during the Sabra and Shatila massacre, was found to bear personal responsibility \"for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge\" and \"not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed.\" Sharon's negligence in protecting the civilian population of Beirut, which had come under Israeli control, amounted to a \"non-fulfillment of a duty with which the Defence Minister was charged\", and it was recommended that Sharon be dismissed as Defence Minister. Sharon initially refused to resign, but after the death of an Israeli after a peace march, Sharon did resign as Defense minister, but remained in the Israeli cabinet.\nThe Palestinians condemned Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount as a provocation and an incursion, as were his armed bodyguards that arrived on the scene with him. Critics claim that Sharon knew that the visit could trigger violence, and that the purpose of his visit was political. According to one observer, Sharon, in walking on the Temple Mount, was \"skating on the thinnest ice in the Arab-Israeli conflict.\"\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", many in the Arab world, including Egyptians, Palestinians, Lebanese and Jordanians, point to Sharon's visit as the beginning of the Second Intifada and derailment of the peace process. According to Juliana Ochs, Sharon's visit 'symbolically instigated' the second intifada. Marwan Barghouti said that although Sharon's provocative actions were a rallying point for Palestinians, the Second Intifada would have erupted even had he not visited the Temple Mount.\nPost-visit Palestinian riots.\nOn 29 September 2000, the day after Sharon's visit, following Friday prayers, large riots broke out around the Old City of Jerusalem. Israeli police fired at Palestinians at the Temple Mount throwing stones over the Western Wall at Jewish worshippers. After the chief of Jerusalem's police force was knocked unconscious by a stone, they switched to live ammunition and killed four Palestinian youths. Up to 200 Palestinians and police were injured. Another three Palestinians were killed in the Old City and on the Mount of Olives. By the end of the day, seven Palestinians had been killed and 300 had been wounded; 70 Israeli policemen were also injured in the clashes.\nIn the days that followed, demonstrations erupted all over the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli police responded with live fire and rubber-coated bullets. In the first five days, at least 47 Palestinians were killed, and 1,885 were wounded. In Paris, as Jacques Chirac attempted to mediate between the parties, he protested to Barak that the ratio of Palestinians and Israelis killed and wounded on one day were such that he could not convince anyone the Palestinians were the aggressors. He also told Barak that \"continu(ing) to fire from helicopters on people throwing rocks\" and refusing an international inquiry was tantamount to rejecting Arafat's offer to participate in trilateral negotiations. During the first few days of riots, the IDF fired approximately 1.3\u00a0million bullets.\nAccording to Amnesty International the early Palestinian casualties were those taking part in demonstrations or bystanders. Amnesty further states that approximately 80% of the Palestinians killed during the first month were in demonstrations where Israeli security services lives were not in danger.\nOn 30 September 2000, the death of Muhammad al-Durrah, a Palestinian boy shot dead while sheltering behind his father in an alley in the Gaza Strip, was caught on video. Initially the boy's death and his father's wounding was attributed to Israeli soldiers. The scene assumed iconic status, as it was shown around the world and repeatedly broadcast on Arab television. The Israeli army initially assumed responsibility for the killing and apologised, and only retracted 2 months later, when an internal investigation cast doubt on the original version, and controversy subsequently raged as to whether indeed the IDF had fired the shots or Palestinian factions were responsible for the fatal gunshots.\nOctober 2000 events.\nThe \"October 2000 events\" refers to several days of disturbances and clashes within Israel, mostly between Arab citizens and the Israel police, as well as large-scale rioting by both Arabs and Jews. Twelve Arab citizens of Israel and a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip were killed by Israeli police, while an Israeli Jew was killed when his car was hit by a rock on the Tel-Aviv-Haifa freeway. During the first month of the Intifada, 141 Palestinians were killed and 5,984 were wounded, while 12 Israelis were killed and 65 wounded.\nA general strike and demonstrations across northern Israel began on 1 October and continued for several days. In some cases, the demonstrations escalated into clashes with the Israeli police involving rock-throwing, firebombing, and live-fire. Policemen used tear-gas and opened fire with rubber-coated bullets and later live ammunition in some instances, many times in contravention of police protocol governing riot-dispersion. This use of live ammunition was directly linked with many of the deaths by the Or Commission.\nOn 8 October, thousands of Jewish Israelis participated in violent acts in Tel Aviv and elsewhere, some throwing stones at Arabs, destroying Arab property and chanting \"Death to the Arabs.\"\nFollowing the riots, a high degree of tension between Jewish and Arab citizens and distrust between the Arab citizens and police were widespread. An investigation committee, headed by Supreme Court Justice Theodor Or, reviewed the violent riots and found that the police were poorly prepared to handle such riots and charged major officers with bad conduct. The Or Commission reprimanded Prime Minister Ehud Barak and recommended Shlomo Ben-Ami, then the Internal Security Minister, not serve again as Minister of Public Security. The committee also blamed Arab leaders and Knesset members for contributing to inflaming the atmosphere and making the violence more severe.\nRamallah lynching and Israeli response.\nOn 12 October, PA police arrested two Israeli reservists who had accidentally entered Ramallah, where in the preceding weeks a hundred Palestinians had been killed, nearly two dozen of them minors. Rumours quickly spread that Israeli undercover agents were in the building, and an angry crowd of more than 1,000 Palestinians gathered in front of the station calling for their death. Both soldiers were beaten, stabbed, and disembowelled, and one body was set on fire. An Italian television crew captured the killings on video and then broadcast the tape internationally. A British journalist had his camera destroyed by rioters as he attempted to take a picture. The brutality of the killings shocked the Israeli public, who saw it as proof of a deep-seated Palestinian hatred of Israel and Jews. In response, Israel launched a series of retaliatory air-strikes against Palestinian Authority targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The police station where the lynching had taken place was evacuated and destroyed in these operations. Israel later tracked down and arrested those responsible for killing the soldiers.\nNovember\u2013December 2000.\nClashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians increased sharply on 1 November, when three Israeli soldiers and six Palestinians were killed, and four IDF soldiers and 140 Palestinians were wounded. In subsequent days, casualties increased as the IDF attempted to restore order, with clashes occurring every day in November. A total of 122 Palestinians and 22 Israelis were killed. On 27 November, the first day of Ramadan, Israel eased restrictions on the passage of goods and fuel through the Karni crossing. That same day, the Jerusalem settlement of Gilo came under Palestinian heavy machine gun fire from Beit Jala. Israel tightened restrictions a week later, and Palestinians continued to clash with the IDF and Israeli settlers, with a total of 51 Palestinians and 8 Israelis killed in December. In a last attempt by the Clinton administration to achieve a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians, a summit was planned in Sharm el-Sheikh in December. However, Israeli Prime Minister Barak decided not to attend after the Palestinians delayed their acceptance of the Clinton Parameters.\n2001.\nThe Taba Summit between Israel and the Palestinian Authority was held from 21 to 27 January 2001, at Taba in the Sinai peninsula. Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat came closer to reaching a final settlement than any previous or subsequent peace talks yet ultimately failed to achieve their goals.\nOn 17 January 2001, Israeli teenager Ofir Rahum was murdered after being lured into Ramallah by a 24-year-old Palestinian, Mona Jaud Awana, a member of Fatah's Tanzim. She had contacted Ofir on the internet and engaged in an online romance with him for several months. She eventually convinced him to drive to Ramallah to meet her, where he was instead ambushed by three Palestinian gunmen and shot over fifteen times. Awana was later arrested in a massive military and police operation, and imprisoned for life. Five other Israelis were killed in January, along with eighteen Palestinians.\nAriel Sharon, at the time from the Likud party, ran against Ehud Barak from the Labor party. Sharon was elected Israeli Prime Minister 6 February 2001 in the 2001 special election to the Prime Ministership. Sharon refused to meet in person with Yasser Arafat.\nViolence in March resulted in the deaths of 8 Israelis, mostly civilians, and 26 Palestinians. In Hebron, a Palestinian sniper killed ten-month-old Israeli baby Shalhevet Pass. The murder shocked the Israeli public. According to the Israel police investigation the sniper aimed deliberately at the baby.\nOn 30 April 2001, seven Palestinian militants were killed in an explosion, one of them a participant in Ofir Rahum's murder. The IDF refused to confirm or deny Palestinian accusations that it was responsible.\nOn 7 May 2001, IDF naval commandos captured the vessel \"Santorini\", which was sailing in international waters towards Palestinian Authority-controlled Gaza. The ship was laden with weaponry. The Israeli investigation that followed said that the shipment had been purchased by Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC). The ship's value and that of its cargo was estimated at $10\u00a0million. The crew was reportedly planning to unload the cargo of weapons-filled barrels\u2014carefully sealed and waterproofed along with their contents\u2014at a prearranged location off the Gaza coast, where the Palestinian Authority would recover it.\nOn 8 May 2001, two Israeli teenagers, Yaakov \"Koby\" Mandell (13) and Yosef Ishran (14), were kidnapped while hiking near their village. Their bodies were discovered the next morning in a cave near where they lived. \"USA Today\" reported that, according to the police, both boys had \"been bound, stabbed and beaten to death with rocks.\" The newspaper continued, \"The walls of the cave in the Judean Desert were covered with the boys' blood, reportedly smeared there by the killers.\"\nAfter a suicide bombing struck Netanya on 18 May 2001, Israel for the first time since 1967 used warplanes to attack Palestinian Authority targets in the West Bank and Gaza, killing 12 Palestinians. In the past, airstrikes had been carried out with helicopter gunships.\nOn 1 June 2001, an Islamic Jihad suicide bomber detonated himself in the Tel Aviv coastline Dolphinarium dancing club. Twenty-one Israeli civilians, most of them high school students, were killed and 132 injured. The attack significantly hampered American attempts to negotiate a cease-fire.\nThe 12 June Murder of Georgios Tsibouktzakis by Palestinian snipers was later tied to Marwan Barghouti.\nA total of 469 Palestinians and 199 Israelis were killed in 2001. Amnesty International's report on the first year of the Intifada states:\nThe overwhelming majority of cases of unlawful killings and injuries in Israel and the Occupied Territories have been committed by the IDF using excessive force. In particular, the IDF have used US-supplied helicopters in punitive rocket attacks where there was no imminent danger to life. Israel has also used helicopter gunships to carry out extrajudicial executions and to fire at targets that resulted in the killing of civilians, including children. ... Hamas and Islamic Jihad have frequently placed bombs in public places, usually within Israel, in order to kill and maim large numbers of Israeli civilians in a random manner. Both organizations have fostered a cult of martyrdom and frequently use suicide bombers.\nPalestinian terrorists committed a number of suicide attacks later in 2001, among them the Sbarro restaurant massacre, with 15 civilian casualties (including 7 children); the Nahariya train station suicide bombing and the Pardes Hanna bus bombing, both with 3 civilian casualties; the Ben Yehuda Street bombing with 11 civilian deaths, many of them children; and the Haifa bus 16 suicide bombing, with 15 civilian casualties.\n2002.\nIn January 2002, the IDF Shayetet 13 naval commandos captured the \"Karine A\", a freighter carrying weapons from Iran towards Israel, believed to be intended for Palestinian militant use against Israel. It was discovered that top officials in the Palestinian Authority were involved in the smuggling, with the Israelis pointing the finger towards Yasser Arafat as also being involved.\nPalestinians launched a spate of suicide bombings and attacks against Israel, aimed mostly at civilians. On 3 March, a Palestinian sniper killed 10 Israeli soldiers and settlers and wounded 4 at a checkpoint near Ofra, using an M1 Carbine. He was later arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. The rate of the attacks increased, and was at its highest in March 2002.\nIn addition to numerous shooting and grenade attacks, the month saw 15 suicide bombings carried out in Israel \u2014 an average of one bombing every two days. The high rate of attacks caused widespread fear throughout Israel and serious disruption of daily life throughout the country. March 2002 became known in Israel as \"Black March\". On 12 March United Nations Security Council Resolution 1397 was passed, which reaffirmed a Two-state solution and laid the groundwork for a Road map for peace.\nOn 27 March, the wave of violence culminated with a suicide bombing during a Passover celebration at the Park Hotel in Netanya in which 30 people were killed. The attack became known as the Passover massacre. In total, around 130 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in Palestinian attacks during March 2002. On 28 March, Arab leaders, whose constituencies were exposed to detailed television coverage of the violence in the conflict, set out a comprehensive Arab Peace Initiative that was endorsed by Arafat, but virtually ignored by Israel.\nOn 29 March, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield, which lasted until 3 May. The IDF made sweeping incursions throughout the West Bank, and into numerous Palestinian cities. Arafat was put under siege in his Ramallah compound. The UN estimated that 497 Palestinians were killed and 1,447 wounded by the Israeli incursion from 1 March to 7 May. A UN report cleared Israel of allegations of massacre, but criticized it for using excessive force on the civilian population. Israeli forces also arrested 4,258 Palestinians during the operation. Israeli casualties during the operation totaled 30 dead and 127 wounded. The operation culminated with the recapturing of Palestinian Authority controlled areas.\nBattle of Jenin.\nBetween 2 and 11 April, a siege and fierce fighting took place in the Palestinian refugee camp of the city of Jenin. The camp was targeted during Operation Defensive Shield after Israel determined that it had \"served as a launch site for numerous terrorist attacks against both Israeli civilians and Israeli towns and villages in the area.\" The Jenin battle became a flashpoint for both sides, and saw fierce urban combat as Israeli infantry supported by armor and attack helicopters fought to clear the camp of Palestinian militants. The battle was eventually won by the IDF, after it employed a dozen Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozers to clear Palestinian booby traps, detonate explosive charges, and raze buildings and gun-posts; the bulldozers proved impervious to attacks by Palestinian militants.\nDuring Israeli military operations in the camp, Palestinian sources alleged that a massacre of hundreds of people had taken place. A senior Palestinian Authority official said in mid-April that some 500 had been killed. During the fighting in Jenin, Israeli officials had also initially estimated hundreds of Palestinian deaths, but later said they expected the Palestinian toll to reach \"45 to 55.\" In the ensuing controversy, Israel blocked the United Nations from conducting the first-hand inquiry unanimously sought by the Security Council, but the UN nonetheless felt able to dismiss claims of a massacre in its report, which said there had been approximately 52 deaths, criticising both sides for placing Palestinian civilians at risk. Based on their own investigations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch charged that some IDF personnel in Jenin had committed war crimes but also confirmed that no massacre had been committed by the IDF. Both human rights organizations called for official inquiries; the IDF disputed the charges.\nAfter the battle, most sources, including the IDF and Palestinian Authority, placed the Palestinian death toll at 52\u201356; Human Rights Watch documented 52 Palestinian deaths and claimed that it included at least 27 militants and 22 civilians, and an additional 3 Palestinians whose status as militants or civilians could not be ascertained, while the IDF said that 48 militants and 5 civilians had been killed. According to Human Rights Watch, 140 buildings had been destroyed. The IDF reported that 23 Israeli soldiers had been killed and 75 wounded during the battle.\nSiege in Bethlehem.\nFrom 2 April to 10 May, a stand-off developed at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. IDF soldiers surrounded the church while Palestinian civilians, militants, and priests were inside. During the siege, IDF snipers killed 8 militants inside the church and wounded more than 40 people. The stand-off was resolved by the deportation to Europe of 13 Palestinian militants whom the IDF had identified as terrorists, and the IDF ended its 38-day stand-off with the militants inside the church.\n2003.\nFollowing an Israeli intelligence report stating that Yasir Arafat had paid $20,000 to al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, the United States demanded democratic reforms in the Palestinian Authority, as well the appointment of a prime minister independent of Arafat. On 13 March 2003, following U.S. pressure, Arafat appointed Mahmoud Abbas as Palestinian prime minister.\nFollowing the appointment of Abbas, the U.S. administration promoted the Road map for peace\u2014the Quartet's plan to end the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict by disbanding militant organizations, halting settlement activity and establishing a democratic and peaceful Palestinian state. The first phase of the plan demanded that the Palestinian Authority suppress guerrilla and terrorist attacks and confiscate illegal weapons. Unable or unwilling to confront militant organizations and risk civil war, Abbas tried to reach a temporary cease-fire agreement with the militant factions and asked them to halt attacks on Israeli civilians.\nOn 20 May, Israeli naval commandos intercepted another vessel, the \"Abu Hassan\", on course to the Gaza Strip from Lebanon. It was loaded with rockets, weapons, and ammunition. Eight crew members on board were arrested including a senior Hezbollah member.\nOn 29 June 2003, a temporary armistice was unilaterally declared by Fatah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which declared a ceasefire and halt to all attacks against Israel for a period of three months. Violence decreased somewhat in the following month, but suicide bombings against Israeli civilians continued as well as Israeli operations against militants.\nFour Palestinians, three of them militants, were killed in gun battles during an IDF raid of Askar near Nablus involving tanks and armoured personnel carriers (APCs); an Israeli soldier was killed by one of the militants. Nearby Palestinians claimed a squad of Israeli police disguised as Palestinian labourers opened fire on Abbedullah Qawasameh as he left a Hebron mosque. YAMAM, the Israeli counter-terrorism police unit that performed the operation, said Qawasemah opened fire on them as they attempted to arrest him.\nOn 19 August, Hamas coordinated a suicide attack on a crowded bus in Jerusalem killing 23 Israeli civilians, including 7 children. Hamas claimed it was a retaliation for the killing of five Palestinians (including Hamas leader Abbedullah Qawasameh) earlier in the week. U.S. and Israeli media outlets frequently referred to the bus bombing as shattering the quiet and bringing an end to the ceasefire.\nFollowing the Hamas bus attack, Israeli Defence Forces were ordered to kill or capture all Hamas leaders in Hebron and the Gaza Strip. The plotters of the bus suicide bombing were all captured or killed and Hamas leadership in Hebron was badly damaged by the IDF. Strict curfews were enforced in Nablus, Jenin, and Tulkarem; the Nablus lockdown lasted for over 100 days. In Nazlet 'Issa, over 60 shops were destroyed by Israeli civil administration bulldozers. The Israeli civil administration explained that the shops were demolished because they were built without a permit. Palestinians consider Israeli military curfews and property destruction to constitute collective punishment against innocent Palestinians.\nUnable to rule effectively under Arafat, Abbas resigned in September 2003. Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) was appointed to replace him. The Israeli government gave up hope for negotiated settlement to the conflict and pursued a unilateral policy of physically separating Israel from Palestinian communities by beginning construction on the Israeli West Bank barrier. Israel claims the barrier is necessary to prevent Palestinian attackers from entering Israeli cities. Palestinians claim the barrier separates Palestinian communities from each other and that the construction plan is a de facto annexation of Palestinian territory.\nFollowing a 4 October suicide bombing in Maxim restaurant, Haifa, which claimed the lives of 21 Israelis, Israel claimed that Syria and Iran sponsored the Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, and were responsible for the terrorist attack. The day after the Maxim massacre, IAF warplanes bombed an alleged former Palestinian training base at Ain Saheb, Syria, which had been mostly abandoned since the 1980s. Munitions being stored on the site were destroyed, and a civilian guard was injured.\n2004.\nIn response to repeated shelling of Israeli communities with Qassam rockets and mortar shells from Gaza, the IDF operated mainly in Rafah \u2013 to search and destroy smuggling tunnels used by militants to obtain weapons, ammunition, fugitives, cigarettes, car parts, electrical goods, foreign currency, gold, drugs, and cloth from Egypt. Between September 2000 and May 2004, ninety tunnels connecting Egypt and the Gaza Strip were found and destroyed. Raids in Rafah left many families homeless. Israel's official stance is that their houses were captured by militants and were destroyed during battles with IDF forces. Many of these houses are abandoned due to Israeli incursions and later destroyed. According to Human Rights Watch, over 1,500 houses were destroyed to create a large buffer zone in the city, many \"in the absence of military necessity\", displacing around sixteen thousand people.\nOn 2 February 2004, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced his plan to transfer all the Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip. The Israeli opposition dismissed his announcement as \"media spin\", but the Israeli Labour Party said it would support such a move. Sharon's right-wing coalition partners National Religious Party and National Union rejected the plan and vowed to quit the government if it were implemented. Yossi Beilin, peace advocate and architect of the Oslo Accords and the Geneva Accord, also rejected the proposed withdrawal plan. He claimed that withdrawing from the Gaza Strip without a peace agreement would reward terror.\nFollowing the declaration of the disengagement plan by Ariel Sharon and as a response to suicide attacks on Erez crossing and Ashdod seaport (10 people were killed), the IDF launched a series of armored raids on the Gaza Strip (mainly Rafah and refugee camps around Gaza), killing about 70 Hamas militants. On 22 March 2004, an Israeli helicopter gunship killed Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, along with his two bodyguards and nine bystanders. On 17 April, after several failed attempts by Hamas to commit suicide bombings and a successful one that killed an Israeli policeman, Yassin's successor, Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi, was killed in an almost identical way, along with a bodyguard and his son Mohammed.\nThe fighting in Gaza Strip escalated severely in May 2004 after several failed attempts to attack Israeli checkpoints such as Erez crossing and Karni crossing. On 2 May, Palestinian militants attacked and shot dead a pregnant woman and her four young daughters. Amnesty International classified it as a crime against humanity and said it \"reiterates its call on all Palestinian armed groups to put an immediate end to the deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians, in Israel and in the Occupied Territories\". Additionally, on 11 and 12 May, Palestinian militants destroyed two IDF M-113 APCs, killing 13 soldiers and mutilating their bodies. The IDF launched two raids to recover the bodies, killing 20\u201340 Palestinians and greatly damaging structures in the Zaitoun neighbourhood in Gaza and in south-west Rafah.\nSubsequently, on 18 May the IDF launched Operation Rainbow with a stated aim of striking the militant infrastructure of Rafah, destroying smuggling tunnels, and stopping a shipment of SA-7 missiles and improved anti-tank weapons. A total of 41 Palestinian militants and 12 civilians were killed in the operation, and about 45\u201356 Palestinian structures were demolished. Israeli tanks shelled hundreds of Palestinian protesters approaching their positions, killing 10. The protesters had disregarded Israeli warnings to turn back. This incident led to a worldwide outcry against the operation.\nOn 29 September, after a Qassam rocket hit the Israeli town of Sderot and killed two Israeli children, the IDF launched Operation Days of Penitence in the north of the Gaza Strip. The operation's stated aim was to remove the threat of Qassam rockets from Sderot and kill the Hamas militants launching them. The operation ended on 16 October, after having caused widespread destruction and the deaths of over 100 Palestinians, at least 20 of whom were under the age of sixteen. The IDF killed thirteen-year-old Iman Darweesh Al Hams as she strayed into a closed military area; the commander was accused of allegedly firing his automatic weapon at her dead body deliberately to verify the death. The act was investigated by the IDF, but the commander was cleared of all wrongdoing, and more recently, was fully vindicated when a Jerusalem district court found the claim to be libellous, ruled that NIS 300,000 be paid by the journalist and TV company responsible for the report, an additional NIS 80,000 to be paid in legal fees and required the journalist and television company to air a correction. According to Palestinian medics, Israeli forces killed at least 62 militants and 42 other Palestinians believed to be civilians. According to a count performed by \"Haaretz\", 87 militants and 42 civilians were killed. Palestinian refugee camps were heavily damaged by the Israeli assault. The IDF announced that at least 12 Qassam launchings had been thwarted and many militants hit during the operation.\nOn 21 October, the Israeli Air Force killed Adnan al-Ghoul, a senior Hamas bomb maker and the inventor of the Qassam rocket.\nOn 11 November, Yasser Arafat died in Paris.\nEscalation in Gaza began amid the visit of Mahmoud Abbas to Syria in order to achieve a Hudna between Palestinian factions and convince Hamas leadership to halt attacks against Israelis. Hamas vowed to continue the armed struggle, sending numerous Qassam rockets into open fields near Nahal Oz, and hitting a kindergarten in Kfar Darom with an anti-tank missile.\nOn 9 December five Palestinians weapon smugglers were killed and two were arrested in the border between Rafah and Egypt. Later that day, Jamal Abu Samhadana and two of his bodyguards were injured by a missile strike. In the first Israeli airstrike against militants in weeks, an unmanned Israeli drone plane launched one missile at Abu Samahdna's car as it travelled between Rafah and Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. It was the fourth attempt on Samhadana's life by Israel. Samhadana is one of two leaders of the Popular Resistance Committees and one of the main forces behind the smuggling tunnels. Samhadana is believed to be responsible for the blast against an American diplomatic convoy in Gaza that killed three Americans.\nOn 10 December, in response to Hamas firing mortar rounds into the Neveh Dekalim settlement in the Gaza Strip and wounding four Israelis (including an 8-year-old boy), Israeli soldiers fired at the Khan Younis refugee camp (the origin of the mortars) killing a seven-year-old girl. An IDF source confirmed troops opened fire at Khan Younis, but said they aimed at Hamas mortar crews.\nThe largest attack since the death of Yasser Arafat claimed the lives of five Israeli soldiers on 12 December, wounding ten others. Approximately 1.5 tons of explosives were detonated in a tunnel under an Israeli military-controlled border crossing on the Egyptian border with Gaza near Rafah, collapsing several structures and damaging others. The explosion destroyed part of the outpost and killed three soldiers. Two Palestinian militants then penetrated the outpost and killed two other Israeli soldiers with gunfire. It is believed that Hamas and a new Fatah faction, the \"Fatah Hawks\", conducted the highly organised and coordinated attack. A spokesman, \"Abu Majad\", claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of the Fatah Hawks claiming it was in retaliation for \"the assassination\" of Yasser Arafat, charging he was poisoned by Israel.\n2005.\nPalestinian presidential elections were held on 9 January, and Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) was elected as the president of the PA. His platform was of a peaceful negotiation with Israel and non-violence to achieve Palestinian objectives. Although Abbas called on militants to halt attacks against Israel, he promised them protection from Israeli incursions and did not advocate disarmament by force.\nViolence continued in the Gaza Strip, and Ariel Sharon froze all diplomatic and security contacts with the Palestinian National Authority. Spokesman Assaf Shariv declared that \"Israel informed international leaders today that there will be no meetings with Abbas until he makes a real effort to stop the terror.\" The freezing of contacts came less than one week after Mahmoud Abbas was elected, and the day before his inauguration. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, confirming the news, declared \"You cannot hold Mahmoud Abbas accountable when he hasn't even been inaugurated yet.\"\nFollowing international pressure and Israeli threat of wide military operation in the Gaza Strip, Abbas ordered Palestinian police to deploy in the northern Gaza Strip to prevent Qassam rocket and mortar shelling over Israeli settlement. Although attacks on Israelis did not stop completely, they decreased sharply. On 8 February 2005, at the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005, Sharon and Abbas declared a mutual truce between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority. They shook hands at a four-way summit that also included Jordan and Egypt at Sharm al-Sheikh. However, Hamas and Islamic Jihad said the truce is not binding for their members. Israel has not withdrawn its demand to dismantle terrorist infrastructure before moving ahead in the Road map for peace.\nMany warned that truce is fragile, and progress must be done slowly while observing that the truce and quiet are kept. On 9\u201310 February night, a barrage of 25\u201350 Qassam rockets and mortar shells hit Neve Dekalim settlement, and another barrage hit at noon. Hamas said it was in retaliation for an attack in which one Palestinian was killed near an Israeli settlement. As a response to the mortar attack, Abbas ordered the Palestinian security forces to stop such attacks in the future. He also fired senior commanders in the Palestinian security apparatus. On 10 February, Israeli security forces arrested Maharan Omar Shucat Abu Hamis, a Palestinian resident of Nablus, who was about to launch a bus suicide attack in the French Hill in Jerusalem.\nOn 13 February 2005, Abbas entered into talks with the leaders of the Islamic Jihad and the Hamas, for them to rally behind him and respect the truce. Ismail Haniyah, a senior leader of the group Hamas said that \"its position regarding calm will continue unchanged and Israel will bear responsibility for any new violation or aggression.\"\nIn the middle of June, Palestinian factions intensified bombardment over the city of Sderot with improvised Qassam rockets. Palestinian attacks resulted in 2 Palestinians and 1 Chinese civilian killed by a Qassam, and 2 Israelis were killed. The wave of attacks lessened support for the disengagement plan among the Israeli public. Attacks on Israel by the Islamic Jihad and the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades increased in July, and on 12 July, a suicide bombing hit the coastal city of Netanya, killing 5 civilians. On 14 July, Hamas started to shell Israeli settlements inside and outside the Gaza Strip with dozens of Qassam rockets, killing an Israeli woman. On 15 July, Israel resumed its \"targeted killing\" policy, killing 7 Hamas militants and bombing about 4 Hamas facilities. The continuation of shelling rockets over Israeli settlements, and street battles between Hamas militants and Palestinian policemen, threatened to shatter the truce agreed in the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005. The Israeli Defence Force also started to build up armored forces around the Gaza Strip in response to the shelling.\nEnd of the Second Intifada.\nThe ending date of the Second Intifada is disputed, as there was no definite event that brought it to an end. The general view is that it ended in 2005, while some sources include events and statistics extending as late as 2007.\nSchachter addressed the difficulties in deciding when the Second Intifada ended. He reasoned that suicide bombing was the best criterion, being arguably the most important element of the violence involved, and that according to this criterion the intifada ended during 2005.\nTrigger for the uprising.\nThe Second Intifada started on 28 September 2000, after Ariel Sharon, a Likud party candidate for Israeli Prime Minister, made a visit to the Temple Mount, also known as Al-Haram Al-Sharif, an area sacred to both Jews and Muslims, accompanied by over 1,000 security guards. He stated on that day, \"the Temple Mount is in our hands and will remain in our hands. It is the holiest site in Judaism and it is the right of every Jew to visit the Temple Mount.\"\nThis visit was seen by Palestinians as highly provocative; and Palestinian demonstrators, throwing stones at police, were dispersed by the Israeli Army, using tear gas and rubber bullets. A riot broke out among Palestinians at the site, resulting in clashes between Israeli forces and the protesting crowd.\nSome believe the Intifada started the next day, on Friday, 29 September, a day of prayers, when an Israeli police and military presence was introduced and there were major clashes and deaths.\nThe Mitchell Report.\nThe Sharm el-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee (an investigatory committee set up to look into the causes behind the breakdown in the peace process, chaired by George J. Mitchell) published its report in May 2001. In the Mitchell Report, the government of Israel asserted that:\nThe immediate catalyst for the violence was the breakdown of the Camp David negotiations on July 25, 2000, and the \"widespread appreciation in the international community of Palestinian responsibility for the impasse\". In this view, Palestinian violence was planned by the PA leadership, and was aimed at \"provoking and incurring Palestinian casualties as a means of regaining the diplomatic initiative\".\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization, according to the same report, denied that the Intifada was planned, and asserted that \"Camp David represented nothing less than an attempt by Israel to extend the force it exercises on the ground to negotiations.\" The report also stated:\nFrom the perspective of the PLO, Israel responded to the disturbances with excessive and illegal use of deadly force against demonstrators; behavior which, in the PLO's view, reflected Israel's contempt for the lives and safety of Palestinians. For Palestinians, the widely seen images of Muhammad al-Durrah in Gaza on September 30, shot as he huddled behind his father, reinforced that perception.\nThe Mitchell report concluded:\nThe Sharon visit did not cause the \"Al-Aqsa Intifada\". But it was poorly timed and the provocative effect should have been foreseen; indeed it was foreseen by those who urged that the visit be prohibited.\nand also:\nWe have no basis on which to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the PA to initiate a campaign of violence at the first opportunity; or to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the [Government of Israel] to respond with lethal force.\nContributing factors.\nPalestinians have claimed that Sharon's visit was the beginning of the Second Intifada, while others have claimed that Yasser Arafat had pre-planned the uprising.\nSome, like Bill Clinton, say that tensions were high due to failed negotiations at the Camp David Summit in July 2000. They note that there were Israeli casualties as early as 27 September; this is the Israeli \"conventional wisdom\", according to Jeremy Pressman, and the view expressed by the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Most mainstream media outlets have taken the view that the Sharon visit was the spark that triggered the rioting at the start of the Second Intifada. In the first five days of rioting and clashes after the visit, Israeli police and security forces killed 47 Palestinians and wounded 1885, while Palestinians killed 5 Israelis.\nPalestinians view the Second Intifada as part of their ongoing struggle for national liberation and an end to Israeli occupation, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a wave of Palestinian terrorism instigated and pre-planned by then Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.\nSupport for the idea that Arafat planned the uprising comes from Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar, who said in September 2010 that when Arafat realized that the Camp David Summit in July 2000 would not result in the meeting of all of his demands, he ordered Hamas as well as Fatah and the Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, to launch \"military operations\" against Israel. Al-Zahar is corroborated by Mosab Hassan Yousef, son of the Hamas founder and leader, Sheikh Hassan Yousef, who claims that the Second Intifada was a political maneuver premeditated by Arafat. Yousef claims that \"Arafat had grown extraordinarily wealthy as the international symbol of victimhood. He wasn't about to surrender that status and take on the responsibility of actually building a functioning society.\"\nDavid Samuels quoted Mamduh Nofal, former military commander of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who supplied more evidence of pre-28 September military preparations. Nofal recounts that Arafat \"told us, Now we are going to the fight, so we must be ready\". Barak as early as May had drawn up contingency plans to halt any intifada in its tracks by the extensive use of IDF snipers, a tactic that resulted in the high number of casualties among Palestinians during the first days of rioting.\nArafat's widow Suha Arafat reportedly said on Dubai television in December 2012 that her husband had planned the uprising: \"Immediately after the failure of the Camp David [negotiations], I met him in Paris upon his return... Camp David had failed, and he said to me, 'You should remain in Paris.' I asked him why, and he said, 'Because I am going to start an intifada. They want me to betray the Palestinian cause. They want me to give up on our principles, and I will not do so,'\" the research institute [MEMRI] translated Suha as saying.\nIsrael's unilateral pullout from Lebanon in the summer of 2000 was, according to Philip Mattar, interpreted by the Arabs as an Israeli defeat and had a profound influence on tactics adopted in the Al Aqsa Intifada. PLO official Farouk Kaddoumi told reporters: \"We are optimistic. Hezbollah's resistance can be used as an example for other Arabs seeking to regain their rights.\" Many Palestinian officials have gone on record as saying that the intifada had been planned long in advance to put pressure on Israel. It is disputed however whether Arafat himself gave direct orders for the outbreak, though he did not intervene to put a brake on it A personal advisor to Arafat, Manduh Nufal, claimed in early 2001 that the Palestinian Authority had played a crucial role in the outbreak of the Intifada. Israeli's military response demolished a large part of the infrastructure built by the PA during the years following the Oslo Accords in preparation for a Palestinian state. This infrastructure included the legitimate arming of Palestinian forces for the first time: some 90 paramilitary camps had been set up to train Palestinian youths in armed conflict. Some 40,000 armed and trained Palestinians existed in the occupied territories.\nOn 29 September 2001 Marwan Barghouti, the leader of the Fatah Tanzim in an interview to \"Al-Hayat\", described his role in the lead up to the intifada.\nI knew that the end of September was the last period (of time) before the explosion, but when Sharon reached the al-Aqsa Mosque, this was the most appropriate moment for the outbreak of the intifada... The night prior to Sharon's visit, I participated in a panel on a local television station and I seized the opportunity to call on the public to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque in the morning, for it was not possible that Sharon would reach al-Haram al-Sharif just so, and walk away peacefully. I finished and went to al-Aqsa in the morning... We tried to create clashes without success because of the differences of opinion that emerged with others in the al-Aqsa compound at the time... After Sharon left, I remained for two hours in the presence of other people, we discussed the manner of response and how it was possible to react in all the cities (bilad) and not just in Jerusalem. We contacted all (the Palestinian) factions.\nBarghouti also went on record as stating that the example of Hezbollah and Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon was a factor which contributed to the Intifada.\nAccording to Nathan Thrall, from Elliott Abrams's inside accounts of negotiations between 2001 and 2005, it would appear to be an inescapable conclusion that violence played an effective role in shaking Israeli complacency and furthering Palestinian goals: the U.S. endorsed the idea of a Palestinian State, Ariel Sharon became the first Israeli Prime Minister to affirm the same idea, and even spoke of Israel's \"occupation\", and the bloodshed was such that Sharon also decided to withdraw from Gaza, an area he long imagined Israel keeping. However, Zakaria Zubeidi, former leader of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, considers the Intifada to be a total failure that achieved nothing for the Palestinians.\nCasualties.\nThe casualty data for the Second Intifada has been reported by a variety of sources and though there is general agreement regarding the overall number of dead, the statistical picture is blurred by disparities in how different types of casualties are counted and categorized.\nThe sources do not vary widely over the data on Israeli casualties. B'Tselem reports that 1,053 Israelis were killed by Palestinian attacks through 30 April 2008. Israeli journalist Ze'ev Schiff reported similar numbers citing the Shin Bet as his source in an August 2004 \"Haaretz\" article where he noted:\nThe number of Israeli fatalities in the current conflict with the Palestinians exceeded 1,000 last week. Only two of the country's wars \u2013 the War of Independence and the Yom Kippur War \u2013 have claimed more Israeli lives than this intifada, which began on September 29, 2000. In the Six-Day War, 803 Israelis lost their lives, while the War of Attrition claimed 738 Israeli lives along the borders with Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.\nThere is little dispute as to the total number of Palestinians killed by Israelis. B'Tselem reports that through 30 April 2008, there were 4,745 Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces, and 44 Palestinians killed by Israeli civilians. B'Tselem also reports 577 Palestinians killed by Palestinians through 30 April 2008.\nBetween September 2000 and January 2005, 69 percent of Israeli fatalities were male, while over 95 percent of the Palestinian fatalities were male. \"Remember These Children\" reports that as of 1 February 2008, 119 Israeli children, age 17 and under, had been killed by Palestinians. Over the same time period, 982 Palestinian children, age 17 and under, were killed by Israelis.\nCombatant versus non-combatant deaths.\nRegarding the numbers of Israeli civilian versus combatant deaths, B'Tselem reports that through 30 April 2008 there were 719 Israeli civilians killed and 334 Israeli security force personnel killed.\nB'Tselem reports that through 30 April 2008, out of 4,745 Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces, there were 1,671 \"Palestinians who took part in the hostilities and were killed by Israeli security forces\", or 35.2%. According to their statistics, 2,204 of those killed by Israeli security forces \"did not take part in the hostilities\", or 46.4%. There were 870 (18.5%) who B'Tselem defines as \"Palestinians who were killed by Israeli security forces and it is not known if they were taking part in the hostilities\".\nThe B'Tselem casualties breakdown's reliability was questioned and its methodology has been heavily criticized by a variety of institutions and several groups and researchers, most notably Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs's senior researcher, retired IDF lieutenant colonel Jonathan Dahoah-Halevi, who claimed that B'Tselem repeatedly classifies terror operatives and armed combatants as \"uninvolved civilians\", but also criticized the Israeli government for not collecting and publishing casualty data.

Glick, deputy managing editor of \"The Jerusalem Post\" and former advisor to Benjamin Netanyahu, pointed to several instances where, she claimed, B'Tselem had misrepresented Palestinian rioters or terrorists as innocent victims, or where B'Tselem failed to report when an Arab allegedly changed his testimony about an attack by settlers. The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), which said that B'Tselem repeatedly classified Arab combatants and terrorists as civilian casualties.\nThe Israeli International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism (IPICT), on the other hand, in a \"Statistical Report Summary\" for 27 September 2000, through 1 January 2005, indicates that 56% (1,542) of the 2,773 Palestinians killed by Israelis were combatants. According to their data, an additional 406 Palestinians were killed by actions of their own side. 22% (215) of the 988 Israelis killed by Palestinians were combatants. An additional 22 Israelis were killed by actions of their own side.\nIPICT counts \"probable combatants\" in its total of combatants. From their full report in September 2002:\nA 'probable combatant' is someone killed at a location and at a time during which an armed confrontation was going on, who appears most likely \u2013 but not certain \u2013 to have been an active participant in the fighting. For example, in many cases where an incident has resulted in a large number of Palestinian casualties, the only information available is that an individual was killed when Israeli soldiers returned fire in response to shots fired from a particular location. While it is possible that the person killed had not been active in the fighting and just happened to be in the vicinity of people who were, it is reasonable to assume that the number of such coincidental deaths is not particularly high. Where the accounts of an incident appear to support such a coincidence, the individual casualty has been given the benefit of the doubt, and assigned a non-combatant status.\nIn the same 2002 IPICT full report there is a pie chart (Graph 2.9) that lists the IPICT combatant breakdown for Palestinian deaths through September 2002. Here follow the statistics in that pie chart used to come up with the total combatant percentage through September 2002:\nOn 24 August 2004, \"Haaretz\" reporter Ze'ev Schiff published casualty figures based on Shin Bet data. The \"Haaretz\" article reported: \"There is a discrepancy of two or three casualties with the figures tabulated by the Israel Defense Forces.\"\nHere is a summary of the figures presented in the article:\nThe article does not say whether those killed were combatants or not. Here is a quote:\nThe Palestinian security forces \u2013 for example, Force 17, the Palestinian police, General Intelligence, and the counter security apparatus \u2013 have lost 334 of its members during the current conflict, the Shin Bet figures show.\nIn response to IDF statistics about Palestinian casualties in the West Bank, the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem reported that two-thirds of the Palestinians killed in 2004 did not participate in the fighting.\nIn 2009, historian Benny Morris stated in his retrospective book \"One State, Two States\" that about one third of the Palestinian deaths up to 2004 had been civilians.\nPalestinians killed by Palestinians.\nB'Tselem reports that through 30 April 2008, there were 577 Palestinians killed by Palestinians. Of those, 120 were \"Palestinians killed by Palestinians for suspected collaboration with Israel\". B'Tselem maintains a list of deaths of Palestinians killed by Palestinians with details about the circumstances of the deaths. Some of the many causes of death are crossfire, factional fighting, kidnappings, collaboration, etc.\nConcerning the killing of Palestinians by other Palestinians, a January 2003 \"The Humanist\" magazine article reports:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For over a decade the PA has violated Palestinian human rights and civil liberties by routinely killing civilians\u2014including collaborators, demonstrators, journalists, and others\u2014without charge or fair trial. Of the total number of Palestinian civilians killed during this period by both Israeli and Palestinian security forces, 16 percent were the victims of Palestinian security forces.\n... According to Freedom House's annual survey of political rights and civil liberties, \"Freedom in the World 2001\u20132002\", the chaotic nature of the Intifada along with strong Israeli reprisals has resulted in a deterioration of living conditions for Palestinians in Israeli-administered areas. The survey states:\nCivil liberties declined due to: shooting deaths of Palestinian civilians by Palestinian security personnel; the summary trial and executions of alleged collaborators by the Palestinian Authority (PA); extra-judicial killings of suspected collaborators by militias; and the apparent official encouragement of Palestinian youth to confront Israeli soldiers, thus placing them directly in harm's way.\nInternal Palestinian violence has been called an \"'Intra'fada\" during this Intifada and the previous one.\nAftermath.\nOn 25 January 2006, the Palestinians held general elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council. The Islamist group Hamas won with an unexpected majority of 74 seats, compared to 45 seats for Fatah and 13 for other parties and independents. Hamas is officially declared as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union and its gaining control over the Palestinian Authority (such as by forming the government) would jeopardize international funds to the PA, by laws forbidding sponsoring of terrorist group.\nOn 9 June, seven members of the Ghalia family were killed on a Gaza beach. The cause of the explosion remains uncertain. Nevertheless, in response, Hamas declared an end to its commitment to a ceasefire declared in 2005 and announced the resumption of attacks on Israelis. Palestinians blame an Israeli artillery shelling of nearby locations in the northern Gaza Strip for the deaths, while an Israeli military inquiry cleared itself from the charges.\nOn 25 June, a military outpost was attacked by Palestinian militants and a gunbattle followed that left 2 Israeli soldiers and 3 Palestinian militants dead. Corporal Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, was captured and Israel warned of an imminent military response if the soldier was not returned unharmed. In the early hours of 28 June Israeli tanks, APCs and troops entered the Gaza Strip just hours after the air force had taken out two main bridges and the only powerstation in the strip, effectively shutting down electricity and water. Operation Summer Rains commenced, the first major phase of the Gaza\u2013Israel conflict, which continues to run independently of the intifada.\nOn 26 November 2006, a truce was implemented between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. A 10 January 2007, Reuters article reports: \"Hamas has largely abided by a November 26 truce which has calmed Israeli\u2013Palestinian violence in Gaza.\"\n2008\u20132009 Gaza\u2013Israel War.\nAn intensification of the Gaza\u2013Israel conflict, the Gaza war, occurred on 27 December 2008 (11:30\u00a0a.m. local time; 09:30\u00a0UTC) when Israel launched a military campaign codenamed \"Operation Cast Lead\" () targeting the members and infrastructure of Hamas in response to the numerous rocket attacks upon Israel from the Gaza Strip. The operation has been termed the \"Gaza massacre\" () by Hamas leaders and much of the media in the Arab World. Studies published in the international medical journal \u2018Global Public Health\u2019 indicate that Israel violated human rights by targeting medical personnel and civilians, preventing emergency medical evacuations and restricting health care to civilians.\nOn Saturday, 17 January 2009, Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire, conditional on elimination of further rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza, and began withdrawing over the next several days. Hamas later announced its own ceasefire, with its own conditions of complete withdrawal and opening of border crossings. A reduced level of mortar fire originating in Gaza continues, though Israel has so far not taken this as a breach of the ceasefire. The frequency of the attacks can be observed in the thumbnailed graph. The data corresponds to the article \"Timeline of the 2008\u20132009 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict\", using mainly \"Haaretz\" news reports from 1 February up to 28 February. The usual IDF responses are airstrikes on weapon smuggling tunnels.\nThe violence continued on both sides throughout 2006. On 27 December the Israeli Human Rights Organization B'Tselem released its annual report on the Intifada. According to which, 660 Palestinians, a figure more than three times the number of Palestinian fatalities in 2005, and 23 Israelis, were killed in 2006. From a 28 December \"Haaretz\" article: \"According to the report, about half of the Palestinians killed, 322, did not take part in the hostilities at the time they were killed. 22 of those killed were targets of assassinations, and 141 were minors.\" 405 of 660 Palestinians were killed in the 2006 Israel-Gaza conflict, which lasted from 28 June till 26 November.\nTactics.\nUnlike the First Intifada, a Palestinian civil uprising mainly focused on mass protests and general strikes, the Second Intifada rapidly turned into an armed conflict between Palestinian militant groups and the Israel Defense Forces. Palestinian tactics focused on Israeli civilians, soldiers, police and other security forces, and methods of attack included suicide bombings, launching rockets and mortars into Israel, kidnapping of both soldiers and civilians, including children, shootings, assassination, stabbings, and lynchings.\nIsraeli tactics included firing live ammunition into crowds of protesters, even when the lives of Israeli Security forces were not at threat, shelling residential areas including the use of up to one-ton bombs over densely populated civilian areas, extrajudicial assassinations, setting up checkpoints, imposing curfews, and collective punishment through the demolition of Palestinian homes and orchards[. The tactics used by Israel throughout the second intifada have been criticized by human rights groups as tantamount to war crimes, and resulted in the deaths of many civilians, including women and children.\nPalestinians.\nMilitant groups involved in violence include Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. The most lethal Palestinian tactic was the suicide bombing (\"see List\"). Conducted as a single or double bombing, suicide bombings were generally conducted against \"soft\" targets, or \"lightly hardened\" targets (such as checkpoints) to try to raise the cost of the war to Israelis and demoralize the Israeli society. Most suicide bombing attacks (although not all) targeted civilians, and were conducted in crowded places in Israeli cities, such as public transport, restaurants, shopping malls and markets.\nOne major development was the use of suicide bombs carried by children. Unlike most suicide bombings, the use of these not only earned condemnation from the United States and from human rights groups such as Amnesty International, but also from many Palestinians and much of the Middle East press. The youngest Palestinian suicide bomber was 16-year-old Issa Bdeir, a high school student from the village of Al Doha, who shocked his friends and family when he blew himself up in a park in Rishon LeZion, killing a teenage boy and an elderly man. The youngest attempted suicide bombing was by a 14-year-old captured by soldiers at the Huwwara checkpoint before managing to do any harm.\nMilitant groups also waged a high-intensity campaign of guerrilla warfare against Israeli military and civilian targets inside Israel and in the Palestinian Territories, utilizing tactics such as ambushes, sniper attacks, and suicide bombings. Military equipment was mostly imported, while some light arms, hand grenades and explosive belts, assault rifles, and Qassam rockets were indigenously produced. They also increased use of remote-controlled landmines against Israeli armor, a tactic that was highly popular among the poorly armed groups. Car bombs were often used against \"lightly hardened\" targets such as Israeli armored jeeps and checkpoints. Also, more than 1,500 Palestinian drive-by shootings killed 75 people in only the first year of the Intifada.\nIn May 2004, Israel Defense minister Shaul Mofaz claimed that United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East's ambulances were used to take the bodies of dead Israeli soldiers in order to prevent the Israel Defense Forces from recovering their dead. Reuters has provided video of healthy armed men entering ambulance with UN markings for transport. UNRWA initially denied that its ambulances carry militants but later reported that the driver was forced to comply with threats from armed men. UNRWA still denies that their ambulances carried body parts of dead Israeli soldiers.\nIn August 2004, Israel said that an advanced explosives-detection device employed by the IDF at the Hawara checkpoint near Nablus discovered a Palestinian ambulance had transported explosive material.\nSome of the Palestinian reaction to Israeli policy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has consisted of non-violent protest, primarily in and near the village of Bil'in. Groups such as the Palestinian Centre for Rapprochement, which works out of Beit Sahour, formally encourage and organize non-violent resistance. Other groups, such as the International Solidarity Movement openly advocate non-violent resistance. Some of these activities are done in cooperation with internationals and Israelis, such as the weekly protests against the Israeli West Bank Barrier carried out in villages like Bi'lin, Biddu and Budrus. This model of resistance has spread to other villages like Beit Sira, Hebron, Saffa, and Ni'lein. During the Israeli re-invasion of Jenin and Nablus, \"A Call for a Non-violent Resistance Strategy in Palestine\" was issued by two Palestinian Christians in May 2002.\nNon-violent tactics have sometimes been met with Israeli military force. For example, Amnesty International notes that \"10-year-old Naji Abu Qamer, 11-year-old Mubarak Salim al-Hashash and 13-year-old Mahmoud Tariq Mansour were among eight unarmed demonstrators killed in the early afternoon of May 19, 2004 in Rafah, in the Gaza Strip, when the Israeli army open fire on a non-violent demonstration with tank shells and a missile launched from a helicopter gunship. Dozens of other unarmed demonstrators were wounded in the attack.\" According to Israeli army and government officials, the tanks shelled a nearby empty building and a helicopter fired a missile in a nearby open space in order to deter the demonstrators from proceeding towards Israeli army positions.\nIsrael.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) countered Palestinian attacks with incursions against militant targets into the West Bank and Gaza Strip, adopting highly effective urban combat tactics. The IDF stressed the safety of their troops, using such heavily armored equipment as the Merkava heavy tank and armored personnel carriers, and carried out airstrikes with various military aircraft including F-16s, drone aircraft and helicopter gunships to strike militant targets. Much of the ground fighting was conducted house-to-house by well-armed and well-trained infantry. Due to its superior training, equipment, and numbers, the IDF had the upper hand during street fighting. Palestinian armed groups suffered heavy losses during combat, but the operations were often criticized internationally due to the civilian casualties often caused. Palestinian metalworking shops and other business facilities suspected by Israel of being used to manufacture weapons were regularly targeted by airstrikes, as well as Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels.Israeli Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozers were routinely employed to detonate booby traps and IEDs, to demolish houses along the border with Egypt that were used for shooting at Israeli troops, to create \"buffer zones\", and to support military operations in the West Bank. Until February 2005, Israel had in place a policy to demolish the family homes of suicide bombers after giving them a notice to evacuate. Due to the considerable number of Palestinians living in single homes, the large quantity of homes destroyed, and collateral damage from home demolitions, it became an increasingly controversial tactic. Families began providing timely information to Israeli forces regarding suicide bombing activities in order to prevent the demolition of their homes, although families doing so risked being executed or otherwise punished for collaboration, either by the Palestinian Authority or extrajudicially by Palestinian militants. The IDF committee studying the issue recommended ending the practice because the policy was not effective enough to justify its costs to Israel's image internationally and the backlash it created among Palestinians.\nWith complete ground and air superiority, mass arrests were regularly conducted by Israeli military and police forces; at any given time, there were about 6,000 Palestinian prisoners detained in Israeli prisons, about half of them held temporarily without a final indictment, in accordance with Israeli law.\nThe tactic of military \"curfew\" \u2013 long-term lockdown of civilian areas \u2013 was used extensively by Israel throughout the Intifada. The longest curfew was in Nablus, which was kept under curfew for over 100 consecutive days, with generally under two hours per day allowed for people to get food or conduct other business.\nSecurity checkpoints and roadblocks were erected inside and between Palestinian cities, subjecting all people and vehicles to security inspection for free passage. Israel defended those checkpoints as being necessary to stop militants and limit the ability to move weapons around. However some Palestinian, Israeli and International observers and organizations have criticized the checkpoints as excessive, humiliating, and a major cause of the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Territories. Transit could be delayed by several hours, depending on the security situation in Israel. Sniper towers were used extensively in the Gaza Strip before the Israeli pullout.\nThe Israeli intelligence services Shin Bet and Mossad penetrated Palestinian militant organizations by relying on moles and sources within armed groups, tapping communication lines, and aerial reconnaissance. The intelligence gathered allowed the IDF, Israel Border Police, and Israel Police, including Yamam and Mistaravim special forces units, to thwart hundreds of planned suicide bombings. The intelligence gathered also helped create a list of Palestinians marked for targeted killings.\nIsrael extensively used targeted killings, the assassinations of Palestinians involved in organizing attacks against Israelis, to eliminate imminent threats and to deter others from following suit, relying primarily on airstrikes and covert operations to carry them out. The strategy of targeted killings had been proposed by Shin Bet, which determined that while it was impossible to stop every single suicide bomber, suicide bombings could be stopped by directly attacking the conspiratorial infrastructure behind them by killing operational commanders, recruiters, couriers, weapons procurers, maintainers of safehouses, and smugglers of money which financed the bombings. Israel was criticized for the use of helicopter gunships in urban assassinations, which often resulted in civilian casualties. Israel criticized what it described as a practice of militant leaders hiding among civilians in densely populated areas, thus turning them into unwitting human shields. Throughout the Intifada, the Palestinian leadership suffered heavy losses through targeted killings.\nThe practice has been widely condemned as extrajudicial executions by the international community, while the Israeli High Court ruled that it is a legitimate measure of self-defense against terrorism. Many criticize the targeted killings for placing civilians at risk, though its supporters believe it reduces civilian casualties on both sides.\nIn response to repeated rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip, the Israeli Navy imposed a maritime blockade on the area. Israel also sealed the border and closed Gaza's airspace in coordination with Egypt, and subjected all humanitarian supplies entering the Strip to security inspection before transferring them through land crossings. Construction materials were declared banned due to their possible use to build bunkers. The blockade has been internationally criticized as a form of \"collective punishment\" against Gaza's civilian population.\nInternational involvement.\nThe international community has long taken an involvement in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, and this involvement has only increased during the al-Aqsa Intifada. Israel currently receives $3\u00a0billion in annual military aid from the United States, excluding loan guarantees. Even though Israel is a developed industrial country, it has remained as the largest annual recipient of US foreign assistance since 1976. It is also the only recipient of US economic aid that does not have to account for how it is spent. The Palestinian Authority receives $100\u00a0million annually in military aid from the United States and $2\u00a0billion in global financial aid, including \"$526\u00a0million from Arab League, $651 million from the European Union, $300 million from the US and about $238 million from the World Bank\". According to the United Nations, the Palestinian territories are among the leading humanitarian aid recipients.\nAdditionally, private groups have become increasingly involved in the conflict, such as the International Solidarity Movement on the side of the Palestinians, and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on the side of the Israelis.\nIn the 2001 and 2002 Arab League Summits, the Arab states pledged support for the Second Intifada just as they had pledged support for the First Intifada in two consecutive summits in the late 1980s.\nImpact on the Oslo Accords.\nSince the start of the Second Intifada and its emphasis on suicide bombers deliberately targeting civilians riding public transportation (buses), the Oslo Accords began to be viewed with increasing disfavor by the Israeli public. In May 2000, seven years after the Oslo Accords and five months before the start of the Second Intifada, a survey by the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research at the Tel Aviv University found that 39% of all Israelis support the Accords and that 32% believe that the Accords will result in peace in the next few years. In contrast, a survey in May 2004 found that 26% of all Israelis support the Accords and 18% believe that the Accords will result in peace in the next few years; decreases of 13% and 16% respectively. Furthermore, a later survey found that 80% of all Israelis believe the Israel Defense Forces have succeeded in dealing with the Second Intifada militarily.\nEconomic effects.\nIsrael.\nThe Israeli commerce experienced a significant negative effect, particularly due to a sharp drop in tourism. A representative of Israel's Chamber of Commerce estimated the cumulative economic damage caused by the crisis at 150 to 200\u00a0billion shekels (US$35\u201345\u00a0billion) \u2013 against an annual GDP of $122\u00a0billion in 2002. The Israeli economy recovered after 2005 with the sharply decrease in suicide bombings, following IDF's and Shin-Bet's efforts.\nPalestinian Authority.\nThe Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO) estimated the damage to the Palestinian economy at over $1.1\u00a0billion in the first quarter of 2002, compared to an annual GDP of $4.5\u00a0billion.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDirectly connected to the Second Intifada and its aftermath\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournal articles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nArticles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "71734", "revid": "6525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71734", "title": "Polygraph", "text": "Pseudoscientific device that attempts to infer lying\nA polygraph, often incorrectly referred to as a lie detector test, is a pseudoscientific device or procedure that measures and records several physiological indicators such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while a person is asked and answers a series of questions. The belief underpinning the use of the polygraph is that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers; however, there are no specific physiological reactions associated with lying, making it difficult to identify factors that separate those who are lying from those who are telling the truth.\nIn some countries, polygraphs are used as an interrogation tool with criminal suspects or candidates for sensitive public or private sector employment. Some United States law enforcement and federal government agencies, as well as many police departments, use polygraph examinations to interrogate suspects and screen new employees. Within the US federal government, a polygraph examination is also referred to as a psychophysiological detection of deception examination.\nAssessments of polygraphy by scientific and government bodies generally suggest that polygraphs are highly inaccurate, may easily be defeated by countermeasures, and are an imperfect or invalid means of assessing truthfulness. A comprehensive 2003 review by the National Academy of Sciences of existing research concluded that there was \"little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy\", while the American Psychological Association has stated that \"most psychologists agree that there is little evidence that polygraph tests can accurately detect lies.\" For this reason, the use of polygraphs to detect lies is considered a form of either pseudoscience or junk science.\nTesting procedure.\nThe examiner typically begins polygraph test sessions with a pre-test interview to gain some preliminary information which will later be used to develop diagnostic questions. Then the tester will explain how the polygraph is supposed to work, emphasizing that it can detect lies and that it is important to answer truthfully. Then a \"stim test\" is often conducted: the subject is asked to deliberately lie and then the tester reports that he was able to detect this lie. Guilty subjects are likely to become more anxious when they are reminded of the test's validity. However, there are risks of innocent subjects being equally or more anxious than the guilty. Then the actual test starts. Some of the questions asked are \"irrelevant\" (\"Is your name Fred?\"), others are \"diagnostic\" questions, and the remainder are the \"relevant questions\" that the tester is really interested in. The different types of questions alternate. The test is passed if the physiological responses to the diagnostic questions are larger than those during the relevant questions.\nCriticisms have been given regarding the validity of the administration of the Control Question Technique. The CQT may be vulnerable to being conducted in an interrogation-like fashion. This kind of interrogation style would elicit a nervous response from innocent and guilty suspects alike. There are several other ways of administering the questions.\nAn alternative is the Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT), or the Concealed Information Test, which is used in Japan. The administration of this test is given to prevent potential errors that may arise from the questioning style. The test is usually conducted by a tester with no knowledge of the crime or circumstances in question. The administrator tests the participant on their knowledge of the crime that would not be known to an innocent person. For example: \"Was the crime committed with a .45 or a 9 mm?\" The questions are in multiple choice and the participant is rated on how they react to the correct answer. If they react strongly to the guilty information, then proponents of the test believe that it is likely that they know facts relevant to the case. This administration is considered more valid by supporters of the test because it contains many safeguards to avoid the risk of the administrator influencing the results.\nEffectiveness.\nAssessments of polygraphy by scientific and government bodies generally suggest that polygraphs are inaccurate, may be defeated by countermeasures, and are an imperfect or invalid means of assessing truthfulness. Despite claims that polygraph tests are between 80% and 90% accurate by advocates, the National Research Council has found no evidence of effectiveness. In particular, studies have indicated that the relevant\u2013irrelevant questioning technique is not ideal, as many innocent subjects exert a heightened physiological reaction to the crime-relevant questions. The American Psychological Association states \"Most psychologists agree that there is little evidence that polygraph tests can accurately detect lies.\"\nIn 2002, a review by the National Research Council found that, in populations \"untrained in countermeasures, specific-incident polygraph tests can discriminate lying from truth telling at rates well above chance, though well below perfection\". The review also warns against generalization from these findings to justify the use of polygraphs\u2014\"polygraph accuracy for screening purposes is almost certainly lower than what can be achieved by specific-incident polygraph tests in the field\"\u2014and notes some examinees may be able to take countermeasures to produce deceptive results.\nIn the 1998 US Supreme Court case \"United States v. Scheffer\", the majority stated that \"There is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable [...] Unlike other expert witnesses who testify about factual matters outside the jurors' knowledge, such as the analysis of fingerprints, ballistics, or DNA found at a crime scene, a polygraph expert can supply the jury only with another opinion.\" The Supreme Court summarized their findings by stating that the use of polygraph was \"little better than could be obtained by the toss of a coin.\" In 2005, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals stated that \"polygraphy did not enjoy general acceptance from the scientific community\". In 2001, William Iacono, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Minnesota, concluded:\nAlthough the CQT [Control Question Test] may be useful as an investigative aid and tool to induce confessions, it does not pass muster as a scientifically credible test. CQT theory is based on naive, implausible assumptions indicating (a) that it is biased against innocent individuals and (b) that it can be beaten simply by artificially augmenting responses to control questions. Although it is not possible to adequately assess the error rate of the CQT, both of these conclusions are supported by published research findings in the best social science journals (Honts et al., 1994; Horvath, 1977; Kleinmuntz &amp; Szucko, 1984; Patrick &amp; Iacono, 1991). Although defense attorneys often attempt to have the results of friendly CQTs admitted as evidence in court, there is no evidence supporting their validity and ample reason to doubt it. Members of scientific organizations who have the requisite background to evaluate the CQT are overwhelmingly skeptical of the claims made by polygraph proponents.\nPolygraphs measure arousal, which can be affected by anxiety, anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), nervousness, fear, confusion, hypoglycemia, psychosis, depression, substance-induced states (nicotine, stimulants), substance-withdrawal state (alcohol withdrawal) or other emotions; polygraphs do not measure \"lies\". A polygraph cannot differentiate anxiety caused by dishonesty and anxiety caused by something else.\nSince the polygraph does not measure lying, the Silent Talker Lie Detector inventors expected that adding a camera to film microexpressions would improve the accuracy of the evaluators. This did not happen in practice according to an article in the Intercept.\nUS Congress Office of Technology Assessment.\nIn 1983, the US Congress Office of Technology Assessment published a review of the technology and found that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;there is at present only limited scientific evidence for establishing the validity of polygraph testing. Even where the evidence seems to indicate that polygraph testing detects deceptive subjects better than chance, significant error rates are possible, and examiner and examinee differences and the use of countermeasures may further affect validity.\nNational Academy of Sciences.\nIn 2003, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) issued a report entitled \"The Polygraph and Lie Detection\". The NAS found that \"overall, the evidence is scanty and scientifically weak\", concluding that 57 of the approximately 80 research studies that the American Polygraph Association relied on to reach their conclusions were significantly flawed. These studies did show that specific-incident polygraph testing, in a person untrained in counter-measures, could discern the truth at \"a level greater than chance, yet short of perfection\". However, due to several flaws, the levels of accuracy shown in these studies \"are almost certainly higher than actual polygraph accuracy of specific-incident testing in the field\". By adding a camera, the Silent Talker Lie Detector attempted to give more data to the evaluator by providing information about microexpressions. However adding the Silent Talker camera did not improve lie detection and was very expensive and cumbersome to include according to an article in the Intercept.\nWhen polygraphs are used as a screening tool (in national security matters and for law enforcement agencies for example) the level of accuracy drops to such a level that \"Its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies.\" The NAS concluded that the polygraph \"may have some utility but that there is \"little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy\".\nThe NAS conclusions paralleled those of the earlier United States Congress Office of Technology Assessment report \"Scientific Validity of Polygraph Testing: A Research Review and Evaluation\". Similarly, a report to Congress by the Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy concluded that \"The few Government-sponsored scientific research reports on polygraph validity (as opposed to its utility), especially those focusing on the screening of applicants for employment, indicate that the polygraph is neither scientifically valid nor especially effective beyond its ability to generate admissions\".\nDespite the NAS finding of a \"high rate of false positives,\" failures to expose individuals such as Aldrich Ames and Larry Wu-Tai Chin, and other inabilities to show a scientific justification for the use of the polygraph, it continues to be employed.\nCountermeasures.\nSeveral proposed countermeasures designed to pass polygraph tests have been described. There are two major types of countermeasures: \"general state\" (intending to alter the physiological or psychological state of the subject during the test), and \"specific point\" (intending to alter the physiological or psychological state of the subject at specific periods during the examination, either to increase or decrease responses during critical examination periods).\nUse.\nLaw enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies in the United States are by far the biggest users of polygraph technology. In the United States alone most federal law enforcement agencies either employ their own polygraph examiners or use the services of examiners employed in other agencies. In 1978 Richard Helms, the eighth Director of Central Intelligence, stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We discovered there were some Eastern Europeans who could defeat the polygraph at any time. Americans are not very good at it, because we are raised to tell the truth and when we lie it is easy to tell we are lying. But we find a lot of Europeans and Asiatics can handle that polygraph without a blip, and you know they are lying and you have evidence that they are lying.\nSusan McCarthy of \"Salon\" said in 2000 that \"The polygraph is an American phenomenon, with limited use in a few countries, such as Canada, Israel and Japan.\"\nArmenia.\nIn Armenia, government administered polygraphs are legal, at least for use in national security investigations. The National Security Service (NSS), Armenia's primary intelligence service, requires polygraph examinations of all new applicants.\nAustralia.\nPolygraph evidence became inadmissible in New South Wales courts under the Lie Detectors Act 1983. Under the same act, it is also illegal to use polygraphs for the purpose of granting employment, insurance, financial accommodation, and several other purposes for which polygraphs may be used in other jurisdictions.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, the 1987 decision of \"R v B\u00e9land\", the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the use of polygraph results as evidence in court, finding that they were inadmissible. The polygraph is still used as a tool in the investigation of criminal acts and sometimes employed in the screening of employees for government organizations.\nIn the province of Ontario, the \"Employment Standards Act, 2000\" prohibits employers from asking or requiring employees to undergo a polygraph test. Police services are permitted use polygraph tests as part of an investigation if the person consents.\nEurope.\nIn a majority of European jurisdictions, polygraphs are generally considered to be unreliable for gathering evidence, and are usually not used by local law enforcement agencies. Polygraph testing is widely seen in Europe to violate the right to remain silent.\nIn England and Wales a polygraph test can be taken, but the results cannot be used in a court of law to prove a case. However, the Offender Management Act 2007 put in place an option to use polygraph tests to monitor serious sex offenders on parole in England and Wales; these tests became compulsory in 2014 for high risk sexual offenders currently on parole in England and Wales.\nThe Supreme Court of Poland declared on January 29, 2015, that the use of polygraph in interrogation of suspects is forbidden by the Polish Code of Criminal Procedure. Its use might be allowed though if the suspect has been already accused of a crime and if the interrogated person consents of the use of a polygraph. Even then, the use of polygraph can never be used as a substitute of actual evidence.\nAs of 2017, the justice ministry and Supreme Court of both of the Netherlands and Germany had rejected use of polygraphs.\nAccording to the 2017 book \"Psychology and Law: Bridging the Gap\" by psychologists David Canter and Rita \u017dukauskien\u0117 Belgium was the European country with the most prevalent use of polygraph testing by police, with about 300 polygraphs carried out each year in the course of police investigations. The results are not considered viable evidence in bench trials, but have been used in jury trials.\nIn Lithuania, \"polygraphs have been in use since 1992\", with law enforcement utilizing the Event Knowledge Test (a \"modification\" of the Concealed Information Test) in criminal investigations.\nIndia.\nIn 2008, an Indian court adopted the Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling test as evidence to convict a woman who was accused of murdering her fianc\u00e9. It was the first time that the result of polygraph was used as evidence in court.\nOn May 5, 2010, The Supreme Court of India declared use of narcoanalysis, brain mapping and polygraph tests on suspects as illegal and against the constitution if consent is not obtained and forced. Article 20(3) of the Indian Constitution states: \"No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.\" Polygraph tests are still legal if the defendant requests one.\nIsrael.\nThe Supreme Court of Israel, in Civil Appeal 551/89 (\"Menora Insurance v. Jacob Sdovnik\"), ruled that the polygraph has not been recognized as a reliable device. In other decisions, polygraph results were ruled inadmissible in criminal trials. Polygraph results are only admissible in civil trials if the person being tested agrees to it in advance.\nPhilippines.\nThe results of polygraph tests are inadmissible in court in the Philippines. The National Bureau of Investigation, however, uses polygraphs in aid of investigation.\nUnited States.\nIn 2018, \"Wired\" magazine reported that an estimated 2.5 million polygraph tests were given each year in the United States, with the majority administered to paramedics, police officers, firefighters, and state troopers. The average cost to administer the test is more than $700 and is part of a $2 billion industry.\nIn 2007[ [update]], polygraph testimony was admitted by stipulation in 19 states, and was subject to the discretion of the trial judge in federal court. The use of polygraph in court testimony remains controversial, although it is used extensively in post-conviction supervision, particularly of sex offenders. In \"Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\" (1993), the old Frye standard was lifted and all forensic evidence, including polygraph, had to meet the new Daubert standard in which \"underlying reasoning or methodology is scientifically valid and properly can be applied to the facts at issue.\" While polygraph tests are commonly used in police investigations in the US, no defendant or witness can be forced to undergo the test unless they are under the supervision of the courts. In \"United States v. Scheffer\" (1998), the US Supreme Court left it up to individual jurisdictions whether polygraph results could be admitted as evidence in court cases. Nevertheless, it is used extensively by prosecutors, defense attorneys, and law enforcement agencies. In the states of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, Delaware and Iowa it is illegal for any employer to order a polygraph either as conditions to gain employment, or if an employee has been suspected of wrongdoing. The Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (EPPA) generally prevents employers from using lie detector tests, either for pre-employment screening or during the course of employment, with certain exemptions. As of 2013, about 70,000 job applicants are polygraphed by the federal government on an annual basis. In the United States, the State of New Mexico admits polygraph testing in front of juries under certain circumstances.\nIn 2010 the NSA produced a video explaining its polygraph process. The video, ten minutes long, is titled \"The Truth About the Polygraph\" and was posted to the website of the Defense Security Service. Jeff Stein of \"The Washington Post\" said that the video portrays \"various applicants, or actors playing them\u2014it\u2019s not clear\u2014describing everything bad they had heard about the test, the implication being that none of it is true.\" AntiPolygraph.org argues that the NSA-produced video omits some information about the polygraph process; it produced a video responding to the NSA video. George Maschke, the founder of the website, accused the NSA polygraph video of being \"Orwellian\".\nThe polygraph was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson, a medical student at the University of California, Berkeley and a police officer of the Berkeley Police Department in Berkeley, California. The polygraph was on the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" 2003 list of greatest inventions, described as inventions that \"have had profound effects on human life for better or worse.\" In 2013, the US federal government had begun indicting individuals who stated that they were teaching methods on how to defeat a polygraph test. During one of those investigations, upwards of 30 federal agencies were involved in investigations of almost 5000 people who had various degrees of contact with those being prosecuted or who had purchased books or DVDs on the topic of beating polygraph tests.\nSecurity clearances.\nIn 1995, Harold James Nicholson, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee later convicted of spying for Russia, had undergone his periodic five-year reinvestigation, in which he showed a strong probability of deception on questions regarding relationships with a foreign intelligence unit. This polygraph test later led to an investigation which resulted in his eventual arrest and conviction. In most cases, however, polygraphs are more of a tool to \"scare straight\" those who would consider espionage. Jonathan Pollard was advised by his Israeli handlers that he was to resign his job from American intelligence if he was ever told he was subject to a polygraph test. Likewise, John Anthony Walker was advised by his handlers not to engage in espionage until he had been promoted to the highest position for which a polygraph test was not required, to refuse promotion to higher positions for which polygraph tests were required, and to retire when promotion was mandated.\nIn 1983, CIA employee Edward Lee Howard was dismissed when, during a polygraph screening, he truthfully answered a series of questions admitting to minor crimes such as petty theft and drug abuse. In retaliation for his perceived unjust punishment for minor offenses, he later sold his knowledge of CIA operations to the Soviet Union.\nPolygraph tests may not deter espionage. From 1945 to the present, at least six Americans have committed espionage while successfully passing polygraph tests. Notable cases of two men who created a false negative result with the polygraphs were Larry Wu-Tai Chin, who spied for China, and Aldrich Ames, who was given two polygraph examinations while with the CIA, the first in 1986 and the second in 1991, while spying for the Soviet Union/Russia. The CIA reported that he passed both examinations after experiencing initial indications of deception. According to a Senate investigation, an FBI review of the first examination concluded that the indications of deception were never resolved.\nAna Belen Montes, a Cuban spy, passed a counterintelligence scope polygraph test administered by the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in 1994.\nDespite these errors, in August 2008, the DIA announced that it would subject each of its 5,700 prospective and current employees to polygraph testing at least once annually. This expansion of polygraph screening at DIA occurred while DIA polygraph managers ignored documented technical problems discovered in the Lafayette computerized polygraph system. The DIA uses computerized Lafayette polygraph systems for routine counterintelligence testing. The impact of the technical flaws within the Lafayette system on the analysis of recorded physiology and on the final polygraph test evaluation is currently unknown.\nIn 2012, a McClatchy investigation found that the National Reconnaissance Office was possibly breaching ethical and legal boundaries by encouraging its polygraph examiners to extract personal and private information from US Department of Defense personnel during polygraph tests that purported to be limited in scope to counterintelligence matters. Allegations of abusive polygraph practices were brought forward by former NRO polygraph examiners.\nAlternative tests.\nMost polygraph researchers have focused more on the exam's predictive value on a subject's guilt. However, there have been no empirical theories established to explain how a polygraph measures deception. A 2010 study indicated that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may benefit in explaining the psychological correlations of polygraph exams. It could also explain which parts of the brain are active when subjects use artificial memories. Most brain activity occurs in both sides of the prefrontal cortex, which is linked to response inhibition. This indicates that deception may involve inhibition of truthful responses. Some researchers believe that reaction time (RT) based tests may replace polygraphs in concealed information detection. RT based tests differ from polygraphs in stimulus presentation duration and can be conducted without physiological recording as subject response time is measured via computer. However, researchers have found limitations to these tests as subjects voluntarily control their reaction time, deception can still occur within the response deadline, and the test itself lacks physiological recording.\nHistory.\nEarlier societies utilized elaborate methods of lie detection which mainly involved torture. For instance, in the Middle Ages, boiling water was used to detect liars, as it was believed honest men would withstand it better than liars. Early devices for lie detection include an 1895 invention of Cesare Lombroso used to measure changes in blood pressure for police cases, a 1904 device by Vittorio Benussi used to measure breathing, the Mackenzie-Lewis Polygraph first developed by James Mackenzie in 1906 and an abandoned project by American William Moulton Marston which used blood pressure to examine German prisoners of war (POWs). Marston said he found a strong positive correlation between systolic blood pressure and lying.\nMarston wrote a second paper on the concept in 1915, when finishing his undergraduate studies. He entered Harvard Law School and graduated in 1918, re-publishing his earlier work in 1917. Marston's main inspiration for the device was his wife, Elizabeth Holloway Marston. \"According to Marston\u2019s son, it was his mother Elizabeth, Marston's wife, who suggested to him that 'When she got mad or excited, her blood pressure seemed to climb'\" (Lamb, 2001). Although Elizabeth is not listed as Marston\u2019s collaborator in his early work, Lamb, Matte (1996), and others refer directly and indirectly to Elizabeth's work on her husband's deception research. She also appears in a picture taken in his polygraph laboratory in the 1920s (reproduced in Marston, 1938).\nDespite his predecessors' contributions, Marston styled himself the \"father of the polygraph\". (Today he is often equally or more noted as the creator of the comic book character Wonder Woman and her Lasso of Truth, which can force people to tell the truth.) Marston remained the device's primary advocate, lobbying for its use in the courts. In 1938 he published a book, \"The Lie Detector Test\", wherein he documented the theory and use of the device. In 1938 he appeared in advertising by the Gillette company claiming that the polygraph showed Gillette razors were better than the competition.\nA device recording both blood pressure and breathing was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson of the University of California and first applied in law enforcement work by the Berkeley Police Department under its nationally renowned police chief August Vollmer. Further work on this device was done by Leonarde Keeler. As Larson's protege, Keeler updated the device by making it portable and added the galvanic skin response to it in 1939. His device was then purchased by the FBI, and served as the prototype of the modern polygraph.\nSeveral devices similar to Keeler's polygraph version included the Berkeley Psychograph, a blood pressure-pulse-respiration recorder developed by C. D. Lee in 1936 and the Darrow Behavior Research Photopolygraph, which was developed and intended solely for behavior research experiments.\nA device which recorded muscular activity accompanying changes in blood pressure was developed in 1945 by John E. Reid, who claimed that greater accuracy could be obtained by making these recordings simultaneously with standard blood pressure-pulse-respiration recordings.\nSociety and culture.\nPortrayals in media.\nLie detection has a long history in mythology and fairy tales; the polygraph has allowed modern fiction to use a device more easily seen as scientific and plausible. Notable instances of polygraph usage include uses in crime and espionage themed television shows and some daytime television talk shows, cartoons and films. Numerous TV shows have been called \"Lie Detector\" or featured the device. The first \"Lie Detector\" TV show aired in the 1950s, created and hosted by Ralph Andrews. In the 1960s Andrews produced a series of specials hosted by Melvin Belli. In the 1970s the show was hosted by Jack Anderson. In early 1983 Columbia Pictures Television put on a syndicated series hosted by F. Lee Bailey. In 1998 TV producer Mark Phillips with his Mark Phillips Philms &amp; Telephision put \"Lie Detector\" back on the air on the FOX Network\u2014on that program Ed Gelb with host Marcia Clark questioned Mark Fuhrman about the allegation that he \"planted the bloody glove\". In 2005 Phillips produced \"Lie Detector\" as a series for PAX/ION; some of the guests included Paula Jones, Reverend Paul Crouch accuser Lonny Ford, Ben Rowling, Jeff Gannon, and Swift Boat Vet Steve Garner.\nIn the UK, shows such as \"The Jeremy Kyle Show\" used polygraph tests extensively. The show was ultimately canceled when a participant committed suicide shortly after being polygraphed. The guest was slated by Kyle on the show for failing the polygraph, but no other evidence has come forward to prove any guilt. Producers later admitted in the inquiry that they were unsure on how accurate the tests performed were.\nIn the Fox game show \"The Moment of Truth\", contestants are privately asked personal questions a few days before the show while hooked to a polygraph. On the show they asked the same questions in front of a studio audience and members of their family. In order to advance in the game they must give a \"truthful\" answer as determined by the previous polygraph exam.\nDaytime talk shows, such as Maury Povich and Steve Wilkos, have used polygraphs to supposedly detect deception in interview subjects on their programs that pertain to cheating, child abuse, and theft.\nIn episode 93 of the US science show \"MythBusters\", the hosts attempted to fool the polygraph by using pain when answering truthfully, in order to test the notion that polygraphs interpret truthful and non-truthful answers as the same. They also attempted to fool the polygraph by thinking pleasant thoughts when lying and thinking stressful thoughts when telling the truth, to try to confuse the machine. However, neither technique was successful for a number of reasons. Michael Martin correctly identified each guilty and innocent subject. Martin suggested that when conducted properly, polygraphs are correct 98% of the time, but no scientific evidence has been offered for this.\nThe history of the polygraph is the subject of the documentary film \"The Lie Detector\", which first aired on \"American Experience\" on January 3, 2023.\nHand-held lie detector for US military.\nA hand-held lie detector is being deployed by the US Department of Defense according to a report in 2008 by investigative reporter Bill Dedman of NBC News. The Preliminary Credibility Assessment Screening System, or PCASS, captures less physiological information than a polygraph, and uses an algorithm, not the judgment of a polygraph examiner, to render a decision whether it believes the person is being deceptive or not. The device was first used in Afghanistan by US Army troops. The Department of Defense ordered its use be limited to non-US persons, in overseas locations only.\nNotable cases.\nPolygraphy has been faulted for failing to trap known spies such as double-agent Aldrich Ames, who passed two polygraph tests while spying for the Soviet Union. Ames failed several tests while at the CIA that were never acted on. Other spies who passed the polygraph include Karl Koecher, Ana Montes, and Leandro Aragoncillo. CIA spy Harold James Nicholson failed his polygraph examinations, which aroused suspicions that led to his eventual arrest. Polygraph examination and background checks failed to detect Nada Nadim Prouty, who was not a spy but was convicted for improperly obtaining US citizenship and using it to obtain a restricted position at the FBI.\nThe polygraph also failed to catch Gary Ridgway, the \"Green River Killer\". Another suspect allegedly failed a given lie detector test, whereas Ridgway passed. Ridgway passed a polygraph in 1984; he confessed almost 20 years later when confronted with DNA evidence. Conversely, innocent people have been known to fail polygraph tests. In Wichita, Kansas in 1986, Bill Wegerle was suspected of murdering his wife Vicki Wegerle because he failed two polygraph tests (one administered by the police, the other conducted by an expert that Wegerle had hired), although he was neither arrested nor convicted of her death. In March 2004, evidence surfaced connecting her death to the serial killer known as BTK, and in 2005 DNA evidence from the Wegerle murder confirmed that BTK was Dennis Rader, exonerating Wegerle.\nProlonged polygraph examinations are sometimes used as a tool by which confessions are extracted from a defendant, as in the case of Richard Miller, who was persuaded to confess largely by polygraph results combined with appeals from a religious leader. In the Watts family murders, Christopher Watts failed one such polygraph test and subsequently confessed to murdering his wife. In the 2002 disappearance of seven-year-old Danielle van Dam of San Diego, police suspected neighbor David Westerfield; he became the prime suspect when he allegedly failed a polygraph test.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "71735", "revid": "9755426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71735", "title": "Hugo Steinhaus", "text": "Polish mathematician (1887\u20131972)\nHugo Dyonizy Steinhaus ( , ; 14 January 1887 \u2013 25 February 1972) was a Polish mathematician and educator. Steinhaus obtained his PhD under David Hilbert at G\u00f6ttingen University in 1911 and later became a professor at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lw\u00f3w (now Lviv, Ukraine), where he helped establish what later became known as the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics. He is credited with \"discovering\" mathematician Stefan Banach, with whom he gave a notable contribution to functional analysis through the Banach\u2013Steinhaus theorem. After World War II Steinhaus played an important part in the establishment of the mathematics department at Wroc\u0142aw University and in the revival of Polish mathematics from the destruction of the war.\nAuthor of around 170 scientific articles and books, Steinhaus has left his legacy and contribution in many branches of mathematics, such as functional analysis, geometry, mathematical logic, and trigonometry. Notably he is regarded as one of the early founders of game theory and probability theory, which led to later development of more comprehensive approaches by other scholars.\nEarly life and studies.\nSteinhaus was born on January 14, 1887, in Jas\u0142o, Austria-Hungary to a family with Jewish roots. His father, Bogus\u0142aw, was a local industrialist, owner of a brick factory and a merchant. His mother was Ewelina, n\u00e9e Lipschitz. Hugo's uncle, Ignacy Steinhaus, was a lawyer and an activist in the \"Ko\u0142o Polskie\" (Polish Circle), and a deputy to the Galician Diet, the regional assembly of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.\nHugo finished his studies at the gymnasium in Jas\u0142o in 1905. His family wanted him to become an engineer but he was drawn to abstract mathematics and began to study the works of famous contemporary mathematicians on his own. In the same year he began studying philosophy and mathematics at the University of Lemberg. In 1906 he transferred to G\u00f6ttingen University. At that University he received his Ph.D. in 1911, having written his doctoral dissertation under the supervision of David Hilbert. The title of his thesis was \"Neue Anwendungen des Dirichlet'schen Prinzips\" (\"New applications to Dirichlet's principle\").\nAt the start of World War I Steinhaus returned to Poland and served in J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski's Polish Legion, after which he lived in Krak\u00f3w.\nHe was an atheist.\nAcademic career.\nInterwar Poland.\nDuring the 1916-1917 period and before Poland had regained its full independence, which occurred in 1918, Steinhaus worked in Krak\u00f3w for the Ministry of the Interior in the ephemeral puppet state of Kingdom of Poland.\nIn 1917 he started to work at the University of Lemberg (later \"Jan Kazimierz University\" in Poland) and acquired his habilitation qualification in 1920. In 1921 he became a \"profesor nadzwyczajny\" (associate professor) and in 1925 \"profesor zwyczajny\" (full professor) at the same university. During this time he taught a course on the then cutting edge theory of Lebesgue integration, one of the first such courses offered outside of France.\nWhile in Lw\u00f3w, Steinhaus co-founded the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics and was active in the circle of mathematicians associated with the Scottish cafe, although, according to Stanislaw Ulam, for the circle's gatherings, Steinhaus would have generally preferred a more upscale tea shop down the street.\nWorld War II.\nIn September 1939, after Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union both invaded and occupied Poland, as a fulfillment of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact they had signed earlier, Lw\u00f3w initially came under Soviet occupation. Steinhaus considered escaping to Hungary but ultimately decided to remain in Lw\u00f3w. The Soviets reorganized the university to give it a more Ukrainian character, but they did appoint Stefan Banach (Steinhaus's student) as the dean of the mathematics department, and Steinhaus resumed teaching there. The faculty of the department at the school were also strengthened by several Polish refugees from German-occupied Poland. According to Steinhaus, during the experience of this period, he \"acquired an insurmountable physical disgust in regard to all sorts of Soviet administrators, politicians and commissars.\"[A]\nDuring the interwar period and the time of the Soviet occupation, Steinhaus contributed ten problems to the famous Scottish Book, including the last one, recorded shortly before Lw\u00f3w was captured by the Nazis in 1941, during Operation Barbarossa.\nSteinhaus, because of his Jewish background, spent the Nazi occupation in hiding, first among friends in Lw\u00f3w, then in the small towns of Osiczyna, near Zamo\u015b\u0107, and Berdech\u00f3w, near Krak\u00f3w. The Polish anti-Nazi resistance provided him with false documents of a forest ranger who had died sometime earlier, by the name of Grzegorz Krochmalny. Under this name he taught clandestine classes (higher education was forbidden for Poles under the German occupation). Worried about the possibility of imminent death if captured by Germans, Steinhaus, without access to any scholarly material, reconstructed from memory and recorded all the mathematics he knew, in addition to writing other voluminous memoirs, of which only a little part has been published.\nAlso while in hiding, and cut off from reliable news on the course of the war, Steinhaus devised a statistical means of estimating for himself the German casualties at the front based on sporadic obituaries published in the local press. The method relied on the relative frequency with which the obituaries stated that the soldier who died was someone's son, someone's \"second son\", someone's \"third son\" and so on.\nAccording to his student and biographer, Mark Kac, Steinhaus told him that the happiest day of his life were the twenty-four hours between the time that the Germans had left occupied Poland and the Soviets had not yet arrived (\"They had left, and they had not yet come\").\nAfter World War II.\nIn the last days of World War II Steinhaus, still in hiding, heard a rumor that University of Lw\u00f3w was to be transferred to the city of Breslau (Wroc\u0142aw), which Poland was to acquire as a result of the Potsdam Agreement (Lw\u00f3w became part of Soviet Ukraine). Although initially he had doubts, he turned down offers for faculty positions in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Lublin and made his way to the city where he began teaching at University of Wroc\u0142aw. While there, he revived the idea behind the \"Scottish Book\" from Lw\u00f3w, where prominent and aspiring mathematicians would write down problems of interest along with prizes to be awarded for their solution, by starting the \"New Scottish Book\". It was also most likely Steinhaus preserved the original \"Scottish Book\" from Lw\u00f3w throughout the war and subsequently sent it to Stanis\u0142aw Ulam, who translated it into English.\nWith Steinhaus' help, Wroc\u0142aw University became renowned for mathematics, much as the University of Lw\u00f3w had been.\nLater, in the 1960s, Steinhaus served as a visiting professor at the University of Notre Dame (1961\u201362) and the University of Sussex (1966).\nMathematical contributions.\nSteinhaus authored over 170 works. Unlike his student, Stefan Banach, who tended to specialize narrowly in the field of functional analysis, Steinhaus made contributions to a wide range of mathematical sub-disciplines, including geometry, probability theory, functional analysis, theory of trigonometric and Fourier series as well as mathematical logic. He also wrote in the area of applied mathematics and enthusiastically collaborated with engineers, geologists, economists, physicians, biologists and, in Kac's words, \"even lawyers\".\nProbably his most notable contribution to functional analysis was the 1927 proof of the Banach\u2013Steinhaus theorem, given along with Stefan Banach, which is now one of the fundamental tools in this branch of mathematics.\nHis interest in games led him to propose an early formal definition of a strategy, anticipating John von Neumann's more complete treatment of a few years later. Consequently, he is considered an early founder of modern game theory. As a result of his work on infinite games Steinhaus, together with another of his students, Jan Mycielski, proposed the axiom of determinacy.\nSteinhaus was also an early contributor to, and co-founder of, probability theory, which at the time was in its infancy and not even considered an actual part of mathematics. He provided the first axiomatic measure-theoretic description of coin-tossing, which was to influence the full axiomatization of probability by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov a decade later. Steinhaus was also the first to offer precise definitions of what it means for two events to be \"independent\", as well as for what it means for a random variable to be \"uniformly distributed\".\nWhile in hiding during World War II, Steinhaus worked on the fair cake-cutting problem: how to divide a heterogeneous resource among several people with different preferences such that every person believes he received a proportional share. Steinhaus' work has initiated the modern research of the fair cake-cutting problem.[B]\nSteinhaus was also the first person to conjecture the ham-sandwich theorem, and one of the first to propose the method of \"k\"-means clustering.\nLegacy.\nSteinhaus is said to have \"discovered\" the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach in 1916, after he overheard someone utter the words \"Lebesgue integral\" while in a Krak\u00f3w park (Steinhaus referred to Banach as his \"greatest mathematical discovery\"). Together with Banach and the other participant of the park discussion, Otto Nikodym, Steinhaus started the \"Mathematical Society of Krak\u00f3w\", which later evolved into the Polish Mathematical Society. He was a member of \"PAU\" (the Polish Academy of Learning) and \"PAN\" (the Polish Academy of Sciences), \"PTM\" (the Polish Mathematical Society), the \"Wroc\u0142awskie Towarzystwo Naukowe\" (Wroc\u0142aw Scientific Society) as well as many international scientific societies and science academies.\nSteinhaus also published one of the first articles in \"Fundamenta Mathematicae\", in 1921. He also co-founded \"Studia Mathematica\" along with Stefan Banach (1929), and \"Zastosowania matematyki\" (Applications of Mathematics, 1953), \"Colloquium Mathematicum\", and \"Monografie Matematyczne\" (Mathematical Monographs).\nHe received honorary doctorate degrees from Warsaw University (1958), Wroc\u0142aw Medical Academy (1961), Pozna\u0144 University (1963) and Wroc\u0142aw University (1965).\nSteinhaus had full command of several foreign languages and was known for his aphorisms, to the point that a booklet of his most famous ones in Polish, French and Latin has been published posthumously.\nIn 2002, the Polish Academy of Sciences and Wroc\u0142aw University sponsored \"2002, The Year of Hugo Steinhaus\", to celebrate his contributions to Polish and world science.\nMathematician Mark Kac, Steinhaus's student, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFamily.\nHis daughter Lidya Steinhaus was married to Jan Kott.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was hoped that Dr. Wake's research program would be able to help the Government of Canada identify gay men working in the Public Service or to prevent gay people from obtaining government jobs. The subjects were made to view erotic imagery and \"homosexual words,\" while the device measured the subject's pupil dilation (pupillary response test), and an early form of lie detector also measured their perspiration and pulse, in response to the erotic images and words. The crude apparatus was constructed by the RCMP's Identification Branch.\nThe research program was employed in Canada approximately between 1960 and 1964 as part of a campaign to eliminate all gay men from the civil service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). Thousands of Canadians lost their jobs or resigned and some died by suicide. Although funding for the project was cut off in the late 1960s, the RCMP investigations continued, and the RCMP collected files on well over 9,000 people.\nThe machine used a chair similar to that used by dentists. It had a pulley with a camera going towards the pupils, with a black box located in front of it that displayed pictures. The pictures ranged from the mundane to sexually explicit photos of men and women. It had previously been determined that the pupils would dilate in relation to the amount of interest in the picture, in a technique termed \"the pupillary response test\".\nPeople were first led to believe that the machine's purpose was to rate stress. After knowledge of its real purpose became widespread, few people volunteered for it.\nFaulty test parameters.\nThe functional mechanism of the \"fruit machine\" was pseudo-scientific and its results inaccurate. First, the pupillary response test was based on fatally flawed assumptions: That the chosen visual stimuli would produce a specific involuntary reaction that could be measured scientifically with 1960s technology; that homosexuals and heterosexuals would respond to these stimuli differently with enough frequency and specificity to sort them; and that there were only two types of sexuality. One physiological problem with the method was that the researchers failed to take into account the varying sizes of the pupils and the differing distances between the eyes. Other problems that existed were that the pictures of the subjects' eyes had to be taken from an angle, as the camera would have blocked the subjects' view of the photographs if it were placed directly in front. Also, the amount of light coming from the photographs changed with each slide, causing the subjects' pupils to dilate in a way that was unrelated to their interest in the picture. Finally, the dilation of the pupils was also exceedingly difficult to measure, as the change was often smaller than one millimeter.\nThe idea was based on an unrelated study done by an American university professor, which measured the sizes of the subjects' pupils as they walked through the aisles of grocery stores.\nIn popular culture.\nBrian Drader's 1998 play \"The Fruit Machine\" juxtaposes the fruit machine project with a parallel storyline about contemporary homophobia.\nSarah Fodey's 2018 documentary film \"The Fruit Machine\" profiled the effects of the project on several of the people affected by it.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "71753", "revid": "46992329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71753", "title": "Tuskegee Airmen", "text": "African-American military pilots during World War II\nMilitary unit\nThe Tuskegee Airmen were a group of primarily African-American military pilots (fighter and bomber) and airmen who fought in World War II. They formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group (Medium) of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The name also applies to the navigators, bombardiers, mechanics, instructors, crew chiefs, nurses, cooks, and other support personnel. The Tuskegee Airmen received praise for their excellent combat record earned while protecting American bombers from enemy fighters. The group was awarded three Distinguished Unit Citations.\nAll black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Griel Field, Kennedy Field, Moton Field, Shorter Field, and the Tuskegee Army Air Fields. They were educated at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), located near Tuskegee, Alabama. Of the 922 pilots, five were Haitians from the Haitian Air Force and one pilot was from Trinidad. It also included an airman born in the Dominican Republic and one born in Jamaica.\nThe 99th Pursuit Squadron (later the 99th Fighter Squadron) was the first black flying squadron, and the first to deploy overseas (to North Africa in April 1943, and later to Sicily and other parts of Italy). The 332nd Fighter Group, which originally included the 100th, 301st, and 302nd Fighter Squadrons, was the first black flying group. It deployed to Italy in early 1944. Although the 477th Bombardment Group trained with North American B-25 Mitchell bombers, they never served in combat. In June 1944, the 332nd Fighter Group began flying heavy bomber escort missions, and in July 1944 with the addition of the 99th Fighter Squadron, it had four fighter squadrons.\nThe 99th Fighter Squadron was initially equipped with Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter-bomber aircraft. The 332nd Fighter Group and its 100th, 301st, and 302nd Fighter Squadrons were equipped for initial combat missions with Bell P-39 Airacobras (March 1944), later with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts (June\u2013July 1944), and finally with the aircraft with which they became most commonly associated, the North American P-51 Mustang (July 1944). When the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their P-47s red, the nickname \"Red Tails\" was coined. The red markings that distinguished the Tuskegee Airmen included red bands on the noses of P-51s, as well as a red empennage; the P-51B, C, and D Mustangs flew with similar color schemes, with red propeller spinners, yellow wing bands, and all-red tail surfaces.\nThe Tuskegee Airmen were the first African-American military aviators in the United States Armed Forces. During World War II, black Americans in many U.S. states were still subject to the Jim Crow laws and the American military was racially segregated, as was much of the federal government. The Tuskegee Airmen were subjected to discrimination, both within and outside of the army.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nBackground.\nBefore the Tuskegee Airmen, no African American had been a U.S. military pilot. In 1917, African-American men had tried to become aerial observers but were rejected. African-American Eugene Bullard served in the French air service during World War I because he was not allowed to serve in an American unit. Bullard returned to infantry duty with the French.\nThe racially motivated rejections of World War I African-American recruits sparked more than two decades of advocacy by African Americans who wished to enlist and train as military aviators. The effort was led by such prominent civil rights leaders as Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), labor union leader A.\u00a0Philip Randolph, and Judge William\u00a0H. Hastie. Finally, on 3 April 1939, Appropriations Bill Public Law 18 was passed by Congress containing an amendment by Senator Harry H. Schwartz designating funds for training African-American pilots. The War Department managed to put the money into funds of civilian flight schools that were willing to train black Americans.\nWar Department tradition and policy mandated the segregation of African Americans into separate military units staffed by white officers, as had been done previously with the 9th Cavalry, 10th Cavalry, 24th Infantry Regiment and 25th Infantry regiments.\nWhen the appropriation of funds for aviation training created opportunities for pilot cadets, their numbers diminished the rosters of these older units. In 1941, the War Department and the Army Air Corps, under pressure \u2014 three months before its transformation into the USAAF \u2014 constituted the first all-black flying unit, the 99th Pursuit Squadron.\nBecause of the restrictive nature of selection policies, the situation did not seem promising for African Americans, since in 1940 the U.S. Census Bureau reported there were only 124 African-American pilots in the nation. The exclusionary policies failed dramatically when the Air Corps received an abundance of applications from men who qualified, even under the restrictive requirements. Many of the applicants had already participated in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, unveiled in late December 1938 (CPTP). Tuskegee University had participated since 1939.\nTesting.\nThe U.S. Army Air Corps had established the Psychological Research Unit 1 at Maxwell Army Air Field, Montgomery, Alabama, and other units around the country for aviation cadet training, which included the identification, selection, education, and training of pilots, navigators and bombardiers. Psychologists employed in these research studies and training programs used some of the first standardized tests to quantify IQ, dexterity, and leadership qualities to select and train the best-suited personnel for the roles of bombardier, navigator, and pilot. The Air Corps determined that the existing programs would be used for all units, including all-black units. At Tuskegee, this effort continued with the selection and training of the Tuskegee Airmen. The War Department set up a system to accept only those with a level of flight experience or higher education which ensured that only the ablest and most intelligent African-American applicants were able to join.\nAirman Coleman Young (Second Lieutenant), later the first African-American mayor of Detroit, told journalist Studs Terkel about the process:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They made the standards so high, we actually became an elite group. We were screened and super-screened. We were unquestionably the brightest and most physically fit young blacks in the country. We were super-better because of the irrational laws of Jim Crow. You can't bring that many intelligent young people together and train 'em as fighting men and expect them to supinely roll over when you try to fuck over 'em, right? (Laughs.)\nFirst Lady's flight.\nThe budding flight program at Tuskegee received a publicity boost when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt inspected it on 29 March 1941, and flew with African-American chief civilian instructor C.\u00a0Alfred \"Chief\" Anderson. Anderson, who had been flying since 1929 and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots, took his prestigious passenger on a half-hour flight in a Piper J-3 Cub. After landing, she cheerfully announced: \"Well, you can fly all right.\"\nThe subsequent brouhaha over the First Lady's flight had such an impact it is often mistakenly cited as the start of the CPTP at Tuskegee, even though the program was already five months old. Eleanor Roosevelt used her position as a trustee of the Julius Rosenwald Fund to arrange a loan of $175,000 to help finance the building of Moton Field.\nFormation.\nOn 22 March 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was activated without pilots at Chanute Field in Rantoul, Illinois.\nA cadre of 14 black non-commissioned officers from the 24th and 25th Infantry Regiments were sent to Chanute Field to help in the administration and supervision of the trainees. A white officer, Army Captain Harold R. Maddux, was assigned as the first commander of the 99th Fighter Squadron.\nA group of 271 enlisted men began training in aircraft ground support trades at Chanute Field in March 1941 until they were transferred to bases in Alabama in July 1941. The skills being taught were so technical that setting up segregated classes was deemed impossible. This small number of enlisted men became the core of other black squadrons forming at Tuskegee Fields in Alabama.\nWhile the enlisted men were in training, five black youths were admitted to the Officers Training School (OTS) at Chanute Field as aviation cadets. Specifically, Elmer D. Jones, Dudley Stevenson, and James Johnson of Washington, DC; Nelson Brooks of Illinois, and William R. Thompson of Pittsburgh, PA successfully completed OTS and were commissioned as the first Black Army Air Corps Officers.\nIn June 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was transferred to Tuskegee, Alabama, and remained the only black flying unit in the country, but did not yet have pilots. The famous airmen were actually trained at five airfields surrounding Tuskegee University (formerly Tuskegee Institute)--Griel, Kennedy, Moton, Shorter, and Tuskegee Army Air Fields. The flying unit consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men and was backed by an entire service arm. On 19 July 1941, thirteen individuals made up the first class of aviation cadets (42-C) when they entered preflight training at Tuskegee Institute. After primary training at Moton Field, they were moved to the nearby Tuskegee Army Air Field, about to the west for conversion training onto operational types. Consequently, Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training (basic, advanced, and transition) at a single location. Initial planning called for 500 personnel in residence at a time.\nBy mid-1942, more than six times that many were stationed at Tuskegee, even though only two squadrons were training there.\nTuskegee Army Airfield was similar to already-existing airfields reserved for training white pilots, such as Maxwell Field, only distant. African-American contractor McKissack and McKissack, Inc. was in charge of the contract. The company's 2,000 workmen, the Alabama Works Progress Administration, and the U.S. Army built the airfield in only six months. The construction was budgeted at $1,663,057. The airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis Jr., one of only two black line officers then serving.\nDuring training, Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison. Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee. However, he was transferred on 12 January 1942, reputedly because of his insistence that his African-American sentries and Military Police had police authority over local white civilians.\nHis successor, Colonel Frederick Kimble, then oversaw operations at the Tuskegee airfield. Contrary to new Army regulations, Kimble maintained segregation on the field in deference to local customs in the state of Alabama, a policy that was resented by the airmen. Later that year, the Air Corps replaced Kimble. His replacement had been the director of training at Tuskegee Army Airfield, Major Noel F. Parrish. Counter to the prevalent racism of the day, Parrish was fair and open-minded and petitioned Washington to allow the Tuskegee Airmen to serve in combat.\nThe strict racial segregation the U.S. Army required gave way in the face of the requirements for complex training in technical vocations. Typical of the process was the development of separate African-American flight surgeons to support the operations and training of the Tuskegee Airmen. Before the development of this unit, no U.S. Army flight surgeons had been black.\nTraining of African-American men as aviation medical examiners was conducted through correspondence courses, until 1943, when two black physicians were admitted to the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field, Texas. This was one of the earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army. Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941 to 1949. At that time, the typical tour of duty for a U.S. Army flight surgeon was four years. Six of these physicians lived under field conditions during operations in North Africa, Sicily, and other parts of Italy. The chief flight surgeon to the Tuskegee Airmen was Vance H. Marchbanks Jr., MD, a childhood friend of Benjamin Davis.\nThe accumulation of washed-out cadets at Tuskegee and the propensity of other commands to \"dump\" African-American personnel on the post exacerbated the difficulties of administering Tuskegee. A shortage of jobs for them made these enlisted men a drag on Tuskegee's housing and culinary departments.\nTrained officers were also left idle as the plan to shift African-American officers into command slots stalled, and white officers not only continued to hold command but were joined by additional white officers assigned to the post. One rationale behind the non-assignment of trained African-American officers was stated by the commanding officer of the Army Air Forces, General Henry \"Hap\" Arnold: \"Negro pilots cannot be used in our present Air Corps units since this would result in Negro officers serving over white enlisted men creating an impossible social situation.\"\nCombat assignment.\nThe 99th was finally considered ready for combat duty by April 1943. It shipped out of Tuskegee on 2 April, bound for North Africa, where it joined the 33rd Fighter Group and its commander, Colonel William W. Momyer. Given little guidance from battle-experienced pilots, the 99th's first combat mission was to attack the small strategic volcanic island of Pantelleria, code name Operation Corkscrew, in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea lanes for the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943. The air assault on the island began 30 May 1943. The 99th flew its first combat mission on 2 June. The surrender of the garrison of 11,121 Italians and 78 Germans due to air attack was the first of its kind.\nThe 99th then moved on to Sicily and received a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for its performance in combat.\nBy the end of February 1944, the all-black 332nd Fighter Group had been sent overseas with three fighter squadrons: The 100th, 301st and 302nd.\nUnder the command of Colonel Davis, the squadrons were moved to mainland Italy, where the 99th Fighter Squadron, assigned to the group on 1 May 1944, joined them on 6 June at Ramitelli Airfield, nine kilometers south-southeast of the small city of Campomarino, on the Adriatic coast. From Ramitelli, the 332nd Fighter Group escorted Fifteenth Air Force heavy strategic bombing raids into Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland, and Germany.\nFlying escort for heavy bombers, the 332nd earned an impressive combat record. The Allies called these airmen \"Red Tails\" or \"Red-Tail Angels\", because of the distinctive crimson unit identification marking predominantly applied on the tail section of the unit's aircraft.\nA B-25 bomb group, the 477th Bombardment Group, was forming in the U.S. but was not able to complete its training in time to see action. The 99th Fighter Squadron after its return to the United States became part of the 477th, redesignated the 477th Composite Group.\nActive air units.\nThe only black air units that saw combat during the war were the 99th Pursuit Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group. The dive-bombing and strafing missions under Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin O. Davis Jr. were considered to be highly successful.\nIn May 1942, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was renamed the 99th Fighter Squadron. It earned three Distinguished Unit Citations (DUC) during World War II. The DUCs were for operations over Sicily from 30 May to 11 June 1943, Monastery Hill near Cassino from 12 to 14 May 1944, and for successfully fighting off German jet aircraft on 24 March 1945. The mission was the longest bomber escort mission of the Fifteenth Air Force throughout the war. The 332nd flew missions in Sicily, Anzio, Normandy, the Rhineland, the Po Valley and Rome-Arno and others. Pilots of the 99th once set a record for destroying five enemy aircraft in under four minutes.\nThe Tuskegee Airmen shot down three German jets in a single day. On 24 March 1945, 43 P-51 Mustangs led by Colonel Benjamin O. Davis escorted B-17 bombers over into Germany and back. The bombers' target, a massive Daimler-Benz tank factory in Berlin, was heavily defended by \"Luftwaffe\" aircraft, including propeller-driven Fw 190s, Me 163 \"Komet\" rocket-powered fighters, and 25 of the much more formidable Me 262s, history's first operational jet fighter. Pilots Charles Brantley, Earl Lane and Roscoe Brown all shot down German jets over Berlin that day. For the mission, the 332nd Fighter Group earned a Distinguished Unit Citation.\nPilots of the 332nd Fighter Group earned 96 Distinguished Flying Crosses. Their missions took them over Italy and enemy-occupied parts of central and southern Europe. Their operational aircraft were, in succession: Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Bell P-39 Airacobra, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft.\nTuskegee Airmen bomber units.\nFormation.\nWith African-American fighter pilots being trained successfully, the Army Air Force now came under political pressure from the NAACP and other civil rights organizations to organize a bomber unit. There could be no defensible argument that the quota of 100 African-American pilots in training at one time, or 200 per year out of a total of 60,000 American aviation cadets in annual training, represented the service potential of 13 million African-Americans.\nOn 13 May 1943, the 616th Bombardment Squadron was established as the initial subordinate squadron of the 477th Bombardment Group, an all-white group. The squadron was activated on 1 July 1943, only to be inactivated on 15 August 1943. By September 1943, the number of washed-out cadets on base had surged to 286, with few of them working. In January 1944, the 477th Bombardment Group was reactivated\u2014an all-Black group. At the time, the usual training cycle for a bombardment group took three to four months.\nThe 477th eventually contained four medium bomber squadrons. Slated to comprise 1,200 officers and enlisted men, the unit operated 60 North American B-25 Mitchell bombers. The 477th went on to encompass three more bomber squadrons\u2013the 617th Bombardment Squadron, the 618th Bombardment Squadron, and the 619th Bombardment Squadron. The 477th was anticipated to be ready for action in November 1944.\nThe home field for the 477th was Selfridge Field, located outside Detroit, with forays to Oscoda Army Air Field in Oscoda, Michigan. Other bases were used for various types of training courses. Twin-engine pilot training began at Tuskegee while the transition to multi-engine pilot training was at Mather Field, California. Some ground crews trained at Mather before rotating to Inglewood. Gunners learned to shoot at Eglin Field, Florida. Bombers-navigators learned their trades at Hondo Army Air Field and Midland Air Field, Texas or at Roswell, New Mexico. Training of the new African-American crewmen also took place at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Lincoln, Nebraska, and Scott Field, Belleville, Illinois. Once trained, the air and ground crews were spliced into a working unit at Selfridge.\nCommand difficulties.\nThe new group's first commanding officer was Colonel Robert Selway, who had also commanded the 332nd Fighter Group before it deployed for combat overseas. Like his ranking officer, Major General Frank O'Driscoll Hunter from Georgia, Selway was a racial segregationist. Hunter was blunt about it, saying such things as \"...racial friction will occur if colored and white pilots are trained together.\" He backed Selway's violations of Army Regulation 210\u201310, which forbade segregation of airbase facilities. They segregated base facilities so thoroughly that they even drew a line in the base theater and ordered separate seating by race. When the audience sat in random patterns as part of \"Operation Checkerboard\", the movie was halted to make men return to segregated seating. African-American officers petitioned base Commanding Officer William Boyd for access to the only officer's club on base. Lieutenant Milton Henry entered the club and personally demanded his club rights; he was court-martialed for this.\nSubsequently, Colonel Boyd denied club rights to African-Americans, although General Hunter stepped in and promised a separate but equal club would be built for black airmen. The 477th was transferred to Godman Field, Kentucky before the club was built. They had spent five months at Selfridge but found themselves on a base a fraction of Selfridge's size, with no air-to-ground gunnery range and deteriorating runways that were too short for B-25 landings. Colonel Selway took on the second role of the commanding officer of Godman Field. In that capacity, he ceded Godman Field's officers club to African-American airmen. White officers used the whites-only clubs at nearby Fort Knox, much to the displeasure of African-American officers.\nAnother irritant was a professional one for African-American officers. They observed a steady flow of white officers through the command positions of the group and squadrons; these officers stayed just long enough to be \"promotable\" before transferring out at their new rank. This seemed to take about four months. In an extreme example, 22-year-old Robert Mattern was promoted to captain, transferred into squadron command in the 477th days later, and left a month later as a major. He was replaced by another white officer. Meanwhile, no Tuskegee Airmen held command.\nOn 15 March 1945, the 477th was transferred to Freeman Field, near Seymour, Indiana. The white population of Freeman Field was 250 officers and 600 enlisted men. Superimposed on it were 400 African-American officers and 2,500 enlisted men of the 477th and its associated units. Freeman Field had a firing range, usable runways, and other amenities useful for training. African-American airmen worked in proximity with white ones; both lived in a public housing project adjacent to the base.\nColonel Selway turned the noncommissioned officers out of their club and turned it into a second officers' club. He then classified all white personnel as cadre and all African-Americans as trainees. One officers' club became the cadre's club. The old Non-Commissioned Officers Club, promptly sarcastically dubbed \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", became the trainees' officers club. At least four of the trainees had flown combat in Europe as fighter pilots and had about four years in service. Four others had completed training as pilots, bombardiers and navigators and may have been the only triply qualified officers in the entire Air Corps. Several of the Tuskegee Airmen had logged more than 900 flight hours by this time. Nevertheless, by Colonel Selway's fiat, they were trainees.\nOff base was no better; many businesses in Seymour would not serve African-Americans. A local laundry would not wash their clothes and yet willingly laundered those of captured German soldiers.\nIn early April 1945, the 118th Base Unit transferred in from Godman Field; its African-American personnel held orders that specified they were base cadre, not trainees. On 5 April, officers of the 477th peaceably tried to enter the whites-only officer's club. Selway had been tipped off by a phone call and had the assistant provost marshal and base billeting manager stationed at the door to refuse the 477th officers' entry. The latter, a major, ordered them to leave and took their names as a means of arresting them when they refused. It was the beginning of the Freeman Field Mutiny.\nIn the wake of the Freeman Field Mutiny, the 616th and 619th were disbanded and the returned 99th Fighter Squadron was assigned to the 477th on 22 June 1945; it was redesignated the 477th Composite Group as a result. On 1 July 1945, Colonel Robert Selway was relieved of the Group's command; he was replaced by Colonel Benjamin\u00a0O. Davis Jr. A complete sweep of Selway's white staff followed, with all vacated jobs filled by African-American officers. The war ended before the 477th Composite Group could get into action. The 618th Bombardment Squadron was disbanded on 8 October 1945. On 13 March 1946, the two-squadron group, supported by the 602nd Engineer Squadron (later renamed 602nd Air Engineer Squadron), the 118th Base Unit, and a band, moved to its final station, Lockbourne Field. The 617th Bombardment Squadron and the 99th Fighter Squadron disbanded on 1 July 1947, ending the 477th Composite Group. It was reorganized as the 332nd Fighter Wing.\nWar accomplishments.\nIn all, 992 pilots were trained in Tuskegee from 1941 to 1946. 355 were deployed overseas, and 84 lost their lives. The toll included 68 pilots killed in action or accidents, 12 killed in training and non-combat missions and 32 captured as prisoners of war.\nThe Tuskegee Airmen were credited by higher commands with the following accomplishments:\nAwards and decorations included:\nControversy over escort record.\nFor decades, the Tuskegee Airmen were popularly believed to have never lost a bomber under escort. This belief derived most directly to an article, \"332nd Flies Its 200th Mission Without Loss\", published by the \"Chicago Defender\" on 24 March 1945. Citing information supplied by the 15th Air Force, the article said that no bomber escorted by the Tuskegee Airmen had ever been lost to enemy fire.\nThis statement was repeated for many years, and not publicly challenged, partly because the mission reports were classified for a number of years after the war. In 2004, William Holton, who was serving as the historian of the Tuskegee Airmen Incorporated, conducted research into wartime action reports. Alan Gropman, a professor at the National Defense University, disputed the initial refutations of the no-loss myth and said he researched more than 200 Tuskegee Airmen mission reports and found no bombers were lost to enemy fighters.\nDaniel Haulman of the Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) reassessed the history of the unit in 2006 and early 2007. He documented 25 bombers shot down by enemy fighter aircraft while being escorted by the Tuskegee Airmen, citing after-mission reports filed by the bomber units and Tuskegee fighter groups, records of missing air crew, and witness testimony.\nHaulman wrote a subsequent article, \"The Tuskegee Airmen and the Never Lost a Bomber Myth\", published in the \"Alabama Review\" and by NewSouth Books as an e-book, and included in a more comprehensive study regarding misconceptions about the Tuskegee Airmen released by AFHRA in July 2013. The article documented 27 bombers shot down by enemy aircraft while those bombers were being escorted by the 332nd Fighter Group. This total included 15 B-17s of the 483rd Bombardment Group shot down during a particularly savage air battle with an estimated 300 German fighters on 18 July 1944, that also resulted in nine kill credits and the award of five Distinguished Flying Crosses to members of the 332nd.\nOf the 179 bomber escort missions the 332nd Fighter Group flew for the Fifteenth Air Force, the group encountered enemy aircraft on 35 of those missions and lost bombers to enemy aircraft on only seven, and the total number of bombers lost was 27. By comparison, the average number of bombers lost by the other P-51 fighter groups of the Fifteenth Air Force during the same period was 46.\nIn 2022, Dr. Haulman published a comprehensive study that established that the record of the 322d differed substantially from that of the three other P-51 groups assigned to Fifteenth Air Force in terms of bombers lost. The group was noticeably better at protecting bombers they escorted, even if not perfect. While the 332nd only lost 27 escorted heavy bombers while flying 179 escort missions, the 31st Fighter Group lost 49 in 184 missions, the 325th lost 68 in 192 escort missions, while the 52nd lost 88 in 193 missions. Moreover, the 332nd flew more missions than any of the other three groups on which they lost no escorted bombers. Combining these numbers with the numbers of enemy aircraft destroyed by each of these groups suggests that the 332nd stuck closer to protect the bombers they escorted, while the other groups were willing to pursue enemy fighters away from the bombers.\nThe historical record shows several examples of the fighter group's losses. A mission report states that on 26 July 1944: \"1 B-24 seen spiraling out of formation in T/A [target area] after attack by E/A [enemy aircraft]. No chutes seen to open.\" The Distinguished Flying Cross citation awarded to Colonel Benjamin O. Davis for the mission on 9 June 1944, noted that he \"so skillfully disposed his squadrons that in spite of the large number of enemy fighters, the bomber formation suffered only a few losses.\"\nWilliam H. Holloman was reported by the \"Times\" as saying his review of records confirmed bombers had been lost. Holloman was a member of Tuskegee Airmen Inc., a group of surviving Tuskegee pilots and their supporters, who also taught Black Studies at the University of Washington and chaired the Airmen's history committee. According to the 28 March 2007 Air Force report, some bombers under 332nd Fighter Group escort protection were even shot down on the day the \"Chicago Defender\" article was published. The mission reports, however, do credit the group for not losing a bomber on an escort mission for a six-month period between September 1944 and March 1945, albeit when Luftwaffe contacts were far fewer than earlier.\nPostwar.\nContrary to negative predictions from some quarters, Tuskegee Airmen were some of the best pilots in the U.S. Army Air Forces due to a combination of pre-war experience and the personal drive of those accepted for training. Nevertheless, the Tuskegee Airmen continued to have to fight racism. Their combat record did much to quiet those directly involved with the group, but other units continued to harass these airmen.\nIn 1949, the 332nd entered the annual U.S. Continental Gunnery Meet in Las Vegas, Nevada. The competition included shooting aerial and ground targets and dropping bombs on targets. Flying the long-range Republic P-47N Thunderbolt (built for the long-range escort mission in the Pacific theatre of World War II), the 332nd Fighter Wing took first place in the conventional fighter class. The pilots were Captain Alva Temple, Lts. Harry Stewart, Jr., James H. Harvey III and Halbert Alexander. Staff Sergeant Buford A. Johnson (30 August 1927 \u2013 15 April 2017) served as the pilots' aircraft crew chief. Lt. Harvey said, \"We had a perfect score. Three missions, two bombs per plane. We didn't guess at anything, we were good.\" They received congratulations from the governor of Ohio and Air Force commanders across the nation.\nAfter segregation in the military was ended in 1948 by President Harry S. Truman with Executive Order 9981, the veteran Tuskegee Airmen found themselves in high demand throughout the newly formed United States Air Force. Some taught in civilian flight schools, such as the black-owned Columbia Air Center in Maryland. On 11 May 1949, \"Air Force Letter 35.3\" mandated that black Airmen be screened for reassignment to formerly all-white units according to qualifications.\nTuskegee Airmen were instrumental in postwar developments in aviation. Edward A. Gibbs, a civilian flight instructor who helped launch in the U.S. Aviation Cadet Program at Tuskegee, later became the founder of Negro Airmen International, an association joined by many airmen. USAF General Daniel \"Chappie\" James Jr. (then Lt.) was an instructor of the 99th Pursuit Squadron and later a fighter pilot in Europe. In 1975, he became the first African-American to reach the rank of four-star general. Post-war commander of the 99th Squadron Marion Rodgers went on to work in communications for NORAD and as a program developer for the Apollo 13 project.\nIn 2005, seven Tuskegee Airmen, including Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Carter, Colonel Charles McGee, group historian Ted Johnson, and Lieutenant Colonel Lee Archer, flew to Balad, Iraq, to speak to active duty airmen serving in the current incarnation of the 332nd, which was reactivated as the 332nd Air Expeditionary Group in 1998 and made part of the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing. \"This group represents the linkage between the 'greatest generation' of airmen and the 'latest generation' of airmen,\" said Lt. Gen. Walter E. Buchanan III, commander of the Ninth Air Force and U.S. Central Command Air Forces.\nAs of 2008[ [update]], no one knew how many of the original 996 pilots and about 16,000 ground personnel were still alive. In August 2019, 14 documented original surviving members of the Tuskegee Airmen participated at the annual Tuskegee Airmen Convention, which is hosted by Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. As of 1 January 2023, there were three surviving members.\nWillie Rogers, one of the last surviving members of the original Tuskegee Airmen, died at the age of 101 on 18 November 2016 in St. Petersburg, Florida, following a stroke. Rogers was drafted into the Army in 1942 and was part of the 100th Air Engineer Squad. Rogers also served with the Red Tail Angels. He was wounded in action, shot in the stomach and leg by German soldiers during a mission in Italy in January 1943. In 2007, President George W. Bush awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to the 300 surviving Tuskegee Airmen, but Rogers was not present. He was given a medal in 2013 after he revealed his previously undisclosed involvement. His pastor, Rev. Irby, said Rogers was a \"passionate oral historian\".\nCapt. Lawrence E. Dickson, 24, had gone missing while flying a P-51 Mustang and escorting a reconnaissance flight to Prague from Italy on 23 December 1944. He was on his 68th mission and had previously been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. On 27 July 2018, his remains, which had been recovered in Austria a year earlier, were conclusively identified and confirmed to his daughter \u2013 included with them was a ring inscribed from her mother to her father and dated 1943. The day before the announcement, his wingman, 2nd Lt. Robert L. Martin, had died at 99, in Olympia Fields, Illinois. The bodies of 26 other Tuskegee Airmen who disappeared in WWII remain unrecovered.\nIn 2019, Lt. Col. Robert J. Friend, one of 12 remaining Tuskegee Airmen at the time, died on 21 June in Long Beach at the age of 99. He had flown 142 combat missions in World War II. A public viewing and memorial was held at the Palm Springs Air Museum on 6 July. He had spoken about his experiences in many different events before to his death, such as in John Murdy Elementary School's \"The Gratitude Project\" in Garden Grove.\nOn January 16, 2022, Brigadier General Charles McGee died in his sleep at the age of 102. His 30-year military career included 409 combat missions in World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam War.\nOn February 2, 2025, Lt Col. Harry Stewart Jr. died, thus leaving Lt. Col. George Hardy as the last surviving member of the original 355 Tuskegee Airmen who served in World War II. Hardy died at age 100 in September 2025. James H. Harvey, III, who did not serve in combat during World War II but who did later manage to be a member of the USAF's inaugural \"Top Gun\" team in 1949 and serve in combat missions in the Korean War, lives as well, as does Lt. Eugene J. Robertson, who also did not serve in World War II combat missions. James Clayton Flowers, Thomas Franklin Vaughns and Lt. Col. Enoch \"Woody\" Woodhouse are also alive.\nLegacy and honors.\nOn 29 March 2007, the Tuskegee Airmen were collectively awarded a Congressional Gold Medal at a ceremony in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. The medal is currently on display at the Smithsonian Institution. The airfield where the airmen trained is now the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site.\nThurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice, got his start defending Tuskegee bomber trainees. The 477th Bombardment Group was formed in 1944 to extend the so-called \"Tuskegee experiment\" by allowing black aviators to serve on bomber crews. The aim was to send pilots\u2014many of them veterans of the original Tuskegee fighter group\u2014back to the States for training on B-25 bombers. While in Indiana, some of the African-American officers were arrested and charged with mutiny after entering an all-white officers' club. Marshall, then a young lawyer, represented the 100 black officers who had landed in jail as a result of the confrontation. The men were soon released (although one was later convicted of violent conduct and fined).\nRobert W. Williams Jr., a navigator/bombardier in the 477th Bombardment Group, became a judge in the First Judicial District, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In 1979, he was elected to the Commonwealth Court, an appellate court, and the first African American to serve on that court. In 1985, he resigned from the court to run for the District Attorney of Philadelphia County. He was the first African American to successfully become a city-wide candidate for that office. On 3 July 2023, Williams reached the age of 100, making him one of the last Tuskegee Airmen alive.\nOther members of the Tuskegee Airmen have made contributions in the world of business. Eugene Winslow founded Afro-Am Publishing in Chicago, Illinois, which published \"Great Negroes Past and Present\" in 1963.\nDaniel \"Chappie\" James Jr. started his career in the early 1940s at Tuskegee, joining the Army Air Corps in July 1943. After the war ended, James stayed in what became the Air Force and flew missions in both Korea and Vietnam. In 1969, James was put in command of Wheelus Air Base outside of Tripoli.\nFour Tuskegee airmen went on to become generals. For keeping his cool in the face of Qaddafi's troops, James was appointed a brigadier general by President Nixon. He was not the only Tuskegee graduate to make flag rank. James followed in the footsteps of Benjamin O. Davis Jr., the original commander of the 332nd Fighter Group and the first black general in the U.S. Air Force. Another Tuskegee aviator, Lucius Theus, retired a major general after dedicating most of his 36-year career in the Air Force to improving the military's bureaucracy, helping to implement a direct deposit system for service members. In 2019, at 100 years of age, Colonel Charles McGee was promoted to honorary Brigadier General.\nColeman Young served in the 477th Medium-Bomber Group of the as a second lieutenant, bombardier, and navigator. As a lieutenant in the 477th, Young played a role in the Freeman Field Mutiny in 1945. Young later was elected mayor of Detroit, MI and served from 1974 to 1994. Young was the first African-American mayor of Detroit.\nIn 2006, California Congressman Adam Schiff and Missouri Congressman William Lacy Clay Jr., led the initiative to create a commemorative postage stamp to honor the Tuskegee Airmen.\nThe 99th Flying Training Squadron flies T-1A Jayhawks and, in honor of the Tuskegee Airmen, painted the tops of the tails of their aircraft red. On 1 August 2008, Camp Creek Parkway, a portion of State Route 6 in south Fulton County and in the City of East Point near Atlanta, Georgia, was officially renamed in honor of the Tuskegee Airmen. The road is a highway that serves as the main artery into Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.\nThe Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh presented an award to several Western Pennsylvania Tuskegee veterans, as well as suburban Sewickley, Pennsylvania dedicated a memorial to the seven from that municipality. An exhibit was established at Pittsburgh International Airport in Concourse A.\nOn 9 December 2008, the Tuskegee Airmen were invited to attend the inauguration of Barack Obama, the first African-American elected as president. Retired Lt. William Broadwater, 82, of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, a Tuskegee Airman, summed up the feeling. \"The culmination of our efforts and others was this great prize we were given on 4 Nov.. Now we feel like we've completed our mission.\" More than 180 airmen attended 20 January 2009 inauguration.\nIn July 2009, 15-year-old Kimberly Anyadike became the youngest female African-American pilot to complete a transcontinental flight across the United States. She cited the Tuskegee Airmen as one of her biggest inspirations, and was accompanied on her trip by 87-year-old former Tuskegee Airman Levi Thornhill.\nThe Tuskegee Airmen Memorial was erected at Walterboro Army Airfield, South Carolina, in honor of the Tuskegee Airmen, their instructors, and ground support personnel who trained at the Walterboro Army Airfield during World War II. In the 2010 Rose Parade, the city of West Covina, California paid tribute to the \"service and commitment of the Tuskegee Airmen\" with a float, entitled \"Tuskegee Airmen\u2014A Cut Above\", which featured a large bald eagle, two replica World War II \"Redtail\" fighter aircraft and historical images of some of the airmen who served. The float won the mayor's trophy as the most outstanding city entry\u2014national or international.\nIn June 1998, the Ohio Army and Air National Guard opened a jointly operated dining hall. They dedicated the new dining facility called the \"Red Tail Dining Facility\" to the Tuskegee Airmen. The facility is operated at the Rickenbacker ANG base outside of Columbus Ohio.\nIn 2008, the Tuskegee Airmen were inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.\nIn January 2012, MTA Regional Bus Operations officially changed the name of its 100th Street depot in New York City to the Tuskegee Airmen Depot. In 2012, George Lucas produced \"Red Tails\", a film based on the experiences of the Tuskegee Airmen.\nIn November 2013, the New York City Council voted to permanently rename South Road in Jamaica, Queens to Tuskegee Airmen Way. The change took effect on November 14.\nIn 2012, Aldine Independent School District in Harris County, Texas named Benjamin O. Davis High School in honor of Benjamin O. Davis Jr.\nOn February 6, 2014, a 17-mile section of I-80 between Vacaville, CA and Davis, CA, near Travis Air Force Base, was named the \"Tuskegee Airman Memorial Highway\".\nIn December 2014, Interstate 75 in Michigan was named the \"Tuskegee Airmen Memorial Highway\".\nOn 16 September 2019, the USAF officially named the winning T-X program aircraft the \"T-7A Red Hawk\" as a tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen, who painted their airplanes' tails red, and to the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, one of the aircraft flown by the Tuskegee Airmen.\nOn 2 February 2020, McGee brought out the commemorative coin for the Super Bowl coin flip.\nIn 2021, the United States Mint issued an America the Beautiful quarter commemorating the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site. The coin depicts a Tuskegee Airman suiting up with two P-51 Mustangs flying overhead and the motto \"They fought two wars\".\nOn 25 April 2021, NASCAR Cup Series driver Erik Jones honored the Airmen with a paint scheme at Talladega Superspeedway similar to the design of the P-51 Mustang they flew in World War II. Jones led 7 laps in the race, but crashed while running fourth on the final lap, and had to settle for a 27th-place finish.\nA commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the official desegregation of the US military during which several Tuskegee Airmen were present was held on 26 July 2023 at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. During the event, a PT-17 Stearman was officially inducted to the National Museum of the Air Force, located at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio. Most Tuskegee pilots were originally trained on the Stearman-class aircraft.\nIn 2023, the Pentagon identified the remains of 2nd Lt. Fred L. Brewer Jr of the 100th Fighter Squadron, 332nd Fighter Group, whose P-51C Mustang crashed during a bomber escort mission over Regensburg Germany in October 1944. After Lt. Brewer's plane crashed he was declared missing in action. In July 2023, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) exhumed a set of previously unidentified remains and positively identified them through lab tests as belonging to Brewer. He was laid to rest with military honors at Salisbury National Cemetery in his home state of North Carolina.\nOn March 28, 2024, President Joseph Biden issued a https:// to recognize Tuskegee Airmen Commemoration Day. In an effort led by Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester (DE), and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC) and Vanessa Butler in partnership with the https:// and https://, Tuskegee Airmen Commemoration Day is typically celebrated on the 4th Thursday in March annually.\nIn January 2025, United States Air Force lesson plans and training courses, which included some videos of the Tuskegee Airmen, were suspended in compliance with the Trump administration's anti-DEI orders. The suspension was not because of the Tuskegee Airmen videos, rather the course contained other material specific to a DEI program, separate from the Tuskegee Airmen videos. Shortly after, secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth tweeted his support for reinstatement of the Tuskegee Airman videos. The videos were soon reintroduced, though the other class material was change to comply with the Trump administration's executive orders.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is Canada's first female astronaut and the first neurologist in space.\nAfter more than a decade as head of an international space medicine research team collaborating with NASA, Bondar became a consultant and speaker in the business, scientific, and medical communities.\nRoberta Bondar has received many honours including appointment as a Companion of the Order of Canada and the Order of Ontario, the NASA Space Flight Medal, over 28 honorary degrees, induction into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame, the International Women's Forum Hall of Fame and a star on Canada's Walk of Fame.\nEarly life and education.\nBondar was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, on December 4, 1945, the second daughter of Mildred (Gourlay) and Edward Bondar. Her father, a manager with the city's Public Utilities Commission and her mother, an educator who taught business and commerce, encouraged their children academically and in extra-curricular activities.\nHer fascination with the sciences began as a child. When she was 7, her father built a lab in the basement where she conducted experiments. In grade school she was awarded first place for an oral presentation on waterpower. But space flight particularly held her imagination. She built rocket models, and her aunt, who worked at Cape Canaveral, would send her posters and crests from the U.S. space program.\nAn experience in grade school of being passed over for an opportunity for a boy classmate who hadn't scored as well on a qualification exam made Bondar especially driven to prove herself academically. She later explained that she wanted \"to be as qualified as possible, so if people didn't want me, they'd have to say, look, you're a woman and I don't think you can do it.\"\nShe attended Sir James Dunn Collegiate and Vocational School in Sault Ste. Marie, graduating in 1964. A science project she conducted on the biology of the forest tent caterpillar won a local Rotary science fair award and was promoted to the 1963 Canada-wide science fair in Toronto. The project also earned her a summer job studying the spruce budworm at what is today the federal Great Lakes Forestry Centre.\nBondar was also an accomplished athlete in high school, rising to captain of her basketball team. She was named the school's sportswoman of the year in 1963. At graduation in 1964, she received the school's athletic leadership trophy and scholarship.\nBondar received an extensive university education in the sciences and medicine. She received a Bachelor of Science in zoology and agriculture from the University of Guelph (1968), a Masters of Science in experimental pathology from the University of Western Ontario (1971), a Doctor of Philosophy in neuroscience from the University of Toronto's Mississauga campus (1974), and a Doctor of Medicine from McMaster University (1977). Part of her undergraduate research experience included work with the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Forestry.\nCareer.\nAs one of the first six members of the Canadian Astronaut Corps selected in 1983, Bondar began astronaut training in 1984, and in 1992 she was designated Payload Specialist for the first International Microgravity Laboratory Mission (IML-1). Bondar flew on the NASA Space Shuttle Discovery during Mission STS-42, January 22\u201330, 1992, during which she performed over 40 experiments in the Spacelab. Her work studying the effects of low-gravity situations on the human body allowed NASA to prepare astronauts for long stays in the space station.\nAfter her astronaut career, Bondar led an international team of researchers at NASA for more than a decade, examining data obtained from astronauts on space missions to better understand the mechanisms underlying the body's ability to recover from exposure to space. Bondar's research in space recovery considered the linkage to Parkinson's disease in addition to other neurological effects.\nBondar pursued her interests in photography with an emphasis on natural environments; she was an Honors student in Professional Nature Photography at the Brooks Institute of Photography, Santa Barbara, California. She is the author of four photo essay books that feature her photography of the Earth. These published books include \"Landscape of Dreams, Passionate Vision: Discovering Canada's National Parks, The Arid Edge of Earth,\" and \"Touching the Earth\". Bondar was also a certified sky diver, underwater diver and private pilot.\nBondar has also been a consultant and speaker to diverse organizations, drawing on her expertise as an astronaut, physician, scientific researcher, photographer, author, environment interpreter, and team leader. Not only can interviews from radio and TV be found of Bondar, but she also played a role in the movie \"Destiny in Space.\" Furthermore, Bondar's expertise was consulted in programs that captured both the literal and figurative takeoff of groundbreaking science\u2014that is, the space shuttle.\nIn 2009, Bondar registered The Roberta Bondar Foundation as a not-for-profit charity. The foundation focuses on environmental awareness.\nHonours, awards, and tributes.\nBondar is the recipient of multiple honours and awards from organizations and universities across Canada. These honours include the Vanier Award in 1985 and the F.W. (Casey) Baldwin Award in 1985.\nBondar was the first astronaut to receive a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. It was inducted on October 1, 2011, at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto.\nThe Roberta Bondar Park and Tent Pavilion is located in Bondar's home town (Sault Ste. Marie) in honour of the first female astronaut. Bondar also has multiple public schools named after her.\nBondar served two terms as the Chancellor of Trent University, from 2003 to 2009.\nIn 2009, Concordia University awarded Bondar the prestigious Loyola Medal.\nIn 2017, the Royal Canadian Mint released a limited edition 25th anniversary $25 coin entitled \"A View of Canada from Space\". The unveiling of this honour was done in her hometown of Sault Ste. Marie at Sault College on November 1, 2016.\nIn 2018, Thebacha and Wood Buffalo Astronomical Society renamed its observatory to The Dr. Roberta Bondar Northern Observatory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In target shooting, they are used for greater accuracy due to the larger meplat. They are more accurate and predictable compared to pointed bullets which, despite having a higher ballistic coefficient (BC), are more sensitive to bullet harmonic characteristics and wind deflection.\nPlastic-tipped bullets are a type of (rifle) bullet meant to confer the aerodynamic advantage of the Spitzer bullet (for example, see very-low-drag bullet) and the stopping power of hollow-point bullets.\nGunshot wounds from hollow-point bullets can be very painful; due to this, they have been banned from use in wartime. They may leave fragments difficult to remove from living tissue.\nHistory.\nSolid lead bullets, when cast from a soft alloy, will often deform and provide some expansion if they hit the target at a high velocity. This, combined with the limited velocity and penetration attainable with muzzleloading firearms, meant there was little need for extra expansion.\nThe first hollow-point bullets were marketed in the late 19th century as \"express bullets\" and were hollowed out to reduce the bullet's mass and provide higher velocities. In addition to providing increased velocities, the hollow also turned out to provide significant expansion, especially when the bullets were cast in a soft lead alloy. Originally intended for rifles, the popular .32-20, .38-40, and .44-40 calibers could also be fired in revolvers.\nWith the advent of smokeless powder, velocities increased, and bullets got smaller, faster, and lighter. These new bullets (especially in rifles) needed to be jacketed to handle the conditions of firing. The new full metal jacket bullets tended to penetrate straight through a target causing less internal damage than a bullet that expands and stops in its target. This led to the development of the soft-point bullet and later jacketed hollow-point bullets at the British arsenal in Dum Dum, near Calcutta around 1890. Designs included the .303\" Mk III, IV &amp; V and the .455\" Mk III \"Manstopper\" cartridges. Although such bullet designs were quickly outlawed for use in warfare (in 1898, the Germans complained they breached the Laws of War), they steadily gained ground among hunters due to the ability to control the expansion of the new high velocity cartridges. In modern ammunition, the use of hollow points is primarily limited to handgun ammunition, which tends to operate at much lower velocities than rifle ammunition (on the order of versus over 2,000 feet per second). At rifle velocities, a hollow point is not needed for reliable expansion and most rifle ammunition makes use of tapered jacket designs to achieve the mushrooming effect. At the lower handgun velocities, hollow point designs are generally the only design that will reliably expand.\nModern hollow-point bullet designs use many different methods to provide controlled expansion, including:\nMechanism.\nWhen a hollow-point hunting bullet strikes a soft target, the pressure created in the pit forces the material (usually lead) around the inside edge to expand outwards, increasing the axial diameter of the projectile as it passes through. This process is commonly referred to as \"mushrooming\", because the resulting shape, a widened, rounded nose on top of a cylindrical base, typically resembles a mushroom.\nThe greater frontal surface area of the expanded bullet limits its depth of penetration into the target and causes more extensive tissue damage along the wound path. Many hollow-point bullets, especially those intended for use at high velocity in centerfire rifles, are \"jacketed\", i.e., a portion of the lead-cored bullet is wrapped in a thin layer of harder metal, such as copper, brass, or mild steel. This jacket provides additional strength to the bullet, increases penetration, and can help prevent it from leaving deposits of lead inside the bore. In \"controlled expansion\" bullets, the jacket and other internal design characteristics help to prevent the bullet from breaking apart; a fragmented bullet will not penetrate as far.\nAccuracy.\nDue to their design, hollow point bullets tend to be more accurate than other types of ammunition, as they are less affected by wind resistance and other factors that can affect trajectory. For bullets designed for target shooting, some such as the Sierra \"Matchking\" incorporate a cavity in the nose, called the meplat. This allows the manufacturer to maintain a greater consistency in tip shape and thus aerodynamic properties among bullets of the same design, at the expense of a slightly decreased ballistic coefficient and higher drag. The result is a slightly decreased overall accuracy between bullet trajectory and barrel direction, as well as an increased susceptibility to wind drift, but closer grouping of subsequent shots due to bullet consistency, often increasing the shooter's perceived accuracy.\nThe manufacturing process of hollow-point bullets also produces a flat, uniformly shaped base on the bullet which is thought to increase accuracy by providing a more consistent piston surface for the expanding gases of the cartridge.\nTesting.\nTerminal ballistics testing of hollow point bullets are generally performed in ballistic gelatin, or some other medium intended to simulate tissue and cause a hollow point bullet to expand. Test results are generally given in terms of expanded diameter, penetration depth, and weight retention. Expanded diameter is an indication of the size of the wound cavity, penetration depth shows if vital organs could be reached by the bullet, and weight retention indicates how much of the bullet mass fragmented and separated from the main body of the bullet. How these factors are interpreted depends on the intended use of the bullet, and there are no universally agreed-upon ideal metrics.\nLegislation.\nThe Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibited the use in \"international warfare\" of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body. It is a common misapprehension that hollow-point ammunition is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions, as the prohibition significantly predates those conventions. The Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868 banned exploding projectiles of less than 400\u00a0grams, along with weapons designed to aggravate injured soldiers or make their death inevitable.\nDespite the widespread ban on military use, hollow-point bullets are one of the most common types of bullets used by civilians and police, which is due largely to the reduced risk of bystanders being hit by over-penetrating or ricocheted bullets, and the increased speed of incapacitation.\nIn many jurisdictions, even ones (such as the United Kingdom) where expanding and all other kinds of ammunition are restricted to firearms certificate holders, it is illegal to hunt certain types of game with ammunition that does \"not\" expand.\nUnited Kingdom.\nMost ammunition types, including hollow-point bullets, are only allowed to a section 1 firearms certificate (FAC) holder. The FAC holder must have the calibre in question as a valid allowance on their licence. A valid firearms certificate allows the holder to use ball, full metal jacket, hollow point and ballistic-tipped ammunition for range use and vermin control. A firearms certificate will only be issued to any individual who can provide good reason to the police for the possession of firearms and their ammunition. Until recently all expanding ammunition fell under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 and was only allowed when conditions were entered onto an FAC by the police. This condition would allow expanding ammunition to be used for:\nSome ammunition types are still prohibited under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968. Ammunition that explodes on impact or any ammunition that is intended for military use are examples of this.\nPopular calibres used in the UK for vermin, fox and deer control are as follows: .223 Remington, .243 Winchester, .308 Winchester, .22-250 amongst others, all using hollow-point bullets. Many rimfire calibres also use expanding ammunition such as .22 Long Rifle, .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire and .17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire.\nUnited States.\nThe United States is one of few major powers that did not agree to IV-3 of the Hague Convention of 1899, and thus is able to openly admit to the use of this kind of ammunition in warfare, but the United States ratified the second (1907) Hague Convention IV-23, which says \"To employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering\", similar to IV-3 of the first Convention. For years the United States military respected this Convention and refrained from the use of expanding ammunition, and even made special FMJ .22LR ammunition for use in High Standard pistols that were issued to the OSS agents and the Savage Model 24 .22/.410 combination guns issued in the E series of air crew survival kits. After announcing consideration of using hollow point ammunition for side arms, with a possible start date of 2018, the United States Army began production of M1153 special purpose ammunition for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum with a jacketed hollow point bullet at per second for use in situations where limited over-penetration of targets is necessary to reduce collateral damage.\nThe state of New Jersey bans possession of hollow point bullets by civilians, except for ammunition possessed at one's own dwellings, premises, or other lands owned or possessed, or for, while and traveling to and from hunting with a hunting license if otherwise legal for the particular game. The law also requires all hollow point ammunition to be transported directly from the place of purchase to one's home or premises, or hunting area, or by members of a rifle or pistol club directly to a place of target practice, or directly to an authorized target range from the place of purchase or one's home or premises.\nThe United States military uses open-tip ammunition in some sniper rifles due to its exceptional accuracy. W. Hays Parks, Colonel, USMC, Chief of the JAG's International Law Branch, has argued that this ammunition is not prohibited by military convention in that the wounds that it produces are similar to full metal jacket ammunition in practice.\nWinchester Black Talon scare.\nIn early 1992, Winchester introduced the \"Black Talon\", a newly designed hollow-point handgun bullet which used a specially designed, reverse tapered jacket. The jacket was cut at the hollow to intentionally weaken it, and these cuts allowed the jacket to open into six petals upon impact. The thick jacket material kept the tips of the jacket from bending as easily as a normal thickness jacket. The slits that weakened the jacket left triangular shapes in the tip of the jacket, and these triangular sections of jacket would end up pointing out after expansion, leading to the \"Talon\" name. The bullets were coated with a black colored, paint-like lubricant called \"Lubalox\", and loaded into nickel-plated brass cases, which made them visually stand out from other ammunition. While performance of the Black Talon rounds was not significantly improved over other comparable high-performance hollow-point ammunition, the reverse taper jacket did provide reliable expansion under a wide range of conditions, and many police departments adopted the round.\nWinchester's \"Black Talon\" product name was eventually used against them. After the high-profile 1993 101 California Street shooting in San Francisco, media response against Winchester was swift. \"This bullet kills you better\", says one report; \"its six razorlike claws unfold on impact, expanding to nearly three times the bullet's diameter\". A concern was raised by the president of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) that the sharp edges of the jacket could cut medical personnel's skin and risk spread of disease. An ACEP spokesman later said he was not aware of any evidence to support this claim.\nWinchester responded to the media criticism of the Black Talon line by removing it from the commercial market and only selling it to law enforcement distributors. Winchester has since discontinued the sale of the Black Talon entirely, although Winchester does manufacture nearly identical ammunition under new brand names, the Ranger T-Series and the Supreme Elite Bonded PDX1.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His mother, a native Irish speaker from Liscannor, M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Scannl\u00e1in (aka Mary Scanlan), was John Holland's second wife; his first, Anne Foley Holland, believed to be a native of Kilkee, died in 1835. The area was heavily Irish-speaking and Holland learned English properly only when he attended the local English-speaking St Macreehy's National School, and from 1858, Irish Christian Brothers school in Ennistymon.\nHolland joined the Irish Christian Brothers in Limerick and taught in Limerick (CBS Sexton Street) and many other centres in the country including North Monastery CBS in Cork City, St. Mary's CBS, Portlaoise, St Joseph's CBS (Drogheda) and as the first Mathematics teacher in Colaiste Ris (also Dundalk). Due to ill health, he left the Christian Brothers in 1873. Holland migrated to the United States in 1873. Initially working for an engineering firm, he returned to teaching again for a further six years at St. John's Catholic school in Paterson, New Jersey.\nDevelopment of submarine designs.\nAfter his arrival in the United States, Holland slipped and fell on an icy Boston street and broke a leg. While recuperating from the injury in a hospital, he used his time to refine his submarine designs and was encouraged by Isaac Whelan, a priest.\nIn 1875, his submarine designs were submitted for consideration by the US Navy but were turned down as unworkable. The Fenians (Irish revolutionaries), however, continued to fund Holland's research and development expenses at a level that allowed him to resign from his teaching post. In 1878 he demonstrated the Holland I prototype. In 1881, \"Fenian Ram\" was launched but, soon after, Holland and the Fenians parted company on bad terms over the issue of payment within the Fenian organisation, and between the Fenians and Holland. The submarine is now preserved at Paterson Museum, New Jersey.\nHolland continued to improve his designs and worked on several experimental boats that were not accepted by the US Navy and founded the Holland Torpedo Boat Company in 1896. He was eventually successful with a privately built type initially named \"Holland VI\", launched on 17 May 1897. This was the first submarine to have power to run submerged for any considerable distance, and the first to combine electric motors for submerged travel and gasoline engines for use on the surface. She was purchased by the US Navy, on 11 April 1900, after rigorous tests and was commissioned on 12 October 1900 as USS \"Holland\". Seven more of her type were ordered, with five built at the Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and two built at Union Iron Works in California. The company that emerged from these developments was called The Electric Boat Company, founded on 7 February 1899. Isaac Leopold Rice became the company's first president, with Elihu B. Frost acting as vice-president and chief financial officer. This company eventually evolved into the major defence contractor General Dynamics.\nThe USS \"Holland\" design was also adopted by others, including the Royal Navy in developing the . The first five submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy used a modified version of the basic design, although these boats were at least 10 feet longer, at about 63 feet. These submarines were also developed at the Fore River Ship and Engine Company in Quincy, Massachusetts. Holland also designed the \"Holland II\" and \"Holland III\" prototypes. The Royal Navy 'Holland 1' is on display at the Submarine Museum, Gosport, England.\nDeath.\nAfter spending 56 of his 73 years working with submersibles, John Philip Holland died on 12 August 1914, in Newark, New Jersey. He is interred at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Totowa, New Jersey.\nMemorial.\nA monument stands at the gates of Scholars Townhouse Hotel, Drogheda (the former building of the Christian Brothers school where Holland taught) in commemoration of his work. It was unveiled in a ceremony on 14 June 2014 as part of the Irish Maritime Festival. The ceremony was attended by Drogheda Town Council as well as representatives of the US, British and Japanese governments. St. Josephs' Christian Brothers School, where Holland once taught, has been renamed and operates as John P. Holland Charter School in Paterson, New Jersey.\nThe John P. Holland Centre, a centre dedicated to the life and work of Holland, was opened in 2016 in Liscannor, County Clare.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was launched on 17 May 1897. She was acquired by the US Navy, on 11 April 1900, and commissioned, on 12 October 1900.\n\"Holland\" was built at former Navy Lieutenant Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard, of Elizabeth, New Jersey for John Holland's Holland Torpedo Boat Company, which became the Electric Boat company in 1899. The vessel was built under the supervision of John Philip Holland, who designed the vessel and her details. \"Holland\"'s keel was laid at Nixon's Crescent Shipyard with both men present. The two men worked together using many of John Holland's proven concepts and patents to make the submarine a reality, each man complementing the other's contributions to the development of the modern submarine. John Holland was the inventor for US Patent 702,729 for the design of a submarine boat. Testing and training first took place at the Holland Torpedo Boat Station from 1899 to 1900. Important contributions were also made by Arthur L. Busch (or Du Busc), Crescent's superintendent.\n\"Holland VI\" included many features that submarines of the early 20th century would exhibit, albeit in later, more advanced forms. There was a conning tower from which the boat, and her weapons, could be directed. Also, she had all the necessary ballast and trim tanks to make precise changes in depth and attitude underwater. Her crew was six men and maximum diving depth was .\nFor armament, she had a reloadable 18-inch (450\u00a0mm) torpedo tube with three Whitehead Mark 2 torpedoes and an pneumatic dynamite gun in the bow (the dynamite gun's projectiles were called \"aerial torpedoes\"). A second dynamite gun in the stern was removed in 1900, to make room for an improved engine exhaust, prior to delivery to the Navy.\nShe had both an internal combustion engine (specifically, a 4-stroke Otto gasoline engine of ) for running on the surface and charging batteries, and an Electro Dynamic electric motor of for submerged operation, with one shaft. A 66-cell Exide battery powered the electric motor when submerged. This allowed speeds of surfaced and submerged. Surfaced range was at 6 knots, while submerged range was at . There is significant variation in references as to the vessel's horsepower and speed, for example, the \"Register of Ships of the U. S. Navy\" gives horsepower figures of surfaced and submerged, with surfaced and submerged.\nService history.\n\"Holland VI\" eventually proved her worthiness as a warship and was ultimately purchased by the US government for the sum of $150,000, on 11 April 1900. She was considered to be the first truly successful craft of her type. The United States Government soon ordered more submarines from Holland's company, which were to be known as the . These became America's first fleet of underwater naval vessels.\n\"Holland VI\" was modified after her christening, and was renamed United States Submarine Torpedo Boat \"Holland\" (Submarine-1) when she was commissioned by the US Navy on 12 October 1900, at Newport, Rhode Island.\nDuring her commissioned life in the Navy, \"Holland\" did not carry the hull designation SS-1. The designation system currently in use was placed into Naval Regulations, on 17 July 1920. \"Holland\" would never been referred to as SS-1, while in service, she would have been designated Submarine-1, or simply S-1, under the system in place between 1895 and 1920. Most historians, including official Navy sources, have retroactively applied both the prefix USS and the designation SS-1 to avoid confusion.\n\"Holland\" was the first commissioned submarine in the US Navyand is the first of the unbroken line of submarines in the Navy. She was the fourth submarine to be owned by the Navy, however. The first submarine was \"Propeller\" (also known as ), the second was \"Intelligent Whale\" and the third was , an experimental submarine, built in 1895, which is not to be confused with .\nOn 16 October 1900, in order to be kept serviceable throughout the winter, \"Holland\" left Newport, under tow of the tug for Annapolis, Maryland, where she was used to train midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy, as well as officers and enlisted men ordered there to receive training vital in preparing for the operation of other submarines being built for the Fleet.\n\"Holland\" proved valuable for experimental purposes in collecting data for submarines under construction or contemplation. Her surface run, from Annapolis to Norfolk, from 8\u201310 January 1901, provided useful data on her performance underway over an extended period.\n\"Holland\", briefly in 1899, on trials, and five \"Plunger\"-class Holland-type submarines, were based in New Suffolk, New York, on the North Fork of Long Island, from 1899 to 1905, prompting the hamlet to claim to be the first submarine base in the United States.\nExcept for the period from 15 June to 1 October 1901, which was passed training cadets at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island, \"Holland\" remained at Annapolis, as a training submarine until 17 July 1905, when she was decommissioned.\nFate.\n\"Holland\" finished her career in reserve at Norfolk. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 November 1910. This revolutionary submarine was sold as scrap to Henry A. Hitner &amp; Sons, of Philadelphia, on 18 June 1913, for $100. Her purchaser was required to put up $5,000 bond as assurance that the submarine would be broken up and not used as a ship.\nAbout 1915, the hulk of \"Holland\", stripped of her external fittings, was sold to Peter J. Gibbons. As of October 1916, she was on display in Philadelphia. In May 1917, she was moved to the Bronx, New York, as a featured attraction at the Bronx International Exposition of Science, Arts and Industries.\n\"Holland\" was on display for several years in Paterson, New Jersey, until in 1930, she was sold as scrap to the Brooklyn Navy yard, and in 1932 was scrapped.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, in developing the foundation for Bose\u2013Einstein statistics, and the theory of the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. A Fellow of the Royal Society, he was awarded India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, in 1954 by the Government of India.\nThe eponymous particles class described by Bose's statistics, bosons, were named by Paul Dirac.\nA polymath, he had a wide range of interests in varied fields, including physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, mineralogy, philosophy, arts, literature, and music. He served on many research and development committees in India after independence.\nEarly life.\nBose was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), the eldest of seven children in a Bengali Kayastha family. Bose's father was Surendra Nath. Bose's mother was (Smt.) Amodini Debi. Surendra was an accountant and worked in East India Railways. Bose was the only son, with six sisters after him. His ancestral home was in the village Bara Jagulia, in the district of Nadia, in the Bengal Presidency. His schooling began at the age of five, near his home. When his family moved to Goabagan, he was admitted into the New Indian School. In his final year of school, he was admitted into the Hindu School. He passed his entrance examination (matriculation) in 1909 and stood fifth in the order of merit. He then joined the intermediate science course at the Presidency College, Calcutta, where his teachers included Jagadish Chandra Bose, Sarada Prasanna Das, and Prafulla Chandra Ray.\nBose received a Bachelor of Science in mixed mathematics from Presidency College, standing first in 1913. Then he joined Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee's newly formed Science College where he again stood first in the Master of Science (MSc) mixed mathematics exam in 1915. His marks in the MSc examination created a new record in the annals of the University of Calcutta, which is yet to be surpassed.\nAfter completing his MSc, Bose joined the Science College, Calcutta University as a research scholar in 1916 and started his studies in the theory of relativity. It was an exciting era in the history of scientific progress. Quantum theory had just appeared on the horizon and significant results had started pouring in.\nHis father, Surendranath Bose, worked in the Engineering Department of the East Indian Railway Company. In 1914, at age 20, Satyendra Nath Bose married Ushabati Ghosh, the 11-year-old daughter of a prominent Calcutta physician. They had nine children, two of whom died in early childhood. When he died in 1974, he left behind his wife, two sons, and five daughters.\nAs a polyglot, Bose was well versed in several languages such as Bengali, English, French, German and Sanskrit as well as the poetry of Lord Tennyson, Rabindranath Tagore and Kalidasa. In Europe, he impressed his host Jacqueline Zadoc-Kahn with his knowledge of Hebrew in literature and religion. He could play the \"esraj\", an Indian instrument similar to a violin. He was actively involved in running night schools that came to be known as the Working Men's Institute.\nResearch career.\nBose attended Hindu School in Calcutta, and later attended Presidency College, also in Calcutta, earning the highest marks at each institution, while fellow student and future astrophysicist Meghnad Saha came second. He came in contact with teachers such as Jagadish Chandra Bose, Prafulla Chandra Ray and Naman Sharma who provided inspiration to aim high in life. From 1916 to 1921, he was a lecturer in the physics department of the Rajabazar Science College under University of Calcutta. Along with Saha, Bose prepared the first book in English based on German and French translations of original papers on Einstein's special and general relativity in 1919.\nIn 1921, Satyendra Nath Bose joined as Reader in the Department of Physics of the recently founded University of Dhaka (in present-day Bangladesh). Bose set up whole new departments, including laboratories, to teach advanced courses for MSc and BSc honours and taught thermodynamics as well as James Clerk Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism.\nBose, along with Indian Astrophysicist Meghnad Saha, presented several papers in theoretical physics and pure mathematics from 1918 onwards. In 1924, whilst a Reader in the Physics Department of the University of Dhaka, Bose wrote a paper deriving Planck's quantum radiation law without any reference to classical physics by using a novel way of counting states with identical particles. This paper was seminal in creating the important field of quantum statistics. Though not accepted at once for publication, he sent the article directly to Albert Einstein in Germany. Einstein, recognising the importance of the paper, translated it into German himself and submitted it on Bose's behalf to the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik\". As a result of this recognition, Bose was able to work for two years in European X-ray and crystallography laboratories, during which he worked with Louis de Broglie, Marie Curie, and Einstein.\nBose\u2013Einstein statistics.\nWhile presenting a lecture at the University of Dhaka on the theory of radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe, Bose intended to show his students that the contemporary theory was inadequate, because it predicted results not in accordance with experimental results.\nIn the process of describing this discrepancy, Bose for the first time took the position that the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution would not be true for microscopic particles, where fluctuations due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle will be significant. Thus he stressed the probability of finding particles in the phase space, each state having volume \"h\"3, and discarding the distinct position and momentum of the particles.\nBose adapted this lecture into a short article called \"Planck's Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta\" and sent it to Albert Einstein with the following letter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEinstein agreed with him, translated Bose's papers \"Planck's Law and Hypothesis of Light Quanta\" into German, and had it published in \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik\" under Bose's name, in 1924.\n(1) There are three outcomes. What is the probability of producing two heads?\n(2) Since the coins are distinct, there are two outcomes which produce a head and a tail. The probability of two heads is one-quarter.\nThe reason Bose's interpretation produced accurate results was that since photons are indistinguishable from each other, one cannot treat any two photons having equal energy as being two distinct identifiable photons. By analogy if, in an alternate universe, coins were to behave like photons and other bosons, the probability of producing two heads would indeed be one-third (tail-head = head-tail).\nBose's interpretation is now called Bose\u2013Einstein statistics. This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of quantum statistics, and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac. When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he asked him whether he had been aware that he had invented a new type of statistics, and he very candidly said that no, he wasn't that familiar with Boltzmann's statistics and didn't realize that he was doing the calculations differently.\nBose\u2013Einstein condensate.\nEinstein also did not at first realize how radical Bose's departure was, and in his first paper after Bose, he was guided, like Bose, by the fact that the new method gave the right answer. But after Einstein's second paper using Bose's method in which Einstein predicted the Bose-Einstein condensate (\"pictured left\"), he started to realize just how radical it was, and he compared it to wave/particle duality, saying that some particles didn't behave exactly like particles. Bose had already submitted his article to the British Journal \"Philosophical Magazine\", which rejected it before he sent it to Einstein. It is not known why it was rejected.\nEinstein adopted the idea and extended it to atoms. This led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which became known as Bose\u2013Einstein condensate, a dense collection of bosons (which are particles with integer spin, named after Bose), which was demonstrated to exist by experiment in 1995.\nDhaka.\nAfter his stay in Europe, Bose returned to Dhaka in 1926. He did not have a doctorate, and so ordinarily, under the prevailing regulations, he would not be qualified for the post of Professor he applied for, but Einstein recommended him. He was then made Head of the Department of Physics at Dhaka University. He continued guiding and teaching at Dhaka University and was the Dean of the Faculty of Science there until 1945.\nBose designed equipment himself for an X-ray crystallography laboratory. He set up laboratories and libraries to make the department a center of research in X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, magnetic properties of matter, optical spectroscopy, wireless, and unified field theories. He also published an equation of state for real gases with Meghnad Saha.\nCalcutta.\nWhen the partition of India became imminent (1947), he returned to Calcutta (now known as Kolkata) and taught there until 1956. He insisted every student design their own equipment using local materials and local technicians. He was made professor emeritus on his retirement. He then became Vice-Chancellor of Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan. He returned to the University of Calcutta to continue research in nuclear physics and complete earlier works in organic chemistry. In subsequent years, he worked in applied research such as extraction of helium in hot springs of Bakreshwar.\nOther fields.\nApart from physics, he did research in biotechnology and literature (Bengali and English). He made studies in chemistry, geology, zoology, anthropology, engineering and other sciences. Being Bengali, he devoted significant time to promoting Bengali as a teaching language, translating scientific papers into it, and promoting the development of the region.\nHonours.\nIn 1937, Rabindranath Tagore dedicated his only book on science, \"Visva\u2013Parichay\", to Satyendra Nath Bose. Bose was honoured with the title Padma Vibhushan by the Indian Government in 1954. In 1959, he was appointed as the National Professor, the highest honour in the country for a scholar, a position he held for 15 years. In 1986, the S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences was established by an act of Parliament, Government of India, in Salt Lake, Calcutta.\nBose became an adviser to the then newly formed Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. He was the president of the Indian Physical Society and the National Institute of Science. He was elected general president of the Indian Science Congress. He was the vice president and then the president of Indian Statistical Institute. In 1958, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was nominated as member of Rajya Sabha.\nPartha Ghose has stated that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Bose's work stood at the transition between the 'old quantum theory' of Planck, Bohr and Einstein and the new quantum mechanics of Schr\u00f6dinger, Heisenberg, Born, Dirac and others.\nNobel Prize nomination.\nBose was nominated by K. Banerjee (1956), D.S. Kothari (1959), S.N. Bagchi (1962), and A.K. Dutta (1962) for the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his contribution to Bose\u2013Einstein statistics and the unified field theory. Banerjee, head of the Physics Department, University of Allahabad, in a letter of 12 January 1956 wrote to the Nobel Committee as follows: \"(1). He (Bose) made very outstanding contributions to physics by developing the statistics known after his name as Bose statistics. In recent years this statistics is found to be of profound importance in the classifications of fundamental particles and has contributed immensely to the development of nuclear physics. (2). During the period from 1953 to date, he has made a number of highly interesting contributions of far-reaching consequences on the subject of Einstein's Unitary Field Theory.\" Bose's work was evaluated by an expert of the Nobel Committee, Oskar Klein, who deemed his work not worthy of the Nobel Prize.\nLegacy.\nBosons, a class of elementary subatomic particles in particle physics were named by Dirac after Satyendra Nath Bose to commemorate his contributions to science.\nSoviet Nobel laureate Lev Landau kept a list of names of physicists which he ranked on a logarithmic scale of productivity ranging from 1 to 5. Albert Einstein was ranked 0.5. Landau awarded a rank of 1 to Bose along with the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, and others. Landau ranked himself as a 2.5 but later promoted to a 2.\nAlthough seven Nobel Prizes were awarded for research related to S N Bose's concepts of the boson, Bose\u2013Einstein statistics and Bose\u2013Einstein condensate, Bose himself was not awarded the Nobel Prize.\nIn his book \"The Scientific Edge\", physicist Jayant Narlikar observed: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;SN Bose's work on particle statistics (c. 1922), which clarified the behaviour of photons (the particles of light in an enclosure) and opened the door to new ideas on statistics of Microsystems that obey the rules of quantum theory, was one of the top ten achievements of 20th century Indian science and could be considered in the Nobel Prize class.\nWhen Bose himself was once asked that question, he replied, \"I have got all the recognition I deserve.\"\nOne of the main academic buildings of University of Rajshahi, the No 1 science building has been named after him.\nThe 4 June 2022 Google Doodle featured Bose, on the 98th anniversary of his sending his work to Einstein.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She appears in the \"Legends\" continuity as the wife of Luke Skywalker and mother of Ben Skywalker. She has been voiced by Heidi Shannon, Edie Mirman and Kath Soucie in various \"Star Wars\" video games.\nConcept and development.\nHer first appearance was in Timothy Zahn's \"Heir to the Empire\" (1991). Zahn imagined Mara Jade as a strong, complex female character, somebody he thought lacking in the \"Star Wars\" universe. While competent, she is flawed. When the \"Thrawn\" trilogy ended in 1993 with \"The Last Command\", Zahn thought it was the last book for which he would develop the character. Asked to write another novel, he established two goals: \"to end the war between the New Republic and the Empire, and to get Luke Skywalker and Mara together.\" Although Lucasfilm resisted the idea of Luke marrying Mara, they eventually acquiesced.\nIn 2018, Zahn said Lucasfilm gave him some creative control over the character of Mara Jade: any appearance of Mara in new works requires Zahn's approval. Zahn also explained that Lucasfilm Story Group held the authority to prevent him from incorporating Mara back into the canon, so any appearance of the character must be approved by both parties. Zahn said he would only allow her to appear if she plays an important role in the plot, and he would block any kind of cameo appearance. Previously, the character of Grand Admiral Thrawn, another Zahn creation, made the jump from \"Legends\" to canon, albeit with a slightly-reworked story. Subsequently, Zahn said he hoped to find a way to bring Mara into the canon, stating \"If there was a generic, or organic, spot for her to fit into a story... I promise people, I will pitch it to the Lucasfilm story group, and then, it's their decision whether to allow it or not.\"\nCompared to Princess Leia, Zahn said, \"Mara has a sharper and sarcastic manner, and of course, she had to go through the painful realization her service was to an evil cause. But both women are strong without sacrificing their femininity, a balance which I think some authors have trouble writing. Bear in mind, too, Leia was one of the first people in the New Republic who decided Mara could be trusted, which perhaps says something about their understanding of each other.\"\nAppearances.\nMara is introduced as smuggler Talon Karrde's second-in-command in \"Heir to the Empire\". The novel establishes she was previously an \"Emperor's Hand\"\u2014a special agent\u2014for Emperor Palpatine.\nSeveral stories depict Jade before the events in \"Heir to the Empire\", showing her training under Palpatine and executing his orders. The \"Thrawn\" trilogy depicts Mara's first confrontation with Luke Skywalker, whom she swears to kill to avenge Palpatine's death (Palpatine sent her a faked image of Luke and Vader turning on him together, rather than Vader killing Palpatine, and the demand for Luke's death motivated by Palpatine's desire for revenge against his father rather than Luke's actions).\nThis was re-inforced by the Emperor's final telepathic command to assassinate Luke, plaguing her thoughts since his death; upon learning this situation, Luke vowed to help Mara break Palpatine's hold on her, regardless of the threat she posed to Luke. Toward the end of the trilogy, she turns against the Empire, and resolves her anger toward Luke, silences the command without killing him and instead killing Luke's \"clone\"\u2014Luuke Skywalker\u2014made by the Dark Jedi Joruus C'baoth to challenge Luke.\nIn doing so, she took Anakin's lightsaber\u2014recovered after the initial duel between Luke and Darth Vader\u2014and used it to stab C'baoth. At the close of \"The Last Command\", Luke gives her Anakin's lightsaber because he believed she earned it and because he truly wanted her to have it. Over the course of the series, Luke recognizes in Mara an underdeveloped affinity for the Force; and although she initially resists Jedi training, she eventually becomes a Jedi Master.\nLuke and Mara develop a strong bond in Zahn's \"The Hand of Thrawn\" duology; he proposes marriage, and the two wed in Michael A. Stackpole's graphic novel \"Union\".

Originally published anonymously, it went on to become a bestseller, and won both the Hawthornden Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.\nBackground.\nPrior to its publication, Siegfried Sassoon's reputation rested entirely on his poetry, mostly written during and about World War I. Only ten years after the war ended, after some experience of journalism, did he feel ready to branch out into prose. So uncertain was he of the wisdom of this move that he elected to publish \"Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man\" anonymously. It is a depiction of his early years presented in the form of an autobiographical novel, with false names being given to the central characters, including Sassoon himself, who appears as \"George Sherston\". Sassoon was motivated to write the work by a war incident, when a fox was loose in the trenches and one of his friends shot and killed it. However, the book draws heavily on his pre-war life, with riding and hunting being among the favourite pastimes of the author.\nMuch of the material for the novel came from Sassoon's own diaries. He said he was inspired by the work of Marcel Proust, saying, \"A few pages of Proust have made me wonder whether insignificant episodes aren't the most significant\". In particular, his relationship with \"Aunt Evelyn\", a fictionalised representation of his mother Theresa, is revealed as having been a major influence in his upbringing.\nPlot.\nThe story is a series of episodes in the youth of George Sherston, ranging from his first attempts to learn to ride to his experiences in winning point-to-point races. The title is somewhat misleading, as the book is mainly concerned with a series of landmark events in Sherston/Sassoon's childhood and youth, and his encounters with various comic characters. \"The Flower-Show Match\", an account of an annual village cricket match \u2013 an important fixture for those involved \u2013 in which young Sherston plays a significant part, was later published separately by Faber as a self-contained story. The book as a whole is a frequently humorous work, in which fox-hunting, one of Sassoon's major interests, comes to represent the young man's innocent frame of mind in the years before war broke out. The book ends with his enlistment in a local regiment, the Sussex Yeomanry, and his subsequent transfer, with a commission, to the Flintshire Fusiliers, a battalion of the Royal Welsh which was sent to France. The story is continued in two sequels: \"Memoirs of an Infantry Officer\" and \"Sherston's Progress\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

October 22], 1734\u00a0\u2013 September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer and frontiersman whose exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States. He became famous for his exploration and settlement of Kentucky, which was then beyond the western borders of the Thirteen Colonies. In 1775, Boone founded the Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap and into Kentucky, in the face of resistance from Native Americans. He founded Boonesborough, one of the first English-speaking settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains. By the end of the 18th century, more than 200,000 people had entered Kentucky by following the route marked by Boone.\nHe served as a militia officer during the Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), which in Kentucky was fought primarily between American settlers and British-allied Indians. In 1778, Boone was captured by the Shawnee and was, according to legend, adopted by the Shawnee Chief and given the name \"Sheltowee\", or Big Turtle. After months of living with the Shawnee, Boone escaped. He was elected to the first of his three terms in the Virginia General Assembly during the war and fought in the Battle of Blue Licks in 1782, one of the last battles of the American Revolution. He worked as a surveyor and merchant after the war, but went deep into debt as a Kentucky land speculator. He resettled in Missouri in 1799, where he spent most of the last two decades of his life, frustrated with legal problems resulting from his land claims.\nBoone remains a legendary, if imperfectly remembered, figure in American history. He was celebrated in his own lifetime, especially after an account of his adventures was published in 1784, making him famous in America and Europe. After his death, he became the subject of many heroic tall tales and works of fiction. His adventures\u2014real and mythical\u2014helped create the archetypal frontier hero of American folklore. In American popular culture, Boone is remembered as one of the foremost early frontiersmen, even though mythology often overshadows the historical details of his life.\nEarly life.\nBoone was born on October 22, 1734 (\"New Style\" November 2), the sixth of eleven children in a family of Quakers. His father, Squire Boone, immigrated to colonial Pennsylvania from the small town of Bradninch in the county of Devon, England, sometime around 1712. Squire, a weaver and blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan, whose family were Quakers from Wales. In 1731, the Boones built a one-room log cabin in the Oley Valley in what is now Berks County, Pennsylvania, near present-day Reading, where Daniel was born.\nBoone spent his early years on the Pennsylvania frontier, often interacting with Native Americans. Boone learned to hunt from local settlers and Native Americans; by the age of fifteen, he had a reputation as one of the region's best hunters. Many stories about Boone emphasize his hunting skills. In one tale, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the panther through the heart just as it leaped at him. The story may be a folktale, one of many that became part of Boone's popular image.\nIn Boone's youth, his family became a source of controversy in the local Quaker community. In 1742, Boone's parents were compelled to publicly apologize after their eldest child Sarah married a \"worldling\", or non-Quaker, while she was visibly pregnant. When Boone's oldest brother Israel also married a \"worldling\" in 1747, Squire Boone stood by his son and was therefore expelled from the Quakers, although his wife continued to attend monthly meetings with her children. Perhaps as a result of this controversy, in 1750 Squire sold his land and moved the family to North Carolina. Daniel Boone did not attend church again, although he always considered himself a Christian and had all of his children baptized. The Boones eventually settled on the Yadkin River, in what is now Davie County, North Carolina, about two miles (3\u00a0km) west of Mocksville.\nBoone received little formal education, since he preferred to spend his time hunting, apparently with his parents' blessing. According to a family tradition, when a schoolteacher expressed concern over Boone's education, Boone's father said, \"Let the girls do the spelling and Dan will do the shooting.\" Boone was tutored by family members, though his spelling remained unorthodox. Historian John Mack Faragher cautions that the folk image of Boone as semiliterate is misleading, arguing that Boone \"acquired a level of literacy that was the equal of most men of his times.\" Boone regularly took reading material with him on his hunting expeditions\u2014the Bible and \"Gulliver's Travels\" were favorites. He was often the only literate person in groups of frontiersmen, and would sometimes entertain his hunting companions by reading to them around the campfire.\nHunter, husband, and soldier.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI can't say as ever I was lost, but I was bewildered once for three days.\n\u2014Daniel Boone\nThe French and Indian War (1754\u20131763) broke out between the French and the British, along with their respective Indian allies, and Boone joined a North Carolina militia company as a teamster and blacksmith. In 1755, his unit accompanied General Edward Braddock's attempt to drive the French out of the Ohio Country, which ended in disaster at the Battle of the Monongahela. Boone, in the rear with the wagons, took no part in the battle, and fled with the retreating soldiers. He returned home after the defeat, and married Rebecca Bryan, a neighbor in the Yadkin Valley, on August 14, 1756. The couple initially lived in a cabin on his father's farm, and eventually had ten children, in addition to raising eight children of deceased relatives.\nIn 1758, conflict erupted between British colonists and the Cherokees, their former allies in the French and Indian War. After the Yadkin Valley was raided by Cherokees, the Boones and many other families fled north to Culpeper County, Virginia. Boone saw action as a member of the North Carolina militia during this \"Cherokee Uprising\", periodically serving under Captain Hugh Waddell on the North Carolina frontier until 1760.\nBoone supported his growing family in these years as a market hunter and trapper, collecting pelts for the fur trade. Almost every autumn, despite the unrest on the frontier, he would go on \"long hunts\", extended expeditions into the wilderness lasting weeks or months. Boone went alone or with a small group of men, accumulating hundreds of deer skins in the autumn, and trapping beaver and otter over the winter. When the long hunters returned in the spring, they sold their take to commercial fur traders. On their journeys, frontiersmen often carved messages on trees or wrote their names on cave walls, and Boone's name or initials have been found in many places. A tree in Washington County, Tennessee reads \"D. Boon Cilled a. Bar on tree in the year 1760\". A similar carving is preserved in the museum of the Filson Historical Society in Louisville, Kentucky which reads \"D. Boon Kilt a Bar, 1803.\" The inscriptions may be genuine, or part of a long tradition of phony Boone relics.\nAccording to a popular story, Boone returned home after a long absence to find that Rebecca had given birth to a daughter. Rebecca confessed that she had thought that Daniel was dead, and that his brother had fathered the child. Boone did not blame Rebecca, and raised the girl as his own child. Boone's early biographers knew the story but did not publish it. Modern biographers regard the tale as possibly folklore, since the identity of the brother and the daughter vary in different versions of the tale.\nIn the mid-1760s, Boone began to look for a new place to settle. The population was growing in the Yadkin Valley, which reduced the amount of game available for hunting. He had difficulty making ends meet, and was often taken to court for nonpayment of debts. He sold what land he owned to pay off creditors. After his father's death in 1765, Boone traveled with a group of men to Florida, which had become British territory after the end of the war, to look into the possibility of settling there. According to a family story, he purchased land in Pensacola, but Rebecca refused to move so far away from friends and family. The Boones instead moved to a more remote area of the Yadkin Valley, and he began to hunt westward into the Blue Ridge Mountains.\nInto Kentucky.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was the first of May, in the year 1769, that I resigned my domestic happiness for a time, and left my family ... to wander through the wilderness of America, in quest of the country of Kentucky.\u2014\u200a\nYears before entering Kentucky, Boone had heard about the region's fertile land and abundant game. In 1767, Boone and his brother Squire first crossed into what became the state of Kentucky, but they failed to reach the rich hunting grounds. In May 1769, Boone set out again with a party of five others\u2014including John Findley, who first told Boone of the Cumberland Gap\u2014on a two-year hunting and trapping expedition. His first sighting of the Bluegrass region from atop Pilot Knob became \"an icon of American history\", and was the frequent subject of paintings.\nOn December 22, 1769, Boone and his brother-in-law and fellow longhunter John Stewart were captured by a party of Shawnee, who confiscated all of their skins and told them to leave and never return. The Shawnee had not signed the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, in which the Iroquois had ceded their claim to Kentucky to the British. The Shawnee regarded Kentucky as their hunting ground; they considered American hunters there to be poachers. Boone, undeterred, continued hunting and exploring in Kentucky. On one occasion, he shot a man to avoid capture, which historian John Mack Faragher says \"was one of the few Indians that Boone acknowledged killing.\" Boone returned to North Carolina in 1771, but came back to hunt in Kentucky in the autumn 1772.\nIn 1773, Boone packed up his family and, with his brother Squire and a group of about 50 others, began the first attempt by British colonists to establish a settlement. Boone was still an obscure figure at the time; the most prominent member of the expedition was William Russell, a well-known Virginian and future brother-in-law of Patrick Henry. Another member of this expedition was Boone's friend and fellow long-hunter, Michael Stoner.\nIncluded in this group were an unknown number of enslaved Blacks, including Charles and Adam. On October 9, Boone's oldest son, James, several Whites and Charles and Adam left the main party to seek provisions in a nearby settlement. They were attacked by a band of Delawares, Shawnee, and Cherokees. Following the Fort Stanwix treaty, American Indians in the region had been debating what to do about the influx of settlers. This group had decided, in the words of Faragher, \"to send a message of their opposition to settlement\". James Boone and William Russell's son, Henry, were tortured and killed. Charles was captured. Adam witnessed the horror concealed in riverbank driftwood. After wandering in the woods for 11 days, Adam located the group and informed Boone of the circumstances of their deaths. Charles's body was found by the pioneers 40 miles from the abduction site, dead from a blow to the head. The brutality of the killings sent shockwaves along the frontier, and Boone's party abandoned their expedition.\nThe attack was one of the first events in what became known as Dunmore's War, a struggle between Virginia and American Indians for control of what is now West Virginia and Kentucky. In the summer of 1774, Boone traveled with a companion to Kentucky to notify surveyors there of the outbreak of war. They journeyed more than in two months to warn those who had not already fled the region. Upon his return to Virginia, Boone helped defend colonial settlements along the Clinch River, earning a promotion to captain in the militia, as well as acclaim from fellow citizens. After the brief war, which ended soon after Virginia's victory in the Battle of Point Pleasant in October 1774, the Shawnee relinquished their claims to Kentucky.\nFollowing Dunmore's War, Richard Henderson, a prominent judge from North Carolina, hired Boone to help establish a colony to be called Transylvania. Boone traveled to several Cherokee towns and invited them to a meeting, held at Sycamore Shoals in March 1775, where Henderson purchased the Cherokee claim to Kentucky.\nBoone then blazed \"Boone's Trace\", later known as the Wilderness Road, through the Cumberland Gap and into central Kentucky. Sam, an enslaved Black \"body servant\", and other enslaved laborers were among this group of settlers. When this group camped near the location of present-day Richmond, Kentucky, Indians attacked, killing Sam and his owner. After driving off the attackers, the party buried the two men side by side.\nBoone founded Boonesborough along the Kentucky River; other settlements, notably Harrodsburg, were also established at this time. Despite occasional Indian attacks, Boone brought his family and other settlers to Boonesborough on September 8, 1775.\nAmerican Revolution.\nAmerican Indians who were unhappy about the loss of Kentucky by treaties saw the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783) as a chance to drive out the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, Boone and his family were among the fewer than 200 colonists who remained, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan's Station.\nOn July 14, 1776, Boone's daughter Jemima and two other girls were captured outside Boonesborough by an Indian war party, who carried the girls north toward the Shawnee towns in the Ohio country. Boone and a group of men from Boonesborough set out in pursuit, finally catching up with them two days later. Boone and his men ambushed the Indians, rescuing the girls and driving off their captors. The incident became the most celebrated event of Boone's life. James Fenimore Cooper created a version of this episode in his classic novel \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1826).\nIn 1777, Henry Hamilton, British Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, began to recruit American Indian war parties to raid the Kentucky settlements. That same year in March, the newly formed militia of Kentucky County, Virginia, mustered in Boonesborough, whose population included ten to 15 enslaved people. On April 24, 1778, the British-allied Shawnee led by Chief Blackfish mounted the siege of Boonesborough. Armed enslaved men fought alongside their owners at the fort's walls. After going beyond the fort walls to engage the attackers, London, one of the enslaved, was killed.\nBoone was shot in the ankle while outside the fort. Amid a flurry of bullets, he was carried back inside by Simon Kenton, a recent arrival at Boonesborough. Kenton became Boone's close friend, as well as a legendary frontiersman in his own right.\nCapture and court-martial.\nWhile Boone recovered, the Shawnee kept up their attacks outside Boonesborough, killing cattle and destroying crops. With food running low, the settlers needed salt to preserve what meat they had, so in January 1778, Boone led a party of 30 men to the salt springs on the Licking River. On February 7, when Boone was hunting for meat for the expedition, he was captured by Blackfish's warriors. Because Boone's party was greatly outnumbered, Boone returned to camp the next day with Blackfish and persuaded his men to surrender rather than put up a fight.\nBlackfish intended to move on to Boonesborough and capture it, but Boone argued the women and children would not survive a winter trek as prisoners back to the Shawnee villages. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly some of his men concluded he had switched sides, an impression that led to his court-martial (see below). Many of the Shawnee wanted to execute the prisoners in retaliation for the recent murder of Shawnee Chief Cornstalk by Virginia militiamen. Because Shawnee chiefs led by seeking consensus, Blackfish held a council. After an impassioned speech by Boone, the warriors voted to spare the prisoners. Although Boone had saved his men, Blackfish pointed out that Boone had not included himself in the agreement, so Boone was forced to run the gauntlet through the warriors, which he survived with minor injuries.\nBoone and his men were taken to Blackfish's town of Chillicothe. As was their custom, the Shawnee adopted some of the prisoners to replace fallen warriors. Boone was adopted into a Shawnee family at Chillicothe, perhaps into Blackfish's family, and given the name Sheltowee (Big Turtle). In March 1778, the Shawnee took the unadopted prisoners to Governor Hamilton in Detroit. Blackfish brought Boone along, though he refused Hamilton's offers to release Boone to the British. Hamilton gave Boone gifts, attempting to win his loyalty, while Boone continued to pretend that he intended to surrender Boonesborough. Boone returned with Blackfish to Chillicothe.\nOn June 16, 1778, when he learned Blackfish was about to return to Boonesborough with a large force, Boone eluded his captors and raced home, covering the to Boonesborough in five days on horseback and, after his horse gave out, the majority on foot. Biographer Robert Morgan calls Boone's escape and return \"one of the great legends of frontier history.\"\nUpon Boone's return to Boonesborough, some of the men expressed doubts about Boone's loyalty, since he had apparently lived happily among the Shawnee for months. Boone responded by leading a preemptive raid against the Shawnee across the Ohio River, and then by helping to successfully defend Boonesborough against a 10-day siege led by Blackfish, which began on September 7, 1778. After the siege, Captain Benjamin Logan and Colonel Richard Callaway\u2014both of whom had nephews who were still captives surrendered by Boone\u2014brought charges against Boone for his recent activities. In the court-martial that followed, Boone was found \"not guilty\" and was even promoted after the court heard his testimony. Despite this vindication, Boone was humiliated by the court-martial, and he rarely spoke of it.\nFinal years of the Revolution.\nAfter the trial, Boone returned to North Carolina to take his family back to Kentucky. In the fall of 1779, a large party of emigrants came with him, including the family of Captain Abraham Lincoln, grandfather of the future president. Rather than remain in Boonesborough, Boone founded the nearby settlement of Boone's Station, Kentucky. He began earning money by locating good land for other settlers. Transylvania land claims had been invalidated after Virginia created Kentucky County, so settlers needed to file new land claims with Virginia. In 1780, Boone collected about $20,000 in cash () from various settlers and traveled to Williamsburg to purchase their land warrants. While he was sleeping in a tavern during the trip, the cash was stolen from his room. Some of the settlers forgave Boone the loss; others insisted he repay the stolen money, which took him several years to do.\nIn contrast to the later folk image of Boone as a backwoodsman who had little affinity for \"civilized\" society, Boone was a leading citizen of Kentucky at this time. When Kentucky was divided into three Virginia counties in November 1780, Boone was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Fayette County militia. In April 1781, he was elected as a representative to the Virginia General Assembly, which was held in Richmond. In 1782, he was elected sheriff of Fayette County.\nMeanwhile, the American Revolutionary War continued. Boone joined General George Rogers Clark's invasion of the Ohio country in 1780, fighting in the Battle of Piqua against the Shawnee on August 7. On the way home from the campaign, Boone was hunting with his brother Ned when Shawnee shot and killed Ned, who resembled Daniel. The Shawnee beheaded Ned, believing him to be Daniel, and took the head as evidence that Daniel Boone had finally been slain.\nIn 1781, Boone traveled to Richmond to take his seat in the legislature, but British dragoons under Banastre Tarleton captured Boone and several other legislators near Charlottesville. The British released Boone on parole several days later. During Boone's term, Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781, but the fighting continued in Kentucky. Boone returned to Kentucky and in August 1782 fought in the Battle of Blue Licks, a disastrous defeat for the Kentuckians in which Boone's son Israel was killed. In November 1782, Boone took part in another Clark-led expedition into Ohio, the last major campaign of the war.\nBusinessman and politician.\nAfter the Revolutionary War ended, Boone resettled in Limestone (later renamed Maysville, Kentucky), then a booming Ohio River port. He kept a tavern and worked as a surveyor, horse trader, and land speculator. In 1784, on Boone's 50th birthday, frontier historian John Filson published \"The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke\". The popular book included a chronicle of Boone's adventures, which made Boone a celebrity.\nAs settlers poured into Kentucky, the border war with American Indians north of the Ohio River resumed. In September 1786, Boone took part in a military expedition into the Ohio Country led by Benjamin Logan. Returning to Limestone, Boone housed and fed Shawnee who had been captured during the raid, and helped to negotiate a truce and prisoner exchange. Although the war would not end until the American victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers eight years later, the 1786 expedition was the last time Boone saw military action.\nBoone was initially prosperous in Limestone, owning seven slaves, a relatively large number for Kentucky at the time. In 1786, he purchased a Pennsylvania enslaved woman, age of about 20, for \"Ninety poundes Current Lawfull (sic) money.\" A leader, he served as militia colonel, sheriff, and county coroner. In 1787, he was again elected to the Virginia state assembly, this time from Bourbon County. He began to have financial troubles after engaging in land speculation, buying and selling claims to tens of thousands of acres. These ventures ultimately failed because of the chaotic nature of land speculation in frontier Kentucky and Boone's poor business instincts. Frustrated with the legal hassles that went with land speculation, in 1789 Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). There he operated a trading post and occasionally worked as a surveyor's assistant. That same year, when Virginia created Kanawha County, Boone became the lieutenant colonel of the county militia. In 1791, he was elected to the Virginia legislature for the third time. He contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping, though he was often hampered by rheumatism.\nIn 1795, Boone and his wife moved back to Kentucky, living on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone in what became Nicholas County. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first governor of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued to make their way through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named Boone County in his honor.\nInto Missouri.\nHaving endured legal and financial setbacks, Boone sought to make a fresh start by leaving the United States. In 1799, he moved his extended family to what is now St. Charles County, Missouri, then part of Spanish Louisiana. The Spanish, eager to promote settlement in the sparsely populated region, did not enforce the official requirement that all immigrants be Catholic. The Spanish governor appointed Boone \"syndic\" (judge and jury) and commandant (military leader) of the Femme Osage district. Anecdotes of Boone's tenure as syndic suggest he sought to render fair judgments rather than strictly observe the letter of the law.\nBoone served as syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri became part of the United States following the Louisiana Purchase. He was appointed captain of the local militia. Because Boone's land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on oral agreements, he again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty.\nAlthough Boone reportedly vowed never to return to Kentucky after moving to Missouri, stories (possibly folk tales) were told of him making one last visit to Kentucky to pay off his creditors. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics noted the similarity of his painting to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have accepted the veracity of Audubon's account.Boone spent his final years in Missouri, often in the company of children and grandchildren. He continued to hunt and trap as much as his health and energy levels permitted, intruding upon the territory of the Osage tribe, who once captured him and confiscated his furs. In 1810, at the age of 76, he went with a group on a six-month hunt up the Missouri River, reportedly as far as the Yellowstone River, a round trip of more than 2,000 miles. He began one of his final trapping expeditions in 1815, in the company of a Shawnee and Derry Coburn, a slave who was frequently with Boone in his final years. They reached Fort Osage in 1816, where an officer wrote, \"We have been honored by a visit from Col. Boone... He has taken part in all the wars of America, from Braddock's war to the present hour,\" but \"he prefers the woods, where you see him in the dress of the roughest, poorest hunter.\"\nDeath and burial.\nBoone died on September 26, 1820, at his son Nathan Boone's home on Femme Osage Creek, Missouri.He was buried next to Rebecca, who had died on March 18, 1813. The graves, which were unmarked until the mid-1830s, were near Jemima (Boone) Callaway's home on Tuque Creek, about two miles (3\u00a0km) from present-day Marthasville, Missouri.\nIn 1845, the Boones' remains were disinterred and reburied in a new cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Resentment in Missouri about the disinterment grew over the years, and a legend arose that Boone's remains never left Missouri. According to this story, Boone's tombstone in Missouri had been inadvertently placed over the wrong grave, but no one had corrected the error\u2014and that Boone's Missouri relatives, displeased with the Kentuckians who came to exhume Boone, kept quiet about the mistake and allowed the Kentuckians to dig up the wrong remains. No contemporary evidence indicates this actually happened, but in 1983, a forensic anthropologist examined a crude plaster cast of Boone's skull made before the Kentucky reburial and announced it might be the skull of an African American. Black slaves were also buried at Tuque Creek, so it is possible that the wrong remains were mistakenly removed from the crowded graveyard. Both the Frankfort Cemetery in Kentucky and the Old Bryan Farm graveyard in Missouri claim to have Boone's remains.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Many heroic actions and chivalrous adventures are related of me which exist only in the regions of fancy. With me the world has taken great liberties, and yet I have been but a common man.\u2014\u200a\nDaniel Boone remains an iconic figure in American history, although his status as an early American folk hero and later as a subject of fiction has tended to obscure the actual details of his life. He emerged as a legend in large part because of John Filson's \"The Adventures of Colonel Daniel Boon\", part of his book \"The Discovery, Settlement and present State of Kentucke\". First published in 1784, Filson's book was primarily intended to popularize Kentucky to immigrants. It was translated into French and German, and made Boone famous in America and Europe. Based on interviews with Boone, Filson's book contained a mostly factual account of Boone's adventures from the exploration of Kentucky through the American Revolution, although many have doubted if the florid, philosophical dialogue attributed to Boone was authentic. Often reprinted, Filson's book established Boone as one of the first popular heroes of the United States.\nTimothy Flint also interviewed Boone, and his \"Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky\" (1833) became one of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint embellished Boone's adventures, doing for Boone what Parson Weems did for George Washington. In Flint's book, Boone fought with a bear, escaped from Indians by swinging on vines (as Tarzan would later do), and so on. Although Boone's family thought the book was absurd, Flint greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales were recycled in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.\nSymbol and stereotype.\nThanks to Filson's book, Boone became a symbol of the \"natural man\" who lives a virtuous, uncomplicated existence in the wilderness. This was famously expressed in Lord Byron's epic poem \"Don Juan\" (1822), which devoted a number of stanzas to Boone, including this one:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nByron's poem celebrates Boone as someone who found happiness by turning his back on civilization. In a similar vein, many folk tales depicted Boone as a man who migrated to more remote areas whenever civilization crowded in on him. In a typical anecdote, when asked why he was moving to Missouri, Boone supposedly replied, \"I want more elbow room!\" Boone rejected this interpretation. \"Nothing embitters my old age,\" he said late in life, like \"the circulation of absurd stories that I retire as civilization advances.\"\nExisting simultaneously with the image of Boone as a refugee from society was, paradoxically, the popular portrayal of him as civilization's trailblazer. Boone was celebrated as an agent of Manifest Destiny, a pathfinder who tamed the wilderness, paving the way for the extension of American civilization. In 1852, critic Henry Tuckerman dubbed Boone \"the Columbus of the woods\", comparing Boone's passage through the Cumberland Gap to Christopher Columbus's voyage to the New World. In popular mythology, Boone became the first to explore and settle Kentucky, opening the way for countless others to follow. In fact, other Americans had explored Kentucky before Boone, as debunkers in the 20th century often pointed out, but Boone came to symbolize them all, making him what historian Michael Lofaro called \"the founding father of westward expansion.\"\nIn the 19th century, when Native Americans were being displaced from their lands and confined on reservations, Boone's image was often reshaped into the stereotype of the belligerent, Indian-hating frontiersman which was then popular. In John A. McClung's \"Sketches of Western Adventure\" (1832), for example, Boone was portrayed as longing for the \"thrilling excitement of savage warfare.\" Boone was transformed in the popular imagination into someone who regarded Indians with contempt and had killed scores of the \"savages\". The real Boone disliked bloodshed. According to historian John Bakeless, there is no record that Boone ever scalped Indians, unlike other frontiersmen of the era. Boone once told his son Nathan that he was certain of having killed only one Indian, during the battle at Blue Licks, although on another occasion he said, \"I never killed but three.\" He expressed regret over the killings, saying the Indians \"have always been kinder to me than the whites.\" Even though Boone had lost two sons and a brother in wars with Indians, he respected Indians and was respected by them. In Missouri, Boone went hunting with the Shawnees who had captured and adopted him decades earlier. Some 19th-century writers regarded Boone's sympathy for Indians as a character flaw and altered his words to conform to contemporary attitudes.\nCommemoration and portrayals.\nMany places in the United States are named for Boone, including the Daniel Boone National Forest in Kentucky and the Sheltowee Trace Trail in Tennessee. His name has long been synonymous with the American outdoors. The Boone and Crockett Club is a conservationist organization founded by Theodore Roosevelt in 1887, and the Sons of Daniel Boone was the precursor of the Boy Scouts of America. A half-dollar coin was minted in 1934 to mark the bicentennial of Boone's birth; a commemorative stamp was issued in 1968. In 1961, the US Navy ordered ten ballistic missile submarines to be made at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. One would be named the USS \"Daniel Boone\" (SSBN-629), commissioning on April 23, 1964, and remaining in service until decommissioning in 1994. The submarine's motto \"New Trails to Blaze\" was an homage to Boone's life and his legacy of exploration on the frontier.\nBoone's adventures, real and mythical, formed the basis of the archetypal hero of the American West, popular in 19th-century novels and 20th-century films. The main character of James Fenimore Cooper's \"Leatherstocking Tales\", the first of which was published in 1823, bore striking similarities to Boone; even his name, Nathaniel Bumppo, echoed Daniel Boone's name. As mentioned above, \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1826), Cooper's second \"Leatherstocking\" novel, features a fictionalized version of Boone's rescue of his daughter. After Cooper, other writers developed the Western hero, an iconic figure which began as a variation of Daniel Boone.\nIn the 20th century, Boone was featured in numerous comic strips, radio programs, novels, and films, such as the 1936 film \"Daniel Boone\" as well as the 1956 \"Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer\" shot in Mexico during the \"\" craze of the time. Boone was the subject of a TV series that ran from 1964 to 1970. In the theme song for the series, Boone was described as a \"big man\" in a \"coonskin cap\" and the \"rippin'est, roarin'est, fightin'est man the frontier ever knew!\" This did not describe the real Boone, who was not a big man and did not wear a coonskin cap, which he thought uncouth and uncomfortable. Boone was portrayed this way in the TV series because Fess Parker, the tall actor who played him, was essentially reprising his role as Davy Crockett from an earlier TV series. That Boone could be portrayed the same way as Crockett, another American frontiersman with a very different personality, was another example of how Boone's image was reshaped to suit popular tastes. He was also the subject matter for the song sung by Ed Ames called \"Daniel Boone\". It was released in 1966.\nArthur Guiterman in a four stanza poem recounts the life of Boone, ending with his ghost happily tracking animals, both ancient and mythical, across the Milky Way. \"The Taking of Jemima Boone\" by Matthew Pearl, published in 2021, is an account of the abduction of the daughter of Daniel Boone and, after her rescue by Boone, then shifts to the conflicts between Boone, his political rival Richard Callaway, and Shawnee leader Blackfish, with resulting impacts to the Western theater of the American Revolutionary War.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It last operated on 12 January 1973 and was replaced by an underground shopping centre and a park. The unpopular modernist development was demolished yet again in 2010, and replaced by the Westfield Forum des Halles, a modern shopping mall built largely underground and topped by an undulating 2.5 hectare canopy. The mall sees around 50 million visitors every year, making it the busiest in France as of 2019. It is directly connected to the massive RER and m\u00e9tro transit hub of Ch\u00e2telet\u2013Les Halles, Paris's busiest station.\nHistory.\nThe market of the Little Fields.\nIn the 11th century, a market grew up by a cemetery to the northwest of Paris in an area called the Little Fields (). This was mainly a dry goods and money changing market. A bishop briefly took control of the market before sharing control with Louis VI in 1137. In 1183, Philip Augustus took full control of the market and built two market halls\u2009\u2013\u2009\u2009\u2013\u2009to protect the textiles. He also built walls around the market, including land which had recently been confiscated from exiled Jews that originally belonged to the church. When he then built walls around the city, these embraced the market, which quickly became the city's largest (and, over time, went from being at the edge of the city to at its center). Officially, it would remain a dry goods market for centuries, but food stalls soon grew up around the main buildings and by the 15th century food prices at les Halles were being cited as significant for the whole city.\nThe market would have ups and downs over the coming centuries and was rebuilt more than once. Over time, an increasing number of halls were built explicitly for food, but the dry goods market remained central to the (increasingly cramped) space.\nThe wholesale market.\nThe church of Saint-Eustache was constructed in the 16th century. The circular Halle aux Bl\u00e9s (Corn Exchange), designed by Nicolas Le Camus de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, was built between 1763 and 1769 at the west end of Les Halles. Its circular central court was later covered with a dome, and it was converted into the Bourse de Commerce in 1889.\nIn the 1850s, Victor Baltard designed the famous glass and iron structure which would house les Halles for over a century and became one of the sights of Paris; this would last until the 1970s. Having become entirely a food market, the remodeled market was known as the \"Belly of Paris\", as \u00c9mile Zola called it in his 1873 novel , which is set in the busy marketplace of the 19th century.\nMajor conversion.\nUnable to compete in the new market economy and in need of massive repairs, the colourful ambience once associated with the bustling area of merchant stalls disappeared in 1973, when Les Halles was demolished (fruit, flower and vegetable markets had moved in 1969, and only the butchers at the meat markets remained); the wholesale market was relocated to the suburb of Rungis. Two of the glass and cast iron market pavilions were dismantled and re-erected elsewhere; one in the Paris suburb of Nogent-sur-Marne, the other in Yokohama, Japan, and the rest were destroyed. The site was chosen to host the station Ch\u00e2telet\u2013Les-Halles, the point of convergence of the RER, a new network of express underground railway lines through the city. Three lines leading out of the city to the south, east and west were to be extended and connected in the new underground station. For several years, the site of the markets was an enormous open pit, nicknamed (\"the hole of Les Halles\"), regarded as an eyesore at the foot of the historic church of Saint-Eustache. The construction on Paris's new central railway hub was completed in 1977.\nThe , a partially underground multiple story commercial and shopping centre, designed by Claude Vasconi and Georges Pencreac'h, opened at the east end of the site on 4 September 1979 in the presence of the Mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac. A public garden covering opened in 1986. Many of the surrounding streets were pedestrianized.\nThe demolition of Baltard's market hall structure and the design of the spaces that replaced it proved highly controversial over the subsequent decades. The critic Oliver Wainwright called the razing \"one of the worst acts of urban vandalism of the century\", and that the place became a \"national embarrassment\" with the park \"a magnet for drug dealing\". Historian Donato Severo called the events \"the most violent act ever committed against the heritage of Paris\", with architect Lloyd Alter adding that the replacement complex was \"nearly universally reviled for its mean spirit\".\n21st century redesign.\nAgainst that background, in 2002 Mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb announced that the City of Paris would begin public consultations regarding the remodeling of the area, calling Les Halles \"a soulless, architecturally bombastic concrete jungle\".\nA design competition for the Forum and gardens was held, with entries from Jean Nouvel, Winy Maas, David Mangin, and Rem Koolhaas. Mangin's design for the gardens, which proposed replacing the landscaped mounds and paths of the 1980s design with a simplified pattern of east\u2013west pedestrian promenades and a large central lawn, was selected. The plan also included extending the pedestrianized area further east to include all the streets bordering the gardens. Another competition was held for the redesign of the Forum. Ten teams submitted plans, and the proposal by Patrick Berger and Jacques Anziutti was selected in 2007. Their design included a large undulating glass canopy covering the redesigned Forum. STIF and RATP began plans for the remodeling of the Ch\u00e2telet-Les-Halles station in 2007, and the following year Berger and Anziutti were awarded a contract for redesign of the station.\nThe station redesign included new entrances on Rue Berger, Rue Rambuteau, and Place Marguerite de Navarre, an expanded RER concourse, and improved pedestrian circulation. Construction began in 2010 on the gardens, Forum, and station. The canopy over the Forum was inaugurated in April 2016; construction finished in 2018.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It comprises 30 teams, with 27 in the United States and 3 in Canada, and is sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation. MLS is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The league is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.\nThe predecessor of MLS was the North American Soccer League (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984. MLS was founded in 1993 as part of the United States' successful bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The inaugural season took place in 1996 with ten teams. MLS experienced financial and operational struggles in its first few years, losing millions of dollars and folding two teams in 2002. Since then, developments such as the proliferation of soccer-specific stadiums around the league, the implementation of the Designated Player Rule allowing teams to sign star players such as David Beckham and Lionel Messi, and national TV contracts have made MLS profitable. \nIn 2022, with an average attendance of over 21,000 per match, MLS had the fourth-highest average attendance of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, behind the National Football League (NFL) with over 69,000 fans per game, Major League Baseball (MLB) with over 26,000 fans per game, and the Canadian Football League (CFL) with over 21,700 fans per game. With an average attendance of approximately 23,200 per match in 2024, MLS surpassed the CFL's 22,800 and rose to be the third-highest average attendance of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.\nThe MLS regular season typically starts in late February and runs through mid-October, with each team playing 34 matches; the team with the best record is awarded the Supporters' Shield. Eighteen teams compete in the postseason MLS Cup playoffs in late October and November, culminating in the league's championship match, the MLS Cup. Instead of operating as an association of independently owned clubs, MLS is a single entity in which each team is owned by the league and individually operated by the league's investors. The league has a fixed membership like most sports leagues in the United States and Canada and Mexico's Liga MX which makes it one of the few soccer leagues that does not use a promotion and relegation process. \nThe LA Galaxy have the most MLS Cups, with six. They are tied with D.C. United for most Supporters' Shields, with four each. The Philadelphia Union are the current Supporters' Shield holders, having won their second title in 2025.\nHistory.\nMajor League Soccer is the most recent of a series of men's premier professional national soccer leagues established in the United States and Canada. The predecessor of MLS was the North American Soccer League (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984. The United States did not have a truly national top-flight league with FIFA-sanctioning until the creation of the NASL. The first league to have U.S. and Canadian professional clubs, the NASL struggled until the mid-1970s when the New York Cosmos, the league's most prominent team, signed a number of the world's best players including Pel\u00e9 and Franz Beckenbauer. Pel\u00e9's arrival attracted other well-known international stars to the league including Johan Cruyff, Gerd M\u00fcller, Eus\u00e9bio, Bobby Moore, and George Best. Despite dramatic increases in attendance (with some matches drawing over 70,000 fans such as Soccer Bowl '78, the highest attendance to date for any club soccer championship in the United States), factors such as over-expansion, the economic recession of the early 1980s, and disputes with the players union ultimately led to the collapse of the NASL following the 1984 season, leaving the United States without a top-level soccer league until MLS.\nEstablishment and shootout era.\nIn 1988, in exchange for FIFA awarding the right to host the 1994 World Cup, U.S. Soccer promised to establish a Division 1 professional soccer league. In 1993, U.S. Soccer selected Major League Professional Soccer (the precursor to MLS) as the exclusive Division 1 professional soccer league. Major League Soccer was officially formed in February 1995 as a limited liability company.\nTab Ramos was the first player signed by MLS, on January 3, 1995, and was assigned to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars. MLS began play in 1996 with ten teams. The first match was held on April 6, 1996, as the San Jose Clash defeated D.C. United in front of 31,000 fans at Spartan Stadium in San Jose in a match broadcast on ESPN. The league had generated some buzz by managing to lure some marquee players from the 1994 World Cup to play in MLS\u2014including U.S. stars such as Alexi Lalas, Tony Meola and Eric Wynalda, and foreign players such as Mexico's Jorge Campos and Colombia's Carlos Valderrama.\nD.C. United won the MLS Cup in three of the league's first four seasons. The league added its first two expansion teams in 1998\u2014the Miami Fusion and the Chicago Fire; the Chicago Fire won its first title in its inaugural season.\nAfter its first season, MLS suffered from a decline in attendance. The league's low attendance was all the more apparent in light of the fact that eight of the original ten teams played in large American football stadiums.\nOne aspect that had alienated fans was that MLS experimented with rules deviations in its early years in an attempt to \"Americanize\" the sport. The league implemented the use of shootouts to resolve draws. MLS also used a countdown clock and halves ended when the clock reached 0:00. The league realized that the rule changes had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to draw new American sports fans, and the shootout and countdown clock were eliminated after the 1999 season.\nThe league's quality was cast into doubt when the U.S. men's national team, which was made up largely of MLS players, finished in last place out of the 32 teams at the 1998 World Cup.\nThe league lost an estimated $250\u00a0million during its first five years, and more than $350\u00a0million between its founding and 2004.\nThe league's financial problems led to Commissioner Doug Logan being replaced by Don Garber, a former NFL executive, in August 1999. Following decreased attendance and increased losses by late 2001, league officials planned to fold but were able to secure new financing from owners Lamar Hunt, Philip Anschutz, and the Kraft family to take on more teams. MLS announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the Tampa Bay Mutiny and Miami Fusion, leaving the league with ten teams.\nDespite the financial problems, though, MLS did have some accomplishments that would set the stage for its resurgence. Columbus Crew Stadium, now known as Historic Crew Stadium, was built in 1999, becoming MLS' first soccer-specific stadium. This began a trend among MLS teams to construct their own venues instead of leasing American football stadiums, where they would not be able to generate revenue from other events. In 2000, the league won an antitrust lawsuit, \"Fraser v. Major League Soccer\", that the players had filed in 1996. The court ruled that MLS' policy of centrally contracting players and limiting player salaries through a salary cap and other restrictions were a legal method for the league to maintain solvency and competitive parity since MLS was a single entity and therefore incapable of conspiring with itself.\nResurgence.\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup, in which the United States made the quarterfinals, coincided with a resurgence in American soccer and MLS, with MLS Cup 2002 drawing 61,316 spectators to Gillette Stadium, the largest attendance in an MLS Cup final until 2018. MLS limited teams to three substitutions per game in 2003, and adopted International Football Association Board (IFAB) rules in 2005.\nMLS underwent a transition in the years leading up to the 2006 World Cup. After marketing itself on the talents of American players, the league lost some of its homegrown stars to prominent European leagues. For example, Tim Howard was transferred to Manchester United for $4 million in one of the most lucrative contract deals in league history. Many more American players did make an impact in MLS. In 2005, Jason Kreis became the first player to score 100 career MLS goals.\nThe league's financial stabilization plan included teams moving out of large American football stadiums and into soccer-specific stadiums. From 2003 to 2008, the league oversaw the construction of six additional soccer-specific stadiums, largely funded by owners such as Lamar Hunt and Phil Anschutz, so that by the end of 2008, a majority of teams were now in soccer-specific stadiums.\nIt was also in this era that MLS expanded for the first time since 1998. Real Salt Lake and Chivas USA began play in 2005, with Chivas USA becoming the second club in Los Angeles. By 2006 the San Jose Earthquakes owners, players and a few coaches moved to Texas to become the expansion Houston Dynamo, after failing to build a stadium in San Jose. The Dynamo became an expansion team, leaving their history behind for a new San Jose ownership group that formed in 2007.\nArrival of Designated Players.\nIn 2007, the league expanded beyond the United States' borders into Canada with the Toronto FC expansion team. Major League Soccer took steps to further raise the level of play by adopting the Designated Player Rule, which helped bring international stars into the league.\nThe 2007 season witnessed the MLS debut of David Beckham. Beckham's signing had been seen as a coup for American soccer, and was made possible by the Designated Player Rule. Players such as Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco (Chicago Fire) and Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel (New York Red Bulls), are some of the first Designated Players who made major contributions to their clubs.\nThe departures of Clint Dempsey and Jozy Altidore, coupled with the return of former U.S. national team stars Claudio Reyna and Brian McBride, highlighted the exchange of top prospects to Europe for experienced veterans to MLS.\nBy 2008, San Jose had returned to the league under new ownership, and in 2009, the expansion side Seattle Sounders FC began play in MLS. The Sounders set a new average attendance record for the league, with 30,943 spectators per match, and were the first expansion team to qualify for the playoffs since 1998. The 2010 season ushered in an expansion franchise in the Philadelphia Union and their new PPL Park stadium (now known as Subaru Park). The 2010 season also brought the opening of the New York Red Bulls' soccer-specific stadium, Red Bull Arena, and the debut of French striker Thierry Henry.\nThe 2011 season brought further expansion with the addition of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the second Canadian MLS franchise, and the Portland Timbers. Real Salt Lake reached the finals of the 2010\u201311 CONCACAF Champions League.\nDuring the 2011 season, the Galaxy signed another international star in Republic of Ireland all-time leading goalscorer Robbie Keane. MLS drew an average attendance of 17,872 in 2011, higher than the average attendances of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL). In 2012, the Montreal Impact became the league's 19th franchise and the third in Canada, and made their home debut in front of a crowd of 58,912, while the New York Red Bulls added Australian all-time leading goalscorer Tim Cahill.\nExpansion of the league.\nIn 2012, with an average attendance of over 18,000 per game, MLS had the third highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S. after the NFL and MLB, and was the seventh highest attended professional soccer league worldwide as of 2013[ [update]].\nIn 2013, MLS introduced New York City FC as its 20th team, and Orlando City Soccer Club as its 21st team, both of which would begin playing in 2015.\nIn 2013, the league implemented its \"Core Players\" initiative, allowing teams to retain key players using retention funds instead of losing the players to foreign leagues. Among the first high-profile players re-signed in 2013 using retention funds were U.S. national team regulars Graham Zusi and Matt Besler.\nBeginning in summer of 2013 and continuing in the run up to the 2014 World Cup, MLS began signing U.S. stars based abroad, including Clint Dempsey, Jermaine Jones, and Michael Bradley from Europe; and DaMarcus Beasley from Mexico's Liga MX. By the 2014 season, 15 of the 19 MLS head coaches had previously played in MLS. By 2013, the league's popularity had increased to the point where MLS was as popular as MLB among 12- to 17-year-olds, as reported by the 2013 Luker on Trends ESPN poll, having jumped in popularity since the 2010 World Cup.\nIn 2014, the league announced Atlanta United FC as the 22nd team to start playing in 2017. Even though New York City FC and Orlando City were not set to begin play until 2015, each team made headlines during the summer 2014 transfer window by announcing their first Designated Players\u2014Spain's leading scorer David Villa and Chelsea's leading scorer Frank Lampard to New York, and Ballon d'Or winner Kak\u00e1 to Orlando. The 2014 World Cup featured 21 MLS players on World Cup rosters and a record 11 MLS players playing for foreign teams\u2014including players from traditional powerhouses Brazil (J\u00falio C\u00e9sar) and Spain (David Villa); in the U.S. v. Germany match the U.S. fielded a team with seven MLS starters.\nOn September 18, 2014, MLS unveiled their new logo as part of a branding initiative. In addition to the new crest logo, MLS teams display versions in their own colors on their jerseys. Chivas USA folded following the 2014 season, while New York City FC and Orlando City SC joined the league in 2015. Sporting Kansas City and the Houston Dynamo moved from the Eastern Conference to the Western Conference in 2015 to make two 10-team conferences.\nIn early 2015, the league announced that two teams\u2014Los Angeles FC and Minnesota United FC\u2014would join MLS in either 2017 or 2018. The 20th season of MLS saw the arrivals of several players who have starred at the highest levels of European club soccer and in international soccer: Giovanni dos Santos, Kak\u00e1, Andrea Pirlo, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Didier Drogba, David Villa, and Sebastian Giovinco. MLS confirmed in August 2016 that Minnesota United would begin play in 2017 along with Atlanta United FC.\nIn April 2016, the league's commissioner Don Garber reiterated the intention of the league to expand to 28 teams, with the next round of expansion \"likely happening in 2020\". In December 2016, he updated the expansion plans stating that the league will look to approve the 25th and 26th teams in 2017 and to start play in 2020. In January 2017, the league received bids from 12 ownership groups.\nIn July 2017, it was reported that Major League Soccer had rejected an offer by MP &amp; Silva to acquire all television rights to the league following the conclusion of its current contracts with Fox, ESPN, and Univision, where MP &amp; Silva insisted that the deal would be conditional on Major League Soccer adopting a promotion and relegation system. The league stated that it rejected the offer due to the exclusive periods that the current rightsholders have to negotiate extensions to their contracts. Additionally, media noted that Major League Soccer has long-opposed the adoption of promotion and relegation, continuing to utilize the fixed, franchise-based model used in other U.S. sports leagues. Furthermore, MP &amp; Silva founder Riccardo Silva also owned Miami FC of the NASL, which stood to benefit from such a promotion and relegation system.\nIn October 2017, Columbus Crew owner Anthony Precourt announced plans to move the franchise to Austin, Texas by 2019. The announcement spawned a league-wide backlash and legal action against the league by the Ohio state government. On August 15, 2018, the Austin City Council voted to approve an agreement with Precourt to move Crew SC to Austin, and on August 22, 2018, the club's new name, Austin FC, was announced. After negotiations between Precourt and Jimmy Haslam, owner of the Cleveland Browns, were announced, MLS made it clear that Austin would receive an expansion team only after a deal to sell Columbus to a local buyer had completed. The purchase of Crew SC by Haslam's group was finalized in late December 2018, and on January 15, 2019, Austin FC was officially announced as a 2021 MLS entry.\nMLS announced on December 20, 2017, that it would be awarding an expansion franchise to Nashville, Tennessee, to play in a yet-to-be-built 27,000-seat soccer-specific stadium, Nashville Fairgrounds Stadium, and would join MLS in 2020. The management of the Nashville franchise announced in February 2019 that the MLS side would assume the Nashville SC name then in use by the city's USL Championship team.\nOn January 29, 2018, MLS awarded Miami an expansion team, led by David Beckham. Inter Miami CF started MLS play on March 1, 2020, and plan on opening the proposed 25,000-seat stadium sometime in the near future. An expansion team was awarded to Cincinnati, Ohio on May 29, 2018, to the ownership group of USL's FC Cincinnati. The team, which assumed the existing FC Cincinnati name, started MLS play in 2019 and moved to the new 26,000-seat TQL Stadium in 2021.\nThe league planned to expand to 30 teams with the addition of Austin FC in 2021, Charlotte in 2022, and Sacramento and St. Louis in 2023; however, this was reduced to 29 after Sacramento Republic FC's bid was placed on indefinite hold. Commissioner Don Garber has suggested that another round of expansion could lead to 32 teams in MLS.\nThe league suspended its 2020 season on March 12, 2020, after two weeks, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and other U.S.-based sports leagues did the same. The 2020 season resumed in July with the MLS is Back Tournament, a competition in which 24 out of the 26 teams competed at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando for a spot in the CONCACAF Champions League. In September 2020, the league announced the formation of MLS Next, an academy league for MLS academy teams from the under-13 to under-19 level.\nIn 2022, the league signed a $2.5 billion, 10-year deal with Apple Inc. that made Apple TV the primary broadcaster for all MLS matches beginning in 2023. The agreement also included MLS and Leagues Cup matches shared across the streaming service. Subscriptions were provided for free for season ticket holders of clubs and certain matches were made free to all users. The schedule was adjusted as a result of the deal, with start times generally at 7:30\u00a0p.m. local time on Wednesdays and Saturdays rather than staggered across the matchday.\nIn May 2023, the league announced it would expand to 30 teams with the addition of San Diego FC for the 2025 season. The 2024 season broke attendance records, with an average of 23,240 per match and over 11 million total spectators. The presence of Lionel Messi and other star players was credited with contributing to the record crowds, which included several matches moved to larger venues.\nExpansion fees.\nIn 2005, Toronto FC's ownership paid $10 million (about $16 million in 2024) to join the league in 2007; San Jose paid $20 million the next year, and the fee had risen to $30 million when Sounders FC paid the fee in 2007 to join the league in 2009. In 2013, New York City FC agreed to pay a record $100 million expansion fee for the right to join MLS in 2015. This record was surpassed by the ownership groups of FC Cincinnati and Nashville SC, which each paid $150 million to join MLS 2019 and 2020, respectively. Despite being announced in January 2018, Inter Miami CF only paid a $25 million expansion fee due to a clause in part-owner David Beckham's original playing contract signed in 2007. $150 million was paid as an effective entrance fee by a group that bought Columbus Crew in 2018, which led to that team's previous operator receiving rights to Austin FC, which joined MLS in 2021. In 2019, Charlotte FC agreed to a reported $325 million expansion fee. The most recent expansion team, San Diego FC paid a record $500 million fee in 2023.\nCompetition format.\nThe MLS regular season runs from late February to October. Teams are geographically divided into the Eastern and Western Conferences, playing 34 matches in an unbalanced schedule. With 30 teams in 2025, each team plays two matches (home and away) against the other teams within their conference, and six matches against teams from the opposite conference. The 2020 season was the first season in league history in which teams did not play against every other team in the league. At the end of the regular season, the team with the highest point total is awarded the Supporters' Shield and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.\nTeams break for the annual All-Star Game midway through the season, an exhibition match containing the league's best players. The format of the All-Star Game has changed several times since the league's inception; 2020 was the first year in which the MLS All-Stars were planned to play against an all-star team from Mexico's Liga MX, before the event's cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2015, the final matchday of the season has been branded as \"Decision Day\" and has almost all matches played between intra-conference teams kicking off simultaneously during two windows\u2014one for each conference.\nUnlike most major soccer leagues around the world, but similar to other leagues in the Americas, the MLS regular season is followed by a postseason knockout tournament to determine the league champion. As of 2023[ [update]], eighteen teams participate in the MLS Cup playoffs in October and November, which concludes with the MLS Cup championship match in early December. The playoff format includes a pair of single-elimination play-in matches for the two lowest-ranked teams in each conference ahead of a best-of-three round; the round is followed by more single-elimination rounds that lead up to the MLS Cup final.\nThe MLS spring-to-fall schedule results in scheduling conflicts with the FIFA calendar and with summertime international tournaments such as the World Cup and the Gold Cup, causing some players to miss league matches. The schedule also causes issues with transfer windows; some players may be reluctant to sign with an MLS team during the North American midseason window while waiting for more lucrative options to appear during the European offseason, the scheduling of the window limits the number of matches new signings are able to appear in, and MLS teams can lose players in the middle of the season to European transfers, with few options to replace them. The MLS Cup playoffs compete for popularity and media presence with the MLB postseason, the heart of the regular season in American football (including college football and the NFL), as well as the start of the NBA and NHL regular seasons. \nOn November 13, 2025, MLS announced that it will transition to a summer-to-spring schedule closer to European leagues beginning in 2027. The regular season will begin in mid-July, a winter break will take place from mid-December to early or mid-February, and the MLS Cup playoffs will occur in May. MLS stated that moving to this schedule would improve the league's competitiveness, transfer opportunities, and allow the playoffs to have more prominence and be held in warmer weather. Under the new schedule, the MLS Cup playoffs would now compete primarily with the NBA and NHL playoffs, but will still fall within a less-crowded period of North America's professional sports calendar. As part of the transition process, the league will play an abbreviated 2027 season in early 2027, followed by the 2027\u201328 season in July. In addition, MLS will replace its conference-based format with a single table divided into five regional divisions: each team will play home and away matches against each of their divisional opponents, and one match against each team in the other four divisions.\nOther competitions.\nMLS teams also play in other international and domestic competitions. Each season, up to ten MLS teams play in the CONCACAF Champions Cup (CCC) against other clubs from the CONCACAF region. Four MLS teams qualify based on regular-season results from the previous year: the Supporters' Shield champion, the team with the highest point total from the opposite conference, and the next two clubs in the Supporters' Shield rankings. The fifth MLS team to qualify is the reigning MLS Cup champion. An additional U.S.-based MLS team can qualify by winning the U.S. Open Cup. Starting in 2024, the league will send eight teams to participate in the U.S. Open Cup instead of every U.S.-based club, with MLS Next Pro teams as representatives for some teams. MLS had announced their intention to remove itself from the tournament entirely, but reached a compromise with U.S. Soccer to send representatives from clubs that were not participating in the Champions Cup, with the exception of the defending Open Cup champions. The last three teams to qualify are the champion, runner-up, and third-place finisher of the Leagues Cup. Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver compete against other Canadian sides in the Canadian Championship for the one CONCACAF Champions Cup berth allocated to Canada. All three Canadian clubs may also qualify through MLS or the Leagues Cup. If a team qualifies through multiple berths, or they are taken by a Canadian MLS team, the berth is reallocated to the next best team in the overall table. If the U.S. Open Cup winner qualifies through multiple methods, the runner-up fills the slot; should the runner-up qualify, the next best team in the overall table earns the slot. If the Leagues Cup champion wins the MLS Cup, the MLS Cup runner-up qualifies to the round of 16; should a Leagues Cup slot already qualify, MLS is awarded with one additional slot given to the next best non-qualified team in the overall table. Seattle Sounders FC became the first MLS team to win the CONCACAF Champions Cup under the competition's updated format in 2022.\nSince 2018, the reigning MLS Cup champion plays in the Campeones Cup, a Super Cup-style single match against the Campe\u00f3n de Campeones from Liga MX, hosted by the MLS team in September. The inaugural edition saw Tigres UANL defeat Toronto FC at BMO Field in Toronto in 2018.\nAnother inter-league competition with Liga MX, the Leagues Cup, was established in 2019. The 2020 edition of the tournament was originally planned to pair eight MLS clubs against eight Liga MX clubs in a single-elimination tournament hosted in the United States, reviving an inter-league rivalry that previously took place in the now-defunct North American Superliga, before its cancelation. Beginning with the 2023 edition all MLS and Liga MX teams participated in the competition, which functions as the regional cup for the North American zone of CONCACAF. As of the 2025 edition, only 18 MLS clubs take part.\nClubs.\nAtlanta \nCharlotte \nChicago \nCincinnati \nColumbus \nD.C. \nMiami \nMontreal \nNashville \nNew&lt;br&gt;England \nNYCFC \nNYRB \nOrlando \nPhiladelphia \nToronto \nAustin \nColorado \nDallas \nHouston \nKansas City \nLA Galaxy \nLAFC \nMinnesota \nPortland \nSalt&lt;br&gt;Lake \nSan Diego \nSan&lt;br&gt;Jose \nSeattle \nSt. Louis \nVancouver \nThe league's 30 clubs are divided between the Eastern and Western conferences. MLS has regularly expanded since the 2005 season, most recently with the addition of San Diego FC in 2025.\nThe league features numerous rivalry cups that are contested by two or more teams, quite often geographic rivals. Each trophy is awarded to the team with the best record in matches during the regular season involving the participating teams. The concept is comparable to rivalry trophies played for by American college football teams.\nMLS features some of the longest travel distances for a domestic soccer league, with Vancouver Whitecaps FC and Inter Miami CF the furthest apart teams at . During the 2018 season, the team with the shortest distance traveled over the entire regular season schedule was Toronto FC at , while the longest was Vancouver at .\nFormer clubs.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;1\u00a0Not a soccer-specific stadium \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;2\u00a0Standard reduced capacity for soccer; can be increased \nLeague championships.\nAs of the 2025 season, 33 different clubs have competed in the league, with 15 having won at least one MLS Cup, and 17 winning at least one Supporters' Shield. The two trophies have been won by the same club in the same year on eight occasions (two clubs have accomplished the feat twice). Of these teams only one, Toronto FC, has also won its national domestic cup tournament (in Toronto FC's case, the Canadian Championship) in the same year for a domestic treble.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOrganization.\nOwnership.\nMLS operates under a single-entity structure in which teams and player contracts are centrally owned by the league. Each team has an investor-operator that is a shareholder in the league. In order to control costs, MLS shares revenues and holds players contracts instead of players contracting with individual teams. In \"Fraser v. Major League Soccer\", a lawsuit filed in 1996 and decided in 2002, the league won a legal battle with its players in which the court ruled that MLS was a single entity that can lawfully centrally contract for player services. The court also ruled that even absent their collective bargaining agreement, players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.\nHaving multiple clubs operated by a single investor was a necessity in the league's first ten years. At one time, Phil Anschutz's AEG operated six MLS franchises and Lamar Hunt's Hunt Sports operated three franchises. In order to attract additional investors, in 2002 the league announced changes to the operating agreement between the league and its teams to improve team revenues and increase the incentives to be an individual club operator. These changes included granting operators the rights to a certain number of players they develop through their club's academy system each year, sharing the profits of Soccer United Marketing, and being able to sell individual club jersey sponsorships.\nAs MLS appeared to be on the brink of overall profitability in 2006 and developed significant expansion plans, the league announced that it wanted each club to have a distinct operator. The league has attracted new investors that have injected more money into the league. Examples include Red Bull's purchase of the MetroStars from AEG in 2006 for over $100\u00a0million. For the 2014 season, the league assumed control of the former Chivas USA club, which had suffered from mismanagement and poor financial results under its individual operator relationship. The league eventually dissolved the team, in favor of awarding rights to a second soccer club in the Los Angeles area to a new investor group on October 30, 2014.\nThe league now has 30 investor-operators for its 30 current clubs, with no member of any club's investor group having a stake in that of any other club. Since December 2015, when AEG sold its remaining 50% interest in the Houston Dynamo, the former multiple-team operators AEG and Hunt Sports, with the LA Galaxy and FC Dallas respectively, now only control one franchise.\nLeague executives.\nDon Garber has been the commissioner of Major League Soccer since 1999, serving as the league's chief executive. The league's first commissioner was Doug Logan, who served in the role from 1995 to 1999. Mark Abbott, a former MLS business partner, has served as the league's president and Deputy Commissioner since 2006.\nLeague facilities.\nMLS is headquartered at 420 5th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Prior to moving to New York City in 1996, the league's main office was in Los Angeles. MLS Season Pass content is produced through a partnership with IMG at the Studios at WWE in Stamford, Connecticut. The video assistant referee system used by MLS is operated by the American branch of Sportec Solutions at a facility in Arlington, Texas, that opened in 2024.\nPlayer acquisition and salaries.\nIn 2016, the average salary for MLS players was $373,094, lower than the average salaries in England's second-tier EFL Championship ($420,000 in 2015), the Netherlands' Eredivisie ($445,000), or Mexico's Liga MX ($418,000 in 2015). The league's minimum player salary increased in 2017 to $65,000 for most players, and roster players #25\u201330 saw their minimum salary increased to $53,000.\nMLS salaries are limited by a salary cap, which MLS has had in place since the league's inception in 1996. The purpose of the salary cap is to prevent the team's owners from unsustainable spending on player salaries and to prevent a competitive imbalance among teams. The salary cap survived a legal challenge by the players in the \"Fraser v. Major League Soccer\" lawsuit. The 2017 salary cap increased to $3.845 million per team. Each team is allowed up to 30 players on its first team roster. All 30 players are eligible for selection to each 18-player matchday squad during the regular season and playoffs.\nTeams may augment their squads by signing players from other leagues. MLS has two transfer windows\u2014the primary pre-season transfer window lasts three months from mid February until mid May, and the secondary mid season transfer window runs one month from early July to early August. When an MLS club sells one of its players overseas, the club and the league split the transfer revenues, with the club retaining from 33% to 75% depending on the player's status and tenure.\nMLS teams have a limited number of international roster slots that they can use to sign non-domestic players. However, MLS teams often obtain green cards for their non-domestic players in order to qualify them for domestic status and thus free up international roster slots. In 2015, 49% of MLS players were born outside of the U.S. and Canada, with players from 58 countries represented.\nMLS has a set of pool goalkeepers who are signed to a contract with the league and are loaned to teams during emergencies in which they are missing a goalkeeper due to injuries or suspensions. The pool goalkeeper trains with an MLS club or an affiliated team when not assigned to a team; some pool goalkeepers, including Tim Melia, have gone on to be signed to permanent contract with their assigned teams. In the past, when rosters were smaller, there were multiple goalkeepers signed to the pool, however, in recent years only one or two keepers are signed as team rosters are much larger.\nDesignated Players and allocation money.\nMLS has also introduced various initiatives and rules intended to improve quality of players while still maintaining the salary cap. Rules concerning Designated Players and allocation money allow for additional wage spending that is exempt from the salary cap. These initiatives have brought about an increase in on-field competition.\nThe Designated Player Rule (DPR) allows teams to sign a limited number of players whose salary exceeds the maximum cap; in 2017, each DP only counted as $480,625 (the maximum non-DP salary) against the cap. Instituted in 2007, England's David Beckham was the first signing under the DPR. The DPR has led to large income inequality in MLS with top DPs earning as much as 180 times more than a player earning the league minimum. In the 2013 season, 21% of the league's wage spending went to just five players; this stretched to 29% on the top 6 players in the 2014 season.\nThe league's \"Core Players\" initiative allows teams to re-sign players using retention funds that do not count against the salary cap. Retention funds were implemented in 2013 as a mechanism for MLS to retain key players; among the first high-profile players re-signed using retention funds were U.S. national team regulars Graham Zusi and Matt Besler. MLS teams can also obtain allocation money, which is money that the team can use on player salaries that does not count against the cap, and teams can earn allocation money in several ways, such as from the transfer fees earned by selling players to teams in other leagues. MLS teams can also use Targeted Allocation Money (often referred to as TAM), an initiative announced in 2015. Teams can use TAM funds to attract high-profile players by \"buying down\" contracts of players to below the DP level. High-profile players for which TAM funds were used include Hector Villalba, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 and Giorgio Chiellini.\nYouth development.\nMLS has introduced various initiatives and rules intended to develop young players and has required all of its teams to operate youth development programs since 2008. MLS roster rules allow teams to sign an unlimited number of players straight from their academies and bypassing the draft process. There is also supplementary salary budget made by MLS only for homegrown players that are registered using senior roster slots called homegrown player funds. One of the most prominent and lucrative examples of success in \"home-grown\" development was Jozy Altidore, who rose to prominence as a teenager in MLS before his record transfer fee $10\u00a0million move to Villarreal in Spain in 2008. The various MLS teams' development academies play matches in a U.S. Soccer developmental league against youth academies from other leagues such as the North American Soccer League (NASL), which had been a Division II league prior to 2018, and USL Pro, originally a Division III league but now the Division II USL Championship.\nThe league operates a Generation Adidas program, which is a joint venture between MLS and U.S. Soccer that encourages young American players to enter MLS. Rules concerning Generation Adidas players and home-grown players provide incentives for clubs to develop and retain young players. The Generation Adidas program has been in place since 1997, and has introduced players such as Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard and Michael Bradley into MLS. Players under the Homegrown Player Rule are signed to Generation Adidas contracts, all players on Generation Adidas contracts are \"off budget players\" and their salaries do not count against the cap.\nMLS has operated reserve leagues, which give playing time to players who were not starters for their MLS teams, during two different periods. The MLS Reserve League was formed in 2005, and operated through 2014 (with the exception of the 2009 &amp; 2010 seasons). MLS began integrating its Reserve League with the league then known as USL Pro in 2013, and after the 2014 season folded the Reserve League, with MLS then requiring all teams to either affiliate with a USL team or field their own reserve side in that league. However, this requirement was never strictly enforced, and MLS eventually relaunched its reserve league in 2022 under the banner of MLS Next Pro. In the inaugural 2022 season, 19 of the league's then-current clubs, plus future club St. Louis City SC, fielded reserve sides in Next Pro. In the 2023 season, the only MLS teams that did not field Next Pro sides were CF Montr\u00e9al and D.C. United.\nFollowing the folding of the Development Academy, MLS announced its own development league in 2020. It includes all of the MLS team academies as well as 95 clubs across the country; many of which were a part of the Development Academy.\nStadiums.\nSince 1999, the league has overseen the construction of twelve stadiums specifically designed for soccer. The development of soccer-specific stadiums owned by the teams has generated a better matchday experience for the fans. The soccer-specific stadiums have yielded positive financial results as teams were no longer required to pay to rent out facilities and gained control over revenue streams such as concessions, parking, naming rights, and the ability to host non-MLS events. Several teams have doubled their season tickets following the team's move into a soccer-specific stadium. The establishment of soccer-specific stadiums is considered the key to the league and the ability of teams to turn a profit. In 2006, Tim Leiweke, then CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group, described the proliferation of soccer-specific stadiums as the turning point for MLS.\nColumbus Crew owner Lamar Hunt started this trend in 1999 by constructing Columbus Crew Stadium, now known as Historic Crew Stadium, as MLS' first soccer-specific stadium. The Los Angeles Galaxy followed four years later with the opening of the Home Depot Center, now Dignity Health Sports Park, in 2003. FC Dallas opened Pizza Hut Park, now Toyota Stadium, in 2005, and the Chicago Fire began playing their home matches in Toyota Park, now SeatGeek Stadium, in 2006. The 2007 season brought the opening of Dick's Sporting Goods Park for the Colorado Rapids and BMO Field for Toronto FC.\nNear the end of the 2008 season, Rio Tinto Stadium (now known as America First Field) became the home of Real Salt Lake, which meant that for the first time in MLS history a majority of MLS teams (8 out of 14) played in soccer-specific stadiums. Red Bull Arena, the new home of the New York Red Bulls opened for the start of the 2010 season, and the Philadelphia Union opened PPL Park, now Subaru Park, in June 2010, midway through their inaugural season.\nThe following season, in 2011, the Portland Timbers made their MLS debut in a newly renovated Jeld-Wen Field, now renamed Providence Park, which was originally a multi-purpose venue but turned into a soccer-specific facility. Also in 2011, Sporting Kansas City moved to new Livestrong Sporting Park, now Children's Mercy Park. The Houston Dynamo relocated to their new home at BBVA Compass Stadium, now Shell Energy Stadium, in 2012. In the same year, the Montreal Impact joined the league in an expanded Stade Saputo, which reopened in June 2012, when renovations pushed the seating capacity to over 20,000. The Impact has used Olympic Stadium for early season matches and for matches that require a larger capacity. The San Jose Earthquakes, who had played at Buck Shaw Stadium from 2008 until 2014, opened their new Avaya Stadium (now PayPal Park) before the 2015 season. Orlando City SC intended to begin constructing its soccer-specific stadium, now known as Exploria Stadium, in 2014 to be completed in 2015. Delays caused by changes to the stadium plans pushed back the new venue's opening, first to late 2016 and finally to the start of the 2017 season. Orlando City played at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium, now Camping World Stadium, while awaiting the construction of their new venue through the 2016 season. Exploria Stadium hosted its first MLS match on March 5, 2017, against New York City FC as Orlando City Stadium.\nThe development of additional MLS stadiums has continued to progress. D.C. United had played their home matches at former NFL and MLB venue RFK Stadium. In 2013, D.C. United announced the signing of a public-private partnership term sheet to build a new soccer stadium in Washington, D.C., and a final deal was reached in late 2014. In late February 2017, D.C. United finally broke ground on their new stadium, Audi Field. After 21 years of playing at RFK Stadium, D.C. United played their first match at Audi Field in July 2018.\nTwo teams have announced their desire to build a soccer-specific stadium, although these teams have not finalized the stadium site and received all necessary government approvals. New York City FC play home matches at Yankee Stadium, an MLB venue, although they intend to move into Etihad Park, expected to be completed by the 2027 season. The New England Revolution play home matches at Gillette Stadium, which is an NFL stadium also owned by the Revolution's owner, Robert Kraft. The team is currently in discussion with the City of Boston regarding a potential soccer-specific stadium in South Boston.\nSeveral remaining clubs play in stadiums not originally built for MLS and have not announced plans to move. The Seattle Sounders FC play at Lumen Field, a dual-purpose facility used for both American football and soccer. The Vancouver Whitecaps FC joined the league with Portland in 2011 and temporarily held matches at Empire Field before moving into the refurbished BC Place in October 2011, a retractable-roof stadium that hosts Canadian football as well as soccer.\nOf the three teams that made their MLS debuts in 2017 and 2018, one opened a soccer-specific stadium in 2019, a second is playing in a shared football stadium, and the last opened a soccer-specific stadium for its inaugural 2018 season. Minnesota United FC, which debuted in 2017, built Allianz Field in St. Paul which hosted its inaugural match against New York City FC on April 13, 2019. Until that time, the team played in Minneapolis at TCF Bank Stadium (now Huntington Bank Stadium), home to University of Minnesota football. Atlanta United FC began play in 2017 at a college football facility, Georgia Tech's Bobby Dodd Stadium, before moving into its permanent home at the retractable-roof Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which it shares with the NFL's Atlanta Falcons; both teams are owned by Arthur Blank and the stadium is equipped with screens to cordon off the upper tiers for most matches. Los Angeles FC, which began play in 2018, opened Banc of California Stadium (now BMO Stadium) on the former site of the Los Angeles Sports Arena in April of its inaugural season.\nFC Cincinnati made its MLS debut in 2019 at Nippert Stadium, the home of the University of Cincinnati football. The stadium had been home to FCC's USL Championship predecessor for all of its three seasons of play. The club moved within Cincinnati to the new TQL Stadium in 2021. Inter Miami began play in 2020 at Inter Miami CF Stadium, now known as Chase Stadium, at the former site of Lockhart Stadium in Fort Lauderdale before opening Miami Freedom Park in the future. Nashville SC played the 2020 and 2021 seasons at an NFL facility, Nissan Stadium, home of the Tennessee Titans, before opening Geodis Park in 2022. Austin FC opened Q2 Stadium for its first season in 2021. St. Louis City SC opened CityPark in November 2022, a few months before the club's first season in 2023. Construction of Eleven Park was tied to an application for an Indianapolis-based MLS team, initialized in 2024.\nProfitability and revenues.\nMajor League Soccer began to demonstrate positive signs of long-term profitability as early as 2004 with the single-entity ownership structure, salary cap, and the media and marketing umbrella Soccer United Marketing (SUM) all contributing towards MLS' financial security. As soccer-specific stadiums were built, ownership expanded, and television coverage increased, MLS saw its revenues increase while controlling costs.\nTelevision coverage and revenue have increased since the league's early years. In 2006, MLS reached an 8-year TV deal with ESPN spanning the 2007\u20132014 seasons, and marked the first time that MLS earned rights fees, reported to be worth $7\u20138\u00a0million annually. In September 2012 the league extended its distribution agreement with London-based Media rights agency MP &amp; Silva until 2014 in a deal worth $10\u00a0million annually. Total league TV revenues are over $40\u00a0million annually. In 2011, MLS earned $150\u00a0million when it sold a 25% stake in SUM.\nIn early 2005, MLS signed a 10-year, $150\u00a0million sponsorship deal with Adidas for its jerseys and other equipment. In 2007, MLS teams started selling ad space on the front of jerseys to go along with the league-wide sponsorship partners who had already been advertising on the back of club jerseys, following the practice of international sport, specifically soccer. MLS established a floor of $500,000 per shirt sponsorship, with the league receiving a flat fee of $200,000 per deal. As of July 2014, sixteen teams had signed sponsorship deals to have company logos placed on the front of their jerseys (and another team is directly owned by its shirt sponsor), and the league average from jersey sponsors was about $2.4\u00a0million. Sleeve sponsorship was introduced to MLS in the 2020 season, with the teams able to sell a section on the right arm where the league logo patch is normally positioned. \nThe LA Galaxy made a profit in 2003 in their first season at The Home Depot Center, and FC Dallas turned a profit after moving into Pizza Hut Park in 2005. For each season between 2006 and 2009, two to three MLS clubs (generally clubs with a soccer-specific stadium) were reported as profitable by the league. In November 2013, \"Forbes\" published a report that revealed that ten of the league's nineteen teams earned an operating profit in 2012, while two broke even and seven had a loss. Forbes estimated that the league's collective annual revenues were $494\u00a0million, and that the league's collective annual profit was $34 million. Forbes valued the league's franchises to be worth $103\u00a0million on average, almost three times as much as the $37\u00a0million average valuation in 2008. The Seattle Sounders FC franchise was named the most valuable at $175\u00a0million, a 483% gain over the $30 million league entrance fee it paid in 2009.\nThe trend in increased team values has continued with MLS teams seeing a strong 52% increase in franchise values from 2012 to 2014. In August 2015 \"Forbes\" updated its MLS franchise values with the most profitable team measuring $245 million and the least $105 million. The average value jumped from $103 to $157 million. In 2018, \"Forbes\" estimated Atlanta United FC is the most valuable MLS team, worth $330 million, while the Colorado Rapids are the lowest value, at $155 million. These valuations do not include the value of stadiums or training facilities owned by the respective clubs. A \"Sportico\" ranking of club valuations in 2024 placed 20 MLS teams in the top 50 globally, with Los Angeles FC the most valuable at $1.15\u00a0billion (15th overall).\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, MLS teams typically used commercial flights to transport players and staff between matches, with only four charter flights allowed under league rules. These commercial flights were often non-direct, requiring transfers and layovers, and contributed to long travel days. The number of charters allowed for league matches was increased to eight legs prior to the 2020 season and lifted entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sun Country Airlines has provided charter service to MLS teams since 2020 and became the league's official carrier in 2022.\nRules and officials.\nWhen the league began play, it tried to gain popularity by \"Americanizing\" the game: the game clock counted down in each half and stopped for certain dead ball, and matches level at the end of regulation were resolved with a running penalty shootout. Now MLS follows the rules and standards of the International Football Association Board (IFAB).\nSince 2005, the playoff extra time structure follows IFAB standards: two full 15-minute periods, followed by a penalty shootout if necessary.\nU.S. Soccer hired the first full-time professional referees in league history in 2007 as part of the league's \"Game First\" initiatives.\nMajor League Soccer has been implementing fines and suspensions since the 2011 season for simulation (diving) through its Disciplinary Committee, which reviews plays after the match. The first player fined under the new rule was Charlie Davies, fined $1,000 for intentionally deceiving match officials.\nMLS uses the list of banned substances published by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nBranding.\nThe current MLS logo debuted in 2014, ahead of the league's 20th season, replacing an earlier logo that featured a stylized boot and ball. The current logo is a simple crest with a diagonal stripe, the MLS wordmark, and three stars that represent \"community, club, and country\". The logo was designed to be remixed in different color schemes that match teams when used on merchandise and jerseys.\nThe first MLS anthem was unveiled in 2007 and was composed by Audiobrain. The current league anthem debuted in 2020 and was composed by film score composer Hans Zimmer. It's used during league broadcasts and as a prelude to kickoff at stadiums.\nTeam names.\nIn the early years of MLS, teams were typically given official nicknames in the style of other U.S. sports leagues (e.g., Columbus Crew, Los Angeles Galaxy, New England Revolution). Several club names in MLS originated with previous professional soccer clubs, such as the 1970s-era NASL team names San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders, Portland Timbers, and Vancouver Whitecaps.\nD.C. United was the only MLS team to adopt European naming conventions during the 1990s. In more recent years, European-style names have become increasingly common in MLS, with expansion teams such as Real Salt Lake, Toronto FC, New York City FC, Atlanta United FC, Minnesota United FC, and FC Cincinnati, along with rebrandings such as FC Dallas (formerly the Dallas Burn), Sporting Kansas City (formerly the Kansas City Wizards), and CF Montr\u00e9al (formerly the Montreal Impact).\nAustrian beverage company Red Bull GmbH owns and sponsors the New York Red Bulls as well as other sports teams outside the U.S.\nMedia coverage.\nMLS Season Pass on Apple TV.\nSince 2023, all MLS and Leagues Cup matches, as well as certain matches from MLS Next Pro and MLS Next, are streamed worldwide on MLS Season Pass via Apple TV. This agreement ended the previous regional sports network-based system. The contract allows for some broadcasts on linear television. ESPN and Univision exited negotiations, apparently because MLS would not allow them to stream via their own platforms or use their own commentators. Following their departures, Fox Sports joined Apple as MLS' linear broadcast partners in the U.S., with Bell Media's TSN and RDS doing so in Canada.\nUnited States.\nFrom 2012 to 2014, MLS matches were broadcast by NBC Sports, with 40 matches per year\u2014primarily on NBCSN, and select matches broadcast on the NBC network. The move from Fox Soccer to the more widely distributed NBCSN caused viewership numbers to double for the 2012 season.\nSoccer United Marketing partnered with Google and Bedrocket Media Ventures in 2012 to launch \"KickTV\", a premium YouTube channel with original soccer programming. KickTV was sold to Copa90 in 2015 to form its American branch. In 2020, Soccer United Marketing signed a multi-year agreement with Bleacher Report to produce content and highlights for MLS and the U.S. national teams through the 2022 season.\nFrom 2015 to 2022, MLS matches were broadcast nationally by ESPN networks and Fox Sports in English, and Univision networks in Spanish under an eight-year contract. Each broadcaster had a window for national regular season matches, with UniM\u00e1s airing a game on Friday nights in Spanish and additional matches on Univision Deportes Network, and ESPN and Fox Sports 1 airing matches on Sunday evenings in English. ESPN, FS1, and Univision shared coverage of the playoffs, while ABC and Fox alternated broadcasting the MLS Cup final in English. In total, at least 125 matches were aired per season across all three networks. The three contracts have an average estimated value of $90 million per season\u2014five times larger than the average $18 million value of the previous contracts with ESPN, Univision, and NBC Sports.\nMatches not televised nationally were broadcast regionally, often by regional sports networks like Bally Sports, NBC Sports Regional Networks, Spectrum Sports and Root Sports, and sometimes by terrestrial stations like KTXA, WGN and KMYU. Regionally televised matches were available outside their local markets on ESPN+, which replaced MLS Live from 2018 until 2022.\nCanada.\nCurrently, English-language national MLS broadcast rights in Canada are held by the TSN networks through a five-year deal first renewed in 2017. The networks primarily broadcast matches involving the league's Canadian franchises, in combination with separate \"regional\" rights deals giving TSN exclusive rights to all Toronto FC and Vancouver Whitecaps FC matches. A limited number of matches are also carried by CTV.\nTVA Sports held exclusive French-language rights to MLS in Canada from 2017 to 2023. As part of a separate \"regional\" rights deal, it also held exclusive rights to all CF Montr\u00e9al matches .\nIn 2018, online streaming service DAZN obtained the league's digital out-of-market service MLS Live with live and on-demand streaming of matches featuring U.S. teams (matches with Canadian teams were only available after a 48-hour delay to protect the league's main rightsholders TSN and TVA Sports).\nInternational.\nMLS also entered into a four-year contract with Sky Sports to broadcast two MLS matches per week in the United Kingdom and Ireland from 2015 to 2019. As part of the agreement, Sky Sports broadcast at least two MLS regular season matches each week, as well as the MLS All-Star Game, every MLS Cup Playoff game, and the MLS Cup final. The matches appeared across Sky's family of networks. It also carried weekly MLS highlights across various platforms, including Sky Sports News and SkySports.com. Sky Sports also broadcast at least one match from MLS' \"Decision Day\" \u2013 the final day of the MLS regular season. Many of the matches on Decision Day every year are expected to determine the final spots for the MLS Cup Playoffs.\nDSport, owned by Discovery Communications, began televising league matches in India in 2017.\nSBS Sport Australia broadcast one MLS game per week in Australia from 2025.\nVideo games.\nMajor League Soccer is a playable league in the EA Sports FC series, the eFootball series, and the Football Manager series. The league made its video game debut in 1999 with FIFA 2000. Kids video game company Humongous Entertainment had the rights to teams and players for their game, \"Backyard Soccer MLS Edition\" and for \"Backyard Soccer 2004\". In 2000, Konami released \"ESPN MLS GameNight\", and two years later, they released its sequel, \"ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002\". The league made its first appearance in the management series \"Football Manager 2005\" in 2004.\nPlayer records.\nStatistics below are for all-time leaders. Statistics are for regular season only.

Most belong to the House of Grimaldi; exceptions, which consist primarily of the principality's administrators under periods of foreign occupation, are noted.\nHistory.\nThe House of Grimaldi, descended from Otto Canella, a statesman from the Republic of Genoa, and taking their name from his son Grimaldo, were an ancient and prominent Guelphic Genoese family. Members of this family, in the course of the civil strife in Genoa between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, were banned from Genoa in 1271 and took refuge in Monaco.\nFran\u00e7ois Grimaldi seized the Rock of Monaco in 1297, starting the Grimaldi dynasty, under the Genoese sovereignty. The Grimaldis acquired Menton in 1346 and Roquebrune in 1355, enlarging their possessions. These two towns (some 95% of the country's territory) were eventually ceded to France by the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty in 1861.\nThe Grimaldis used the title of Lord until 1612. Then, Lord Honor\u00e9 II started using the title of Prince, thereby becoming the first Prince of Monaco. Afterwards, Honor\u00e9 II secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne in 1641. Since then the area has remained under the control of the Grimaldi family to the present day, except when under French control from 24 February 1793 to 17 May 1814.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in February 2000, the league began its first season in April 2001 with eight teams in the United States. The league suspended operations on September 15, 2003, shortly after the end of its third season, after making cumulative losses of around US$100 million.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nAs a result of the US women's national team's (USWNT) first-place showing in the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, a seemingly viable market for the sport germinated.\nFeeding on the momentum of their victory, the twenty USWNT players, in partnership with John Hendricks of the Discovery Channel, sought out the investors, markets, and players necessary to form an eight-team league. The twenty founding players were Michelle Akers, Brandi Chastain, Tracy Ducar, Lorrie Fair, Joy Fawcett, Danielle Fotopoulos, Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, Shannon MacMillan, Tiffeny Milbrett, Carla Overbeck, Cindy Parlow, Christie Pearce, Tiffany Roberts, Briana Scurry, Kate (Markgraf) Sobrero, Tisha Venturini, Saskia Webber, and Sara Whalen.\nInitial investment in the league was provided by the following:\nThe U.S. Soccer Federation approved membership of the league as a sanctioned Division 1 women's professional soccer league on August 18, 2000. Tony DiCicco was made commissioner.\nMedia coverage.\nAt various times, games were televised on TNT, CNNSI, ESPN2, PAX TV, and various local and regional sports channels via Comcast, Cox, Fox, AT&amp;T, and MSG.\nTNT and CNN/SI (2001).\nTNT broadcast the first WUSA game on April 14, 2001, which was contested between the Washington Freedom and San Jose CyberRays at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C.. Former U.S. national team member Wendy Gebauer Palladino helped called the game alongside play-by-play broadcaster JP Dellacamera. About 22 games were scheduled to be broadcast nationally on TNT or CNN/SI in 2001. 15 games were initially expected to be shown on TNT and seven games on CNN/SI over the course of June to August. The deal included broadcast of both semifinal matches along with the championship game, known as the Founders Cup, on TNT. During a four-year span, TNT and CNN/SI were scheduled to televise at least 88 games under a $3 million TV contract.\nRatings were not available for CNN/SI for the 2001 season as the cable TV provider did not reach enough households to be a statistical factor.\nPax (2002\u20132003).\nAfter the 2001 season, the WUSA opted out of its four-year agreement to go with a two-year pact with the Pax network. The WUSA's reasoning that Pax's offer for a 4 p.m. Saturday timeslot was more desirable than the noon timeslot that TNT offered.\nThe change from TNT and CNN/SI to Pax however, may have immediately depressed ratings by confusing fans. To be more specific, the WUSA's ratings plunged from the 0.4 to 0.2 average it got on TNT to a 0.1 average on Pax. In other words, where as an average of 425,000 households tuned in to watch the games on TNT, fewer than 100,000 watched them on Pax. Keep in mind that Pax was a station available in 90 million, 5 million more than TNT. The move to Pax also came as AOL Time Warner considered morphing CNN/SI into a basketball channel that would be co-owned with the National Basketball Association.\nPax's coverage in itself, concerned the broadcast of the \"WUSA Game of the Week\", on 19 consecutive Saturdays beginning in April at 4:00\u00a0p.m. (ET). In 2003, the league wouldn't decide on the opponents for the final Pax \"Game of the Week\" on August 9 in order to provide soccer fans with the best possible matchup with playoff implications. The decision on the two opponents for the August 9 game would be made in early August. In total, Pax was scheduled to televise 18 regular season games and one WUSA Playoff Semifinal in the second week of August.\nPax would receive certain cross-promotional opportunities with the league, including signs at each team venue, although the WUSA would handle ad sales for the games. The agreement carried a reported value of $2 million.\nESPN2 (2003).\nFor the WUSA's third and final season, they announced that ESPN2 would join Pax in broadcasting 23 league games in 2003. This would begin with a rematch of Founders Cup II with the Washington Freedom visit the Carolina Courage on April 5. ESPN2 was scheduled to broadcast only four of the 23 nationally televised games. This included the All-Star Game on June 19 and the Founders Cup on August 24. Beth Mowins and Anson Dorrance handled WUSA games on not just Pax but ESPN2 also.\nThe WUSA ultimately scored a 0.1 percent rating on Pax and 0.2 percent on ESPN2.\nTeams.\nThe WUSA franchises were located in Philadelphia; Boston; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Cary, N.C.; Atlanta; San Jose, Ca.; and San Diego:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor the inaugural season, each roster primarily consisted of players from the United States, although up to four international players were allowed on each team's roster. Among the international players were China's Sun Wen, Pu Wei, Fan Yunjie, Zhang Ouying, Gao Hong, Zhao Lihong, and Bai Jie; Germany's Birgit Prinz, Conny Pohlers, Steffi Jones and Maren Meinert; Norway's Hege Riise, Unni Lehn, and Dagny Mellgren; Brazil's Sissi, K\u00e1tia and Pretinha; and Canada's Charmaine Hooper, Sharolta Nonen, and Christine Latham.\nThe league also hosted singular talents from nations which were not then at the forefront of women's soccer, such as Maribel Dominguez of Mexico, Homare Sawa of Japan, Julie Fleeting of Scotland, Cheryl Salisbury of Australia, Marinette Pichon of France, and Kelly Smith of England.\nWUSA Awards.\nFounders Cup champions.\nThe Founders Cup (named in honor of the 20 founding players) was awarded to the winner of a four-team, single-elimination postseason playoff.\n\"asdet\" stands for \"after sudden death extra time\". WUSA's sudden death overtime was 15 minutes long (two 7\u00bd-minute periods) and used only in the playoffs.\nLeague suspension.\nThe WUSA played for three full seasons, suspending operations on September 15, 2003, shortly after the conclusion of the third season. Neither television ratings nor attendance met forecasts, while the league spent its initial $40million budget, planned to last five years, by the end of the first season. Even though the players took salary cuts of up to 30% for the final season, with the founding players (who also held a participating interest in the league) taking the largest cuts, that was not enough to bring expenses under control. In the hopes of an eventual relaunch of the league, all rights to team names, logos, and similar properties were preserved. Efforts to line up new sources of capital and operating funds continued. In June 2004, the WUSA held two \"WUSA Festivals\" in Los Angeles and Blaine, Minnesota, featuring matches between reconstituted WUSA teams (often with marquee players borrowed from other teams), in order to maintain the league in the public eye and sustain interest in women's professional soccer.\nWith the WUSA on hiatus, the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL) and the W-League regained their status as the premier women's soccer leagues in the United States, and many former WUSA players joined those teams.&lt;ref name=\"SOCCER / Collapse of WUSA leaves void / College, pro players ponder their futures\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nA new women's professional soccer league in the United States called Women's Professional Soccer started in 2009.

They were one of the founder members of the Football League.\nHistory.\nAccrington Football Club was formed following a meeting at a local public house in 1878. It was the second association club in the town, after Enfield. The club's record appearance holder and top scorer was Johnny Kirkham, who played 117 matches and scored 37 goals during its Football League tenure.\nLocal cups.\nWith backing from mill owners, the Owd Reds became one of the strongest sides in Lancashire. In 1880\u201381, it won the Lancashire Senior Cup for the first time, beating Blackburn Park Road 6\u20134 in the final. The Roadsters walked off the field with five minutes to go in protest at the refereeing, and put in an unsuccessful protest, one reporter stating that the second Accrington goal was seen as handball \"by every reporter present\" and the sixth Accrington goal was so far offside that \"the referee (William Peirce-Dix of Sheffield) was obviously bribed or neglecting his duty as a final judge\", another stating that \"the greatest wrongdoer in this last piece of business connected with the already ugly career of the Lancashire Association Challenge Cup is the referee of Saturday last\".\nThe club was part of the revolt against the Football Association in 1884 over professionalism, after being expelled from the FA the previous year for paying a player, and was a founding member of the British Football Association, in a successful ploy to have the FA overturn its ban on professionals. It won the Lancashire Senior Cup twice more; in 1887\u201388 by forfeit, after Preston North End refused to play the final in Blackburn, and in 1888\u201389. Accrington was fortunate to be in the final, turning up late to its third round tie at Halliwell, which claimed the tie; however, before the crowd had left, Accrington turned up and the tie took place, the Owd Reds winning 1\u20130. The final, against underdogs Higher Walton, ended 1-1 and around 6,000 turned up to Deepdale for the replay, in which the Owd Reds scored the only goal. \nFA Cup.\nThe club had less fortune in the FA Cup, as the regionalization of the early rounds in the 1880s meant it was drawn against strong Lancastrian sides. Its best run, in 1887\u201388, saw it beat Rossendale by an easy 11\u20130, and then beat Burnley 3\u20132 at home, coming from 2\u20130 down at half-time, before a crowd of at least 5,000; however the club was then drawn to host Blackburn Rovers, which had just had a three-season winning run in the competition. Harry Fecitt gave Accrington the lead against his former club, the goal followed by a burst of music from the Accrington Volunteer Band, but Rovers rallied to win 3\u20131.\nFootball League and decline.\nIt was one of the original twelve clubs that formed the Football League on 17 April 1888. Accrington's best season was in 1889\u201390, when the club finished sixth in the table. However, in the 1892\u201393 season they finished fifteenth (of 16) and were relegated after losing a test match 1\u20130 against Sheffield United at Trent Bridge. Accrington then resigned from the league rather than play in the Second Division, becoming the first of the founding Football League clubs to leave the League permanently (Stoke had failed to be re-elected in 1890, but rejoined the league a year later).\nAfter its first season in the Lancashire League, Accrington, realizing that business was better in the national competition, unsuccessfully applied for re-election to the Football League. Shortly afterwards, Accrington F.C. suffered financial problems, which eventually led to its demise. The club continued outside the league until 1896, when they finally folded following a 12\u20130 defeat on 14 January against Darwen in the Lancashire Senior Cup. The growth of the Football League, and the increased - and consistent - crowds of clubs in bigger population areas, had dwarfed the money available to Accrington from its benefactors, and, with bigger towns close by, Accrington had no room to breathe.\nAccrington did not have a Football League club again until in 1921\u201322 the Lancashire Combination league's Accrington Stanley (formerly a local rival), became a member as part of a major expansion of the league.\nColours.\nThe club originally wore scarlet and black jerseys and hose, with black knickers. In 1880 the club changed to red jerseys and white knickers, changing the knickers to serge blue from 1888 to 1892.\nGround.\nThe Owd Reds played at Accrington Cricket Club's ground in Thorneyholme Road, which is still in use for that sport today.\nInternational players.\nDuring its short existence the club had three players selected for the England national team:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its population was 61,960 in the 2020 United States census, making Chapel Hill the 17th-most populous municipality in the state. Chapel Hill and Durham make up the Durham-Chapel Hill, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 608,879 in 2023. When it is combined with Raleigh, the state capital, they make up the corners of the Research Triangle (officially the Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC Combined Statistical Area), which had an estimated population of 2,368,947 in 2023.\nThe town was founded in 1793 and is centered on Franklin Street, covering . It contains several districts and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and UNC Health Care are a major part of the economy and town influence. Local artists have created many murals in the town.\nHistory.\nPre-establishment and colonial era.\nThe Occaneechi Indians lived in the area of what is now Hillsborough, north of Chapel Hill, prior to European settlement.\nThe area was the home place of early settler William Barbee of Middlesex County, Virginia, whose 1753 grant of 585 acres on the north and south side of \"Lick Branch\" from John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville was the first of two land grants in what is now the Chapel Hill-Durham area. Though William Barbee died shortly after settling there in 1758, one of his eight children, Christopher Barbee, became an important contributor to his father's adopted community and to the fledgling University of North Carolina. In 1792, he offered the trustees of UNC 221 acres on which the university is now built, making him the university's largest donor.\nChapel Hill has developed along a hill; the crest was the original site of a small Anglican \"chapel of ease\", built in 1752, known as New Hope Chapel. The Carolina Inn now occupies this site. In 1819, the town was founded by the NC General Assembly to serve the University of North Carolina and developed around it. The town was chartered in 1851, and its main street, Franklin Street, was named in memory of Benjamin Franklin.\nAntebellum.\nOf Chapel Hill during slavery, Kemp Plummer Battle wrote,\n The government of the village of Chapel Hill was primitive. All white males between 21 and 50 years of age were distributed into classes and in turn patrolled the streets at night. Slaves were liable to a whipping of ten lashes, or a fine of one dollar, for being absent from home without a written permit from the owner. Nor could a slave hire his own time.\nCivil War.\nFour in ten Chapel Hillians were enslaved at the start of the Civil War, and about half of the town was Black. In April 1865, as the war ended, the 9th Michigan Cavalry rode into Chapel Hill and occupied the university and the town for more than two weeks.\nReconstruction.\nIn 1869, in the lead-up to the Kirk-Holden War, Governor William Holden sent a detective into Chapel Hill to investigate the presence of the Ku Klux Klan, whose members had been riding through Chapel Hill and nearby towns committing crimes and terrorizing the populace. Once in Chapel Hill, the detective was tied to the town pump by a group of men and given sixty lashes.\nIn 1870, a group of Chapel Hill Conservatives attempted to overthrow the Chapel Hill Board of Commissioners. On February 28, they held a fraudulent election and installed a new Board, which seized the town records and began holding regular meetings. They appointed members of their group as Magistrate of Police, Town Constable, and Town Clerk. In early April, the Conservative Board began to face scrutiny, and on April 7, it fell apart, as their own attorney informed them that their February 28 election was not valid.\nGreat Depression.\nIn 1937, Chapel Hill was the site of a race riot resulting from racial tensions, economic hardship, and neglect of Chapel Hill's black community. Geeta N. Kapur and John K. Chapman described the incident as a revolt by Black workers.\nAs a result of the riot, the White and Black upper class of Chapel Hill collaborated to raise money for a black community center. According to Chapman, this was with the intention of pacifying black men to prevent further unrest. In 1939, land was purchased for the Hargraves Community Center. Construction completed in 1945.\nCivil rights era.\nIn 1960, a group of Black students from Lincoln High School, called the Chapel Hill Nine, participated a sit-in at Colonial Drugstore to protest the store's refusal to serve dine-in black customers.\nIn 1969, a year after the town fully integrated its schools, Chapel Hill elected Howard Lee as mayor. It was the first majority-white municipality in the South to elect an African-American mayor. Serving from 1969 to 1975, Lee helped establish Chapel Hill Transit, the town's bus system, and the Mountains-to-Sea trail.\nSome 30 years later, in 2002, the state passed legislation to provide free service to all riders on local buses. The bus operations are funded through Chapel Hill and Carrboro town taxes, federal grants, and UNC student tuition. The change has resulted in a large increase in ridership, taking many cars off the roads. Several hybrid and articulated buses have been added recently. All buses carry GPS transmitters to report their location in real-time to a tracking web site. Buses can transport bicycles and have wheelchair lifts.\nIn 1993, the town celebrated its bicentennial and founded the Chapel Hill Museum. This cultural community resource \"exhibiting the character and characters of Chapel Hill, North Carolina\" included among its permanent exhibits \"Alexander Julian\", \"History of the Chapel Hill Fire Department\", \"Chapel Hill's 1914 Fire Truck\", \"The James Taylor Story\", \"Farmer/James Pottery\", and \"The Paul Green Legacy\".\nIn addition to the Carolina Inn, the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity House, Chapel Hill Historic District, Chapel Hill Town Hall, Chapel of the Cross, Gimghoul Neighborhood Historic District, Alexander Hogan Plantation, Old Chapel Hill Cemetery, Old East, University of North Carolina, Playmakers Theatre, Rocky Ridge Farm Historic District, and West Chapel Hill Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGeography and climate.\nChapel Hill is located in the southeast corner of Orange County, with a small part extending east into Durham County. It is bounded on the west by the town of Carrboro and on the northeast by the city of Durham. However, most of Chapel Hill's borders are adjacent to unincorporated portions of Orange and Durham Counties rather than shared with another municipality.

The community elects a mayor and eight council members. Mayors serve two-year terms, and council members serve staggered four-year terms, all elected by the town at large; town elections are held in November of odd-numbered years. Mayor Jessica Anderson, a former council member, succeeded four-term mayor Pam Hemminger in 2023. In 2015, Hemminger defeated incumbent Mark Kleinschmidt, who had been elected in 2009 as the first openly gay mayor of Chapel Hill, succeeding outgoing four-term mayor Kevin Foy.\nThe town adopted its flag in 1990. According to flag designer Spring Davis, the blue represents the town and the University of North Carolina (whose colors are Carolina blue and white); the green represents \"environmental awareness\"; and the \"townscape\" in the inverted chevron represents \"a sense of home, friends, and community.\"\nThe town's seal, has, since the 1930s, depicted Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and protector of cities. Having gone through several revisions, the seal, which also serves as the town logo, was most recently updated in 2005 to a visually simpler version.\nEducation.\nChapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools covers most of the towns of Chapel Hill and Carrboro, along with portions of unincorporated Orange County, and is recognized for its academic strengths. East Chapel Hill High School, Carrboro High School, and Chapel Hill High School have all received national recognition for excellence, with \"Newsweek\" in 2008 ranking East Chapel Hill High as the 88th-best high school in the nation, and the highest-ranked standard public high school in North Carolina. The small portion of Chapel Hill located in Durham County is part of Durham Public Schools.\nThere are several private K-12 schools in Chapel Hill, including Emerson Waldorf School.\nFounded in 1789, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is a public research university and is the flagship of the University of North Carolina System.\nThe state's main youth orchestra, Piedmont Youth Orchestra, is based in Chapel Hill.\nAlso located in the town is the Chapel Hill Public Library, directed by Atlas Logan.\nCulture.\nThough Chapel Hill is a principal town of a large metropolitan area, it retains a relatively small-town feel. Combined with its close neighbor, the Chapel Hill-Carrboro area has roughly 85,000 residents. Many large murals can be seen painted on the buildings. Most of these murals were painted by UNC alumnus Michael Brown. Also, for more than 30 years, Chapel Hill has sponsored the annual street fair, Festifall, in October. The fair offer booths to artists, craftsmakers, nonprofits, and food vendors. Performance space is also available for musicians, martial artists, and other groups. The fair is attended by tens of thousands each year.\nThe Morehead Planetarium and Science Center was the first planetarium built on a U.S. college campus. When it opened in 1949, it was one of six planetariums in the nation and has remained an important town landmark. During the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs, astronauts were trained there. One of the town's hallmark features is the giant sundial, located in the green square in front of the planetarium on Franklin Street.\nInfluences of the university are seen throughout the town, even in the fire departments. Each fire station in Chapel Hill has a fire engine (numbers 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35) that is Carolina blue. These engines are also decorated with different UNC decals, including a firefighter Rameses.\nChapel Hill also has some new urbanist village communities, such as Meadowmont Village and Southern Village. Meadowmont and Southern Village both have shopping centers, green space where concerts, movies, and other outdoor events have taken place, community pools, and schools. Also, a traditional-style mall with a mix of national and local retailers is located at University Place.\nFood.\nHailed as one of America's Foodiest Small Towns by \"Bon App\u00e9tit\", Chapel Hill is rapidly becoming a hot spot for pop American cuisine. Among the restaurants noted nationally are Mama Dip's (Food Network's \"$40 A Day With Rachael Ray\"), Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen (\"The Splendid Table\"), caff\u00e8 Driade (Food Network's \"$40 A Day With Rachael Ray\"), Lantern Restaurant (\"Food &amp; Wine\", \"Southern Living\", etc.), and Vimala's Curryblossom Cafe.\nMusic.\nIn the realm of popular music, James Taylor, George Hamilton IV, Southern Culture on the Skids, Superchunk, Polvo, Archers of Loaf, Ben Folds Five, The Kingsbury Manx, Spider Bags and more recently Porter Robinson, are among the most notable musical artists and acts whose careers began in Chapel Hill. The town has also been a center for the modern revival of old-time music and bluegrass with composer as Elizabeth Cotten and such bands as the Ayr Mountaineers, Hollow Rock String band, Watchhouse (formerly known as Mandolin Orange), Steep Canyon Rangers, Mipso, the Tug Creek Ramblers, Two Dollar Pistols, the Fuzzy Mountain String band, Big Fat Gap and the Red Clay Ramblers.\nChapel Hill was also the founding home of now Durham-based Merge Records. Bruce Springsteen has made a point to visit the town on four occasions. His most recent appearance was on September 15, 2003, at Kenan Memorial Stadium with the E Street Band. U2 also performed at Kenan on the first American date of their 1983 War Tour, where Bono climbed up to the top of the stage, during pouring rain and lightning, holding up a white flag for peace. The 2011 John Craigie song, \"Chapel Hill\", is about the singer's first visit there. One song from \"Dirty\", a Sonic Youth album, is named after the town.\nSports.\nThe University of North Carolina has been very successful at college basketball and women's soccer, and a passion for these sports has been a distinctive feature of the town's culture, fueled by the Tobacco Road rivalry among North Carolina's four ACC teams: the North Carolina Tar Heels, the Duke Blue Devils, the NC State Wolfpack, and the Wake Forest Demon Deacons.\nThe two largest sports venues in the town both house UNC teams. The Dean Smith Center is home to the men's basketball team, while Kenan Memorial Stadium is home to the football team. In addition, Chapel Hill is also home to Carmichael Arena which formerly housed the UNC men's basketball team, and currently is home to the women's team, and to the new Dorrance Field, home to men's and women's soccer and lacrosse teams.\nMany walking/biking trails are in Chapel Hill. Some of these include Battle Branch Trail, Morgan Creek Trail and Bolin Creek Trail, Chapel Hill's oldest trail and most popular greenway.\nTransit.\nBus.\nChapel Hill has no-fee intracity bus service via Chapel Hill Transit. Park &amp; Ride lots provide financial support for the service, and fees are collected through UNC Parking. The connecting services are fee-based, but subsidized for UNC students, staff, and faculty. Go Triangle provides connection to the rest of the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, and Hillsborough), of which the Hillsborough service is operated by Chapel Hill Transit, and supplemented mid-day by a county shuttle.\nLight rail.\nThe Durham\u2013Orange Light Rail line, which would have run between Chapel Hill and Durham, entered planning and engineering phases in August 2017. The project was discontinued in April 2019.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The club was established in 1901 by a merger of Burton Swifts and Burton Wanderers, and played their last competitive season in 1910. In 1924 they merged with Burton All Saints continuing the lineage of the history of football in Burton, while at the same time legally ending the club. Between 1901 and 1907, the club were members of the Football League.\nHistory.\nThe club was formed in 1901 when Burton Swifts merged with Burton Wanderers. Swifts had played in the Football League since 1892, whilst Wanderers had been Football League members between 1894 and 1897 but were now members of the Midland League. It was unusual for a smaller town such as Burton to host two Football League clubs so it was hoped the merger would see an upturn in fortunes for the United club.\nThe new club took Swifts' place in the Second Division of the Football League and took over residence at their Peel Croft home. However, the new club failed to achieve success, and never finished above 10th place or made it past the first round of the FA Cup. In the 1904\u201305 and 1905\u201306 seasons the club finished in second last place, and in 1906\u201307 finished bottom. At the end of the season the club failed to win re-election, losing their Football League place to Fulham. Following the re-election meeting Burslem Port Vale resigned from the League, and although United applied to take their place, it was instead offered to and accepted by Oldham Athletic. Notable figures include W. D. Clarke who was reportedly \"among the best-known figures in the world of Association football in pre-war days.\" and C. Grewcock\nThe club dropped into the Birmingham &amp; District League, and in 1909 also became members of the Southern League. At the end of the 1909\u201310 season the club finished bottom of the Birmingham &amp; District League and second bottom of their Southern League division, and subsequently merged with Burton All Saints, who had been established around the same time as United. They became Burton Town in 1924. They ceased playing in 1940, and were merged into Burton Albion shortly after they were founded in 1950. Albion did not reach the second tier of English football, however, until 2015\u201316, when they were promoted to the by-now Football League Championship.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "71831", "revid": "1319251794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71831", "title": "Corned beef", "text": "Salt-cured beef product\nCorned beef, called salted beef in some Commonwealth countries, is a salt-cured piece of beef. The term comes from the treatment of the meat with large-grained rock salt, also called \"corns\" of salt. Sometimes, sugar and spices are added to corned beef recipes. Corned beef is featured as an ingredient in many cuisines.\nMost recipes include nitrates, which convert the natural myoglobin in beef to nitrosomyoglobin, giving it a pink color. Nitrates and nitrites reduce the risk of dangerous botulism during curing by inhibiting the growth of \"Clostridium botulinum\" bacteria spores, but react with amines in beef to form compounds that cause cancer. Beef cured without nitrates or nitrites has a gray color and is sometimes called \"New England corned beef\".\nTinned corned beef, alongside salt pork and hardtack, was a standard ration for many militaries and navies from the 17th through the early 20th centuries, including World War\u00a0I and World War\u00a0II, during which fresh meat was rationed. Corned beef remains popular worldwide as an ingredient in a variety of regional dishes and as a common part in modern field rations of various armed forces around the world.\nHistory.\nAlthough the exact origin of corned beef is unknown, it most likely came about when people began preserving meat through salt-curing. Evidence of its legacy is apparent in numerous cultures, including ancient Europe and the Middle East. The word \"corn\" derives from Old English and is used to describe any small, hard particles or grains. In the case of \"corned beef\", the word may refer to the coarse, granular salts used to cure the beef. The word \"corned\" may also refer to the corns of potassium nitrate, also known as saltpeter, which were formerly used to preserve the meat.\nPre-20th century.\nAlthough the practise of curing beef existed across the globe since the period of classical antiquity, the industrial production of corned beef started in the British Isles during the British Agricultural Revolution. Corned beef sourced from cattle reared in Ireland and Scotland was used extensively for civilian and military consumption throughout the British Empire beginning from the 17th century onwards due to its non-perishable nature. Irish and Scottish corned beef was also sold to the French West Indies, where it was used to feed both settlers and slaves. Industrial processes in the British Isles for producing corned beef during the 17th century did not distinguish different cuts of beef beyond the tough and undesirable parts of the cow such as the beef shank and neck. Instead, the grading was done by sorting all cuts of beef by weight into \"small beef\", \"cargo beef\" and \"best mess beef\", with the first being considered the worst and the last the best. \"Small beef\" and \"cargo beef\" cuts were most commonly traded to the French, while \"best mess beef\" were frequently intended for sale and consumption in markets throughout the British Empire.\nIreland produced a significant portion of corned beef consumed in the British Empire during the early modern period, using cattle reared locally and salt imported from the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. Irish port cities, such as Dublin, Belfast and Cork, became home to large-scale beef curing and packing industries, with Cork alone producing half of Ireland's annual beef exports in 1668. Although the consumption of corned beef carried no significant negative connotations in Europe, in European colonies in the Americas it was frequently looked upon with disdain due to being primarily consumed by poor people and slaves. American social theorist Jeremy Rifkin noted the sociopolitical effect of corned beef in the British Isles during the early modern period in his 1992 book \"Beyond Beef: The Rise and Fall of the Cattle Culture\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe British enclosure movement had displaced thousands of rural English families, creating a cheap new labour pool to fill the unskilled jobs in the industrial factories of London, Leeds, Manchester, and Bristol. Shortages of foodstuffs and rising prices were fueling discontent among the new working class and middle class of the cities, threatening open rebellion. British officials and entrepreneurs quieted the masses with Scottish and Irish beef. Historians of the period point out that were it not for the Celtic pasturelands of Scotland and Ireland, it might well have proved impossible to quell the growing unrest of the British working class during the critical decades of British industrial expansion.\nDespite being a major producer of corned beef, the majority of the Irish population during this period, Catholic tenant farmers, consumed relatively little meat in their diets. This was due to a variety of factors, including the high costs of buying meat in Ireland and the ownership of the majority of Irish farms by Protestant landlords, who marked most of the corned beef produced using their cattle for export. The level of meat, including corned beef, present in the Irish diet of the period decreased in areas away from major centres for corned beef production, such as Northern Ireland, while increasing in areas such as County Cork. The majority of meat consumed by working-class Irish Catholics consisted of cheap products such as salt pork, with bacon and cabbage quickly becoming one of the most common meals in Irish cuisine.\n20th century to present.\nCorned beef became a less important commodity in the 19th century Atlantic world, due in part to the abolition of slavery. Corned beef production and its canned form remained an important food source during World War II. Much of the canned corned beef was produced by the Frigor\u00edfico Anglo in Fray Bentos, Uruguay, with over 16\u00a0million cans exported in 1943. Today significant amounts of the global canned corned beef supply comes from South America. Approximately 80% of the global canned corned beef supply originates in Brazil.\nNutrition and health effects.\nCorned beef is a type of processed red meat. Red meat is a good source of protein, iron, zinc, and vitamins B1, B2, B6, and B12. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), processed meat causes cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. Strong evidence also links processed meat with higher risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The World Cancer Research Fund recommends minimizing consumption of processed meats.\nCultural associations.\nIn North America, corned beef dishes are associated with traditional British and Irish cuisines.\nMark Kurlansky, in his book \"Salt\", states that the Irish produced a salted beef around the Middle Ages that was the \"forerunner of what today is known as Irish corned beef\" and in the 17th century, the English named the Irish salted beef \"corned beef\".\nBefore the wave of 19th century Irish immigration to the United States, many ethnic Irish immigrants did not consume corned beef dishes. The popularity of corned beef compared to back bacon among the Irish immigrant population may have been due to corned beef being considered a luxury product in their native land, while it was cheap and readily available in the United States.\nThe Jewish population produced similar corned beef brisket, also smoking it into pastrami. Irish immigrants often purchased corned beef from Jewish butchers.\nCanned corned beef has long been one of the standard meals included in military field ration packs globally, due to its simplicity and instant preparation. One example is the American Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) pack. Astronaut John Young sneaked a contraband corned beef sandwich on board Gemini 3, hiding it in a pocket of his spacesuit.\nRegions.\nNorth America.\nIn the United States and Canada, corned beef is typically available in two forms: a cut of beef (usually brisket, but sometimes round or silverside) cured or pickled in a seasoned brine, or cooked and canned.\nCorned beef is often purchased ready to eat in Jewish delicatessens. It is the key ingredient in the grilled Reuben sandwich, consisting of corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Thousand Island or Russian dressing on rye bread. Smoking corned beef, typically with a generally similar spice mix, produces smoked meat (or \"smoked beef\") such as pastrami or Montreal-style smoked meat.\nCorned beef hashed with potatoes served with eggs is a common breakfast dish in the United States of America.\nIn both the United States and Canada, corned beef is sold in cans in minced form. It is also sold this way in Puerto Rico and Uruguay.\nCaribbean.\nMultiple Caribbean nations have their own varied versions of canned corned beef as a dish, common in Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Barbados, and elsewhere.\nNewfoundland and Labrador.\nCorned beef is known specifically as \"salt beef\" in Newfoundland and Labrador, and is sold in buckets with brine to preserve the beef and is not seasoned with spices. It is a staple product culturally in Newfoundland and Labrador, providing a source of meat during their long winters. It is commonly eaten in Newfoundland and Labrador as part of the local Jiggs dinner meal. It has been used in different meals locally, such as a Jiggs dinner poutine dish.\nSaint Patrick's Day.\nIn the United States, consumption of corned beef is often associated with Saint Patrick's Day. Corned beef is not an Irish national dish, and the connection with Saint Patrick's Day specifically originates as part of Irish-American culture, and is often part of their celebrations in North America.\nCorned beef was used as a substitute for bacon by Irish immigrants in the late 19th century. Corned beef and cabbage is the Irish-American variant of the Irish dish of bacon and cabbage. A similar dish is the New England boiled dinner, consisting of corned beef, cabbage, and root vegetables such as carrots, turnips, and potatoes, which is popular in New England and another similar dish, Jiggs dinner, is popular in parts of Atlantic Canada.\nEurope.\nIreland.\nThe appearance of corned beef in Irish cuisine dates to the 12th century in the poem \"Aislinge Meic Con Glinne\" or \"The Vision of MacConglinne\". Within the text, it is described as a delicacy a king uses to purge himself of the \"demon of gluttony\". Cattle, valued as a bartering tool, were only eaten when no longer able to provide milk or to work. The corned beef as described in this text was a rare and valued dish, given the value and position of cattle within the culture, as well as the expense of salt, and was unrelated to the corned beef eaten today.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK, \"corned beef\" refers to minced and canned salt beef. Unminced corned beef is referred to as salt beef.\nMiddle East.\nIsrael.\nIn Israel, a canned corned beef called \"Loof\" (\u05dc\u05d5\u05e3) was the traditional field ration of the Israel Defense Forces until the product's discontinuation in 2011. The name \"Loof\" derives from \"a colloquially corrupt short form of 'meatloaf.'\" \"Loof\" was developed by the IDF in the late 1940s as a kosher form of bully beef, while similar canned meats had earlier been an important component of relief packages sent to Europe and Palestine by Jewish organizations such as Hadassah.\nOceania.\nPolynesia.\nIn Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, colonialism by western powers brought with them something that would change Polynesian diets\u2014canned goods, including the highly prized corned beef. Natural disasters brought in food aid from New Zealand, Australia, and the US, then world wars in the mid-20th century, foreign foods became a bigger part of daily diets while retaining ancestral foods like taro and coconuts.\nBoth wet salt-brined beef and canned corned beef are differentiated. In Samoa, brined (lit.\u2009'salted beef') or canned (lit. \"pea soup\", general term for canned foods). In Tonga, corned (wet brine) or canned meats are typical.\nEast Asia.\nHong Kong.\nCorned beef has also become a common dish in Hong Kong cuisine, though it has been heavily adapted in style and preparation to fit local tastes. It is often served with other \"Western\" fusion cuisine at cha chaan teng and other cheap restaurants catering to locals.\nSoutheast Asia.\nPhilippines.\nAlong with other canned meats, canned corned beef is a popular breakfast staple in the Philippines. Corned beef is also known as \"carne norte\" (alternative spelling: \"karne norte\") locally, literally translating to \"northern meat\" in Spanish; the term refers to Americans, whom Filipinos referred then as norteamericanos, just like the rest of Spain's colonies, where there is a differentiation between what is norteamericano (Canadian, American, Mexicano, what is centroamericano (Nicaraguense, Costarricense et al.), and what is sudamericano (Colombiano, Equatoriano, Paraguayo, et al.). The colonial mindset distinction then of what was norteamericano was countries north of the Viceroy's Road (\"Camino de Virreyes\"), the route used to transport goods from the Manila Galleon landing in the port of Acapulco overland for Havana via the port of Veracruz (and not the Rio Grande river in Texas today), thus centroamericano meant the other Spanish possessions south of Mexico City.\nCorned beef, especially the Libby's brand, first became popular during the American colonial period of the Philippines (1901\u20131941) among the wealthy as a luxury food; they were advertised serving the corned beef cold and straight-from-the-can on to a bed of rice, or as patties in between bread. During World War II (1942\u20131945), American soldiers brought for themselves, and airdropped from the skies the same corned beef; it was a life-or-death commodity since the Japanese Imperial Army forcibly controlled all food in an effort to subvert any resistance against them.\nAfter the war (1946 to present), corned beef gained far more popularity. It remains a staple in \"balikbayan\" boxes and on Filipino breakfast tables. The ordinary Filipino can afford them, and many brands have sprung up, including those manufactured by Century Pacific Food, CDO Foodsphere and San Miguel Food and Beverage, which are wholly owned by Filipinos and locally manufactured.\nPhilippine corned beef is typically made from shredded beef or buffalo meat, and is almost exclusively sold in cans. It is boiled, shredded, canned, and sold in supermarkets and grocery stores for mass consumption. It is usually served as the breakfast combination called \"corned beef \"silog\"\", in which corned beef is cooked as \"carne norte guisado\" (fried, mixed with onions, garlic, and often, finely cubed potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, and/or cabbage), with a side of \"sinangag\" (garlic fried rice), and a fried egg. Another common way to eat corned beef is \"tortang carne norte\" (or corned beef omelet), in which corned beef is mixed with egg and fried. Corned beef is also used as a cheap meat ingredient in dishes like \"sopas\" and \"sinigang\".\nSee also.\nSong references.\nMark Knopfler's song \"Corned Beef City\" from the album Privateering (2012)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
