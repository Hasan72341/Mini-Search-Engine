The history of Norwegian literature starts with the pagan Eddaic poems and skaldic verse of the 9th and 10th centuries with poets such as Bragi Boddason and Eyvindr Sk\u00e1ldaspillir. The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European medieval learning, hagiography and history writing. Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence, this was to flower into an active period of literature production in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Major works of that period include \"Historia Norwegie\", \"Thidreks saga\" and \"Konungs skuggsj\u00e1.\"\nThe period from the 14th century to the 19th is considered a Dark Age in the nation's literature though Norwegian-born writers such as Peder Clauss\u00f8n Friis, Dorothe Engelbretsdatter and Ludvig Holberg contributed to the common literature of Denmark\u2013Norway. With the advent of nationalism and the struggle for independence in the early 19th century, a new period of national literature emerged. In a flood of nationalistic romanticism, the \"great four\" emerged: Henrik Ibsen, Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson, Alexander Kielland, and Jonas Lie. The dramatist Henrik Wergeland was the most-influential author of the period while the later works of Henrik Ibsen were to earn Norway a key place in Western European literature.\nModernist literature was introduced to Norway through the literature of Knut Hamsun and Sigbj\u00f8rn Obstfelder in the 1890s. In the 1930s Emil Boyson, Gunnar Larsen, Haakon Bugge Mahrt, Rolf Stenersen and Edith \u00d8berg were among the Norwegian authors who experimented with prose modernism. The literature in the first years after the Second World War was characterized by a long series of documentary reports from people who had been in German custody, or who had participated in the resistance efforts during the occupation. In the 20th century notable Norwegian writers include the two Nobel Prize-winning authors, Knut Hamsun and Sigrid Undset. The period after 1965 represented a sharp expansion of market for Norwegian fiction and the 1970s produced both politicization and empowerment of Norwegian authors. The 1980s has been labeled the \"fantasy decade\" in Norwegian literature.\nMedieval poetry.\nThe earliest preserved examples of Old Norse literature are the Eddic poems, the oldest of which may have been composed in early 9th century Norway drawing on the common Germanic tradition of alliterative verse. In the 9th century the first instances of skaldic poetry also appear with the skalds Bragi Boddason, \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir and the court poets of Harald Fairhair. This tradition continued through the 10th century with the major Norwegian poet being Eyvindr sk\u00e1ldaspillir. By the late 10th century the tradition of skaldic verse had increasingly moved to Iceland and Norwegian rulers such as Eir\u00edkr H\u00e1konarson and St. Olaf employed mostly Icelandic poets.\nMedieval prose.\nIn pagan times the runic alphabet was the only one used in Norway. The preserved inscriptions from that time are mostly short memorial dedications or magical formulas. One of the longest inscriptions is that on the 8th century Eggjum stone, containing cryptic religious or magical allusions. Around the years 1000 to 1030, Christianity became established in Norway, bringing with it the Latin alphabet. The oldest preserved Norwegian prose works are from the mid-12th century, the earliest are Latin hagiographical and historical texts such as \"Passio Olavi\", \"Acta sanctorum in Selio\", \"Historia Norwegie\" and \"Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium\". At the end of the 12th century, historical writing expanded to the vernacular with \"\u00c1grip af N\u00f3regskonungas\u00f6gum\" followed by the \"Legendary Saga of St. Olaf\" and \"Fagrskinna\".\nMedieval Norwegian literature is closely tied with medieval Icelandic literature, and together, they are considered Old Norse literature. The greatest Norse author of the 13th century was the Icelander Snorri Sturluson. He recorded Norse mythology in the form of the \"Prose Edda\", a book of poetic language providing an important understanding of Norse culture prior to Christianity. He was also the author of the \"Heimskringla\", a detailed history of the Norwegian kings that begins in the legendary \"Ynglinga saga\" and continues to document much of early Norwegian history.\nThe period of common Old Norse literature continued up through the 13th century with Norwegian contributions such as \"Thidreks saga\" and \"Konungs skuggsj\u00e1\" but by the 14th century saga writing was no longer cultivated in Norway and Icelandic literature became increasingly isolated.\n\"Four Hundred Years of Darkness\".\nNorwegian literature was virtually nonexistent during the period of the Scandinavian Union and the subsequent Dano-Norwegian union (1387\u20131814). Ibsen characterized this period as \"Four Hundred Years of Darkness\". During the period of union with Denmark, Danish replaced Norwegian. The university and cultural center of Denmark\u2013Norway was Copenhagen, where young men went to study.\nThe reformation was imposed on Norway in 1537 and the Dano-Norwegian rulers used it to also impose Danish culture; this was effected through the pulpit as well as through written records, as pastors were trained in Copenhagen. Thus, written Norwegian became closely related to Danish, causing the literature to become essentially Danish. Geble Pedersson (c.1490\u20131557) was the first Lutheran Bishop of Bergen and a man of broad humanistic views; his adopted son, Absalon Pederss\u00f8n Beyer (1528\u20131575), followed in his footsteps as a humanist and a nationalist, writing an important historical work, \"Concerning the Kingdom of Norway\" (1567). Peder Clauss\u00f8n Friis (1545\u20131615) was also a humanist who both revived the \"Heimskringla\" by translating it into the language of the period and wrote the first natural history of Norway as well as an important topographic study of Norway.\nThe seventeenth century was a period of meager literary activity in Norway, but there were significant contributions. Petter Dass (1647\u20131707) wrote \"Nordlands Trompet\" (The Trumpet of Nordland) which described in graphic verse the landscape, mode of life, conditions and character of the northern Norwegian people. Two other authors merit mention. Dorothe Engelbretsdotter (1634\u20131713), was Norway's first recognized woman author who wrote powerful religious poetry. Her first work, \"Si\u00e6lens Sang-offer\", was published in 1678. \"Taare-Offer\" was her second collected works and was published for the first time in 1685. Another gifted poet was Anders Arrebo who translated the Psalms into Norwegian and composed the creation poem, \"Hexaemeron\".\nNorway also contributed significantly to the joint literature of Denmark\u2013Norway. One of the first names in Danish literature, Peder Clauss\u00f8n Friis (1545\u20131614), was Norwegian-born. Other important Norwegian by birth 'Danish' authors of the period included Ludvig Holberg (Bergen, 1684\u20131754), Christian Tullin (Christiania, 1728\u20131765), and Johan Herman Wessel (1742\u20131785).\nRebirth.\nTwo major events precipitated a major resurgence in Norwegian literature. In 1811, a Norwegian university was established in Christiania (later renamed Oslo). Seized by the spirit of revolution following the American and French Revolutions, as well as bridling as a result of the forced separation from Denmark and subordination to Sweden subsequent to the Napoleonic wars, Norwegians signed their first constitution in 1814. Virtually immediately, the cultural backwater that was Norway brought forth a series of strong authors recognized first in Scandinavia, and then worldwide.\nHenrik Wergeland is generally recognized as the father of a new Norwegian literature. The enthusiastic nationalism of Wergeland and his young following brought conflict with the establishment, which was unwilling to accept everything as good, simply because it was Norwegian.\nThis period also saw collection of Norwegian folk tales by Peter Asbj\u00f8rnsen and Bishop J\u00f8rgen Moe. This collection, which paralleled those by the Brothers Grimm in Germany and Hans Christian Andersen in Denmark, captured an important overview of the folk culture of the mountains and fjords.\nAt least as important in the creation of a Norwegian literature was the effort to introduce a pure Norwegian language, based on the dialects spoken in the areas more isolated from capital. The genius of Ivar Aasen (1813\u20131898) was at the heart of this effort. Aasen, a self-taught linguistic scholar and philologist, documented a written grammar and dictionary for the spoken Norwegian folk language, which became Nynorsk (New Norwegian) \u2013 the \"speech of the country\" as opposed to the official language largely imported from Denmark. Nynorsk is one of the two official written norms of the Norwegian language to this day.\nNational Romantic Period.\nBy the late 19th century, in a flood of nationalistic romanticism, the \"great four\" emerged: Henrik Ibsen, Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson, Alexander Kielland, and Jonas Lie. A unity of purpose pervades the whole period, creation of a national culture based on the almost forgotten and certainly neglected past, as well as celebration of the \"bondekultur\" or Norwegian farm culture. The realism of Kielland (e.g., \"Skipper Worse\") gave way to the romantic and nationalistic spirit which swept Europe and rekindled the Norwegian interest in their glorious Viking past (e.g., Ibsen's \"The Vikings at Helgeland\"), the struggles of the Middle Ages (e.g., Ibsen's \"Lady Inger of \u00d8steraad\"), peasant stories (e.g., Bj\u00f8rnson's \"A Happy Boy\") and the wonders of myths and folks tales of the mountains (e.g., Ibsen's \"Peer Gynt\") and the sea (e.g., Lie's \"The Visionary\").\nTransition to Realism.\nAlthough a strong contributor to early Norwegian romanticism, Henrik Ibsen is perhaps best known as an influential Norwegian playwright who was largely responsible for the popularity of modern realistic drama in Europe, with plays like \"The Wild Duck\" and \"A Doll's House\". In this, he built on a theme first evident in Norway with plays like Bj\u00f8rnson's \"En fallit\" (A Bankruptcy).\nEmigration Literature.\nAlthough a side note to the mainstream of Norwegian literature, the literature which documents the experience of Norwegian emigrants to America is as important as the Norwegian immigrants became to the growing America of the 19th century. Three authors are recognized in this genre; Ole R\u00f8lvaag wrote about immigrants, while Johan Bojer and Ingeborg Refling Hagen wrote about emigrants. Ole E. R\u00f8lvaag, who immigrated to America, experienced life in the prairies, and rose to become professor of Norwegian at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, provided a strong record of the joys and pains of the immigrant in adapting to the harsh realities of and carving out a new life in a wild new country. Norwegian author Johan Bojer provided a mirror image, depicting the struggles and processes which led to the decisions to emigrate. Ingeborg Refling Hagen, having two brothers and a sister in the United States contemplated the emigrant's longing for home and their harsh struggle \"over there\" in a known collection of emigrant poems from 1935.\nModernism in Norway.\nModernist literature was introduced to Norway through the literature of Knut Hamsun and Sigbj\u00f8rn Obstfelder in the 1890s. In the 1930s, Emil Boyson, Gunnar Larsen, Haakon Bugge Mahrt, Rolf Stenersen and Edith \u00d8berg were among the Norwegian authors who experimented with prose modernism. The books of the 1930s did not receive the same recognition as modernist works after the war. In 1947, Tarjei Vesaas published a poetry collection, \"Leiken og lynet\", that led to major debate about the shape and rhythm for Norwegian poetry. This evolved further in the 1950s. Rolf Jacobsen achieved recognition as a poet of modernistic style after the war. Kristofer Uppdal was also recognized for his work.\nThe Twentieth Century.\nAfter the death of the great four and Amalie Skram, a new period of Norwegian literature took place. The year 1905, when Norway was free from the union with Sweden, marks a new period in the history of Norwegian literature. In the 20th century, three Norwegian novelists won the Nobel Prize in Literature. The first was Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson, whose prize reflected work of the previous century. The second was awarded to Knut Hamsun for the idealistic novel \"Markens Gr\u00f8de\" (Growth of the Soil, 1917) in 1920. The third was Sigrid Undset for the trilogy of Kristin Lavransdatter and the two books of Olav Audunss\u00f8n, in 1927.\nKnut Hamsun was especially criticized because of his sympathy for Nasjonal Samling, a Norwegian Nazi-party, during the Second World War.\nOther important Norwegian writers include: Trygve Gulbranssen, Jens Bj\u00f8rneboe, Agnar Mykle, Olav Duun, Cora Sandel, Kjartan Fl\u00f8gstad, Arne Garborg, Aksel Sandemose, Tarjei Vesaas, Lars Saabye Christensen, Kjell Askildsen, Johan Borgen, Dag Solstad, Herbj\u00f8rg Wassmo, Jon Fosse, Hans Herbj\u00f8rnsrud, Jan Erik Vold, Roy Jacobsen, Bergljot Hob\u00e6k Haff, Hans E. Kinck, Olav H. Hauge, Rolf Jacobsen, Gunvor Hofmo, Arnulf \u00d8verland, Sigbj\u00f8rn Obstfelder, Olaf Bull, Aasmund Olavsson Vinje, Tor Ulven, Torborg Nedreaas, Stein Mehren, Jan Kj\u00e6rstad, Georg Johannesen, Kristofer Uppdal, Aslaug Vaa, Halldis Moren Vesaas, Sigurd Hoel, Johan Falkberget, Hans B\u00f8rli and Axel Jensen.\nThe Post-war Period (1945\u20131965).\nThe literature in the first years after the Second World War was characterized by a long series of documentary reports from people who had been in German custody, or who had participated in the resistance efforts during the occupation. The most famous among these were Lise B\u00f8rsums's \"Fange i Ravensbr\u00fcck\", Odd Nansen's \"Fra dag til dag\" (From Day to Day) and the posthumously published \"Petter Moens dagbok\" (Petter Moen's diary). Some years later, biographies of heroes of resistance, such as Fridtjof S\u00e6len's \"Shetlands-Larsen\", about Leif Andreas Larsen, and David Armin Howarth's \"Ni liv. Historien om Jan Baalsrud\" (Nine Lives \u2013 the story of Jan Baalsrud), became major publishing successes.\nFiction of the period also centered on the war. Sigurd Evensmo's \"Englandsfarere\" (published in English as \"A Boat for England\") about a group of resistance fighters who are captured. Tarjei Vesaas symbolically addressed the war experience in \"Huset i m\u00f8rkret\" (The House in the Dark). A significant portion of the post-war literature was concerned with the question of why some remained good Norwegian patriots while others, seemingly ordinary people, served the enemy. Examples of this include Sigurd Hoel's \"M\u00f8te ved milepelen\" from 1947, K\u00e5re Holt's \"Det store veiskillet\" (The Big Fork) from 1949 and Aksel Sandemose's \"Varulven\" (The Werewolf) from 1958, which provide psychological explanations for collaboration.\nPoetry written during the war, which had either been broadcast from London or had circulated illegally, was published as collections in the spring of 1945, and enjoyed a popularity that Norwegian poetry has not seen before or since. In particular Arnulf \u00d8verland's \"Vi overlever alt\" (We survive everything) and Nordahl Grieg's \"Friheten\" (Freedom) were well received. Some of those who were young during the war found that the traditional lyrical forms were insufficient to express horrors of war, atomic bombs and the emerging Cold War. Gunvor Hofmo, who was personally affected by the war, came with the remarkable collections \"Jeg vil hjem til menneskene\" (I Want to Go Home to the People) and \"Fra en annen virkelighet\" (From an Alternate Reality).\nModernism appeared on a broad front in the Norwegian poetry of the 1950s. It impacted the lyrics produced by Tarjei Vesaas, Ernst Orvil, Astrid Tollefsen and Olav H. Hauge. Among the younger poets, such as Astrid Hjerten\u00e6s Andersen, Paal Brekke, Hans B\u00f8rli, Harald Sverdrup and Marie Takvam, free verse was the preferred form. Paal Brekke was modernism's foremost advocate against traditionalists \u2013 such as Arnulf \u00d8verland and Andr\u00e9 Bjerke \u2013 in a wide-ranging debate about poetic forms which is recognized as the \"speaking-in-tongues debate\". Georg Johannesen's first publication \"Dikt\" (Poetry) in 1959 introduced a new interest in political and social values, that had not been particularly evident in the 1950s. At the same time, the well-established poet, Rolf Jacobsen, espoused a more critical attitude to the consumer mentality and environmental destruction.\nIn prose, first and foremost it was Jens Bj\u00f8rneboe who led the attack on the establishment in the 1950s. In \"Jonas\" and \"Den onde hyrde\" (The Evil Shepherd) he attacks the school and prison systems, arguing that there the government shows its authoritarian aspects particularly clearly. One of the highlights of 1950s prose literature is Johan Borgen's \"Lillelord\" trilogy. Borgen' work is characterized by an experimental prose-writing style, which can be seen in several short story collections as well as the experimental novel \"Jeg\" (I) from 1959. Another highlight of 1950s literature was two controversial novels by Agnar Mykle's about Ask Burlefot: \"Lasso rundt fru Luna\" (published in English as \"Lasso Around The Moon\") and \"Sangen om den r\u00f8de rubin\" (The Song of the Red Ruby). But as a result of legal intervention against the latter book, the pressure of the court case and surrounding controversy left Mykle a reclusive who published little thereafter. Axel Jensen was another fresh, new voice in the 1950s. In his debut novels \"Ikaros\" and \"Line\" the young protagonist comes to terms with nonsocialistic members of the Social Democratic welfare state. Jensen also introduced a new theme in Norwegian literature with the publication of \"Epp\" in 1965; this novel dealt with a future dystopia.\nBesides Johan Borgen, Tarjei Vesaas and Torborg Nedreaas also achieved recognition as excellent short story writers. In 1953, Kjell Askildsen debuted with the short story collection \"Heretter f\u00f8lger jeg deg helt hjem\" (From now on I'll walk you all the way home). He has since remained at short prose genre, and is today considered one of Norwegian literature's finest short story writers.\nPolitical awareness and social realism (1965\u20131980).\nThe period after 1965 represented a sharp expansion of market for Norwegian fiction. In 1965, Norway instituted a policy for purchasing new literature. The state committed to purchase 1000 copies of each new title of Norwegian literature (conditioned on it meeting minimum standards). These were distributed among the country's libraries. This, combined with the creation of the book club \"Bokklubben Nye B\u00f8ker\" (New Books) in 1976 produced increased vitality in the country's literary production.\nThe 1970s produced both politicization and empowerment of Norwegian authors as a group \u2013 as well as intellectuals in general. The Norwegian Authors' Union became an arena for political struggle as well as the struggle for academic authors' rights. At one point the author's union split into two camps. Around the country the authors organized themselves in the regional author's organizations, and started a number of literary journals, in which contributions by amateur writers were welcomed.\n\"Profil\" would eventually become the most-notable literary magazine. From 1965, it published the work of a number of young writers who would put their distinct mark on the literature of the period. The \"Profil\" goal was to bring Norwegian literature abreast of European literature in general. To achieve this, they rebelled against the traditional psychological novel development. The question of the true identify for the modern state was core. Dag Solstad contributed significantly to this late-1960s figures modernism through his articles, essays and literary works.\nPoetry already exhibited a modernist style, which was prevalent through the 1950s and early 1960s. Traditionalists who still wrote in fixed stanza forms were out of favor. The younger poets targeted replacing the 1950s-style symbolism, and Jan Erik Vold was at the forefront of this insurgency. Profil poetry introduced a new simplicity, concretism, and use of everyday language. Paal Brekke was particularly noted for promoting modern European poetry, both as poet and critic. He argued for a renewal of Norwegian poetry, and spread knowledge of foreign literature through translations of English modernist writers like T.S.Eliot. In the mid-1950s, Brekke participated in the debate on lyrical form, and opposed Andr\u00e9 Bjerke and Arnulf \u00d8verland in the so-called \"Glossolalia debate\". Among the established lyrists, Olav H. Hauge transitioned to modernistic and concretist poetry and enjoyed a renaissance, especially with his collection entitled \"Dropar in austavind,\" which inspired other, younger Norwegian poets, such as Jan Erik Vold.\nAfter a short period the \"Profil\" group went separate routes, as authors such as Dag Solstad, Espen Haavardsholm, and Tor Obrestad turned to the newly formed party Workers' Communist Party (\"Arbeidernes kommunistparti\" or AKP), and become involved in formulating a new political program that based on the view that literature should serve the working people and their uprising against capitalism. Arild Asnes Solstad's \"1970\" is a key novel to understanding the desire of the modern intellectual to connect with something larger and more realistic \u2013 the working people and a cause.\nThere were few AKP-authors, yet they managed to set a major part of the agenda for Norwegian fiction through much of the 1970s. Some authors began to write novels and poems in a language targeted so that people could recognize themselves, often known as social realism literature. Well-known works in this genre include Solstad's \"25. septemberplassen\", Obrestad's \"Sauda! Streik!\" and Haavardsholm's \"Historiens kraftlinjer\".\nEven though a minority wrote AKP-themed literature, there was a general willingness of the larger community of authors to support this literary focus. Besides the class struggle, there were two areas that were subject of serious literature: feminism and the struggle against the concentration of governmental power into a centralized government.\nThe term feminist literature or woman's literature was shifting during this period. While some believed that a special term for literature written for women by women about women's experiences were necessary, others were concerned that feminist literature served to place the female writers and readers outside the community, in an isolated cycle. Notwithstanding the debate, important contributions came from new, female authors about women unsatisfactory role in the family and in society. Liv K\u00f8ltzow's \"Hvem bestemmer over Liv og Unni?\" (Who decides for Liv and Unni?) is central to understanding the new woman's literature. Bj\u00f8rg Vik contributed a long series of short story collections and the play \"To akter for fem kvinner\" (Two acts for five women). Both K\u00f8ltzow's and Vik's work stayed with the realistic tradition. Later Cecilie L\u00f8veid and Eldrid Lunden created work with a more rebellious language representing a fresh genre of experimental work. L\u00f8veid's work is notably committed to finding a new language for a new female role.\nBeyond social realism (1980\u20132000).\nThe decade of the 1980s was in many ways a response to the social realism in 1970s literature. In 1983, Kaj Skagen published a polemical-philosophical treatise titled \"Bazarovs barn\" (\"Bazarov's Children\", alluding to the Russian fictional nihilist Eugene Bazarov), which reconciled the role of authors who had been on the periphery in the 1970s. Skagen advocated for a more individual-oriented and idealistic literature. Although it is uncertain whether this book created or simplify reflected the transition, many of the 1970s authors shifted in new directions during the 1980s. Dag Solstad published two novels which were retrospectives on the Workers' Communist Party. Espen Haavardsholm wrote a novel titled \"Drift\" and Edvard Hoem authored \"Pr\u00f8vetid\". All these works focused on middle-aged men who live through the crises of life, while struggling to find new footing. Similarly Knut Faldbakken's novels about the change of men's roles during the women's revolution in the 1970s reflected the new direction.\nThe 1980s generated several major novels that develop a main theme over decades, are centered on a strong-central character person and are built around rural milieu or a local community of a not too distant past. Examples include Lars Saabye Christensen's \"Beatles\", Tove Nilsen's \"Skyskraperengler\" (Skyscraper Angels), Ingvar Ambj\u00f8rnsen's \"Hvite niggere\" (White Niggers), Gerd Brantenberg's St.Croix trilogy, Herbj\u00f8rg Wassmo's Tora-trilogy and Roy Jacobsen's \"Seierherrene\".\nThe 1980s have also been labeled the \"fantasy decade\" in Norwegian literature. A number of authors, including Kjartan Fl\u00f8gstad, Mari Osmundsen, Hans Herbj\u00f8rnsrud, Arild Nyquist, Jan Kj\u00e6rstad and Ragnar Hovland produced works with magical, fantastic or improbable elements. Literature written for children and young people also included fantastic elements; Tormod Haugen is the most notable contributor to this genre.\nA large number of 1980s authors displayed a high degree of literary consciousness. Many of the new authors in this decade were formally educated in literature, philosophy and other academic subjects at the many schools or institutes for writers established throughout Norway. Many novels generated internal conflicts with the text itself or with other texts, and the protagonists was represented as a writer, scientist or artist. Jan Kj\u00e6rstad's \"Homo Falsus\" is perhaps the foremost of these 1980s meta-novels, Karin Moe's \"KYKA/1984\" another. Ole Robert Sunde and Liv Nysted also produced works in this genre. Another consequence of more academically oriented authors was the large number of essay collections published in recent years; these often provide an authors' interpretations of other authors or reflections on other forms of art.\nThe period showed a rising interest in crime literature. Jon Michelet, Gunnar Staalesen, Kim Sm\u00e5ge and Fredrik Skagen all were well appreciated by Norwegian readers. In the 1990s female crime writers such as Karin Fossum and Anne Holt had great success \u2013 the latter's works featured a female investigator. Interest in crime has in no way decreased since the turn of the millennium, and a number of writers have either specialized in crime or have alternated between crime and other prose. Jo Nesb\u00f8, Kurt Aust, Unni Lindell, Tom Egeland, Tom Kristensen, J\u00f8rn Lier Horst, Stein Morten Lier and Kjell Ola Dahl are among the authors in this category. A stream of translated crime, especially from Sweden and Britain, have influenced Norwegian authors of this genre.\nAnother clear trend is an interest in biographies, especially of authors and artists. Many of the significant living writers during the 1980s have written one or more biographies of deceased artist or other colleagues. In addition, several significant biographies were written. \"The Fall of the Sun God. Knut Hamsun\" by J\u00f8rgen Haugan and Ingar Sletten Kolloen's Knut Hamsun biography received great attention. There is a trend in these modern biographies \u2013 similar to today's cinema and unlike the past \u2013 to use source material of a private character.\nIn poetry Rolf Jacobsen's \"Natt\u00e5pent\" sold almost 20,000 copies and Harald Sverdrup's \"Lysets \u00f8yeblikk\" was also very well received. Stein Mehren, Tor Ulven and Paal-Helge Haugen also published significant collections of poetry during this decade. Jan Erik Vold wrote some of his most political poetry, reminiscent of the 1970s, during the 1990s. The new and emerging poetry shows great diversity. However, only the rare collection of poetry achieves substantial sales or circulation. Poetry can be said to be in a crisis state, unlike newer novels, which often are published in large quantities as the month's book for book clubs.\nTheater audiences show only moderate interest in new Norwegian plays. Hence drama has been overshadowed by prose and poetry, with one exception: Jon Fosse. Fosse, through the 1990s and later, has achieved an international acclaim not enjoyed by any other Norwegian playwright since Ibsen.\n21st century.\nKarl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd had worldwide success with his six-volume series of autobiographical novels entitled \"My Struggle\" (\"Min kamp\" in Norwegian) and was described by Wall Street Journal as \"one of the 21st-century's greatest literary sensations\". Knausg\u00e5rd is also the author of novels (\"Ute av verden\", \"En tid for alt\", \"Morgenstjernen\"), the autobiographical \"The Seasons Quartet\" and essay collections.\nComics.\nNorway has a distinct comic strip and single-panel comic culture that it shares with Sweden.\nStory-driven comics with local themes were popular in the postwar years, including Vangsgutane, Jens von Bustenskjold and Sm\u00f8rbukk. However, they gradually faded out of popularity, leading to several decades with no major locally produced comics (with the partial exception of Pyton). Starting in the early 1990s, a large number of strip comics were born from the local hype that had surrounded such US strip comics as Calvin &amp; Hobbes, Piranha Club and Beetle Bailey. Significant names include Frode \u00d8verli (\"Pondus\", \"Rutetid\"), Lars Lauvik (\"Eon\", \"Wildlife\"), Mads Eriksen (\"M\"), Lise Myhre (\"Nemi\"), \u00d8yvind Sagosen (\"Radio Gaga\"), and the duo Emberland &amp; Sveen (\"Sleivdal IL\").\nStarting out with a focus on slapstick comedy, Norwegian comic strips gradually focused more on relationships and family life from the late 2000s onwards, leading to the creation of additional comic strips made by names like Hanne Sigbj\u00f8rnsen (\"Tegnehanne\") and Nils Axle Kanten (\"Hjalmar\").\nElectronic literature.\nHans Kristian Rustad's book \"Digital litteratur\" (2012) provides an overview of early Norwegian electronic literature. See also the Nordic Electronic Literature Collection in the ELMCIP Electronic Literature Knowledge Base. Significant authors include Ottar Ormstad and Anne Bang Steinsvik.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2006, 79% of the population had access to internet at home, rising to 95% by 2012.\nNorway was the first non-English-speaking country on the net. In 1971 NORSAR (Norwegian Seismic Array) at Kjeller just outside Oslo was connected by satellite to the SDAC (Seismic Data Analysis Center) in Virginia, US as part of ARPANET in order to monitor nuclear test-ban treaties with the Soviet Union.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Norway has old water transport traditions, but road, rail and air transport have increased in importance during the 20th century. Due to the low population density, public transport is somewhat less built out in rural areas of Norway, however public transport in and around cities is well developed.\nThe main governing body is the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, which performs operations through numerous subsidiaries. Tasks related to public transport and some roads have been delegated to the counties and municipalities. Most infrastructure is publicly owned, while most operations are performed by private companies; public transport is subsidized.\nOn average each Norwegian transported themselves for 70 minutes each day. In 2008 8% of passenger transport was made by public transport; road transport is the dominant mode of transport. It had risen to 10% in 2017. In 2014 22% of travel was on foot and 4% by bicycle. The transport sector was responsible for 4.1% of the gross national product and 6.6% of employment in 2006. According to the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013, Norway placed 83 out of 140 countries regarding quality of roads, 47 out of 122 regarding quality of railroad infrastructure, 25 out of 140 regarding quality of port infrastructure and 54 out of 140 regarding ground transport networks.\nCivil aviation.\nAviation has become an important passenger transport mode since the 1960s. Aircraft is the commonly used mode of transport on longer distances, and the routes between Oslo and Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger are all among the largest in Europe. On long distances, such as Oslo-Bod\u00f8 and longer, air travel is by far the leading travel method. In Western and Northern Norway, with difficult terrain, obstacling fjords and lack of rail transport, regional airline travel provides quick travel within the region or to the capital.\nMajor airlines based in Norway are Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Wider\u00f8e.\nAirports.\nOf the 98 airports in Norway, 51 are public, and 46 are operated by the state-owned Avinor. Seven airports have more than one million passengers annually. 41,089,675 passengers passed through Norwegian airports in 2007, of which 13,397,458 were international.\nThe main gateway by air to Norway is Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, located about north of Oslo with departures to most European countries and some intercontinental destinations. It is hub for the three major Norwegian airlines Scandinavian Airlines System, Norwegian Air Shuttle, and Wider\u00f8e and for regional aircraft from Western Norway.\nHeliports are common at hospitals and oil platforms. The Norwegian Air Ambulance service operates twelve helicopters and nine airplanes.\nRegional aviation.\nThe regional airport service was introduced in the 1960s, with 30 airports being served by short take-off and landing aircraft. These are located mainly in Sogn og Fjordane and Northern Norway, in areas with long distances to large cities and with too little traffic to support commercial flights. The airports, which typically have an runway, are run by Avinor, while the airplanes are operated based on subsidized public service obligation contracts with the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. by the far largest contractor is Wider\u00f8e with their fleet of de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft, but also Danish Air Transport, Lufttransport and Kato Airline have won bids. The flights operate from one or more regional airports to larger hubs; in Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, Bod\u00f8, Troms\u00f8 and Kirkenes. One service, to V\u00e6r\u00f8y Heliport, is served by helicopter. 1,214,508 passengers passed through the regional airports in 2012.\nRail transport.\nThe main railway network consists of of standard gauge lines, of which is double track and high-speed rail (210\u00a0km/h) while 62% is electrified at 15\u00a0kV \u200a16.7\u00a0Hz AC. The railways transported 56,827,000 passengers 2,956 million passenger kilometers and 24,783,000 tonnes of cargo 3,414 million tonne kilometers.\nThe main long-haul network consists of lines from Oslo and westwards along the South Coast to Stavanger and over the mountains to Bergen; and north to \u00c5ndalsnes and via Trondheim to Bod\u00f8. Four lines connect to Sweden, allowing access to the European network. The only high-speed line is Gardermobanen, connecting Oslo to The Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, but plans exist to build more high-speed lines in Eastern Norway, and possibly to other parts of Norway. The entire network is owned by the Bane NOR, while domestic passenger trains are operated by the Airport Express Train, Go-Ahead Nordic, SJ Norge and Vy. Several companies operate freight trains.\nInvestment in new infrastructure and maintenance is financed through the state budget, and subsidies are provided for passenger train operations. NSB operates long-haul trains, including night trains, regional services and four commuter train systems, around Oslo, Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger.\nRail transit.\nTramways operate in Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen. The only rapid transit system is the Oslo T-bane, while the only funicular is in Bergen. The rail transits are operated by the counties, and the ticket system is integrated into the bus transport. In Oslo the two systems make the backbone of the Ruter public transport system, giving Oslo by far the highest public transport share of 20%. Local trains on the railway is operated by NSB, but monthly passes are integrated into the local transit ticket system.\nIn 2007, 101 million passengers were transported 490 million passenger kilometers by rail transit.\nRoad transport.\nNorway has a road network of , of which are paved and are motorway. There are four tiers of road routes; national, county, municipal and private, with national and primary county roads numbered en route. The most important national routes are part of the European route scheme, and the two most prominent are the E6 going north-south through the entire country, while E39 follows the West Coast. An improved E39 coastal highway is currently under development to improve the route and reduce the driving time from 21 hours. It is expected to be completed in 2033 with a series of new tunnels and bridges, including Rogfast, a under sea tunnel that will link Stavanger and Haugesund. National and county roads are managed by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration.\nMotorways exist around the largest cities; many of the larger cities have introduced toll schemes to help finance roads. In 2008, 130 ferry routes remained in service, operated by private companies on contract with the Public Roads Administration. Since the 1970s the heaviest rural investments have been mainland connections to replace the many car ferries that are needed to cross fjords and connect to islands. There are not enough funding through tax money, so these tunnels and bridges are normally financed mainly through toll fees. Some mountain passes have severe snowstorm problems in the winter, so often they have to be closed, or cars have to drive after a snowplow in a column. The most exposed mountain passes are closed the entire winter.\nIn 2007 there were 2.6 million automobiles in Norway, or 444 per 1000 residents, an increase of 27% the last ten years\u2014average age was 10.2 years. Road accidents killed 242 people and road transport caused 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Between 2007 and 2011, diesel cars constituted over 70% of new cars, and fell to 40% in 2015. Trucks transported 264 million tonnes 15 billion tonne kilometers.\nNorway has the world's largest registered stock of plug-in electric vehicles per capita, with Oslo recognized as the EV capital of the world. In March 2014, Norway became the first country where over 1 in every 100 passenger cars on the roads is a plug-in electric. Norway's fleet of electric cars is one of the cleanest in the world because almost 100% of the electricity generated in the country comes from hydropower. As of \u00a02014,[ [update]] a total of 43,442 plug-in electric vehicles were registered in Norway, of which, almost 95% are all-electric vehicles. The Norwegian plug-in electric segment has the world's highest market share of new car sales, with 5.6% in 2013, and 12.5% in 2014.[ [update]]\nBus transport.\nEach county is responsible for the public bus and boat transport in their area, (railways, regional airlines and the Coastal Express boat, are financed by the state). Buses transported 290 million passengers 3.7 billion passenger kilometers in 2007. 6,194 buses were in operation during 2007; tickets sales was NOK 3,721 million while bus transport received government subsidies of NOK 3,393 million.\nBus and passenger boat services are normally operated by private companies on contract with the county or their public transport authority (such as Ruter or Vestviken Kollektivtrafikk). Tickets and tickets prices are organised by these authorities. Some of them have special brand names and connected painting of the buses, especially in bigger cities. Other counties, especially smaller, don't use brand names and let the operators decide bus paint.\nLong-haul coach services are operated by various companies, most of whom cooperate through NOR-WAY Bussekspress. In Northern Norway (mostly from Fauske Municipality and further north) long-haul buses are operated by the counties.\nWater transport.\nThe coastal infrastructure is operated by the Norwegian Coastal Administration, while ports are operated by the municipalities. Norway has of shoreline, 400,000 leisure craft and a 715 ships in the merchant marine.\nMerchant marine.\nIn 2007 Norway was the fifth largest beneficial ship owning country, with 5% of the world's fleet; though a high portion of these were registered in flags of convenience, Norway had 15 million deadweight tonnage of ships under its flag. The government has created an internal register, the Norwegian International Ship Register (NIS), as a subset of the Norwegian Ship Register; ships on the NIS enjoy many benefits of flags of convenience and do not have to be crewed by Norwegians.\nFerries.\nCar ferries are vital links across fjords and to islands where there are no fixed connections. There are more than one hundred car ferry connections inside Norway. Fast passenger ferries operate many places where fjords and islands make it quicker to follow the waterways than the roads; some small islands are served by water buses. Public transport by ship transported eight million passengers 273 million passenger kilometers in 2007.\nWith the large amount of hydroelectricity in Norway, battery-electric ferries have been introduction on several routes. Of Norway's 180 ferries on 112 ferry routes, a study by Siemens and the Bellona Foundation identified 127 could be replaced with either fully electric or hybrid ferries.\nThe Coastal Express (known as Hurtigruten) operates daily cruiseferries from Bergen to Kirkenes, calling at 35 ports. International car carrying cruiseferries operate from Southern Norway to Denmark, Germany and Sweden.\nPipelines.\nThe petroleum and natural gas production on the Norwegian continental shelf uses pipelines to transport produce to processing plants on mainland Norway and other European countries; total length is . The government-owned Gassco operates all natural gas pipelines; in 2006, 88 billion cubic meters were transported, or 15% of European consumption\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57620", "revid": "7447121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57620", "title": "Foreign relations of Norway", "text": " \nThe foreign relations of Norway are based on the country's membership in NATO and within the workings of the United Nations (UN). Additionally, despite not being a member of the European Union (EU), Norway takes a part in the integration of EU through its membership in the European Economic Area. Norway's foreign ministry includes both the minister of foreign affairs and minister of international development.\nHistory.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established on the same day that Norway declared the dissolution of the union with Sweden: June 7, 1905. Although diplomats could not present credentials to foreign governments until the Swedish king formally renounced his right to the Norwegian throne, a number of unofficial representatives worked on the provisional government's behalf until the first Norwegian ambassador, Hjalmar Christian Hauge, sought accreditation by the United States Secretary of State Elihu Root on November 6, 1905.\nThe initial purposes of the newly formed Foreign Ministry were to represent Norway's interests through diplomatic channels, and to provide consular services for Norwegian shipping and commerce overseas. In 1906, the Storting decided to establish six embassies in Europe, with two more in the Americas: one in the United States and one in Argentina. 20 consular offices were also opened.\nDuring World War I, the foreign ministry was confronted with unprecedented challenges in maintaining neutrality for Norway, in particular in order to protect its merchant fleet.\nIn 1922, the ministry was consolidated and reorganised to ensure fuller cooperation between the diplomatic and consular branches. The reorganization included the formation of a designated career path for diplomats that included completion of a university entrance examination and professional experience from international trade. The economic hardship of the times forced austerity measures at the ministry for the next several years.\nWhen Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, the government fled to the United Kingdom and reconstituted in exile in Bracknell, outside London. Kingston House in London was later used. The government moved back to Norway following the peace in 1945.\nAfter the end of World War II, Norway was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations, the latter having Norwegian Trygve Lie as inaugural Secretary-General. Norway was also part of the first slate of non-permanent members to the United Nations Security Council.\nElements of policy.\nSince the end of the Cold War, Norway has developed a model to foreign policy known as the \"Norwegian model,\" the goal of which is to contribute to peace and stability through coordinated response among governmental and non-governmental Norwegian organizations; acting as an honest broker in international conflicts; an informal network of Norwegian individuals with access and credibility among parties; and the willingness to take the long view in international issues.\nThe post-war foreign policy of Norway can be described along four dimensions:\nStrategic alliances.\nNorway's strategic importance for waging war in the North Atlantic became important in the failed neutrality policy of World War II. Norway became a founding member of NATO in order to ally itself with countries that shared its democratic values. Both through diplomatic and military cooperation, Norway has played a visible role in the formation and operations of NATO. It allowed a limited number of military bases and exercises to be based in its territories, which caused some controversy when NATO decided to put forward bases in Northern Norway in preparation for a conflict with the Soviet Union.\nInternational cooperation.\nNorway supports international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of disputes, recognizing the need for maintaining a strong national defence through collective security. Accordingly, the cornerstones of Norwegian policy are active membership in NATO and support for the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Norway also pursues a policy of economic, social, and cultural cooperation with other Nordic countries\u2014Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland\u2014through the Nordic Council. Its relations with Iceland are very close due to the cultural bond the two nations share. Norway ended a 2-year term on the UN Security Council in January 2003, and chaired the Iraq Sanctions Committee.\nNorway, along with Iceland and the Faroe Islands, is not a member of the European Union, . Membership of the EU has been proposed within Norway, and referendums over Norwegian membership were held in 1972 and 1994. Popular opinion was split between rural and urban areas. \"See Norway and the European Union.\" The present government is not planning to raise the possibility for future membership.\nNorway also has a history of co-operation and friendship with the United Kingdom and Scotland, due to their shared cultural heritage since Viking times. The Vikings conquered areas including the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland for several hundred years. Norway is only 300 kilometres (159 Nautical miles) east of Unst, the northernmost island of Shetland. The Norwegian embassy to the United Kingdom is located in London, and Norway also maintains a Consulate General in Edinburgh. A Norway Spruce is given by the city of Oslo and presented to London as a Christmas tree for display in Trafalgar Square as a token of gratitude for the UK's support during World War II. King Haakon, his son Crown Prince Olav and the country's government lived in exile in London throughout the war. As part of the tradition, the Lord Mayor of Westminster visits Oslo in the late autumn to take part in the felling of the tree, and the Mayor of Oslo then goes to London to light the tree at the Christmas ceremony.\nOn 25 April 2022, Norwegian foreign minister visited Bangladesh as part of her two-day trip in order to broaden economic partnership through trade, investment and maritime sector cooperation.\nInternational mediation and nation building.\nNorway has played an active role as a third party mediator in a number of international conflicts. The late foreign minister Johan J\u00f8rgen Holst was instrumental in forging the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO. Thorvald Stoltenberg was part of the unsuccessful mediation team in seeking an end to the war in Bosnia. Norway has contributed both mediation services and financial assistance in Guatemala.\nAs of 2005, Norwegian diplomats are acting as mediators in Sudan, Bosnia, Sri Lanka, and Colombia. Some of those countries accuse Norway of supporting and propping up separatist groups. Israel is often bitter with harsh criticisms from Norwegian politicians. The spat was at its highest when finance minister Kristin Halvorsen supported boycott of Israeli goods. in early 2006. Finance ministry spokesman, Runar Malkenes, told BBC News that \"there are no moves to push for a boycott of Israeli goods\" at government level. Eritrea has been actively supported by Norway during its liberation from Ethiopia. As of recent, Ethiopia expelled six Norwegian diplomats due to Norway's alleged support to 'Terrorist group and Eritrea'. Norway retaliated by cutting aid to Ethiopia.\nAfter the Al-Qaeda attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, NATO launched a military invasion to overthrow Al-Qaeda and its Taliban sponsors. Norway was one of 51 donors providing aid and assistance to rebuild the war-torn country. Norway had charge of Faryab Province. The Norwegian-led Provincial Reconstruction Team had the mission of effecting security, good governance and economic development, 2005\u20132012. But the results were dubious and frustration continued until the U.S. and all other countries finally decided to withdraw by 2021.\nInternational disputes.\nTerritorial claims in Antarctica (Queen Maud Land and Peter I Island) are only recognized by Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\nStatus-seeking.\nA number of scholars have argued that Norway has through its foreign policy engaged in status-seeking. Through an activist foreign policy, Norway has sought to elevate its standing among the international system's small powers and middle powers, and earn recognition from the great powers.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which Norway maintains diplomatic relations with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57621", "revid": "45135949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57621", "title": "Dragonfly", "text": "Raptorial winged insects\nA dragonfly is a flying insect belonging to the infraorder Anisoptera below the order Odonata. About 3,000 extant species of dragonflies are known. Most are tropical, with fewer species in temperate regions. Loss of wetland habitat threatens dragonfly populations around the world. Adult dragonflies are characterised by a pair of large, multifaceted, compound eyes, two pairs of strong, transparent wings, sometimes with coloured patches, and an elongated body. Many dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or metallic colours produced by structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. An adult dragonfly's compound eyes have nearly 24,000 ommatidia each.\nDragonflies can be mistaken for the closely related damselflies, which make up the other odonatan infraorder (Zygoptera) and are similar in body plan, though usually lighter in build; however, the wings of most dragonflies are held flat and away from the body, while damselflies hold their wings folded at rest, along or above the abdomen. Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker, fluttery flight. Dragonflies make use of motion camouflage when attacking prey or rivals.\nDragonflies are predatory insects, both in their aquatic nymphal stage (also known as \"naiads\") and as adults. In some species, the nymphal stage lasts up to five years, and the adult stage may be as long as 10 weeks, but most species have an adult lifespan in the order of five weeks or less, and some survive for only a few days. They are fast, agile fliers capable of highly accurate aerial ambush, sometimes migrating across oceans, and often live near water. They have a uniquely complex mode of reproduction involving indirect insemination, delayed fertilisation, and sperm competition. During mating, the male grasps the female at the back of the head, and the female curls her abdomen under her body to pick up sperm from the male's secondary genitalia at the front of his abdomen, forming the \"heart\" or \"wheel\" posture. \nFossils of very large dragonfly-like insects, sometimes called griffinflies, are found from 325\u00a0million years ago (Mya) in Upper Carboniferous rocks; these had wingspans up to about , though they were only distant relatives. True dragonflies first appeared during the Early Jurassic.\nDragonflies are represented in human culture on artefacts such as pottery, rock paintings, statues, and Art Nouveau jewellery. They are used in traditional medicine in Japan and China, and caught for food in Indonesia. They are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness in Japan, but seen as sinister in European folklore. Their bright colours and agile flight are admired in the poetry of Lord Tennyson and the prose of H. E. Bates.\nEtymology.\nThe infraorder Anisoptera comes from Greek \"anisos\" \"unequal\" and \"pteron\" \"wing\" because dragonflies' hindwings are broader than their forewings.\nEvolution.\nDragonflies and their relatives are similar in structure to an ancient group, the Meganisoptera or griffinflies, from the 325\u00a0Mya Upper Carboniferous of Europe. This group includes one of the largest insects that ever lived, \"Meganeuropsis permiana\" from the Early Permian, which had a wingspan of around . The Protanisoptera, another ancestral group that lacks certain wing-vein characters found in modern Odonata, lived in the Permian.\nAnisoptera first appeared during the Toarcian age of the Early Jurassic, and the crown group developed in the Middle Jurassic. They retain some traits of their distant predecessors, and are in a group known as the Palaeoptera, meaning 'ancient-winged'. Like the gigantic griffinflies, dragonflies lack the ability to fold their wings up against their bodies in the way that many modern insects can, although some evolved their own different way to do so. The forerunners of modern Odonata are included in a clade called the Panodonata, which include the basal Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (true dragonflies). Today, some 3,000\u00a0species are extant around the world.\nThe relationships of anisopteran families are not fully resolved as of 2021, but all the families are monophyletic except the Corduliidae, and the Aeshnoidea are sister to the remaining families:\nDistribution and diversity.\nAbout 3,012 species of dragonflies were known in 2010; these are classified into 348 genera in 11 families. The distribution of diversity within the biogeographical regions is summarized below (the world numbers are not ordinary totals, as overlaps in species occur).\nDragonflies live on every continent except Antarctica. In contrast to the damselflies (Zygoptera), which tend to have restricted distributions, some genera and species are spread across continents. For example, the blue-eyed darner \"Rhionaeschna multicolor\" lives across North America, and in Central America; emperors \"Anax\" live throughout the Americas from as far north as Newfoundland to as far south as Bahia Blanca in Argentina, across Europe to central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. The globe skimmer \"Pantala flavescens\" is probably the most cosmopolitan, occurring on all continents in the warmer regions. Most Anisoptera species are tropical, with far fewer species in temperate regions.\nSome dragonflies, including libellulids and aeshnids, live in desert pools. In the Mojave Desert they are active in shade temperatures between ; these dragonflies survive body temperatures fatal to individuals not adapted to that environment, even those of the same species.\nDragonflies live from sea level up to the mountains, decreasing in species diversity with altitude. Their altitudinal limit is about 3700 m, represented by a species of \"Aeshna\" in the Pamirs.\nDragonflies become scarce at higher latitudes. They are not native to Iceland, but individuals are occasionally swept in by strong winds, including a \"Hemianax ephippiger\" native to North Africa, and an unidentified darter species. In Kamchatka, only a few species of dragonfly including the treeline emerald \"Somatochlora arctica\" and some aeshnids such as \"Aeshna subarctica\" are found, possibly because of the low temperature of the lakes there. The treeline emerald also lives in northern Alaska, within the Arctic Circle, making it the most northerly of all dragonflies.\nDescription.\nAnatomy.\nDragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying insects that hold their wings horizontally both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, and the eyes are well separated on the sides of the head.\nAn adult dragonfly has three distinct segments, the head, thorax, and abdomen, as in all insects. It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates held together with flexible membranes. The head is large with very short antennae. It is dominated by the two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being greater in the larger species. \"Aeshna interrupta\" has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes, 4500 being large. The facets facing downward tend to be smaller. \"Petalura gigantea\" has 23890 ommatidia of just one size. These facets provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly. The compound eyes meet at the top of the head (except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae, as also in the genus \"Epiophlebia\"). Also, they have three simple eyes or ocelli. The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like labrum, at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This arrester system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight.\nThe thorax consists of three segments as in all insects. The prothorax is small and flattened dorsally into a shield-like disc, which has two transverse ridges. The mesothorax and metathorax are fused into a rigid, box-like structure with internal bracing, and provide a robust attachment for the powerful wing muscles inside. The thorax bears two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. The wings are long, veined, and membranous, narrower at the tip and wider at the base. The hindwings are broader than the forewings and the venation is different at the base. The veins carry haemolymph, which is analogous to blood in vertebrates, and carries out many similar functions, but which also serves a hydraulic function to expand the body between nymphal stages (instars) and to expand and stiffen the wings after the adult emerges from the final nymphal stage. The leading edge of each wing has a node where other veins join the marginal vein, and the wing is able to flex at this point. In most large species of dragonflies, the wings of females are shorter and broader than those of males. The legs are rarely used for walking, but are used to catch and hold prey, for perching, and for climbing on plants. Each has two short basal joints, two long joints, and a three-jointed foot, armed with a pair of claws. The long leg joints bear rows of spines, and in males, one row of spines on each front leg is modified to form an \"eyebrush\", for cleaning the surface of the compound eye.\nThe abdomen is long and slender and consists of 10 segments. Three terminal appendages are on segment 10; a pair of superiors (claspers) and an inferior. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, the underside of the second segment has a cleft, forming the secondary genitalia consisting of the lamina, hamule, genital lobe, and penis. There are remarkable variations in the presence and the form of the penis and the related structures, the flagellum, cornua, and genital lobes. Sperm is produced at the ninth segment, and is transferred to the secondary genitalia prior to mating. The male holds the female behind the head using a pair of claspers on the terminal segment. In females, the genital opening is on the underside of the eighth segment, and is covered by a simple flap (vulvar lamina) or an ovipositor, depending on species and the method of egg-laying. Dragonflies having simple flaps shed the eggs in water, mostly in flight. Dragonflies having ovipositors use them to puncture soft tissues of plants and place the eggs singly in each puncture they make.\nDragonfly nymphs vary in form with species, and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar is known as a prolarva, a relatively inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan is similar to that of an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles. Both damselfly and dragonfly nymphs ventilate the rectum, but just some damselfly nymphs have a rectal epithelium that is rich in trachea, relying mostly on three feathery external gills as their major source of respiration. Only dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, called a branchial chamber, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. These internal gills consist originally of six longitudinal folds, each side supported by cross-folds. But this system has been modified in several families. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.\nColoration.\nMany adult dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or metallic colours produced by structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. Their overall coloration is often a combination of yellow, red, brown, and black pigments, with structural colours. Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light. Greens often combine a structural blue with a yellow pigment. Freshly emerged adults, known as tenerals, are often pale, and obtain their typical colours after a few days. Some have their bodies covered with a pale blue, waxy powderiness called pruinosity; it wears off when scraped during mating, leaving darker areas.\nSome dragonflies, such as the green darner, \"Anax junius\", have a noniridescent blue that is produced structurally by scatter from arrays of tiny spheres in the endoplasmic reticulum of epidermal cells underneath the cuticle.\nThe wings of dragonflies are generally clear, apart from the dark veins and pterostigmata. In the chasers (Libellulidae), however, many genera have areas of colour on the wings: for example, groundlings (\"Brachythemis\") have brown bands on all four wings, while some scarlets (\"Crocothemis\") and dropwings (\"Trithemis\") have bright orange patches at the wing bases. Some aeshnids such as the brown hawker (\"Aeshna grandis\") have translucent, pale yellow wings.\nDragonfly nymphs are usually a well-camouflaged blend of dull brown, green, and grey.\nBiology.\nEcology.\nDragonflies and damselflies are predatory both in the aquatic nymphal and adult stages. Nymphs feed on a range of freshwater invertebrates and larger ones can prey on tadpoles and small fish. Naiads of one species, \"Phanogomphus militaris\", may even act as parasites, feeding on the gills of gravid freshwater mussels.\nThe mating system of dragonflies is complex, and they are among the few insect groups that have a system of indirect sperm transfer along with sperm storage, delayed fertilisation, and sperm competition.\nAdult males vigorously defend territories near water; these areas provide suitable habitat for the nymphs to develop, and for females to lay their eggs. Swarms of feeding adults aggregate to prey on swarming prey such as emerging flying ants or termites.\nDragonflies as a group occupy a considerable variety of habitats, but many species, and some families, have their own specific environmental requirements. Some species prefer flowing waters, while others prefer standing water. For example, the Gomphidae (clubtails) live in running water, and the Libellulidae (skimmers) live in still water. Some species live in temporary water pools and are capable of tolerating changes in water level, desiccation, and the resulting variations in temperature, but some genera such as \"Sympetrum\" (darters) have eggs and nymphs that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm, shallow pools, also often benefiting from the absence of predators there. Vegetation and its characteristics including submerged, floating, emergent, or waterside are also important. Adults may require emergent or waterside plants to use as perches; others may need specific submerged or floating plants on which to lay eggs. Requirements may be highly specific, as in \"Aeshna viridis\" (green hawker), which lives in swamps with the water-soldier plant, \"Stratiotes aloides\". The chemistry of the water, including its trophic status (degree of enrichment with nutrients) and pH can also affect its use by dragonflies. Most species need moderate conditions, not too eutrophic, not too acidic; a few species such as \"Sympetrum danae\" (black darter) and \"Libellula quadrimaculata\" (four-spotted chaser) prefer acidic waters such as peat bogs, while others such as \"Libellula fulva\" (scarce chaser) need slow-moving, eutrophic waters with reeds or similar waterside plants.\nBehaviour.\nMany dragonflies, particularly males, are territorial. Some defend a territory against others of their own species, some against other species of dragonfly and a few against insects in unrelated groups. A particular perch may give a dragonfly a good view over an insect-rich feeding ground; males of many species such as the \"Pachydiplax longipennis\" (blue dasher) jostle other dragonflies to maintain the right to alight there. Defending a breeding territory is common among male dragonflies, especially in species that congregate around ponds. The territory contains desirable features such as a sunlit stretch of shallow water, a special plant species, or the preferred substrate for egg-laying. The territory may be small or large, depending on its quality, the time of day, and the number of competitors, and may be held for a few minutes or several hours. Dragonflies including \"Tramea lacerata\" (black saddlebags) may notice landmarks that assist in defining the boundaries of the territory. Landmarks may reduce the costs of territory establishment, or might serve as a spatial reference. Some dragonflies signal ownership with striking colours on the face, abdomen, legs, or wings. The \"Plathemis lydia\" (common whitetail) dashes towards an intruder holding its white abdomen aloft like a flag. Other dragonflies engage in aerial dogfights or high-speed chases. A female must mate with the territory holder before laying her eggs. There is also conflict between the males and females. Females may sometimes be harassed by males to the extent that it affects their normal activities including foraging and in some dimorphic species females have evolved multiple forms with some forms appearing deceptively like males. In some species females have evolved behavioural responses such as feigning death to escape the attention of males. Similarly, selection of habitat by adult dragonflies is not random, and terrestrial habitat patches may be held for up to 3 months. A species tightly linked to its birth site utilises a foraging area that is several orders of magnitude larger than the birth site.\nReproduction.\nMating in dragonflies is a complex, precisely choreographed process. First, the male has to attract a female to his territory, continually driving off rival males. When he is ready to mate, he transfers a packet of sperm from his primary genital opening on segment 9, near the end of his abdomen, to his secondary genitalia on segments 2\u20133, near the base of his abdomen. The male then grasps the female by the head with the claspers at the end of his abdomen; the structure of the claspers varies between species, and may help to prevent interspecific mating. The pair flies in tandem with the male in front, typically perching on a twig or plant stem. The female then curls her abdomen downwards and forwards under her body to pick up the sperm from the male's secondary genitalia, while the male uses his \"tail\" claspers to grip the female behind the head: this distinctive posture is called the \"heart\" or \"wheel\"; the pair may also be described as being \"in cop\".\nEgg-laying (ovipositing) involves not only the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. This behaviour following the transfer of sperm is termed as mate guarding and the guarding male attempts to increase the probability of his sperm fertilising eggs. Sexual selection with sperm competition occurs within the spermatheca of the female and sperm can remain viable for at least 12 days in some species. Females can fertilise their eggs using sperm from the spermatheca at any time. Males use their penis and associated genital structures to compress or scrape out sperm from previous matings; this activity takes up much of the time that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.\nEgg-laying takes two different forms depending on the species. The female in some families (Aeshnidae, Petaluridae) has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant on or near the water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping the surface of the water repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.\nLife cycle.\nDragonflies are hemimetabolous insects; they do not have a pupal stage and undergo an incomplete metamorphosis with a series of nymphal stages from which the adult emerges. Eggs laid inside plant tissues are usually shaped like grains of rice, while other eggs are the size of a pinhead, ellipsoidal, or nearly spherical. A clutch may have as many as 1500 eggs, and they take about a week to hatch into aquatic nymphs or naiads which moult between six and 15 times (depending on species) as they grow. Most of a dragonfly's life is spent as a nymph, beneath the water's surface. The nymph extends its hinged labium (a toothed mouthpart similar to a lower mandible, which is sometimes termed as a \"mask\" as it is normally folded and held before the face) that can extend forward and retract rapidly to capture prey such as mosquito larvae, tadpoles, and small fish. They breathe through gills in their rectum, and can rapidly propel themselves by suddenly expelling water through the anus. Some naiads, such as the later stages of \"Antipodophlebia asthenes\", hunt on land.\nThe nymph stage of dragonflies lasts up to five years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to metamorphose into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its exoskeleton begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its nymph exoskeleton, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.\nDragonflies in temperate areas can be categorized into two groups: an early group and a later one. In any one area, individuals of a particular \"spring species\" emerge within a few days of each other. The springtime darner (\"Basiaeschna janata\"), for example, is suddenly very common in the spring, but disappears a few weeks later and is not seen again until the following year. By contrast, a \"summer species\" emerges over a period of weeks or months, later in the year. They may be seen on the wing for several months, but this may represent a whole series of individuals, with new adults hatching out as earlier ones complete their lifespans.\nSex ratios.\nThe sex ratio of male to female dragonflies varies both temporally and spatially. Adult dragonflies have a high male-biased ratio at breeding habitats. The male-bias ratio has contributed partially to the females using different habitats to avoid male harassment. As seen in Hine's emerald dragonfly (\"Somatochlora hineana\"), male populations use wetland habitats, while females use dry meadows and marginal breeding habitats, only migrating to the wetlands to lay their eggs or to find mating partners. Unwanted mating is energetically costly for females because it affects the amount of time that they are able to spend foraging.\nFlight.\nDragonflies are powerful and agile fliers, capable of migrating across the sea, moving in any direction, and changing direction suddenly. In flight, the adult dragonfly can propel itself in six directions: upward, downward, forward, backward, to left and to right. They have four different styles of flight.\nThe wings are powered directly, unlike most families of insects, with the flight muscles attached to the wing bases. Dragonflies have a high power/weight ratio, and have been documented accelerating at 4 G linearly and 9 G in sharp turns while pursuing prey.\nDragonflies generate lift in at least four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; and creating and shedding vortices. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and twisting during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.\nFlight speed.\nOld and unreliable claims are made that dragonflies such as the southern giant darner can fly up to . However, the greatest reliable flight speed records are for other types of insects. In general, large dragonflies like the hawkers have a maximum speed of with average cruising speed of about . Dragonflies can travel at 100 body-lengths per second in forward flight, and three lengths per second backwards.\nMotion camouflage.\nIn high-speed territorial battles between male Australian emperors (\"Hemianax papuensis\"), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing the chance of being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival and the start of his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.\nTemperature control.\nThe flight muscles need to be kept at a suitable temperature for the dragonfly to be able to fly. Being cold-blooded, they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun. Early in the morning, they may choose to perch in a vertical position with the wings outstretched, while in the middle of the day, a horizontal stance may be chosen. Another method of warming up used by some larger dragonflies is wing-whirring, a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles. The green darner (\"Anax junius\"), known for long-distance migrations, often resorts to wing-whirring before dawn to enable an early start.\nDragonflies can avoid overheating on hot days by perching in the shade. Some species have dark patches on the wings which shade the body, and a few use the obelisk posture to avoid overheating. This behaviour involves a \"handstand\", perching with the body raised and the abdomen pointing towards the sun, minimising sun exposure. On a hot day, dragonflies sometimes adjust their body temperature by skimming over a water surface and briefly touching it, often three times in quick succession. This may also prevent desiccation.\nFeeding.\nAdult dragonflies hunt on the wing using their exceptionally acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating a wide variety of insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head, after which the dragonfly may grasp its legs and carry it to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and prey ingested, usually head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight per day. A study of \"Libellula cyanea\" pursuing \"Drosophila melanogaster\" fruit flies in a netted outdoor enclosure has suggested that dragonflies are efficient hunters, catching up to 95% of the prey they pursue. Success was correlated with prey density, while erratic prey flight contributed to escapes at lower densities.\nNymphs are voracious predators, eating most living things smaller than themselves. Their staple diet is mostly bloodworms and other insect larvae, but they also feed on tadpoles and small fish. A few species, especially those that live in temporary waters, are likely to leave the water to feed. Nymphs of \"Cordulegaster bidentata\" sometimes hunt small arthropods on the ground at night, while some species in the \"Anax\" genus have even been observed leaping out of the water to kill full-grown tree frogs.\nEyesight.\nDragonfly vision is thought to be like slow motion for humans. Dragonflies see faster than humans do; they see around 200 images per second. A dragonfly can see in 360 degrees, and nearly 80 percent of the insect's brain is dedicated to its sight.\nPredators.\nAlthough dragonflies are swift and agile fliers, some predators are fast enough to catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby. Nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and swallows also take some adults. Some wasps prey on dragonflies, laying an egg on each captured insect to provision their nests. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly nymphs and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, \"Pantala flavescens,\" may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.\nParasites.\nDragonflies are affected by three groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, \"Hydracarina\", can kill smaller dragonfly nymphs, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host, a snail. Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph for the whole of its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode.\nDragonflies and humans.\nConservation.\nMost odonatologists live in temperate areas and the dragonflies of North America and Europe have been the subject of much research. However, the majority of species live in tropical areas and have been little studied. With the destruction of rainforest habitats, many of these species are in danger of becoming extinct before they have even been named. The greatest cause of decline is forest clearance with the consequent drying up of streams and pools which become clogged with silt. The damming of rivers for hydroelectric schemes and the drainage of low-lying land has reduced suitable habitat, as has pollution and the introduction of alien species.\nIn 1997, the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up a status survey and conservation action plan for dragonflies. This proposes the establishment of protected areas around the world and the management of these areas to provide suitable habitat for dragonflies. Outside these areas, encouragement should be given to modify forestry, agricultural, and industrial practices to enhance conservation. At the same time, more research into dragonflies needs to be done, consideration should be given to pollution control and the public should be educated about the importance of biodiversity.\nHabitat degradation has reduced dragonfly populations across the world, for example in Japan. Over 60% of Japan's wetlands were lost in the 20th century, so its dragonflies now depend largely on rice fields, ponds, and creeks. Dragonflies feed on pest insects in rice, acting as a natural pest control. Dragonflies are steadily declining in Africa, and represent a conservation priority.\nThe dragonfly's long lifespan and low population density makes it vulnerable to disturbance, such as from collisions with vehicles on roads built near wetlands. Species that fly low and slow may be most at risk.\nDragonflies are attracted to shiny surfaces that produce polarization which they can mistake for water, and they have been known to aggregate close to polished gravestones, solar panels, automobiles, and other such structures on which they attempt to lay eggs. These can have a local impact on dragonfly populations; methods of reducing the attractiveness of structures such as solar panels are under experimentation.\nIn culture.\nA blue-glazed faience dragonfly amulet was found by Flinders Petrie at Lahun, from the Late Middle Kingdom of ancient Egypt.\nFor the Navajo, dragonflies symbolize pure water. Often stylized in a double-barred cross design, dragonflies are a common motif in Zuni pottery, as well as Hopi rock art and Pueblo necklaces.\nAs a seasonal symbol in Japan, dragonflies are associated with the season of autumn.\nIn Japan, they are symbols of rebirth, courage, strength, and happiness. They are also depicted frequently in Japanese art and literature, especially \"haiku\" poetry. Japanese children catch large dragonflies as a game, using a hair with a small pebble tied to each end, which they throw into the air. The dragonfly mistakes the pebbles for prey, gets tangled in the hair, and is dragged to the ground by the weight.\nIn both China and Japan, dragonflies have been used in traditional medicine. In Indonesia, adult dragonflies are caught on poles made sticky with birdlime, then fried in oil as a delicacy.\nImages of dragonflies are common in Art Nouveau, especially in jewellery designs. They have also been used as a decorative motif on fabrics and home furnishings. Douglas, a British motorcycle manufacturer based in Bristol, named its innovatively designed postwar 350-cc flat-twin model the Dragonfly.\nAmong the classical names of Japan are \"Akitsukuni\" (\u79cb\u6d25\u56fd), \"Akitsushima\" (\u79cb\u6d25\u5cf6), \"Toyo-akitsushima\" (\u8c4a\u79cb\u6d25\u5cf6). \"Akitsu\" is an old word for dragonfly, so one interpretation of \"Akitsushima\" is \"Dragonfly Island\". This is attributed to a legend in which Japan's mythical founder, Emperor Jimmu, was bitten by a mosquito, which was then eaten by a dragonfly.\nIn Europe, dragonflies have often been seen as sinister. Some English vernacular names, such as \"horse-stinger\", \"devil's darning needle\", and \"ear cutter\", link them with evil and injury. Some of these reference the popular misconception that dragonflies can bite or sting humans. Swedish folklore holds that the devil uses dragonflies to weigh people's souls. The Norwegian name for dragonflies is \"\u00d8yenstikker\" (\"eye-poker\"), and in Portugal, they are sometimes called \"tira-olhos\" (\"eyes-snatcher\"). They are often associated with snakes, as in the Welsh name \"gwas-y-neidr\", \"adder's servant\". The Southern United States terms \"snake doctor\" and \"snake feeder\" refer to a folk belief that dragonflies catch insects for snakes or follow snakes around and stitch them back together if they are injured.\nThe watercolourist Moses Harris (1731\u20131785), known for his \"The Aurelian or natural history of English insects\" (1766), published in 1780, the first scientific descriptions of several Odonata including the banded demoiselle, \"Calopteryx splendens\". He was the first English artist to make illustrations of dragonflies accurate enough to be identified to species (\"Aeshna grandis\" at top left of plate illustrated), though his rough drawing of a nymph (at lower left) with the mask extended appears to be plagiarised.\nMore recently, dragonfly watching has become popular in America as some birdwatchers seek new groups to observe.\nIn heraldry, like other winged insects, the dragonfly is typically depicted tergiant (with its back facing the viewer), with its head to chief (at the top).\nIn poetry and literature.\nLafcadio Hearn wrote in his 1901 book \"A Japanese Miscellany\" that Japanese poets had created dragonfly \"haiku\" \"almost as numerous as are the dragonflies themselves in the early autumn.\" The poet Matsuo Bash\u014d (1644\u20131694) wrote \"haiku\" such as \"Crimson pepper pod / add two pairs of wings, and look / darting dragonfly\", relating the autumn season to the dragonfly. Hori Bakusui (1718\u20131783) similarly wrote \"Dyed he is with the / Colour of autumnal days, / O red dragonfly.\"\nThe poet Lord Tennyson, described a dragonfly splitting its old skin and emerging shining metallic blue like \"sapphire mail\" in his 1842 poem \"The Two Voices\", with the lines \"An inner impulse rent the veil / Of his old husk: from head to tail / Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.\"\nThe novelist H. E. Bates described the rapid, agile flight of dragonflies in his 1937 nonfiction book \"Down the River\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I saw, once, an endless procession, just over an area of water-lilies, of small sapphire dragonflies, a continuous play of blue gauze over the snowy flowers above the sun-glassy water. It was all confined, in true dragonfly fashion, to one small space. It was a continuous turning and returning, an endless darting, poising, striking and hovering, so swift that it was often lost in sunlight.\nIn technology.\nA dragonfly has been genetically modified with light-sensitive \"steering neurons\" in its nerve cord to create a cyborg-like \"DragonflEye\". The neurons contain genes like those in the eye to make them sensitive to light. Miniature sensors, a computer chip, and a solar panel were fitted in a \"backpack\" over the insect's thorax in front of its wings. Light is sent down flexible light-pipes named optrodes from the backpack into the nerve cord to give steering commands to the insect. The result is a \"micro-aerial vehicle that's smaller, lighter and stealthier than anything else that's manmade\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57622", "revid": "50263362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57622", "title": "Common sunflower", "text": "Species of flowering plant in the family of Asteraceae\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a species of large annual forb of the daisy family Asteraceae. The common sunflower is harvested for its edible oily seeds, which are often eaten as a snack food. They are also used in the production of cooking oil, as food for livestock, as bird food, and as plantings in domestic gardens for aesthetics. Wild plants are known for their multiple flower heads, whereas the domestic sunflower often possesses a single large flower head atop an unbranched stem.\nDescription.\nThe plant has an erect rough-hairy stem, reaching typical heights of . The tallest sunflower on record achieved . Sunflower leaves are broad, coarsely toothed, rough and mostly alternate; those near the bottom are largest and commonly heart-shaped.\nFlower.\nThe plant flowers in summer. What is often called the \"flower\" of the sunflower is actually a \"flower head\" (pseudanthium), wide, of numerous small individual five-petaled flowers (\"florets\"). The outer flowers, which resemble petals, are called ray flowers. Each \"petal\" consists of a ligule composed of fused petals of an asymmetrical ray flower. They are sexually sterile and may be yellow, red, orange, or other colors. The spirally arranged flowers in the center of the head are called disk flowers. These mature into fruit (sunflower \"seeds\").\nThe prairie sunflower (\"H. petiolaris\") is similar in appearance to the wild common sunflower; the scales in its central disk are tipped by white hairs.\nHeliotropism.\nA common misconception is that flowering sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky. Although immature flower buds exhibit this behaviour, the mature flowering heads point in a fixed (and typically easterly) direction throughout the day. This old misconception was disputed in 1597 by the English botanist John Gerard, who grew sunflowers in his famous herbal garden: \"[some] have reported it to turn with the Sun, the which I could never observe, although I have endeavored to find out the truth of it.\" The uniform alignment of sunflower heads in a field might give some people the false impression that the flowers are tracking the Sun.\nThis alignment results from heliotropism in an earlier development stage, the young flower stage, before full maturity of flower heads (anthesis). Young sunflowers orient themselves in the direction of the sun. At dawn, the head of the flower faces east and moves west throughout the day. When sunflowers reach full maturity, they no longer follow the sun and continuously face east. Young flowers reorient overnight to face east in anticipation of the morning. Their heliotropic motion is a circadian rhythm, synchronized by the sun, which continues if the sun disappears on cloudy days or if plants are moved to constant light. They are able to regulate their circadian rhythm in response to the blue-light emitted by a light source. If a sunflower plant in the bud stage is rotated 180\u00b0, the bud will be turning away from the sun for a few days, as resynchronization with the sun takes time.\nWhen growth of the flower stalk stops and the flower is mature, the heliotropism also stops and the flower faces east from that moment onward. This eastward orientation allows rapid warming in the morning, and as a result, an increase in pollinator visits. Sunflowers do not have a pulvinus below their inflorescence. A pulvinus is a flexible segment in the leaf stalks (petiole) of some plant species and functions as a 'joint'. It effectuates leaf motion due to reversible changes in turgor pressure which occurs without growth. The sensitive plant's closing leaves are a good example of reversible leaf movement via pulvinuli.\nFloret arrangement.\nGenerally, each floret is oriented toward the next by approximately the golden angle, 137.5\u00b0, producing a pattern of interconnecting spirals, where the number of left spirals and the number of right spirals are successive Fibonacci numbers. Typically, there are 34 spirals in one direction and 55 in the other; however, in a very large sunflower head there could be 89 in one direction and 144 in the other. This pattern produces the most efficient packing of seeds mathematically possible within the flower head.\nA model for the pattern of florets in the head of a sunflower was proposed by H. Vogel in 1979. This is expressed in polar coordinates\nformula_1\nformula_2\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle, \"r\" is the radius or distance from the center, and \"n\" is the index number of the floret and \"c\" is a constant scaling factor. It is a form of Fermat's spiral. The angle 137.5\u00b0 is related to the golden ratio (55/144 of a circular angle, where 55 and 144 are Fibonacci numbers) and gives a close packing of florets. This model has been used to produce computer generated representations of sunflowers.\nGenome.\nThe sunflower genome is diploid with a base chromosome number of 17 and an estimated genome size of 2,871\u20133,189\u00a0billion base pairs. Some sources claim its true size is around 3.5\u00a0billion base pairs (slightly larger than the human genome).\nEtymology.\nIn the binomial name \"Helianthus annuus\", the genus name is derived from the Greek \"\u1f25\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 : h\u1e17lios\" 'sun' and \"\u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 : \u00e1nthos\" 'flower'. The species name \"annuus\" means 'annual' in Latin.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe plant was first domesticated in the Americas. Sunflower seeds were brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, where, along with sunflower oil, they became a widespread cooking ingredient. With time, the bulk of industrial-scale production has shifted to Eastern Europe, and (as of 2020[ [update]]) Russia and Ukraine together produce over half of worldwide seed production.\nSunflowers grow best in fertile, moist, well-drained soil with heavy mulch. They often appear on dry open areas and foothills. Outside of cultivation, the common sunflower is found on moist clay-based soils in areas with climates similar to Texas. In contrast, the related \"Helianthus debilis\" and \"Helianthus petiolaris\" are found on drier, sandier soils.\nThe precise native range is difficult to determine. According to Plants of the World Online (POWO), it is native to Arizona, California, and Nevada in the present-day United States and to all parts of Mexico except the Gulf Coast and southeast. Though not giving much detail, the Missouri Botanical Garden Plant Finder also lists it as native to the Western United States and Canada. The information published by the Biota of North America Program (BONAP) largely agrees with this, showing the common sunflower as native to states west of the Mississippi, though also listed as a noxious weed in Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas. Regardless of its original range, it can now be found in almost every part of the world that is not tropical, desert, or tundra.\nEcology.\nThreats and diseases.\nOne of the major threats that sunflowers face today is \"Fusarium\", a filamentous fungus that is found largely in soil and plants. It is a pathogen that over the years has caused an increasing amount of damage and loss of sunflower crops, some as extensive as 80% of damaged crops.\nDowny mildew is another disease to which sunflowers are susceptible. Its susceptibility to downy mildew is particularly high due to the sunflower's way of growth and development. Sunflower seeds are generally planted only an inch deep in the ground. When such shallow planting is done in moist and soaked earth or soil, it increases the chances of diseases such as downy mildew.\nAnother major threat to sunflower crops are broomrapes, a family of plants which parasitize the roots of various other plants, including sunflowers. Damage and loss to sunflower crops as a result of broomrape can be as high as 100%.\nCultivation.\nIn commercial planting, seeds are planted apart and deep.\nHistory.\nThe common sunflower was one of several plants cultivated by Native Americans in prehistoric North America as part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex, which also included goosefoot, little barley, squash, and a variety of other crops, most of which were replaced by maize and beans following their introduction. Although it was commonly accepted that the sunflower was first domesticated in what is now the southeastern US, roughly 5,000 years ago, there is evidence that it was first domesticated in Mexico around 2600\u00a0BCE. These crops were found in Tabasco, Mexico, at the San Andres dig site. The earliest known examples in the US of a fully domesticated sunflower have been found in Tennessee, and date to around 2300\u00a0BCE. Other very early examples come from rockshelter sites in Eastern Kentucky. Many indigenous American peoples used the sunflower as the symbol of their solar deity, including the Aztecs and the Otomi of Mexico and the Incas in South America. In 1510, early Spanish explorers encountered the sunflower in the Americas and carried its seeds back to Europe. Of the four plants known to have been domesticated in eastern North America and to have become important agricultural commodities, the sunflower is currently the most economically important.\nResearch of phylogeographic relations and population demographic patterns across sunflowers has demonstrated that earlier cultivated sunflowers form a clade from wild populations from the Great Plains, which indicates that there was a single domestication event in central North America. Following the cultivated sunflower's origin, it may have gone through significant bottlenecks dating back to ~5,000 years ago.\nIn the 16th century the first crop breeds were brought from America to Europe by explorers. Domestic sunflower seeds have been found in Mexico, dating to 2100\u00a0BCE. Native American people grew sunflowers as a crop from Mexico to Southern Canada. They then were introduced to the Russian Empire, where oilseed cultivators were located, and the flowers were developed and grown on an industrial scale. The Russian Empire reintroduced this oilseed cultivation process to North America in the mid-20th century; North America began their commercial era of sunflower production and breeding. New breeds of the \"Helianthus spp.\" began to become more prominent in new geographical areas. During the 18th century, the use of sunflower oil became very popular in Russia, particularly with members of the Russian Orthodox Church, because only plant-based fats were allowed during Lent, according to fasting traditions. In the early 19th century, it was first commercialized in the village of Alexeyevka in Voronezh Governorate by the merchant named Daniil Bokaryov, who developed a technology suitable for its large-scale extraction, and quickly spread around. The town's coat of arms has included an image of a sunflower ever since.\nProduction.\nIn 2024, world production of sunflower seeds was 51.9 million tonnes, led by Russia and Ukraine, with 58% combined of the total.\nFertilizer use.\nResearchers have analyzed the impact of various nitrogen-based fertilizers on the growth of sunflowers. Ammonium nitrate was found to produce better nitrogen absorption than urea, which performed better in low-temperature areas.\nCrop rotation.\nSunflower cultivation typically uses crop rotation, often with cereals, soybean, or rapeseed. This reduces idle periods and increases total sunflower production and profitability.\nHybrids and cultivars.\nIn today's market, most of the sunflower seeds provided or grown by farmers are hybrids. Hybrids or hybridized sunflowers are produced by cross-breeding different types and species, for example cultivated sunflowers with wild species. By doing so, new genetic recombinations are obtained ultimately leading to the production of new hybrid species. These hybrid species generally have a higher fitness and carry properties or characteristics that farmers look for, such as resistance to pathogens.\nHybrid, \"Helianthus annuus dwarf2\" does not contain the hormone gibberellin and does not display heliotropic behavior. Plants treated with an external application of the hormone display a temporary restoration of elongation growth patterns. This growth pattern diminished by 35% 7\u201314 days after final treatment.\nHybrid male sterile and male fertile flowers that display heterogeneity have a low crossover of honeybee visitation. Sensory cues such as pollen odor, diameter of seed head, and height may influence pollinator visitation of pollinators that display constancy behavior patterns.\nSunflowers are grown as ornamentals in a domestic setting. Being easy to grow and producing spectacular results in any good, moist soil in full sun, they are a favourite subject for children. A large number of cultivars, of varying size and color, are now available to grow from seed. The following are cultivars of sunflowers (those marked agm have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit):\nUses.\nSunflower \"whole seed\" (fruit) are sold as a snack food, raw or after roasting in ovens, with or without salt and/or seasonings added. Sunflower seeds can be processed into a peanut butter alternative, sunflower butter. It is also sold as food for birds and can be used directly in cooking and salads. Native Americans had multiple uses for sunflowers in the past, such as in bread, medical ointments, dyes and body paints.\nSunflower oil, extracted from the seeds, is used for cooking, as a carrier oil and to produce margarine and biodiesel, as it is cheaper than olive oil. A range of sunflower varieties exist with differing fatty acid compositions; some \"high-oleic\" types contain a higher level of monounsaturated fats in their oil than even olive oil. The oil is also sometimes used in soap. After World War I, during the Russian Civil War, people in Ukraine used sunflower seed oil in lamps as a substitute for kerosene due to shortages. The light from such a lamp has been described as \"miserable\" and \"smoky\".\nThe cake remaining after the seeds have been processed for oil is used as livestock feed. The hulls resulting from the dehulling of the seeds before oil extraction can also be fed to domestic animals. Some recently developed cultivars have drooping heads. These cultivars are less attractive to gardeners growing the flowers as ornamental plants, but appeal to farmers, because they reduce bird damage and losses from some plant diseases. Sunflowers also produce latex, and are the subject of experiments to improve their suitability as an alternative crop for producing hypoallergenic rubber.\nTraditionally, several Native American groups planted sunflowers on the north edges of their gardens as a \"fourth sister\" to the better-known three sisters combination of corn, beans, and squash. Annual species are often planted for their allelopathic properties. It was also used by Native Americans to dress hair. Among the Zuni people, the fresh or dried root is chewed by the medicine man before sucking venom from a snakebite and applying a poultice to the wound. This compound poultice of the root is applied with much ceremony to rattlesnake bites.\nHowever, for commercial farmers growing other commodity crops, the wild sunflower is often considered a weed. Especially in the Midwestern US, wild (perennial) species are often found in corn and soybean fields and can decrease yields. The decrease in yield can be attributed to the production of phenolic compounds which are used to reduce competition for nutrients in nutrient-poor growing areas of the common sunflower.\nPhytoremediation.\n\"Helianthus annuus\" can be used in phytoremediation to extract pollutants from soil such as lead and other heavy metals, such as cadmium, zinc, cesium, strontium, and uranium. The phytoremediation process begins by absorbing the heavy metal(s) through the roots, which gradually accumulate in other areas, such as the shoots and leaves. \"Helianthus annuus\" can also be used in rhizofiltration to neutralize radionuclides, such as caesium-137 and strontium-90 from a pond after the Chernobyl disaster. A similar campaign was mounted in response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.\nIn culture.\nAccording to Iroquois mythology, the first sunflowers grew out of Earth Woman's legs after she died giving birth to her twin sons, Sapling and Flint.\nThe Zuni people use the blossoms ceremonially for anthropic worship. Sunflowers were also worshipped by the Incas because they viewed it as a symbol for the Sun.\nStories of Clytie the nymph who was spurned by her former lover Helios end with her transformed into what may be translated as sunflower. However, the plant in Greek mythology may be, \"partly pale and partly red, and very like a violet\". The plant described also exhibits heliotropism, with its face turning towards the sun. This plant may be a species in the genus heliotrope (\"Heliotropium\"). However, less commonly it is identified as the common marigold (\"Calendula officinalis\").\nDuring the 19th century, it was believed that nearby plants of the species would protect a home from malaria. The flowers are the subject of Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" series of still-life paintings.\nIn July 2015, viable seeds were acquired from the field where Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed on a year earlier and were grown in tribute to the 15 Dutch residents of Hilversum who were killed. Earlier that year, Fairfax chief correspondent Paul McGeough and photographer Kate Geraghty had collected 1.5\u00a0kg of sunflower seeds from the wreck site for family and friends of the 38 Australian victims, who aimed to give them a poignant symbol of hope.\nOn 13 May 2021, during the National Costume competition of the Miss Universe 2020 beauty pageant, Miss Dominican Republic Kimberly Jim\u00e9nez wore a \"Goddess of Sunflowers\" costume covered in gold and yellow rhinestones that included several real sunflowers sewn onto the fabric.\nSymbolism.\nThe sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine. Ukrainians used sunflower as a main source of cooking oil instead of butter or lard forbidden by the Orthodox Church when observing Lent. They were also planted to serve as bioremediation in Chernobyl. In June 1996, U.S., Russian, and Ukrainian officials planted sunflowers at the Pervomaysk missile base where Soviet nuclear weapons were formerly placed. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a video widely shared on social media showed a Ukrainian woman confronting a Russian soldier, telling the latter to \"take these seeds and put them in your pockets so at least sunflowers will grow when you all lie down here\". The sunflower has since become a global symbol of resistance, unity, and hope.\nThe sunflower is also the state flower of the U.S. state of Kansas and one of the city flowers of Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b, Japan.\nDuring the late 19th century, the flower was used as the symbol of the Aesthetic Movement.\nThe sunflower was chosen as the symbol of the Spiritualist Church, for many reasons, but mostly because of the belief that the flowers turn toward the sun as \"Spiritualism turns toward the light of truth\". Modern Spiritualists often have art or jewelry with sunflower designs.\nThe sunflower is often used as a symbol of green ideology. The flower is also the symbol of the Vegan Society.\nThe sunflower is the symbol behind the Sunflower Movement, a 2014 mass protest in Taiwan.\nThe Hidden Disabilities Sunflower was first used as a visible symbol (typically worn on a lanyard) in May 2016 at London Gatwick Airport. It has since come into common usage throughout the UK and in the Commonwealth more generally.\nSunflowers were also used for cultural beliefs for many Native American Tribes. For the Hopi tribe, a big sunflower bloom meant there would be a good harvest year. The Teton Dakota tribe believed that when sunflowers were tall and blooming, it would be a good hunting season for buffalo. The Onandaga tribe had sunflowers in their creation story. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They first appeared in the Middle Jurassic, and reached a peak diversity during the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene. They eventually declined from the mid-Paleocene onwards, disappearing from the known fossil record in the late Eocene. They are the most diverse order of Mesozoic mammals with more than 200 species known, ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. These species occupied a diversity of ecological niches, ranging from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like arborealism to jerboa-like hoppers. Multituberculates are usually placed as crown mammals outside either of the two main groups of living mammals, Theria \u2014 placentals and marsupials \u2014 and Monotremata, but usually as closer to Theria than to monotremes. They are considered to be closely related to Euharamiyida and Gondwanatheria as part of Allotheria.\nDescription.\nThe multituberculates had a cranial and dental anatomy superficially similar to rodents such as mice and rats, with cheek-teeth separated from the chisel-like front teeth by a wide tooth-less gap (the diasteme). Each cheek-tooth displayed several rows of small cusps (or tubercles, hence the name) that operated against similar rows in the teeth of the jaw; the exact homology of these cusps to therian ones is still a matter of debate. Unlike rodents, which have ever-growing teeth, multituberculates underwent dental replacement patterns typical of most mammals (though in at least some species the lower incisors continued to erupt long after the root's closure). Multituberculates are notable for the presence of a massive fourth lower premolar, the plagiaulacoid; other mammals, like Plesiadapiformes and diprotodontian marsupials, also have similar premolars in both upper and lower jaws, but in multituberculates this tooth is massive and the upper premolars are not modified this way. In basal multituberculates all three lower premolars were plagiaulacoids, increasing in size posteriorly, but in Cimolodonta only the fourth lower premolar remained, with the third one remaining only as a vestigial peg-like tooth, and in several taxa like taeniolabidoideans, the plagiaulacoid disappeared entirely or was reconverted into a molariform tooth.\nUnlike rodents and similar therians, multituberculates had a palinal jaw stroke (front-to-back), instead of a propalinal (back-to-front) or transverse (side-to-side) one; as a consequence, their jaw musculature and cusp orientation is radically different. Palinal jaw strokes are almost entirely absent in modern mammals (with the possible exception of the dugong), but are also present in haramiyidans, argyrolagoideans and tritylodontids, the former historically united with multituberculates on that basis. Multituberculate mastication is thought to have operated in a two stroke cycle: first, food held in place by the last upper premolar was sliced by the bladelike lower pre-molars as the dentary moved orthally (upward). Then the lower jaw moved palinally, grinding the food between the molar cusp rows.\nThe structure of the pelvis in the Multituberculata suggests that they gave birth to tiny helpless, underdeveloped young, similar to modern marsupials, such as kangaroos. However, a 2022 study reveals that they might actually have had long gestation periods like placentals. However, in 2024, all Allotheria (including multituberculates) fell outside the crown group of Mammalia, implying that cimolodonts developed placental-like gestation (and viviparity in general) independently, rather than multituberculates and therians having a common viviparous ancestor.\nAt least two lineages developed hypsodonty, in which tooth enamel extends beyond the gumline: lambdopsalid taeniolabidoideans and sudamericid gondwanatheres.\nStudies published in 2018 demonstrated that multituberculates had relatively complex brains, some braincase regions even absent in therian mammals.\nEvolution.\nMultituberculates first appear in the fossil record during the Jurassic period, and then survived and even dominated for over one hundred million years, longer than any other order of mammaliforms, including placental mammals. The earliest known multituberculates are from the Middle Jurassic (Bathonian ~166-168 million years ago) of England and Russia, including \"Hahnotherium\" \"and Kermackodon\" from the Forest Marble Formation of England, and \"Tashtykia\" and \"Tagaria\" from the Itat Formation of Russia. These forms are only known from isolated teeth, which bear close similarity to those of euharamyidans, which they are suspected to be closely related to. During the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, basal multituberculates, collectively grouped into the paraphyletic \"Plagiaulacida\", were abundant and widespread across Laurasia (including Europe, Asia and North America). During the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous, the advanced subgroup Cimolodonta appeared in North America, characterised by a reduced number of lower premolars, with a blade-like lower fourth premolar. By the early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Cimolodonta had replaced all other multituberculate lineages.\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, multituberculates experienced an adaptive radiation, corresponding with a shift towards herbivory. Multituberculates reached their peak diversity during the early Paleocene, shortly after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, but declined from the mid Paleocene onwards, likely due to competition with placental mammals such as rodents and ungulates. The group finally became extinct in the Late Eocene.\nThere are some isolated records of multituberculates from the Southern Hemisphere, including the cimolodontan \"Corriebaatar\" from the Early Cretaceous of Australia, and fragmentary remains from the Late Cretaceous Maevarano Formation of Madagascar. The family Ferugliotheriidae from the Late Cretaceous of South America, traditionally considered gondwanatherians, may actually be cimolodontan multituberculates.\nDuring the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene the multituberculates radiated into a wide variety of morphotypes, including the squirrel-like arboreal ptilodonts. The peculiar shape of their last lower premolar is their most outstanding feature. These teeth were larger and more elongated than the other cheek-teeth and had an occlusive surface forming a serrated slicing blade. Though it can be assumed that this was used for crushing seeds and nuts, it is believed that most small multituberculates also supplemented their diet with insects, worms, and fruits. Tooth marks attributed to multituberculates are known on \"Champsosaurus\" fossils, indicating that at least some of these mammals were scavengers. A ptilodont that thrived in North America was \"Ptilodus\". Thanks to the well-preserved \"Ptilodus\" specimens found in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, we know that these multituberculates were able to abduct and adduct their big toes, and thus that their foot mobility was similar to that of modern squirrels, which descend trees head first.\nAnother group of multituberculates, the taeniolabids, were heavier and more massively built, indicating that they lived a fully terrestrial life. The largest specimens weighed probably as much as , making them comparable in size to large rodents like the modern beaver.\nClassification.\nMultituberculate is generally placed within Allotheria alongside Euharamiyida, a clade of mammals known from the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous of Asia and possibly Europe that possess several morphological similarities with multituberculates.\nGondwanatheria is a monophyletic group of allotherians that was diverse in the Late Cretaceous of South America, India, Madagascar and possibly Africa and occurs onwards into the Paleogene of South America and Antarctica. Their placement within Allotheria is highly controversial, with some phylogenies recovering the group as deeply nested within multituberculates, while others recover them as a distinct branch of allotherians separate from multituberculates.\nIn their 2001 study, Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum found that most multituberculates could be referred to two suborders: \"Plagiaulacida\" and Cimolodonta. The exception is the genus \"Arginbaatar\", which shares characteristics with both groups.\n\"Plagiaulacida\" is paraphyletic, representing the more primitive evolutionary grade. Its members are the more basal Multituberculata. Chronologically, they ranged from perhaps the Middle Jurassic until the mid-Cretaceous. This group is further subdivided into three informal groupings: the allodontid line, the paulchoffatiid line, and the plagiaulacid line.\nCimolodonta is, apparently, a natural (monophyletic) suborder. This includes the more derived Multituberculata, which have been identified from the lower Cretaceous to the Eocene. The superfamilies Djadochtatherioidea, Taeniolabidoidea, Ptilodontoidea are recognized, as is the Paracimexomys group. Additionally, there are the families Cimolomyidae, Boffiidae, Eucosmodontidae, Kogaionidae, Microcosmodontidae and the two genera \"Uzbekbaatar\" and \"Viridomys\". More precise placement of these types awaits further discoveries and analysis.\nPhylogeny.\nAfter Chimento et al. 2015:\nCladogram after Carvalho et al. 2025:\nPaleoecology.\nBehaviour.\nMultituberculates are some of the earliest mammals to display complex social behaviours. One species, \"Filikomys,\" from the Late Cretaceous of North America, engaged in multi-generational group nesting and burrowing.\nExtinction.\nThe extinction of multituberculates has been a topic of controversy for several decades. After at least 88\u00a0million years of dominance over most mammalian assemblies, multituberculates reached the peak of their diversity in the early Palaeocene, before gradually declining across the final stages of the epoch and the Eocene, finally disappearing in the early Oligocene.\nThe last multituberculate species, \"Ectypodus childei\", went extinct near the end of the Eocene in North America. It is unclear why this particular species persisted for so long when all of its counterparts succumbed to replacement by rodents.43\nTraditionally, the extinction of multituberculates has been linked to the rise of rodents (and, to a lesser degree, earlier placental competitors like hyopsodonts and Plesiadapiformes), which supposedly competitively excluded multituberculates from most mammalian faunas. Adams et al. (2019) argued in favor of this hypothesis as rodents have a higher bite force than multituberculates, which would have given them access to harder, drier seeds which were becoming more abundant and had a greater range of food compared to multituberculates. The authors also argued rodents had was longer gestation periods and larger neonates which gave them a competitive advantage over multituberculates. In addition, they believed the diversity of new predators such as owls, creodonts, and carnivorans, also played a role in their extinction.\nHowever, the idea that multituberculates were competitively replaced by rodents and other placentals has been criticised by several authors. For one thing, it relies on the assumption that these mammals are \"inferior\" to more derived placentals, and ignores the fact that rodents and multituberculates had co-existed for at least 15\u00a0million years. According to some researchers, multituberculate \"decline\" is shaped by sharp extinction events, most notably after the Tiffanian, where a sudden drop in diversity occurs. Finally, the youngest known multituberculates do not exemplify patterns of competitive exclusion; the Oligocene \"Ectypodus\" is a rather generalistic species, rather than a specialist. This suggests that multituberculates simply could not cope with climatic and vegetation changes, as well as the rise of new predatory eutherians, such as miacids. However, rodents probably still played a role in their decline.\nMore recent studies show a mixed effect. Multituberculate faunas in North America and Europe do indeed decline in correlation to the introduction of rodents in these areas. However, Asian multituberculate faunas co-existed with rodents with minimal extinction events, implying that competition was not the main cause for the extinction of Asiatic multituberculates. As a whole, it seems that Asian multituberculates, unlike North American and European species, never recovered from the KT event, which allowed the evolution and propagation of rodents in the first place. A recent study seems to indeed indicate that eutherians recovered more quickly from the KT event than multituberculates. Conversely, another study has shown that placental radiation did not start significantly until after the decline of multituberculates.\nHowever, competitive replacement among North American species has been called into question by Benjamin John Burger in his 2025 study. He suggests the extinction of multituberculates in North America was correlated to the decline of boreal forests that were dominated by dawn redwoods and Chinese swamp cypress. The analysis suggested that multituberculates avoided pine and spruce-dominated forests despite having similar geographic distributions to those trees. However, Burger argues competitive replacements by seed-eating passerine birds such as songbirds, and several mammalian groups such as paromomyids, may have played a role in the extinction of multituberculates, although this requires more testing.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is currently in version 2022 revision 1.\nCommon Criteria is a framework in which computer system users can \"specify\" their security \"functional\" and \"assurance\" requirements (SFRs and SARs, respectively) in a Security Target (ST), and may be taken from Protection Profiles (PPs). Vendors can then \"implement\" or make claims about the security attributes of their products, and testing laboratories can \"evaluate\" the products to determine if they actually meet the claims. In other words, Common Criteria provides assurance that the process of specification, implementation and evaluation of a computer security product has been conducted in a rigorous and standard and repeatable manner at a level that is commensurate with the target environment for use. Common Criteria maintains a list of certified products, including operating systems, access control systems, databases, and key management systems.\nKey concepts.\nCommon Criteria evaluations are performed on computer security products and systems.\nThe evaluation process also tries to establish the level of confidence that may be placed in the product's security features through quality assurance processes:\nSo far, most PPs and most evaluated STs/certified products have been for IT components (e.g., firewalls, operating systems, smart cards).\nCommon Criteria certification is sometimes specified for IT procurement. Other standards containing, e.g., interoperation, system management, user training, supplement CC and other product standards. Examples include the ISO/IEC 27002 and the German IT baseline protection.\nDetails of cryptographic implementation within the TOE are outside the scope of the CC. Instead, national standards, like FIPS 140-2, give the specifications for cryptographic modules, and various standards specify the cryptographic algorithms in use.\nMore recently, PP authors are including cryptographic requirements for CC evaluations that would typically be covered by FIPS 140-2 evaluations, broadening the bounds of the CC through scheme-specific interpretations.\nSome national evaluation schemes are phasing out EAL-based evaluations and only accept products for evaluation that claim strict conformance with an approved PP. The United States currently only allows PP-based evaluations.\nHistory.\nCC originated out of three standards:\nCC was produced by unifying these pre-existing standards, predominantly so that companies selling computer products for the government market (mainly for Defence or Intelligence use) would only need to have them evaluated against one set of standards. The CC was developed by the governments of Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and the U.S.\nTesting organizations.\nAll testing laboratories must comply with ISO/IEC 17025, and certification bodies will normally be approved against ISO/IEC 17065.\nThe compliance with ISO/IEC 17025 is typically demonstrated to a National approval authority:\nCharacteristics of these organizations were examined and presented at ICCC 10.\nMutual recognition arrangement.\nAs well as the Common Criteria standard, there is also a sub-treaty level Common Criteria MRA (Mutual Recognition Arrangement), whereby each party thereto recognizes evaluations against the Common Criteria standard done by other parties. Originally signed in 1998 by Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, Australia and New Zealand joined 1999, followed by Finland, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain in 2000. The Arrangement has since been renamed Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA) and membership continues to expand. Within the CCRA only evaluations up to EAL 2 are mutually recognized (Including augmentation with flaw remediation). The European countries within the SOGIS-MRA typically recognize higher EALs as well. Evaluations at EAL5 and above tend to involve the security requirements of the host nation's government.\nIn September 2012, a majority of members of the CCRA produced a vision statement whereby mutual recognition of CC evaluated products will be lowered to EAL 2 (Including augmentation with flaw remediation). Further, this vision indicates a move away from assurance levels altogether and evaluations will be confined to conformance with Protection Profiles that have no stated assurance level. This will be achieved through technical working groups developing worldwide PPs, and as yet a transition period has not been fully determined.\nOn July 2, 2014, a new CCRA was ratified per the goals outlined within the 2012 vision statement. Major changes to the Arrangement include:\nIssues.\nRequirements.\nCommon Criteria is very generic; it does not directly provide a list of product security requirements or features for specific (classes of) products: this follows the approach taken by ITSEC, but has been a source of debate to those used to the more prescriptive approach of other earlier standards such as TCSEC and FIPS 140-2.\nValue of certification.\nCommon Criteria certification cannot guarantee security, but it can ensure that claims about the security attributes of the evaluated product were independently verified. In other words, products evaluated against a Common Criteria standard exhibit a clear chain of evidence that the process of specification, implementation, and evaluation has been conducted in a rigorous and standard manner.\nVarious Microsoft Windows versions, including Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, have been certified, but security patches to address security vulnerabilities are still getting published by Microsoft for these Windows systems. This is possible because the process of obtaining a Common Criteria certification allows a vendor to restrict the analysis to certain security features and to make certain assumptions about the operating environment and the strength of threats faced by the product in that environment. Additionally, the CC recognizes a need to limit the scope of evaluation in order to provide cost-effective and useful security certifications, such that evaluated products are examined to a level of detail specified by the assurance level or PP. Evaluations activities are therefore only performed to a certain depth, use of time, and resources and offer reasonable assurance for the intended environment.\nIn the Microsoft case, the assumptions include A.PEER: \n\"Any other systems with which the TOE communicates are assumed to be under the same management control and operate under the same security policy constraints. The TOE is applicable to networked or distributed environments only if the entire network operates under the same constraints and resides within a single management domain. There are no security requirements that address the need to trust external systems or the communications links to such systems.\"\nThis assumption is contained in the Controlled Access Protection Profile (CAPP) to which their products adhere. Based on this and other assumptions, which may not be realistic for the common use of general-purpose operating systems, the claimed security functions of the Windows products are evaluated. Thus they should only be considered secure in the assumed, specified circumstances, also known as the \"evaluated configuration\".\nWhether you run Microsoft Windows in the precise evaluated configuration or not, you should apply Microsoft's security patches for the vulnerabilities in Windows as they continue to appear. If any of these security vulnerabilities are exploitable in the product's evaluated configuration, the product's Common Criteria certification should be voluntarily withdrawn by the vendor. Alternatively, the vendor should re-evaluate the product to include the application of patches to fix the security vulnerabilities within the evaluated configuration. Failure by the vendor to take either of these steps would result in involuntary withdrawal of the product's certification by the certification body of the country in which the product was evaluated.\nThe certified Microsoft Windows versions remain at EAL4+ without including the application of any Microsoft security vulnerability patches in their evaluated configuration. This shows both the limitation and strength of an evaluated configuration.\nCriticisms.\nIn August 2007, \"Government Computing News\" (GCN) columnist William Jackson critically examined Common Criteria methodology and its US implementation by the Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS). In the column executives from the security industry, researchers, and representatives from the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) were interviewed. Objections outlined in the article include:\nIn a 2006 research paper, computer specialist David A. Wheeler suggested that the Common Criteria process discriminates against free and open-source software (FOSS)-centric organizations and development models. Common Criteria assurance requirements tend to be inspired by the traditional waterfall software development methodology. In contrast, much FOSS software is produced using modern agile paradigms. Although some have argued that both paradigms do not align well, others have attempted to reconcile both paradigms. Political scientist Jan Kallberg raised concerns over the lack of control over the actual production of the products once they are certified, the absence of a permanently staffed organizational body that monitors compliance, and the idea that the trust in the Common Criteria IT-security certifications will be maintained across geopolitical boundaries.\nIn 2017, the ROCA vulnerability was found in a list of Common Criteria certified smart card products. The vulnerability highlighted several shortcomings of Common Criteria certification scheme:\nAlternative approaches.\nThroughout the lifetime of CC, it has not been universally adopted even by the creator nations, with, in particular, cryptographic approvals being handled separately, such as by the Canadian / US implementation of FIPS-140, and the CESG Assisted Products Scheme (CAPS) in the UK.\nThe UK has also produced a number of alternative schemes when the timescales, costs and overheads of mutual recognition have been found to be impeding the operation of the market:\nIn early 2011, NSA/CSS published a paper by Chris Salter, which proposed a Protection Profile oriented approach towards evaluation. In this approach, communities of interest form around technology types which in turn develop protection profiles that define the evaluation methodology for the technology type. The objective is a more robust evaluation. There is some concern that this may have a negative impact on mutual recognition.\nIn Sept of 2012, the Common Criteria published a Vision Statement implementing to a large extent Chris Salter's thoughts from the previous year. Key elements of the Vision included:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lewis and Clark mention in their journals that the Chin-n\u00e2m pam (or the Lower Snake River Chamnapam Nation) called the river T\u00e2pe t\u00eatt (also rendered \"Tapteete\"), possibly from the French \"tape-t\u00eate\", meaning \"head hit\". The length of the river from headwaters to mouth is , with an average drop of . It is the longest river entirely in Washington state.\nCourse.\nThe river rises in the Cascade Range at an elevation of at Keechelus Dam on Keechelus Lake near Snoqualmie Pass, near Easton. The river flows through that town, skirts Ellensburg, passes the city of Yakima, and continues southeast to Richland, where it flows into the Columbia River creating the Yakima River Delta at an elevation of .\nAbout 9 million years ago, the Yakima River flowed south from near Vantage to the Tri-Cities, and then turned west straight for the ocean through Badger Canyon west of Kennewick. Badger Canyon was once a waterway of the Yakima River, this pre-existing channel led the Yakima River to make tribute to the Columbia River at the current location of the city of Kennewick. Beginning nearly 15,000 years ago the Columbia Plateau was transformed by the successive Missoula glacial outburst floods. Much of the flood water made way down the Columbia river Channel where a 'choke-point' known as Wallula Gap caused the restriction of flow. Floodwaters began ponding near the Tri-Cities resulting in the back-flooding of the Columbia's tributary valleys. Badger Canyon was an entry point for back-flooding of the Yakima Valley, successive floods left behind thick deposits of sediments in Badger Canyon and the Valley beyond. These flood deposits which were deposited in large quantities in short amounts of time changed the ground elevation within Badger Canyon causing the Yakima River to re-route north of Red Mountain and enter the Columbia River by present-day Richland.\nDuring the last ice age, the Missoula Floods further altered the landscape of the area, opening up the Horn Rapids area to the Yakima River. The West Fork of Amon Creek now utilizes Badger Canyon.\nThe first western explorers to visit the river were Lewis and Clark on or about October 17, 1805. They stopped briefly at the confluence of the Yakima and the Columbia, although they did not proceed upriver. The river was then known to local Native Americans as \"Tap Teel\", although the area has been inhabited since prehistory.\nRecreation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Yakima River is used for rafting, kayaking, and fishing, especially around the Ellensburg area and near the confluence with the Columbia River during the summer months. The Yakima River is ranked between Class I and Class II rapids, depending on the circumstances and season. In the Tri-Cities, the delta where the Yakima meets the Columbia has several hiking trails.\nThe dry climate, with over 300 sunshine days a year, draws visitors from Seattle, about two hours' drive away.\nYakima Valley.\nThe Yakima River Basin consists of approximately located in south central Washington State. It is bounded by the Cascade Mountains on the west, the Wenatchee Mountains on the north, Rattlesnake Mountain and the Rattlesnake Hills on the east, and the Horse Heaven Hills to the south. The basin encompasses areas designated by the Washington Department of Ecology as the Upper Yakima Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIAs) 38 and 39 and the Lower Yakima WRIA 37. The dividing line between these northern and southern sections is the confluence of the Naches and Yakima Rivers.\nThe Yakima River provides irrigation for the dry but fertile land in the valley, and irrigated agriculture is the economic base. Agricultural land totals , including irrigated pastures, orchards, grapes, hops, and field crops. A significant portion of Washington apples and cherries are grown in the valley, as well as most (75%) of the United States's hops. Since the late 20th century, the wine industry has grown rapidly in the area. It is the location of the Yakima Valley AVA, a designated American Viticultural Area.\nMajor landowners in the valley include federal and state agencies and the Yakama Indian Nation. Private ownership accounts for . The United States Forest Service manages , and the Yakama Nation owns within the basin. Forested areas in the northern and western portions of the basin occupy approximately and are used for recreation, wildlife habitat, timber harvest, grazing, and tribal cultural activities. Range lands comprise about and are used for military training, grazing, wildlife habitat, and tribal cultural activities.\nMajor population centers include the city of Yakima and the Tri-Cities area. Population growth for the 1990s was projected at 7.9% in Kittitas County, 19.7% in Yakima County, and 22.7% in Benton County. While much of the growth in Benton and Yakima counties has been in and around the incorporated areas, most of the growth in Kittitas County has been in unincorporated areas.\nIn addition to irrigated agriculture, the major economic driving forces include timber harvest and processing, cattle, and outdoor recreation. With the significant reduction in timber harvesting on federal lands and the implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan to protect the endangered northern spotted owl, the timber economy has been greatly eroded in recent years. The proximity to high population areas of the Puget Sound has caused a rapid increase in the demand for outdoor recreational experiences in the basin.\nRiver modifications.\nThe Yakima River and its tributaries have been heavily altered for the purpose of irrigated agriculture. There are numerous dams and irrigation canals. Irrigation runoff is in places returned to the river through canal drains. The irrigation system in the Yakima's watershed causes periods of both severe river dewatering and elevated flows, relative to the historic streamflow regime. As a result, discharge statistics for the Yakima River are heavily affected by the irrigation system. The USGS operates four streamflow gauges on the Yakima River. The highest average discharge recorded, , is more than halfway up the river at Union Gap. The two downriver gauges show average flows of a reduced amount.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The company is headquartered in Rochester, New York, and is incorporated in New Jersey. It is best known for photographic film products, which it brought to a mass market for the first time.\nKodak began as a partnership between George Eastman and Henry A. Strong to develop a film roll camera. After the release of the Kodak camera, Eastman Kodak was incorporated on May 23, 1892. Under Eastman's direction, the company became one of the world's largest film and camera manufacturers, and also developed a model of welfare capitalism and a close relationship with the city of Rochester. During most of the 20th century, Kodak held a dominant position in photographic film, and produced several technological innovations through heavy investment in research and development at Kodak Research Laboratories. Kodak produced some of the most popular camera models of the 20th century, including the Brownie and Instamatic. The company's ubiquity was such that its \"Kodak moment\" tagline entered the common lexicon to describe a personal event that deserved to be recorded for posterity.\nKodak began to struggle financially in the late 1990s as a result of increasing competition from Fujifilm. The company also struggled with the transition from film to digital photography, even though Kodak had developed the first self-contained digital camera. Attempts to diversify its chemical operations failed, and as a turnaround strategy in the 2000s, Kodak instead made an aggressive turn to digital photography and digital printing. These strategies failed to improve the company's finances, and in January 2012, Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\nIn September 2013, the company emerged from bankruptcy, having shed its large legacy liabilities, restructured, and exited several businesses. Since emerging from bankruptcy, Kodak has continued to provide commercial digital printing products and services, motion picture film, and still film, the last of which is distributed through the spinoff company Kodak Alaris. The company has licensed the Kodak brand to several products produced by other companies, such as the PIXPRO line of digital cameras manufactured by JK Imaging. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Kodak announced in late July that year it would begin production of pharmaceutical materials.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nName.\nThe letter \"k\" was a favorite of George Eastman's; he is quoted as saying, \"it seems a strong, incisive sort of letter.\" He and his mother, Maria, devised the name \"Kodak\" using an Anagrams set. Eastman said that there were three principal concepts he used in creating the name: it should be short, easy to pronounce, and not resemble any other name or be associated with anything else. According to a 1920 ad, the name \"was simply invented\u00a0\u2013 made up from letters of the alphabet to meet our trademark requirements. It was short and euphonious and likely to stick in the public mind.\" The \"Kodak\" name was trademarked by Eastman in 1888. There was also a rumor that the name \"Kodak\" came from the sound made by the Kodak camera's shutter.\nFounding.\nEastman entered a partnership with Henry Strong in 1880, and the Eastman Dry Plate Company was founded on January 1, 1881, with Strong as president and Eastman as treasurer. Initially, the company sold dry plates for cameras, but Eastman's interest turned to replacing glass plates altogether with a new roll film process. On October 1, 1884, the company was re-incorporated as the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company. In 1885, Eastman patented the first practical film roll holder with William Walker, which would allow dry plate cameras to store multiple exposures in a camera simultaneously. That same year, Eastman patented a form of paper film he called \"American film\". Eastman would continue experimenting with cameras and hired chemist Henry Reichenbach to improve the film. These experiments would culminate in an 1889 patent for nitrocellulose film. As the company continued to grow, it was reincorporated several more times. In November 1889, it was renamed the Eastman Company, and 10,000 shares of stock were issued for $100. On May 23, 1892, another round of capitalization occurred and it was renamed Eastman Kodak. An Eastman Kodak of New Jersey was established in 1901 and existed simultaneously with the Eastman Kodak of New York until 1936, when the New York corporation was dissolved and its assets were transferred to the New Jersey corporation. Kodak remains incorporated in New Jersey today, although its headquarters is in Rochester.\nThe Kodak camera.\nIn 1888, the Kodak camera was patented by Eastman. It was a box camera with a fixed-focus lens on the front and no viewfinder; two V shape silhouettes at the top aided in aiming in the direction of the subject. At the top, it had a rotating key to advance the film, a pull-string to set the shutter, and a button on the side to release it, exposing the celluloid film. Inside, it had a rotating bar to operate the shutter. When the user pressed the button to take a photograph, an inner rope was tightened and the exposure began. Once the photograph had been taken, the user had to rotate the upper key to change the selected frame within the celluloid tape.\nThe $25 camera came pre-loaded with a film roll of 100 exposures, and could be mailed to Eastman's headquarters in Rochester with $10 for processing. The camera would be returned with prints, negatives, and a new roll of film. Additional rolls were also sold for $2 to professional photographers who wished to develop their own photographs. By unburdening the photographer from the complicated and expensive process of film development, photography became more accessible than ever before. The camera was an immediate success with the public and launched a fad of amateur photography. Eastman's advertising slogan, \"You Press the Button, We Do the Rest\", soon entered the public lexicon, and was referenced by Chauncey Depew in a speech and Gilbert and Sullivan in their opera \"Utopia, Limited\".\nExpansion.\nIn the 1890s and early 1900s, Kodak grew rapidly and outmaneuvered competitors through a combination of innovation, acquisitions, and exclusive contracts. Eastman recognized that film would return more profit than the cameras that used them, and focused on control of the film market. This razor and blades model of sales would change little for several decades. Larger facilities were soon needed in Rochester, and the construction of Kodak Park began in 1890. Kodak purchased and opened several shops and factories in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom. The British holdings were initially organized under the Eastman Photographic Materials Company. Beginning in 1898, they were placed under the holding company Kodak Limited. An Australian subsidiary, Australia Kodak Limited, was established in 1908. In 1931, Kodak-Path\u00e9 was established in France and Kodak AG was formed in Germany following the acquisition of Nagel. The Brownie camera, marketed to children, was first released in 1900, and further expanded the amateur photography market. One of the largest markets for film became the emerging motion picture industry. When Thomas Edison and other film producers formed the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908, Eastman negotiated for Kodak to be the sole supplier of film to the industry. In 1914, Kodak built its current headquarters on State Street. By 1922, the company was the second-largest purchaser of silver in the United States, behind the U.S. Treasury. Beginning on July 18, 1930, Kodak was included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.During World War I, Kodak established a photographic school in Rochester to train pilots for aerial reconnaissance. The war strained supply chains, and Eastman sought out new chemical sources that the company could have direct control over. At the war's end in 1920, Kodak purchased a hardwood distillation plant in Tennessee from the federal government and established Eastman Tennessee, which later became the Eastman Chemical Company.\nHenry Strong died in 1919, after which Eastman became the company president. Eastman began to wind down his involvement in the daily management of the company in the mid-1920s, and formally retired in 1925, although he remained on the board of directors. William Stuber succeeded him as president and managed the company along with Frank Lovejoy.\nIn 1912, Kodak established the Kodak Research Laboratories at Building 3 in Kodak Park, with Kenneth Mees as director. Research primarily focused on film emulsions for color photography and radiography. In 1915, Kodak began selling Kodachrome, a two-color film developed by John Capstaff at the research lab. Another two-color film duplitized film was marketed for photography of X-rays as it had a short exposure time and could reduce the dosage of radiation needed to take a photo.\nLabor relations.\nKodak became closely tied to Rochester, where most of its employees resided, and was at the vanguard of welfare capitalism during the 1910s and 1920s. Eastman implemented several worker benefit programs, including a welfare fund to provide workmen's compensation in 1910 and a profit-sharing program for all employees in 1912. In 1919, he sold a large portion of his stock to company employees below market value. The expansion of benefits continued after Eastman; in 1928, the company began offering life insurance, disability benefits, and retirement annuity plans for employees, at the behest of company statistician Marion Folsom. Many other employers in the Rochester area took cues from Kodak and increased their own wages and benefits to remain competitive in the labor market.\nEastman believed that offering these benefits served the interests of the company. He feared labor unions and believed that offering better compensation than that received by union workers would deter union organizing and avoid the potential costs of a company strike. Selling his stock to employees would simultaneously make it more appealing to investors, who were wary of purchasing shares because of his large stake, and lower the price of the stock, which would keep anti-trust lawyers from investigating the company. Because Kodak was a capital-intensive industry with a low labor-cost ratio, employee benefits contributed less to the company's expenses than they would in other industries.\nEmployment opportunities were not extended to all Rochesterians. The company almost exclusively hired workers of an Anglo-Saxon background under Eastman, and excluded Catholic immigrants, African-Americans, and Jews. Approximately one-third of employees were female. A system of family hiring, where children of employees would be hired to follow their parents, reinforced the concept of an industrial community that Eastman sought to create. These practices were not seriously challenged until after World War II. As a consequence of this shared background and the robust company benefits, Kodak employees formed a close community that viewed unions as outsiders, and no attempt to organize workers at Kodak succeeded during the 20th century.\nGreat Depression.\nKodak was hard-hit by the Great Depression, although Rochester was spared from its worst effects as banks were able to remain solvent. Seventeen percent of the company's employees were laid off between 1929 and 1933. Company founder George Eastman committed suicide at his home on March 14, 1932, due to his declining health. From 1931 to 1936, Kodak participated in the Rochester Plan, a privately funded unemployment insurance program to assist the jobless and boost consumer spending. The program was created by Marion Folsom, who gained national recognition for his work and would later serve as a company director and cabinet secretary for Dwight D. Eisenhower. Payments were made between 1933 and 1936, when layoffs ended at Kodak. The program led to many statistical improvements at Kodak, but overall had an insignificant effect on the Rochester community, as few companies were willing to join the program.\nResearch projects led to several new Kodak products in the 1930s. At Kodak Research Laboratories, Leopold Godowsky Jr. and Leopold Mannes invented a three-color film which would be commercially viable. In 1935, the product was launched as Kodachrome. The company also produced industrial high-speed cameras and began to diversify its chemical operations by producing vitamin concentrates and plastics. In 1934, Kodak entered a partnership with Edwin Land to supply polarized lenses, after briefly considering an offer to purchase Land's patents. Land would later launch the Polaroid Corporation and invented the first instant camera using emulsions supplied by Kodak.\nFrank Lovejoy succeeded William Stuber as company president in 1934, and Thomas J. Hargrave became president in 1941.\nWorld War II.\nAfter the American entry into World War II, Kodak ceased its production of amateur film and began supplying the American war effort at the direction of the War Production Board. The company produced film, cameras, microfilm, pontoons, synthetic fibers, RDX, variable-time fuses, and hand grenades for the government.\nKodak's European subsidiaries continued to operate during the war. Kodak AG, the German subsidiary, was transferred to two trustees in 1941 to allow the company to continue operating in the event of war between Germany and the United States. The company produced film, fuses, triggers, detonators, and other material. Slave labor was employed at Kodak AG's Stuttgart and Berlin-K\u00f6penick plants. During the German occupation of France, Kodak-Path\u00e9 facilities in Severan and Vincennes were also used to support the German war effort. Kodak continued to import goods to the United States purchased from Nazi Germany through neutral nations such as Switzerland. This practice was criticized by many American diplomats but defended by others as more beneficial to the American war effort than detrimental. Kodak received no penalties during or after the war for collaboration.\nManhattan Project.\nAfter a 1943 meeting between Kenneth Mees and Leslie Groves, a team of Kodak scientists joined the Manhattan Project and enriched uranium-235 at Oak Ridge.\nKodak's experiments with radiation would continue after the war. In 1945, a batch of X-ray film that the company processed mysteriously became fogged. Julian Webb, who had worked at Oak Ridge, proposed that the film had been exposed to radiation released by nuclear weapons tests. The source of the radiation was eventually traced to strawboard packaging from Vincennes, Indiana, which had been irradiated by fallout that had traveled thousands of miles northeast from the Trinity test site. After this discovery, Kodak officials became concerned that fallout would contaminate more of their film, and began monitoring atmospheric radiation levels with rainwater collection at Kodak Park. In 1951, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) began providing Kodak with a schedule of nuclear tests in exchange for its silence after the company threatened to sue the federal government for damage caused to film products. Kodak was later contracted to create emulsions for radiation tests of fallout from nuclear tests.\nPost-war expansion.\nKodak reached its zenith in the post-war era, as the usage of film for amateur, commercial, and government purposes all increased. In 1948, Tennessee Eastman created a working acetate film, which quickly replaced nitrate film in the movie industry because it was non-flammable. In 1958, Kodak began marketing a line of super glue, Eastman 910. Its cameras were used by NASA for space exploration. In 1963, the first Instamatic cameras were sold, which were the company's lowest-cost cameras to date. Annual sales passed $1 billion in 1962 and $2 billion in 1966. Albert K. Chapman succeeded Thomas Hargrave as president in 1952, and was succeeded by William S. Vaughn in 1960. Louis K. Eilers would serve as president and CEO between 1969 and 1972. In the 1970s, Kodak published important research in dye lasers, and patented the Bayer Filter method of RGB arrangement on photosensors.\nDuring the Cold War, Kodak participated in several clandestine government projects. Beginning in 1955, they were contracted by the CIA to design cameras and develop film for the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft under the Bridgehead Program. Kodak was also contracted by the National Reconnaissance Office to produce cameras for surveillance satellites such as the KH-7 Gambit and KH-9 Hexagon. Between 1963 and 1970, Kodak engineers worked on the cancelled Manned Orbiting Laboratory program, designing optical sensors for a crewed reconnaissance satellite. The company later performed a study for NASA on the astronomical uses of the equipment developed for MOL.\nKodak doubled its number of employees worldwide between 1936 and 1966. The majority remained employed in Rochester, where it was the employer of choice for most. The company continued offering higher wages and more benefits than labor market competitors, including the annual wage dividend, a bonus for all employees, which typically amounted to 15% of base salary. Employee loyalty was strong, and the company experienced a turnover rate of only 13% in the 1950s, compared to 50% for American manufacturers as a whole. Journalist Curt Gerling noted that Kodak employees behaved like a separate class from other workers in Rochester, and \"From the cradle infants are impressed with the fact that 'daddy is a Kodak man'; inferentially this compares with 'our father is a 33rd degree mason'\". A 1989 \"New York Times\" article compared Rochester to a company town.\nKodak's business model changed little from the 1930s to the 1970s, as the company's dominant position made change unnecessary, and it made no mergers or acquisitions, which might bring new perspectives. Research and development remained focused on products related to film production and development, which caused the company to fall behind rivals Polaroid and Xerox in the development of instant cameras and photocopiers. Kodak would begin selling its own versions of each in the mid-1970s, but neither became popular. Both product lines would be abandoned in the 1990s.\nRivalry with Fujifilm.\nJapanese competitor Fujifilm entered the U.S. market with lower-priced film and supplies in the 1980s. Fuji defeated Kodak in a bid to become the official film of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, which gave it a permanent foothold in the market. Fuji opened a film plant in the U.S., and its aggressive marketing and price cutting began taking market share from Kodak, rising from a 10% share in the early 1990s to 17% in 1997. Fuji also made headway into the professional market with specialty transparency films such as Velvia and Provia, which competed with Kodak's signature professional product, Kodachrome.\nEncouraged by shareholders, the company began cutting benefits and making large layoffs to save money. Despite the competition, Kodak's revenues and profits continued to increase during the 1990s, due to the strategy changes and an overall expansion of the global market. Under CEO George M. C. Fisher, Kodak's annual revenue peaked at $16 billion in 1996 and profits peaked at $2.5 billion in 1999.\nIn May 1995, Kodak filed a petition with the US Commerce Department under section 301 of the Commerce Act, arguing that its poor performance in the Japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by Fuji. The complaint was lodged by the United States with the World Trade Organization. On January 30, 1998, the WTO announced a \"sweeping rejection of Kodak's complaints\" about the film market in Japan.\nA price war between the two companies began in 1997, eating into Kodak's profits. Kodak's financial results for 1997 showed that the company's revenues dropped from $15.97\u00a0billion in 1996 to $14.36\u00a0billion in 1997, a fall of more than 10%; its net earnings went from $1.29\u00a0billion to just $5\u00a0million for the same period. Kodak's market share declined from 80.1% to 74.7% in the United States, a one-year drop of five percentage points.\nFuji and Kodak recognized the upcoming threat of digital photography, and although both sought to diversify as a mitigation strategy, Fuji was more successful at diversification. Fuji stopped production of motion picture film in 2013, leaving Kodak as the last major producer.\nShift to digital.\nDespite the common misconception that the industry titan's refusal to invest in digital cameras led to its downfall, Kodak was actively involved in the development and production of digital cameras. In 1972, Roger VanHeyningen, the Director of the Physics Division in Kodak Research Labs (KRL), established a small laboratory where researchers began investigating the basic processes of the metal oxide semiconductor technology used to manufacture Charge Coupled Device (CCD) image sensors. In early 1974, KRL began an effort to develop a one-piece color video camera / recorder (now known as a camcorder), to replace home movie cameras which used 8mm film. While working on this project, Kodak Scientist Peter L. P. Dillon invented integral color image sensors and single-sensor color video cameras, which are now ubiquitous in products such as smart phone cameras, digital cameras and camcorders, digital cinema cameras, medical cameras, automobile cameras, and drones. In 1982, Kodak designed and manufactured a color CCD image sensor having 360,000 pixels, the highest resolution sensor available at the time.Kodak employee Steven Sasson developed the first handheld digital camera in 1975 using a monochrome CCD manufactured by Fairchild having 10,000 pixels. Larry Matteson, another employee, wrote a report in 1979 predicting a complete shift to digital photography would occur by 2010. However, company executives were reluctant to make a strong pivot towards digital technology at the time, since it would require heavy investment for a very limited market and put the company into direct competition with established firms in the computer hardware industry.\nUnder CEOs Colby Chandler and Kay Whitmore, Kodak instead attempted to diversify its chemical operations. Although these new operations were given large budgets, there was little long-term planning or assistance from outside experts, and most of them resulted in large losses. Another effort to diversify failed when Kodak purchased Sterling Drug in 1988 for $5.1 billion. The drug company was overvalued and soon lost money. Research and development at Kodak Research Laboratories was directed into digital technology during the 1980s, laying the groundwork for a future digital shift.\nKodak sought to establish a presence in the information systems market, acquiring Unix developer Interactive Systems Corporation in early 1988 to operate as a subsidiary of Kodak's newly established software systems division. Kodak's resources enabled Interactive to expand their business, but this raised issues with regard to Kodak's strategy, since the company had previously acquired a 7% stake, diluted to 4.5% by subsequent share issues, in prominent Unix systems vendor Sun Microsystems. Interactive's role in Kodak's strategy was to deliver Unix-based imaging products and to support Kodak's introduction of Photo CD. Interactive planned to release a distribution of Unix System V Release 4 featuring comprehensive support for imaging peripherals such as scanners and printers, along with facilities for colour management and colourspace conversion. Later in 1991, however, Kodak put Interactive up for sale, attracting interest from various technology companies including the SunSoft subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, on whose Solaris operating system Interactive had undertaken development work. SunSoft eventually acquired the systems products division of Interactive in early 1992, leaving the services and technologies division with Kodak, until its eventual sale to SHL Systemhouse in 1993. Kodak would continue its relationship with Sun as a notable customer, integrating various Sun technologies in its document management products. Kodak would later sue Sun for infringing three software patents acquired by Kodak in 1997 from Wang Laboratories.\nIn 1993, Whitmore announced the company would restructure, and he was succeeded by George M. C. Fisher, a former Motorola CEO, later that year. Under Fisher, the company abandoned diversification in chemicals and focused on an incremental shift to digital technology. Tennessee Eastman was spun off as Eastman Chemical on January 1, 1994, and Sterling Drug's remaining operations were sold in August 1994. Eastman Chemical later became a Fortune 500 company in its own right. A key component of the incremental strategy was Kodak's line of digital self-service kiosks installed in retail locations, where consumers could upload and edit photos, as a replacement for traditional photo developers. Kodak also began manufacturing digital cameras, such as the Apple QuickTake. Film sales continued to rise during the 1990s, delaying the digital transition from occurring faster.\nIn 2001, film sales began to fall. Under Daniel Carp, Fisher's successor as CEO, Kodak made an aggressive move in the digital camera market with its EasyShare family of digital cameras. By 2005, Kodak ranked No. 1 in the U.S. in digital camera sales, which surged 40% to $5.7\u00a0billion. The company also began selling digital medical image systems after acquiring the Israel-based companies Algotec Systems and OREX Computed Radiography. Despite the initial high growth in sales, digital cameras had low profit margins due to strong competition, and the market rapidly matured. Its digital cameras soon were undercut by Asian competitors that could produce and sell cheaper products. Many digital cameras were sold at a loss as a result. The film business, where Kodak enjoyed high profit margins, also continued to fall. The combination of these two factors caused a decline in profits. By 2007, Kodak had dropped to No. 4 in U.S. digital camera sales with a 9.6% share, and by 2010, had dropped to a 7% share, in seventh place behind Canon, Sony, Nikon, and others, according to research firm IDC. An ever-smaller share of digital pictures were being taken on dedicated digital cameras, being gradually displaced by cameras on cellphones, smartphones, and tablets. Digital camera sales peaked in 2007 and declined afterwards.\nIn September 2025, Kodak released the Charmera, a mini digital keychain camera sold in blind boxes, available in seven retro designs with vintage\u2011style filters, a date\u2011stamp function, and USB\u2011C file transfer.\nNew strategy.\nKodak began another strategy shift after Antonio M. P\u00e9rez became CEO in 2005. While Kodak had previously done all development and manufacturing in-house, P\u00e9rez shut down factories and outsourced or eliminated manufacturing divisions. Kodak agreed to divest its digital camera manufacturing operations to Flextronics in August 2006, including assembly, production, and testing. The company exited the film camera market altogether, and began to end the production of film products. In total, 13 film plants and 130 photo finishing facilities were closed, and 50,000 employees laid off between 2004 and 2007. In 2009, Kodak announced that it would cease selling Kodachrome color film, ending 74 years of production, after a dramatic decline in sales.\nP\u00e9rez invested heavily in digital technologies and new services that capitalized on its technology innovation to boost profit margins. He also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build up a high-margin printer ink business to replace falling film sales, a move which was widely criticized due to the amount of competition present in the printer market, which would make expansion difficult. Kodak's ink strategy rejected the razor and blades business model used by dominant market leader Hewlett-Packard by selling expensive printers with cheaper ink cartridges. In 2011, these new lines of inkjet printers were said to be on verge of turning a profit, although some analysts were skeptical as printouts had been replaced gradually by electronic copies on computers, tablets, and smartphones. Inkjet printers continued to be viewed as one of the company's anchors after it entered bankruptcy proceedings. However, in September 2012, declining sales forced Kodak to announce an exit from the consumer inkjet market.\nBankruptcy.\nKodak's finances and stock value continued to decline, and in 2009 the company negotiated a $300 million loan from KKR. Several divisions were sold off to repay debts from previous investments, most notably the Kodak Health Group, one of the company's profitable units. Kodak used the $2.35 billion from the sale to fully repay its approximately $1.15\u00a0billion of secured term debt. Around 8,100 employees from the Kodak Health Group transferred to Onex, which was renamed Carestream Health. In 2010, Kodak was removed from the S&amp;P 500.\nIn the face of growing debts and falling revenues, Kodak also turned to patent litigation to generate revenue. In 2010, it received $838\u00a0million from patent licensing that included a settlement with LG. Between 2010 and 2012, Kodak and Apple sued each other in multiple patent infringement lawsuits.\nBy 2011, Kodak was rapidly using up its cash reserves, stoking fears of bankruptcy; it had $957\u00a0million in cash in June 2011, down from $1.6\u00a0billion in January 2001. Later that year, Kodak reportedly explored selling off or licensing its vast portfolio of patents to stave off bankruptcy. In December 2011, two board members who had been appointed by KKR resigned. By January 2012, analysts suggested that the company could enter bankruptcy followed by an auction of its patents, as it was reported to be in talks with Citigroup to provide debtor-in-possession financing. This was confirmed on January 19, 2012, when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and obtained a $950\u00a0million, 18-month credit facility from Citigroup to enable it to continue operations. Under the terms of its bankruptcy protection, Kodak had a deadline of February 15, 2013, to produce a reorganization plan. In January 2013, the Court approved financing for Kodak to emerge from bankruptcy by mid 2013.\nDuring bankruptcy proceedings, Kodak sold many of its patents for approximately $525 million to a group of companies (including Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Samsung, Adobe Systems, and HTC) under the names Intellectual Ventures and RPX Corporation. Kodak announced that it would end the production of several products, including digital cameras, pocket video cameras, digital picture frames, and inkjet printers. As part of a settlement with the UK-based Kodak Pension Plan, Kodak agreed to sell its photographic film, commercial scanners, and photo kiosk operations, which were reorganized as a spinoff company, Kodak Alaris. The Image Sensor Solutions (ISS) division of Kodak was sold to Truesense Imaging Inc.\nOn September 3, 2013, Kodak announced that it emerged from bankruptcy as a technology company focused on imaging for business. Its main business segments would be Digital Printing &amp; Enterprise and Graphics, Entertainment &amp; Commercial Films.\nKodak's decline and bankruptcy were damaging to the Rochester area. Its jobs were largely replaced with lower-paying ones, contributing to a high poverty rate in the city. Between 2007 and 2018, real GDP losses from Kodak canceled out the growth in all other sectors in Rochester.\nPost-bankruptcy.\nOn March 12, 2014, Kodak announced that Jeffrey J. Clarke had been named as chief executive officer and a member of its board of directors. At the end of 2016, Kodak reported its first annual profit since bankruptcy.\nIn recent years, Kodak has licensed its brand to several other companies. The California-based company JK Imaging has manufactured Micro Four-Thirds cameras under the Kodak brand since 2013. The Kodak Ektra, a smartphone, was designed by the Bullitt Group and launched in 2016. Digital tablets were announced with Archos in 2017. In 2018, Kodak announced two failed cryptocurrency products; the cryptocurrency KodakCoin, which was developed by RYDE Holding, Inc., and the Kodak Kashminer, a Bitcoin-mining computer which was developed by Spotlite.\nIn 2016, the Kodak spinoff company eApeiron was founded with assets acquired from Kodak and an investment by Alibaba. The company's mission is to eliminate \u201cknock offs\u201d and promote authenticity.\nDespite the pivot to digital technology, film remains a major component of Kodak's business. The company continues to supply film to the motion picture industry after signing new agreements with major studios in 2015 and 2020. In 2022, Kodak announced it would hire new film technicians after film photography experienced a revival among hobbyists.\nCurrent products and services.\nKodak is currently arranged in four business reporting segments: Traditional Print, Digital Print, Advanced Material &amp; Chemicals (including Motion Picture), and Brand (Brand licensing of consumer products produced by third parties).\nKodak is the primary provider of film stock to the American motion picture industry, and also provides packaging, functional printing, graphic communications, and professional services for international businesses.\nKodak Alaris, based in the UK, holds the rights to still photographic films and the Kodak Moments photo kiosk businesses, which formed part of the 2012 bankruptcy settlement. They also held the rights to the Photo Paper, Photochemicals, Display, and Software businesses (PPDS) but sold these to Sino Promise, China, in 2020. In 2023, Sino Promise relinquished the photochemical rights, which reverted to Eastman Kodak, who re-licensed them (see brand).\nAdvanced Material &amp; Chemicals.\nMotion picture.\nSince the 2000s, most movies across the world have been captured and distributed digitally; however, some filmmakers still prefer to use film picture formats to achieve the desired results.\nMotion picture camera films are produced in 8mm, 16mm, and 35mm. In addition to the camera films listed below, several motion picture technical stocks are also produced, e.g., inter-negatives, duplication sound, and final print films, together with the process chemicals.\nCamera films\nStill film.\nEastman Kodak continues to manufacture Kodak-branded still films on behalf of Kodak Alaris (except for Kodacolor 100/200), which holds the rights to the sale, marketing, and distribution of these products.\nEastman Kodak also undertakes contract coating and/or packaging for other still film brands, including Cinestill (remjet-free versions of color movie films), Lomography color negative films, and Fujifilm, which, starting in 2022, procured production of some color negative films from their former business rival. Due to shortage of still films, 35mm motion picture stock has also been made available to still film consumers by 3rd parties such as Flic Film.\nEastman Kodak currently produces several photographic film products in 35mm and 120 film formats. In response to the growing demand for film by hobbyists, Kodak launched a newly formulated version of the discontinued Ektachrome 100 in 35mm film format in September 2018. The following year, the company announced the film stock in 120 and 4x5 film formats.\nTraditional and digital printing.\nKodak produces commercial inkjet printers, electrophotographic printing equipment, and related consumables and services. At present, Kodak sells the Prosper, Nexfinity, and Uteco lines of commercial printers, and the Prosper and Versamark imprinting systems. Kodak designs and manufactures products for flexography printing through its Flexcel brand. The company has also sold a line of computer to plate (CTP) devices since 1995.\nThe company currently has partnerships with touch-panel producers for functional printing, including ones with UniPixel, announced on April 16, 2013, and Kingsbury Corp., launched on June 27, 2013.\nIn 1997, Heidelberg Printing Machines AG and Eastman Kodak Co. created Nexpress Solutions LLC, a joint venture to develop a digital color printing press for the high-end market segment. Heidelberg acquired Eastman Kodak Co.'s Office Imaging black and white digital printing activities in 1999. In March 2004, Heidelberg transferred its Digital Print division to Kodak under mutual agreement.\nBrand.\nThe Kodak brand is licensed to several consumer products produced by other companies, such as the PIXPRO line of digital cameras manufactured by JK Imaging.\nBatteries.\nKodak licenses its brand on alkaline, lithium, hearing aid and button cell batteries.\nProfessional photo chemistry.\nThe brand rights to Kodak professional photo chemistry, passed to Kodak Alaris in 2012 as part of the bankruptcy settlement. In 2020, Alaris sold these rights to Sino Promise, a Chinese supplier of the color chemistry for minilabs. However, in early 2023, Sino Promise decided to exit the business; this enabled Photo Systems Inc. US, who had been a manufacturer of some of the products for Kodak Alaris, to acquire the brand rights directly from Eastman Kodak in September 2023, with the intent to re-introduce the full range of black &amp; white, and C-41, RA-4 and E6 color photochemistry.\nFormer products and services.\nPhotographic film and paper.\nKodak continues to produce specialty films and film for newer and more popular consumer formats, but it has discontinued the manufacture of film in most older formats. Among its most famous discontinued film brands was Kodachrome.\nKodak was a leading producer of silver halide paper used for printing from film and digital images. In 2005, Kodak announced it would stop producing black-and-white photo paper. All paper manufacturing operations were transferred to Kodak Alaris in 2013.\nStill film cameras.\nKodak sold film cameras from the time of its founding until 2007, beginning with the Kodak No. 1 in 1888. In the 20th century, Kodak's most popular models were the Brownie, sold between 1900 and 1986, and the Instamatic, sold between 1968 and 1988.\nBetween 1914 and 1932, an autographic feature on Kodak cameras provided a means for recording data on the margin of the negative at the time of exposure.\nIn 1982, Kodak launched a newly developed disc film camera. The cameras initially sold well due to their compact size, but were unpopular due to their poor image quality, and were discontinued in 1988.\nOn January 13, 2004, Kodak announced it would stop marketing traditional still film cameras (excluding disposable cameras) in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, but would continue to sell film cameras in India, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and China. By the end of 2005, Kodak had ceased manufacturing cameras that used the Advanced Photo System. Kodak licensed the manufacture of Kodak-branded cameras to Vivitar in 2006.\nSlide projectors.\nKodak purchased a concept for a slide projector from Italian-American inventor Louis Misuraca in the early 1960s. The Carousel line of slide projectors was launched in 1962, and a patent was granted to Kodak employee David E. Hansen in 1965. Kodak ended the production of slide projectors in October 2004.\nOne early Kodak product bridging digital technology with projection techniques was the Kodak Datashow, featuring a translucent liquid crystal display panel that was placed on an overhead projector instead of a conventional transparency, with the panel being connected to the display card of a personal computer to accept its video output. This arrangement permitted the computer's display to be projected onto a projection screen or wall, making it suitable for viewing by audiences of more than \"a handful of people\". Limitations included the monochrome nature of the panel, along with a lack of resolution and contrast. However, at just above the \"psychologically important \u00a31,000 mark\", the product was competitive when considering the pricing of larger colour monitors appropriate for group viewing.\nInstant cameras.\nKodak was the exclusive supplier of negatives for Polaroid cameras from 1963 until 1969, when Polaroid chose to manufacture its own instant film. In 1976, Kodak began selling its own line of EK instant camera models. These were followed by the Colorburst in 1979 and the Kodamatic in 1982. After losing a patent battle with Polaroid Corporation, Kodak left the instant camera business in 1986.\nImage sensors.\nIn the early 1970s, Kodak began research into CCD sensor image sensors. Kodak developed the first megapixel sensor in a 2/3 inch format, which was marketed in the Videk Megaplus Camera in 1987. In 1991, the KAF-1300, a 1.3 megapixel sensor, was used in Kodak's first commercially sold digital camera, the DCS-100. The company began producing its first CMOS image sensors in 2005.\nThe Bayer filter, a method of RGB color display for image sensors, was patented by Kodak scientist Bryce Bayer in 1976. In 2007, a successor to the Bayer filter for digital cameras was created by company scientists John Compton and John Hamilton, which added white pixels to the RGB display.\nIn 2011, Kodak sold its Image Sensor Solutions business to Platinum Equity, which was renamed Truesense shortly after.\nFloppy disks.\nIn 1983, Kodak introduced a non-standard 3.3\u00a0million byte diskette; it was manufactured by an outside company, DriveTec. Another was announced in 1984. Kodak's 1985 purchase of Verbatim, a floppy disk manufacturer with over 2,000 employees, expanded their presence. Part of this acquisition was Verbatim's \"Data Encore\" unit, which \"copies software onto floppy disks in a way that makes it difficult for software 'pirates' to re-copy the material.\"\nIn 1990, Kodak exited the diskette business and sold Verbatim to Mitsubishi Kasei, the forerunner of Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation. Kodak held onto Verbatim's optical disk unit.\nDigital cameras.\nThe Kodak DCS series of digital single-lens reflex cameras and digital camera backs were released by Kodak in the 1990s and 2000s, and discontinued in 2005. They were based on existing 35mm film SLRs from Nikon and Canon. In 2003, the Kodak EasyShare series was launched. Kodak extensively studied customer behavior, finding that women in particular enjoyed taking digital photos but were frustrated by the difficulty in moving them to their computers. Kodak attempted to fill this niche with a wide range of products, which made it easy to share photos via PCs. One of their key innovations was a printer dock, which allowed consumers to insert their cameras into a compact device and print photos with the press of a button. In April 2006, Kodak introduced the Kodak EasyShare V610, at that time the world's smallest 10\u00d7 (38\u2013380\u00a0mm) optical zoom camera at less than 2.5\u00a0cm (an inch) thick.\nMany of Kodak's early compact digital cameras were designed and built by Chinon Industries, a Japanese camera manufacturer. In 2004, Kodak Japan acquired Chinon and many of its engineers and designers joined Kodak Japan. In July 2006, Kodak announced that Flextronics would manufacture and help design its digital cameras.\nKodak ended the production of its digital cameras in 2012.\nDigital picture frames.\nKodak first entered the digital picture frame market with the Kodak Smart Picture Frame in the fourth quarter of 2000. It was designed by Weave Innovations and licensed to Kodak with an exclusive relationship with Weave's StoryBox online photo network. Smart Frame owners connected to the network via an analog telephone connection built into the frame. The frame could hold 36 images internally and came with a six-month free subscription to the StoryBox network.\nKodak re-entered the digital photo frame market at CES in 2007 with the introduction of four new EasyShare-branded models, some of which included Wi-Fi capability to connect with the Kodak Gallery. Kodak ended the production of digital picture frames in 2012.\nKodak Gallery.\nIn June 2001, Kodak purchased the photo-developing website Ofoto, later renamed Kodak Gallery. The website enabled users to upload their photos into albums, publish them into prints, and create mousepads, calendars, and other products. On March 1, 2012, Kodak announced that it sold Kodak Gallery to Shutterfly for $23.8\u00a0million.\nLight-emitting diodes.\nKodak's research into LED technology produced several innovations beginning in the 1980s. In 1986, Kodak unveiled the first high-volume LED printer. Kodak chemists Ching Wan Tang and Steven Van Slyke created the first practical organic light-emitting diode (OLED) in 1987. In 1999, Kodak entered a partnership with Sanyo to produce OLED displays. Kodak sold its OLED business unit to LG Electronics in December 2009.\nMedical technology.\nKodak's first radiographic film was produced in 1896.\nIn the 1970s, Kodak developed the Ektachem Analyzer, a clinical chemistry analyzer. The devices were first sold in 1980 after receiving FDA approval.\nIn 2007, Kodak agreed to sell Kodak Health Group to Onex Corporation for $2.35\u00a0billion in cash, and up to $200\u00a0million in additional future payments if Onex achieved specified returns on the acquisition. The sale was completed May 1.\nDocument imaging.\nKodak's involvement in document imaging technology began when George Eastman partnered with banks to image checks in the 1920s. Kodak subsidiary Recordak was founded in 1928 to manufacture some of the first microfilm. Kodak acquired the Bowe Bell &amp; Howell scanner division in 2009. The Document Imaging division was transferred to Kodak Alaris in 2013.\nPhotocopiers and duplicators.\nKodak entered the plain paper photocopier market in 1975 with the Kodak Ektaprint 100 Copier-Duplicator. In 1986 they announced the Ektaprint 235 copier-duplicator, capable of producing 5,100 copies per hour, and the Ektaprint 300, capable of producing 6,000 copies per hour. In 1988 IBM exited the Photocopier industry, selling its interests to Kodak for an undisclosed sum. On Sept. 10, 1996 Kodak announced it was selling its Copier business to Danka for $684 million in cash.\nConsumer inkjet printers.\nKodak entered into consumer inkjet photo printers in a joint venture with manufacturer Lexmark with the Kodak Personal Picture Maker PM100 and PM200. In February 2007, Kodak re-entered the market with a new product line of All-in-One (AiO) inkjet printers that employ several technologies marketed as Kodacolor Technology. Advertising emphasized low price for ink cartridges rather than for the printers themselves. The printers failed to become profitable and were a major contributor to the company's bankruptcy in 2012. Kodak announced plans to stop selling inkjet printers in 2013 as it focused on commercial printing.\nPhoto kiosks.\nKodak's first self-service kiosk opened in 1988. The Picture Maker line of kiosks was launched in 1994 for digital prints. Kiosks were installed in retail locations to provide a digital equivalent to the company's film processing locations. Over time, additional features for image editing and products were added, such as the ability to remove red-eye effect from portraits. The PYNK Smart Print System, announced in 2010, would allow customers to create collages on-demand. Over 100,000 kiosks were installed worldwide during the 1990s and 2000s. The photo kiosks were transferred to Kodak Alaris as part of the Personalized Imaging division in 2013.\nPhotography On Demand.\nAfter two years in development, Kodak launched an on-demand photography service platform, Kodakit, in early 2016. The launch was formally announced in January 2017 at CES. Kodakit initially targeted consumers for wedding and portrait photography, but soon shifted towards businesses seeking high volume photography \u2013 real estate, food photography, and head shots. The platform was criticized for requiring photographers to relinquish copyright of their works. After failing to generate enough traction, the Singapore-based subsidiary announced that it would cease operations in January 2020.\nMotion picture and TV production.\nIn addition to the home market-oriented 8mm and Super 8 formats developed by Kodak in the 1950s and 1960s, which are still sold today, Kodak also briefly entered the professional television production video tape market in the mid-1980s under the product portfolio name of Eastman Professional Video Tape Products.\nKodak previously owned the visual effects film post-production facilities Cinesite in Los Angeles and London, and LaserPacific in Los Angeles. In April 2010, Kodak sold LaserPacific and its subsidiaries Laser-Edit, Inc, and Pacific Video, Inc., for an undisclosed sum to TeleCorps Holdings, Inc. In May 2012, Kodak sold Cinesite to Endless LLP, an independent British private equity house. Kodak also sold Pro-Tek Media Preservation Services, a film storage company in Burbank, California, to LAC Group in October 2013.\nOperations.\nSince 2015, Kodak has had five business divisions: Print Systems, Enterprise Inkjet Systems, Micro 3D Printing and Packaging, Software and Solutions, and Consumer and Film.\nKodak's corporate headquarters are located at Kodak Tower in downtown Rochester. Its primary manufacturing facility in the United States is Eastman Business Park, where film production occurs.\nKodak Teenage Film Awards.\nSince 1962,&lt;ref name=\"ufdc.uflib.ufl.edu/UF00028321/03315\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kodak, with University Film and Video Association,&lt;ref name=\"uschefnerarchive/UVFA-finding-aid\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Council on International Nontheatrical Events,&lt;ref name=\"nytimes/1973/camera\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and University Film Foundation, presented the annual Teenage Film Awards\n&lt;ref name=\"jstor/20687148\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"nytimes/his-job-kodak\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\"Entrant must be no older than 19; film may be 8mm, Super 8, or 16mm, on any subject.\"&lt;ref name=\"jstor/814432\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"google/books=fVchX8mdrgAC\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nEric Goldberg's Super-8 film won 1974's Grand Prize.&lt;ref name=\"archive.org/directingforanimation\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; KBYU-TV director of broadcast production, Jay Sumsion, won second place in 1971.&lt;ref name=\"deseret/18904717\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Charles S. Cohen and Carl Weingarten were awarded Honorable Mentions.\nArchive donation.\nIn 2005, Kodak Canada donated its entire historic company archives to Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Ryerson University Library also acquired an extensive collection of materials on the history of photography from the private collection of Nicholas M. and Marilyn A. Graver of Rochester, New York. The Kodak Archives, begun in 1909, contain the company's Camera Collection, historic photos, files, trade circulars, Kodak magazines, price lists, daily record books, equipment, and other ephemera. It includes the contents of the Kodak Heritage Collection Museum, a museum established in 1999 for Kodak Canada's centennial that Kodak closed in 2005 along with the company's entire \"Kodak Heights\" manufacturing campus in Mount Dennis, Toronto.\nControversies and lawsuits.\nEarly legal issues.\nPatent infringement.\nKodak encountered several challenges from rival patents for film and cameras. These began while Eastman was still developing his first camera, when he was forced to pay inventor David Houston for a license to his pre-existing patents. A major lawsuit for patent infringement would come from rival film producer Ansco. Inventor Hannibal Goodwin had filed his own patent for nitrocellulose film in 1887, before the one owned by Kodak, but his was initially denied by the patent office. In 1898, Goodwin succeeded in convincing the patent office to change its decision, and his patent was granted. Ansco purchased the patent in 1900 and sued Kodak for infringement in 1902. The lawsuit spent over a decade in court and was finally settled in 1914 for $5 Million for Kodak.\nAnti-trust lawsuit.\nIn 1911, the federal government began an antitrust investigation into Kodak for exclusive contracts, acquisitions of competitors, and price-fixing. Eastman had cautioned the board of directors against eliminating competition, but believed that many of the company's other monopolistic actions were in the best interest of consumers by allowing the company to produce high-quality products. The investigation resulted in a lawsuit against Kodak in 1913 and a consent decree in 1921, ordering Kodak to stop fixing prices and sell many of its interests. \nFIGHT.\nBefore the civil rights movement, Kodak hired virtually no African-American employees. In the 1950s, Rochester's African-American population grew rapidly, rising from 7,845 in 1950 to around 40,000 in 1964. Many objected to Kodak's discriminatory hiring practices and organized to end the status quo. The civil rights organization F.I.G.H.T. (Freedom, Integration, God, Honor\u2014Today) was formed in 1965 by Saul Alinsky, and led by Minister Franklin Florence. The organization protested Kodak and successfully negotiated an agreement with the company to hire 600 African-American workers through a job training program in 1967.\n\"Polaroid Corporation v. Eastman Kodak Company\".\nKodak and Polaroid were partners from the 1930s until the 1960s, with Polaroid purchasing large quantities of film from Kodak for its cameras and further research and development. Their cooperative partnership came to an end in the late 1960s, when Polaroid pursued independent production of its film and Kodak expressed an interest in developing its own instant camera, bringing them into direct competition. In 1976, Kodak unveiled the EK series of instant cameras. Shortly after the announcement, Polaroid filed a complaint for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court District of Massachusetts, beginning a lawsuit which would last a decade. \"Polaroid Corporation v. Eastman Kodak Company\" was decided in Polaroid's favor in 1985, and after a short period of appeals, Kodak was forced to exit the instant camera market immediately in 1986. On October 12, 1990, Polaroid was awarded $909 million in damages. After appeals, Kodak agreed to pay Polaroid $925 million in 1991, then the largest settlement for patent infringement in US history.\nPollution.\nIn the 1980s, contamination from silver and other chemicals was discovered in the land around Kodak Park and the nearby Genesee River. In 1989, a pipeline at the edge of the park burst, contaminating a nearby school with about 30,000 gallons of methylene chloride. Many families living near the factories chose to relocate as a result. Kodak pledged $100 million to study and clean up pollution. The company received a $2.15 million fine from the state of New York for illegally disposing of silver-contaminated soil and failing to disclose chemical spills in 1990, the largest environmental fine ever issued by the state at the time. Kodak remained a heavy air and water polluter during the 1990s.\nIn the 1990s, an elementary school was built on the site of the former Kodak factory at Vincennes in France. After three cases of pediatric cancer were reported at the school, an INVS investigation was opened into potential carcinogens left behind from the factory. The school was closed in 2001, but no link between the cancers and factory pollutants was established by medical experts. The school reopened in 2004.\nIn a 2014 settlement with the EPA, Kodak provided $49 million to clean up pollution it had caused in the Genesee River and at superfund sites in New York and New Jersey.\nDeparture from Better Business Bureau.\nIn 2006, Kodak notified the BBB of Upstate New York that it would no longer accept or respond to consumer complaints submitted by them. On March 26, 2007, the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) announced that Eastman Kodak was resigning its national membership in the wake of expulsion proceedings initiated by the CBBB board of directors. Kodak said its customer service and customer privacy teams concluded that 99% of all complaints forwarded by the BBB already were handled directly with the customer, and that the BBB had consistently posted inaccurate information about Kodak.\nPharmaceuticals loan.\nOn July 28, 2020, the Trump administration announced that it planned to give Kodak a $765\u00a0million loan for manufacturing ingredients used in pharmaceuticals, to rebuild the national stockpile depleted by the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce dependency on foreign factories. Kodak had not previously manufactured any such products. The funding would come through U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and was arranged by presidential trade advisor Peter Navarro. Within two days, the company's stock price had gained as much as 2,189% from its price at the close of July 27 on the NYSE.\nThe \"New York Times\" reported that one day before the White House announced the loan, Kodak CEO Jim Continenza was given 1.75\u00a0million stock options, some of which he was able to execute immediately. The funding was put on hold as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began probing allegations of insider trading by Kodak executives ahead of the deal's announcement, and the funding agency's inspector general announced scrutiny into the loan terms. In November, CEO Jim Continenza stated that Kodak was still committed to pharmaceutical manufacturing without the loan. The DFC concluded no wrongdoing on its part in December. Continenza and other executives were ordered to testify as part of the SEC investigation in June 2021. A class-action lawsuit from Kodak investors was dismissed in 2022.\nXinjiang social media post.\nIn July 2021, Kodak removed a post about Xinjiang from its Instagram page. The photo was taken by the photographer Patrick Wack, who describes the region as an \"Orwellian dystopia\" in a reference to the persecution of Uyghurs in China. In later statements on Instagram and WeChat, Kodak declared its Instagram page was not a \"platform for political commentary\" and affirmed their \"close cooperation with various [Chinese] government departments\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57628", "revid": "27136118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57628", "title": "Multiple chemical sensitivity", "text": "Controversial medical diagnosis\nMultiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is an unrecognized and controversial diagnosis characterized by chronic symptoms attributed to exposure to low levels of commonly used chemicals. Symptoms are typically vague and non-specific. They may include fatigue, headaches, nausea, and dizziness. \nRecent imaging studies have shown that it is likely a neurological condition.\nMCS is a chronic disease that requires ongoing management. In the long term, about half of people with MCS get better and about half continue to be affected, sometimes severely.\nClassification.\nIn nosological terms, MCS may be more than one disease.\nIt is generally considered a subtype of non-allergic chemical intolerance (also called \"chemical sensitivity\").\nMCS is considered an acquired disorder, meaning that it was not present from birth but instead developed later.\nCompared to other conditions with medically unexplained physical symptoms, such as Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia or Gulf War syndrome, MCS symptoms are only present in response to environmental triggers.\nName.\nThe name \"multiple chemical sensitivity\" has been criticized, partly because MCS is not a sensitivity in the allergic or immunological meaning of that word. Being more sensitive than average to some chemical exposures (e.g., secondhand smoke) is fairly common. MCS is generally used to refer to more significant disability.\nThe name has also been criticized because it suggests that chemical exposure is the actual cause or etiology, which has not been proven. The word \"chemical\" in the name is used loosely and includes natural substances (e.g., the aromas produced by pine trees or other fragrant plants). Other names, such as idiopathic environmental intolerance, have been recommended as more accurate alternatives.\nDefinitions.\nDifferent researchers and proponents use different definitions, which complicates research and can affect diagnosis. For example, the 1987 definition that requires symptoms to begin suddenly after an identifiable, documented exposure to a chemical, but the 1996 definition by the WHO/ICPS says that the cause can be anything, including other medical conditions or psychological factors.\nIn 1996, an expert panel at WHO/ICPS was set up to examine MCS. The panel accepted the existence of \"a disease of unclear pathogenesis\", rejected the claim that MCS was caused by chemical exposure, and proposed these three diagnostic requirements for a group of conditions that includes MCS, which they called \"idiopathic environmental intolerances\" (IEI):\nIn Japan, MCS is called \"chemical hypersensitivity\" or \"chemical intolerance\" (\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8cea\u904e\u654f\u75c7; kagaku bushitsu kabinsho), and the 1999 Japanese definition requires one or more of four major symptoms \u2013 headaches; malaise and fatigue; muscle pain; joint pain \u2013 combined with laboratory findings and/or some minor symptoms, such as mental effects or skin conditions. The defined lab findings are abnormalities in parasympathetic nerves, cerebral cortical dysfunction diagnosed by SPECT testing, visuospatial abnormalities, abnormalities of eye movement, or a positive provocation test.\nAnother definition requires a known precipitating event (e.g., an injury or an illness) followed by the appearance of multi-organ symptoms that predictably wax and wane in response to a variety of exposures that do not bother other people. For example, this could describe someone who always feels sick after using ordinary household cleaning products, when exposed to new car smell, or having a live Christmas tree in the house, and then feels better again when not around these things. Additionally, the symptoms cannot be explainable through other conditions that can be identified with ordinary medical tests, such as an allergic reaction.\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms are typically vague and non-specific, such as fatigue or headaches. These symptoms, although they can be disabling, are called non-specific because they are not associated with any single specific medical condition.\nSymptoms affect a variety of different organ systems. Different people have different symptoms and different affected systems, but cognitive and neurologic symptoms (e.g., headache and brain fog) are common, as are systemic symptoms (e.g., fatigue). Other people have symptoms affecting the eyes, ears, and nose (e.g., stuffy nose), the respiratory system (e.g., shortness of breath), gastrointestinal system (e.g., nausea), musculoskeletal system (e.g., joint pain), or dermatological system (e.g., itching).\nA 2010 review of MCS literature said that the following symptoms, in this order, were the most reported in the condition: headache, fatigue, confusion, depression, shortness of breath, arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, dizziness, memory problems, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms.\nSymptoms mainly arise from the autonomic nervous system (such as nausea or dizziness) or have psychiatric or psychological aspects (such as difficulty concentrating).\nPossible causes.\nVarious different causes for MCS have been hypothesized, including immunological, toxicological, and neurobiological ideas.\nThere is a general agreement among most MCS researchers that the cause is not specifically related to sensitivity to chemicals, but this does not preclude the possibility that symptoms are caused by other known or unknown factors. Various health care professionals and government agencies are working on giving those who report the symptoms proper care while searching for a cause.\nIn 2017, a Canadian government Task Force on Environmental Health said that there had been very little rigorous peer-reviewed research into MCS and almost a complete lack of funding for such research in North America. \"Most recently,\" it said, \"some peer-reviewed clinical research has emerged from centres in Italy, Denmark and Japan suggesting that there are fundamental neurobiologic, metabolic, and genetic susceptibility factors that underlie ES/MCS.\"\nThe US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says that MCS is highly controversial and that there is insufficient scientific evidence to explain the relationship between any of the suggested causes of MCS \u2013 it lists \"allergy, dysfunction of the immune system, neurobiological sensitization, and various psychological theories\" as the suggested causes \u2013 and its symptoms.\nImmunological.\nResearchers have studied immunity biomarkers in people with MCS to determine whether MCS could be an autoimmune disorder or allergic response, but the results have been inconclusive. Some people with MCS appear to have excess production of inflammatory cytokines, but this phenomenon is not specific to MCS and overall there is no evidence that low-level chemical exposure causes an immune response.\nGenetic.\nIt has been hypothesized that there is a heritable genetic trait which pre-disposes people to be hypersensitive to low-level chemical exposure and so develop MCS. To investigate, researchers compared the genetic makeup of people with MCS, to people without. The results were generally inconclusive and contradictory, thus failing to support the hypothesis.\nGa\u00e9tan Carrier and colleagues write that the genetic hypothesis appears implausible when the evidence around it is judged by the Bradford Hill criteria.\nPsychological.\nA 2018 systematic review concluded that the evidence suggests that abnormalities in sensory processing pathways combined with peculiar personality traits best explains this condition.\nDiagnosis.\nIn practice, diagnosis relies entirely upon the self-reported claim that the symptoms are triggered by exposure to various substances. Commonly attributed substances include scented products (e.g. perfumes), pesticides, plastics, synthetic fabrics, smoke, petroleum products, and paint fumes.\nMany other tests have been promoted by various people over the years, including testing of the immune system, porphyrin metabolism, provocation-neutralization testing, autoantibodies, the Epstein\u2013Barr virus, testing for evidence of exposure to pesticides or heavy metals, and challenges involving exposure to chemicals, foods, or inhalants. None of these tests correlate with MCS symptoms, and none are useful for diagnosing MCS.\nThe stress and anxiety experienced by people reporting MCS symptoms are significant. Neuropsychological assessments do not find differences between people reporting MCS symptoms and other people in areas such as verbal learning, memory functioning, or psychomotor performance. Neuropsychological tests are sensitive but not specific, and they identify differences that may be caused by unrelated medical, neurological, or neuropsychological conditions.\nAnother major goal for diagnostic work is to identify and treat any other medical conditions the person may have. People reporting MCS-like symptoms may have other health issues, ranging from common conditions, such as depression or asthma, to less common circumstances, such a documented chemical exposure during a work accident. These other conditions may or may not have any relationship to MCS symptoms, but they should be diagnosed and treated appropriately, whenever the patient history, physical examination, or routine medical tests indicates their presence. The differential diagnosis list includes solvent exposure, occupational asthma, and allergies.\nManagement.\nThere is no single proven treatment for MCS and no scientific consensus on supportive therapies. The literature generally agrees on the need for MCS patients to avoid the specific substances that trigger reactions for them as well as xenobiotics in general, in order to prevent further sensitization. The goal of treatment is to improve quality of life, with fewer distressing symptoms and the ability to maintain employment and social relationships, rather than to produce a permanent cure.\nSome literature recommends a multidisciplinary treatment approach that takes into account the uncommon personality traits often seen in affected individuals and physiological abnormalities in sensory pathways and the limbic system.\nCommon self-care strategies include avoiding exposure to known triggers and emotional self-care. Healthcare providers can provide useful education on the body's natural ability to eliminate and excrete toxins on its own and support positive self-care efforts. Avoiding triggers, such as by removing smelly cleaning products from the home, can reduce symptoms and increase the person's sense of being able to reclaim a reasonably normal life. However, for other people with MCS, their efforts to avoid suspected triggers will backfire, and instead produce harmful emotional side effects that interfere with the overall goal of reducing distress and disability. Treatments that have not been scientifically validated, such as \"elimination or rotary diversified diets\", hormone supplement and chemical detoxification through exercise have been used by people with MCS. \"Controversial treatment methods offer hope of improvement to many individuals with MCS.\" Unproven treatments can be expensive, may cause side effects, and may be counterproductive.\nVarious combinations of different antioxidants together with \"detoxifying\" measures that are not evidence based are recommended by some authors. \"Treatment with a multitude of pills and infusions may lead to \"catastrophizing\", thus making patients perceive their disorder particularly negatively; this phenomenon is known to have a negative impact on the subsequent disease course ... such treatments place a significant financial strain on patients.\"\nEpidemiology.\nPrevalence rates for MCS vary according to the diagnostic criteria used. For example, a 2014 study estimated that 0.9% of Canadian males and 3.3% of Canadian females had a diagnosis of MCS by a health professional. A 2018 study found that 6.5% of Australian adults reported having a medical diagnosis of MCS. In Germany, 9% of adults say they have MCS, and 12% of adults in the US say they have been diagnosed. When self-reports are included, about 20% of Australians and 25% of Americans say that they are more sensitive to chemicals than average. As of 2022[ [update]], the number of people with MCS has either plateaued or is declining.\nThe condition is reported across industrialized countries. It affects significantly more women than men. A typical age of onset is near middle age. People with MCS are more likely to have high socioeconomic status and to be well educated. They are also more likely to have stressful work situations and a history of subjective health complaints.\nFor about half of people with MCS, the symptoms could be considered disabling.\nRelated syndromes.\nSymptoms attributed to Gulf War syndrome are similar to those reported for MCS, including headache, fatigue, muscle stiffness, joint pain, inability to concentrate, sleep problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Gulf War veterans are somewhat more likely to have symptoms consistent with MCS. \nMCS is also similar to sick building syndrome, with both showing non-specific symptoms such as headaches, respiratory irritation and fatigue. There is also some overlap in symptoms between MCS and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), though chemical exposures are not suspected in ME/CFS.\nPrognosis.\nAbout half of those with MCS get better over the course of several years, while about half continue to experience distressing or disabling symptoms.\nHistory.\nMCS was first proposed as a distinct disease by Theron G. Randolph in 1950. In 1965, Randolph founded the Society for Clinical Ecology as an organization to promote his ideas about symptoms reported by his patients. As a consequence of his insistence upon his own, non-standard definition of \"allergy\" and his unusual theories about how the immune system and toxins affect people, the ideas he promoted were widely rejected, and clinical ecology emerged as a non-recognized medical specialty.\nSince the 1950s, many hypotheses have been advanced for the science surrounding multiple chemical sensitivity.\nIn the 1990s, an association was noted with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War syndrome.\nIn 1994, the AMA, American Lung Association, US EPA and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission published a booklet on indoor air pollution that discusses MCS, among other issues. The booklet further states that a pathogenesis of MCS has not been definitively proven, and that symptoms that have been self-diagnosed by a patient as related to MCS could actually be related to allergies or have a psychological basis, and recommends that physicians should counsel patients seeking relief from their symptoms that they may benefit from consultation with specialists in these fields.\nIn 1995, an Interagency Workgroup on Multiple Chemical Sensitivity was formed under the supervision of the Environmental Health Policy Committee within the United States Department of Health and Human Services to examine the body of research that had been conducted on MCS to that date. The work group included representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Environmental Protection Agency, United States Department of Energy, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the National Institutes of Health. The Predecisional Draft document generated by the workgroup in 1998 recommended additional research in the basic epidemiology of MCS, the performance of case-comparison and challenge studies, and the development of a case definition for MCS. However, the workgroup also concluded that it was unlikely that MCS would receive extensive financial resources from federal agencies because of budgetary constraints and the allocation of funds to other, extensively overlapping syndromes with unknown cause, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War syndrome. The Environmental Health Policy Committee is currently inactive, and the workgroup document has not been finalized.\nThe different understandings of MCS over the years have also resulted in different proposals for names. For example, in 1996 the International Programme on Chemical Safety proposed calling it \"idiopathic environmental illness\", because of their belief that chemical exposure may not the sole cause, while another researcher, whose definition includes people with allergies and acute poisoning, calls it \"chemical sensitivity\".\nSociety and culture.\nMemoirs about multiple chemical sensitivity tend to follow a predictable pattern, with a description of various toxins and their effects alongside requests for others to help the writers by changing their behavior (e.g., by not wearing perfume). Frequently the memoirs focus more on things than on people, with interpersonal relationships fading into the background as the writers describe the vigilance they apply to everyday life, such as holding their breath whenever a car drives by, or trying to guess whether nearby people are likely to be smoking or wearing perfumes.\nMultiple chemical sensitivity has been featured in the film \"Safe\", a 1995 fictional psychological horror film.\nInternational Statistical Classification of Diseases.\nThe International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), maintained by the World Health Organization, is a medical coding system used for medical billing and statistical purposes \u2013 not for deciding whether any person is sick, or whether any collection of symptoms constitutes a single disease. However, this does not mean that people with MCS-related symptoms cannot be treated or billed for medical services.MCS was illegally, without a proper proposal, added to USA ICD10 medical diagnostic code system 2011-2016, then, it was removed. https://icd.codes/icd10cm/F459# The public health service in Germany permits healthcare providers to bill for MCS-related medical services under the ICD-10 code T78.4, which is for idiosyncratic reactions, classified under the heading T78, Unerw\u00fcnschte Nebenwirkungen, anderenorts nicht klassifiziert (\"adverse reactions, not otherwise specified\"). Being able to get paid for medical services and collect statistics about unspecified, idiosyncratic reactions does not mean that MCS is recognized as a specific disease or that any particular cause has been defined by the German government. MCS is named in evidence-based (\"S3\") guidelines for the management of patients with nonspecific, functional symptoms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Usually, the term monsoon is used to refer to the rainy phase of a seasonally changing pattern, although technically there is also a dry phase. The term is also sometimes used to describe locally heavy but short-term rains.\nThe major monsoon systems of the world consist of the West African, Asian\u2013Australian, the North American, and South American monsoons.\nThe term was first used in English in British India and neighbouring countries to refer to the big seasonal winds blowing from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area.\nEtymology.\nThe etymology of the word monsoon is not wholly certain. The English \"monsoon\" came from Portuguese ultimately from Arabic (, \"season\"), \"perhaps partly via early modern Dutch \"monson\"\".\nHistory.\nAsian monsoon.\nStrengthening of the Asian monsoon has been linked to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau after the collision of the Indian subcontinent and Asia around 50\u00a0million years ago. Because of studies of records from the Arabian Sea and that of the wind-blown dust in the Loess Plateau of China, many geologists believe the monsoon first became strong around 8\u00a0million years ago. More recently, studies of plant fossils in China and new long-duration sediment records from the South China Sea led to a timing of the monsoon beginning 15\u201320\u00a0million years ago and linked to early Tibetan uplift. Testing of this hypothesis awaits deep ocean sampling by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. The monsoon has varied significantly in strength since this time, largely linked to global climate change, especially the cycle of the Pleistocene ice ages. A study of Asian monsoonal climate cycles from 123,200 to 121,210 years BP, during the Eemian interglacial, suggests that they had an average duration of around 64 years, with the minimum duration being around 50 years and the maximum approximately 80 years, similar to today.\nA study of marine plankton suggested that the South Asian Monsoon (SAM) strengthened around 5\u00a0million years ago. Then, during ice periods, the sea level fell and the Indonesian Seaway closed. When this happened, cold waters in the Pacific were impeded from flowing into the Indian Ocean. It is believed that the resulting increase in sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean increased the intensity of monsoons. In 2018, a study of the SAM's variability over the past million years found that precipitation resulting from the monsoon was significantly reduced during glacial periods compared to interglacial periods like the present day. The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) underwent several intensifications during the warming following the Last Glacial Maximum, specifically during the time intervals corresponding to 16,100\u201314,600 BP, 13,600\u201313,000 BP, and 12,400\u201310,400 BP as indicated by vegetation changes in the Tibetan Plateau displaying increases in humidity brought by an intensifying ISM. Though the ISM was relatively weak for much of the Late Holocene, significant glacial accumulation in the Himalayas still occurred due to cold temperatures brought by westerlies from the west.\nDuring the Middle Miocene, the July ITCZ, the zone of rainfall maximum, migrated northwards, increasing precipitation over southern China during the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) while making Indochina drier. During the Late Miocene Global Cooling (LMCG), from 7.9 to 5.8 million years ago, the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) became stronger as the subarctic front shifted southwards. An abrupt intensification of the EAWM occurred 5.5 million years ago. The EAWM was still significantly weaker relative to today between 4.3 and 3.8 million years ago but abruptly became more intense around 3.8 million years ago as crustal stretching widened the Tsushima Strait and enabled greater inflow of the warm Tsushima Current into the Sea of Japan. Circa 3.0 million years ago, the EAWM became more stable, having previously been more variable and inconsistent, in addition to being enhanced further amidst a period of global cooling and sea level fall. The EASM was weaker during cold intervals of glacial periods such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and stronger during interglacials and warm intervals of glacial periods. Another EAWM intensification event occurred 2.6 million years ago, followed by yet another one around 1.0 million years ago. During Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events, the EASM grew in strength, but it has been suggested to have decreased in strength during Heinrich events. The EASM expanded its influence deeper into the interior of Asia as sea levels rose following the LGM; it also underwent a period of intensification during the Middle Holocene, around 6,000 years ago, due to orbital forcing made more intense by the fact that the Sahara at the time was much more vegetated and emitted less dust. This Middle Holocene interval of maximum EASM was associated with an expansion of temperate deciduous forest steppe and temperate mixed forest steppe in northern China. By around 5,000 to 4,500 BP, the East Asian monsoon's strength began to wane, weakening from that point until the present day. A particularly notable weakening took place ~3,000 BP. The location of the EASM shifted multiple times over the course of the Holocene: first, it moved southward between 12,000 and 8,000 BP, followed by an expansion to the north between approximately 8,000 and 4,000 BP, and most recently retreated southward once more between 4,000 and 0 BP.\nAustralian monsoon.\nThe January ITCZ migrated further south to its present location during the Middle Miocene, strengthening the summer monsoon of Australia that had previously been weaker.\nFive episodes during the Quaternary at 2.22 Ma (PL-1), 1.83 Ma (PL-2), 0.68 Ma (PL-3), 0.45 Ma (PL-4) and 0.04 Ma (PL-5) were identified which showed a weakening of the Leeuwin Current (LC). The weakening of the LC would have an effect on the sea surface temperature (SST) field in the Indian Ocean, as the Indonesian Throughflow generally warms the Indian Ocean. Thus these five intervals could probably be those of considerable lowering of SST in the Indian Ocean and would have influenced Indian monsoon intensity. During the weak LC, there is the possibility of reduced intensity of the Indian winter monsoon and strong summer monsoon, because of change in the Indian Ocean dipole due to reduction in net heat input to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Throughflow. Thus a better understanding of the possible links between El Ni\u00f1o, Western Pacific Warm Pool, Indonesian Throughflow, wind pattern off western Australia, and ice volume expansion and contraction can be obtained by studying the behaviour of the LC during Quaternary at close stratigraphic intervals.\nSouth American monsoon.\nThe South American summer monsoon (SASM) is known to have become weakened during Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events. The SASM has been suggested to have been enhanced during Heinrich events.\nProcess.\nMonsoons were once considered as a large-scale sea breeze caused by higher temperature over land than in the ocean. This is no longer considered as the cause and the monsoon is now considered a planetary-scale phenomenon involving the annual migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone between its northern and southern limits. The limits of the ITCZ vary according to the land\u2013sea heating contrast and it is thought that the northern extent of the monsoon in South Asia is influenced by the high Tibetan Plateau. These temperature imbalances happen because oceans and land absorb heat in different ways. Over oceans, the air temperature remains relatively stable for two reasons: water has a relatively high heat capacity (3.9 to 4.2 J g\u22121 K\u22121), and because both conduction and convection will equilibrate a hot or cold surface with deeper water (up to 50 metres). In contrast, dirt, sand, and rocks have lower heat capacities (0.19 to 0.35 J g\u22121 K\u22121), and they can only transmit heat into the earth by conduction and not by convection. Therefore, bodies of water stay at a more even temperature, while land temperatures are more variable.\nDuring warmer months sunlight heats the surfaces of both land and oceans, but land temperatures rise more quickly. As the land's surface becomes warmer, the air above it expands and an area of low pressure develops. Meanwhile, the ocean remains at a lower temperature than the land, and the air above it retains a higher pressure. This difference in pressure causes sea breezes to blow from the ocean to the land, bringing moist air inland. This moist air rises to a higher altitude over land and then it flows back toward the ocean (thus completing the cycle). However, when the air rises, and while it is still over the land, the air cools. This decreases the air's ability to hold water, and this causes precipitation over the land. This is why summer monsoons cause so much rain over land.\nIn the colder months, the cycle is reversed. Then the land cools faster than the oceans and the air over the land has higher pressure than air over the ocean. This causes the air over the land to flow to the ocean. When humid air rises over the ocean, it cools, and this causes precipitation over the oceans. (The cool air then flows towards the land to complete the cycle.)\nMost summer monsoons have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain (because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air). The intensity and duration, however, are not uniform from year to year. Winter monsoons, by contrast, have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge, subside and cause drought.\nSimilar rainfall is caused when moist ocean air is lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface. However the lifting occurs, the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure, and this produces condensation.\nGlobal monsoon.\nAfrica (West African and Southeast African).\nThe monsoon of western Sub-Saharan Africa is the result of the seasonal shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the great seasonal temperature and humidity differences between the Sahara and the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. The ITCZ migrates northward from the equatorial Atlantic in February, reaches western Africa on or near June 22, then moves back to the south by October. The dry, northeasterly trade winds, and their more extreme form, the harmattan, are interrupted by the northern shift in the ITCZ and resultant southerly, rain-bearing winds during the summer. The semiarid Sahel and Sudan depend upon this pattern for most of their precipitation.\nNorth America.\nThe North American monsoon (NAM) occurs from late June or early July into September, originating over Mexico and spreading into the southwest United States by mid-July. It affects Mexico along the Sierra Madre Occidental as well as Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, West Texas and California. It pushes as far west as the Peninsular Ranges and Transverse Ranges of Southern California, but rarely reaches the coastal strip (a wall of desert thunderstorms only a half-hour's drive away is a common summer sight from the sunny skies along the coast during the monsoon). The North American monsoon is known to many as the \"Summer\", \"Southwest\", \"Mexican\" or \"Arizona\" monsoon. It is also sometimes called the \"Desert monsoon\" as a large part of the affected area are the Mojave and Sonoran deserts. However, it is controversial whether the North and South American weather patterns with incomplete wind reversal should be counted as true monsoons.\nAsia.\nThe Asian monsoons may be classified into a few sub-systems, such as the Indian Subcontinental Monsoon which affects the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions including Nepal, and the East Asian Monsoon which affects southern China, Taiwan, Korea and parts of Japan.\nSouth Asian monsoon.\nSouthwest monsoon.\nThe southwestern summer monsoons occur from June to September. The Thar Desert and adjoining areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent heat up considerably during the hot summers. This causes a low pressure area over the northern and central Indian subcontinent. To fill this void, the moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean rush into the subcontinent. These winds, rich in moisture, are drawn towards the Himalayas. The Himalayas act like a high wall, blocking the winds from passing into Central Asia, and forcing them to rise. As the clouds rise, their temperature drops, and precipitation occurs. Some areas of the subcontinent receive up to of rain annually.\nThe southwest monsoon is generally expected to begin between the end of May and beginning of June and fade away between the end of September and start of October. The moisture-laden winds on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula, due to its topography, become divided into two parts: the \"Arabian Sea Branch\" and the \"Bay of Bengal Branch\".\nThe \"Arabian Sea Branch\" of the Southwest Monsoon first hits the Western Ghats of the coastal state of Kerala, India, thus making this area the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest Monsoon. This branch of the monsoon moves northwards along the Western Ghats (Konkan and Goa) with precipitation on coastal areas, west of the Western Ghats. The eastern areas of the Western Ghats do not receive much rain from this monsoon as the wind does not cross the Western Ghats.\nThe \"Bay of Bengal Branch\" of Southwest Monsoon flows over the Bay of Bengal heading towards north-east India and Bengal, picking up more moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The winds arrive at the Eastern Himalayas with large amounts of rain. Mawsynram, situated on the southern slopes of the Khasi Hills in Meghalaya, India, is one of the wettest places on Earth. After the arrival at the Eastern Himalayas, the winds turns towards the west, travelling over the Indo-Gangetic Plain at a rate of roughly 1\u20132 weeks per state, pouring rain all along its way. June 1 is regarded as the date of onset of the monsoon in India, as indicated by the arrival of the monsoon in the southernmost state of Kerala.\nThe monsoon accounts for nearly 80% of the rainfall in India. Indian agriculture (which accounts for 25% of the GDP and employs 70% of the population) is heavily dependent on the rains, for growing crops especially like cotton, rice, oilseeds and coarse grains. A delay of a few days in the arrival of the monsoon can badly affect the economy, as evidenced in the numerous droughts in India in the 1990s.\nThe monsoon is widely welcomed and appreciated by city-dwellers as well, for it provides relief from the climax of summer heat in June. However, the roads take a battering every year. Often houses and streets are waterlogged and slums are flooded despite drainage systems. A lack of city infrastructure coupled with changing climate patterns causes severe economic loss including damage to property and loss of lives, as evidenced in the 2005 flooding in Mumbai that brought the city to a standstill. Bangladesh and certain regions of India like Assam and West Bengal, also frequently experience heavy floods during this season. Recently, areas in India that used to receive scanty rainfall throughout the year, like the Thar Desert, have surprisingly ended up receiving floods due to the prolonged monsoon season.\nThe influence of the Southwest Monsoon is felt as far north as in China's Xinjiang. It is estimated that about 70% of all precipitation in the central part of the Tian Shan Mountains falls during the three summer months, when the region is under the monsoon influence; about 70% of that is directly of \"cyclonic\" (i.e., monsoon-driven) origin (as opposed to \"local convection\"). The effects also extend westwards to the Mediterranean, where however the impact of the monsoon is to induce drought via the Rodwell-Hoskins mechanism.\nNortheast monsoon.\nAround September, with the sun retreating south, the northern landmass of the Indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly, and air pressure begins to build over northern India. The Indian Ocean and its surrounding atmosphere still hold their heat, causing cold wind to sweep down from the Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plain towards the vast spans of the Indian Ocean south of the Deccan peninsula. This is known as the Northeast Monsoon or Retreating Monsoon.\nWhile travelling towards the Indian Ocean, the cold dry wind picks up some moisture from the Bay of Bengal and pours it over peninsular India and parts of Sri Lanka. Cities like Chennai, which get less rain from the Southwest Monsoon, receive rain from this Monsoon. About 50% to 60% of the rain received by the state of Tamil Nadu is from the Northeast Monsoon. In Southern Asia, the northeastern monsoons take place from October to December when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. The jet stream in this region splits into the southern subtropical jet and the polar jet. The subtropical flow directs northeasterly winds to blow across southern Asia, creating dry air streams which produce clear skies over India. Meanwhile, a low pressure system known as a monsoon trough develops over South-East Asia and Australasia and winds are directed toward Australia. In the Philippines, northeast monsoon is called Amihan.\nEast Asian monsoon.\nThe East Asian monsoon affects large parts of Indochina, the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Siberia. It is characterised by a warm, rainy summer monsoon and a cold, dry winter monsoon. The rain occurs in a concentrated belt that stretches east\u2013west except in East China where it is tilted east-northeast over Korea and Japan. The seasonal rain is known as \"Meiyu\" in China, \"Jangma\" in Korea, and \"Bai-u\" in Japan, with the latter two resembling frontal rain.\nThe onset of the summer monsoon is marked by a period of premonsoonal rain over South China and Taiwan in early May. From May through August, the summer monsoon shifts through a series of dry and rainy phases as the rain belt moves northward, beginning over Indochina and the South China Sea (May), to the Yangtze River Basin and Japan (June) and finally to northern China and Korea (July). When the monsoon ends in August, the rain belt moves back to southern China.\nAustralia.\nThe rainy season occurs from September to February and it is a major source of energy for the Hadley circulation during boreal winter. It is associated with the development of the Siberian High and the movement of the heating maxima from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere. North-easterly winds flow down Southeast Asia, are turned north-westerly/westerly by Borneo topography towards Australia. This forms a cyclonic circulation vortex over Borneo, which together with descending cold surges of winter air from higher latitudes, cause significant weather phenomena in the region. Examples are the formation of a rare low-latitude tropical storm in 2001, Tropical Storm Vamei, and the devastating flood of Jakarta in 2007.\nThe onset of the monsoon over Australia tends to follow the heating maxima down Vietnam and the Malay Peninsula (September), to Sumatra, Borneo and the Philippines (October), to Java, Sulawesi (November), Irian Jaya and northern Australia (December, January). However, the monsoon is not a simple response to heating but a more complex interaction of topography, wind and sea, as demonstrated by its abrupt rather than gradual withdrawal from the region. The Australian monsoon (the \"Wet\") occurs in the southern summer when the monsoon trough develops over Northern Australia. Over three-quarters of annual rainfall in Northern Australia falls during this time.\nEurope.\nThe European Monsoon (more commonly known as the return of the westerlies) is the result of a resurgence of westerly winds from the Atlantic, where they become loaded with wind and rain. These westerly winds are a common phenomenon during the European winter, but they ease as spring approaches in late March and through April and May. The winds pick up again in June, which is why this phenomenon is also referred to as \"the return of the westerlies\".\nThe rain usually arrives in two waves, at the beginning of June, and again in mid- to late June. The European monsoon is not a monsoon in the traditional sense in that it doesn't meet all the requirements to be classified as such. Instead, the return of the westerlies is more regarded as a conveyor belt that delivers a series of low-pressure centres to Western Europe where they create unsettled weather. These storms generally feature significantly lower-than-average temperatures, fierce rain or hail, thunder, and strong winds.\nThe return of the westerlies affects Europe's Northern Atlantic coastline, more precisely Ireland, Great Britain, the Benelux countries, western Germany, northern France and parts of Scandinavia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

San Salvador was also the host city of the 18th Ibero-American Summit in 2008, the most important sociopolitical event in the Spanish and Portuguese sphere. The Central American Integration System has its headquarters in San Salvador.\nEtymology.\nThe conquistador Gonzalo de Alvarado founded a mission he named \"San Salvador\" in 1525. The name likely referenced the feast of the Transfiguration of Jesus (also called \"Divino Salvador\" in Spanish), celebrated on the 6th of August in the Western Church. On that day in 1456 Pope Callixtus III commemorated the Hungarian victory at the Siege of Belgrade against the Ottomans, specifically referencing the perceived divine intervention that led to the Christian victory. As a result, variations of the name 'holy' or 'divine' savior (\"san\" or \"divino salvador\") became a popular inspiration for the names of churches and places, such as when Christopher Columbus named the island of Guanahani, Bahamas \"San Salvador\" in 1492. In the same vein, Pedro de Alvarado, when organizing his second expedition into the territory of Cuzcatlan, ordered his brother Gonzalo to name the town he founded San Salvador.\nThe name \"San Salvador\" would inspire the name for the country \"El Salvador\" which was a part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala as a province, and later an Intendancy in 1785. After the 19th Century first Independent movement, the Central American Independence Act, and the insurgency against Mexican rule, El Salvador became an independent state in 1824. The new government retained the name \"San Salvador\" for the capital city and the Salvadoran department.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical affiliations\n Kingdom of Spain 1525\u20131821 Mexican Empire 1822\u20131823 Central America 1823\u20131841 El Salvador 1841\u20131896 Central America 1896\u20131898 El Salvador 1898\u2013present\nBefore the Spanish conquest, the Pipil people established their capital, Cuzcatlan, near the current location of San Salvador. Not much is known about Cuzcatlan, as it was abandoned by its inhabitants in an effort to avoid Spanish rule. Under the orders of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, his associates Gonzalo de Alvarado and Diego de Holgu\u00edn occupied the empty settlement and began to develop it. Diego de Holgu\u00edn became the first mayor of San Salvador after the town was founded on 1 April 1525. The town changed location twice, in 1528 and 1545. Originally established in what is now the archeological site of Ciudad Vieja, north of the present-day city, it was moved to the \"Valle de Las Hamacas\", so named for the intense seismic activity that characterizes it. The new site was chosen because it had more space and more fertile land, thanks to the Acelhuate River.\nThe city became the seat of the Intendancy of San Salvador in 1785, however the population remained relatively small until the early 20th century. The War of the Salvadoran Revolution led by Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado, Manuel Jos\u00e9 Arce, and Juan Manuel Rodr\u00edguez took place in San Salvador, and in fact started at the Our Lady of Mercy parish church. During the Independence struggle, the city was the political and administrative epicenter of the newly formed, independent Salvadorean state.\nIn January 1885, during the presidency of Rafael Zald\u00edvar, a group of businessmen and the president's family contributed funds for building the Sara Zaldivar Asylum for Indigents and the Elderly. In 1902, Hospital Rosales was built, named after its benefactor, Jos\u00e9 Rosales Herrador, a former Salvadoran president who gave his fortune to the hospital and to the orphanage. The hospital's construction was begun by president Carlos Ezeta and finished during the presidency of Tom\u00e1s Regalado. In 1905, president Pedro Jos\u00e9 Escal\u00f3n initiated construction of the National Palace funded by coffee exportation taxes. The \"Monumento a los Pr\u00f3ceres de 1811\" (Monument to the Heroes of 1811), located in the Plaza Libertad, and the Teatro Nacional de El Salvador were built in 1911 during Manuel Enrique Araujo's presidency.\nIn 1917, an earthquake during an eruption of the nearby San Salvador volcano damaged the city, but it escaped additional damage because the lava flowed down the back side of the volcano. On 2 December 1931, president Arturo Araujo was ousted by a military coup d'\u00e9tat and replaced by the military Civic Directory. The directory named vice-president Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez as president and Araujo went into exile. The Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez regime lasted from 4 December 1931 to 6 May 1944.\nIn 1964, the Christian Democratic Party candidate, Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte, an engineer, was elected mayor; he served from 1964 to 1970. During his term he ordered construction of the Pancho Lara park in the Vista Hermosa neighborhood, renewed the electrical grid, and set up a system of schools for adult education. The 1960s to the 1980s were the golden age of San Salvador in all aspects of security, quality of life, and modernization.\nToday the tallest building in the country has 28 floors and is 110 meters high. With the commencement of the Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s, many modernization projects were halted. Examples of suspended projects include a 40-story government building approximately 160 meters in height, and the Sheraton Hotel Tower, a 26-story building with a rotating restaurant on top.\nIn 1969, celebrations in the Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n were held in honor of the returning troops from the Football War with Honduras. The \"Boulevard de los H\u00e9roes\" (Boulevard of the Heroes) was named after the Salvadoran soldiers who fought there. The 1986 San Salvador earthquake destroyed many government buildings and other important structures, injuring and killing hundreds. Thousands of people were displaced by the disaster and many struggled to find shelter in the ruins.\nIn 1986, Mayor Morales Ehrlich closed streets in the downtown of the city to create a large pedestrian mall, which has resulted in chronic traffic congestion.\nThe Chapultepec Peace Accords were signed on 16 January 1992, ending 12 years of civil war. The signing is celebrated as a national holiday with people flooding downtown San Salvador in the Plaza Gerardo Barrios and in La Libertad Park.\nSince 2009, Mayor Norman Quijano has worked for the redevelopment of parks and historic buildings in the \"Rescate del Centro Hist\u00f3rico\", which involves the removal of street vendors. This has led to several riots in the area, but he has managed to place the vendors in new markets where they can operate their own stalls.\nMunicipal government.\nThe cities in El Salvador, by constitutional provision (Article 203), are economically and administratively autonomous. San Salvador is governed by a council consisting of a mayor (elected by direct vote every three years, with an option to be re-elected), a trustee and two or more aldermen whose number varies in proportion to the population of the municipality. The functions and powers of this government are framed within the rules of the Municipal Code.\nSan Salvador's government is composed of departments, including the departments of festivals, parks, cemeteries, and finance. To safeguard the interests of the municipality, there is a board of metropolitan agents. Each of the six city districts also has a government department. The mayor is a member of the Council of Mayors of the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador (COAMSS), composed of fourteen local councils that make up the area known as Greater San Salvador.\nMunicipal districts.\nThe municipality is further subdivided into districts governed by the municipal mayor and by a District board. There are seven districts in San Salvador, Districts 1\u20136 and the Historic Downtown.\nThe six districts:\nTotal population in all six districts: 567,788\nGeography.\nThe city is located in the Boquer\u00f3n Volcano Valley, a region of high seismic activity. The city's average elevation is above sea level, but ranges from a highest point of above sea level to a lowest point of above sea level.\nThe municipality is surrounded by these natural features of the landscape: the Acelhuate River on the east, the San Jacinto Hill on the south east, El Picacho Mountain and the Bicentennial Park on the West, North by the San Antonio River, southward by the \"Cordillera del Balsamo\" (Balsam Mountain Range); westward by the Boquer\u00f3n Volcano and \"Cerro El Picacho\", the highest point in the municipality at .\nEl Boquer\u00f3n Volcano was dormant since its last eruption in 1917, but has been active recently. East of the municipality lies the San Jacinto Hill and the caldera of Lake Ilopango, the largest natural body of water in the country with an area of . The caldera is seismically active, but has not erupted since 1880.\nClimate.\nSan Salvador has a tropical wet and dry climate under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, and enjoys very warm to hot weather all year round, with daily mean temperatures of . Its average elevation of causes the city to experience slightly cooler temperatures in the mornings, higher solar radiation, and greater diurnal air temperature variation (particularly during the dry season) than nearby cities at sea level such as Acajutla. Its weather cools from the months of November through February due to seasonal winds of the dry season. During these months one can expect a daily mean of . The hottest months of the year are April and May, during the transition from the dry season (November to April), to the rainy season (May to October). In April and May average maximum temperatures reach . The highest reading ever recorded was , the lowest was . The highest dew point was and the lowest . Thunderstorms occur almost daily during the rainy season, mostly in the afternoon and through the night\u2014by morning the sky clears and the days are usually sunny until the afternoon storms.\nTopography.\nSan Salvador has a very hilly terrain; there are few parts of the municipality where the elevation is consistent. The city shares many topographic features with neighboring municipalities in the San Salvador and the La Libertad departments.\nThe most notable topographical feature visible in San Salvador and its metropolitan area is the \"Boquer\u00f3n Volcano\", which looms over this region in its foothills at a height of above sea level.\nSan Salvador shares \"Cerro El Picacho\", above sea level, with the neighboring municipality of Mejicanos.\nThe portion of the \"Cordillera del B\u00e1lsamo\" \"(Balsam Mountain Range)\" that sits in the Municipality has an average elevation of above sea level. The \"Cordillera del B\u00e1lsamo\" is named after the Myroxylon balsamum tree, one of two species of Central American and South American trees in the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae). The tree, often called \"Quina\" or \"B\u00e1lsamo\", is well known in the western world as the source of Balsam of Peru and Tolu balsam. El Salvador is the main exporter of these resins, which are still extracted manually.\n\"El Cerro de San Jacinto\" \"(San Jacinto Hill)\", is located on the eastern border of the municipality and is shared with Soyapango, Santo Tom\u00e1s and San Marcos. The summit is located at above sea level. The hill was once famous for the San Jacinto Cable Car and Park located at its summit, but the facilities were eventually abandoned. Soil types include regosol, latosol, and andosol, as well as soils derived from andesitic and basaltic rocks.\nBodies of water.\nThe river nearest San Salvador is the \"Acelhuate\", which is long. Although not within the municipality, it forms a natural boundary between San Salvador and Soyapango. The \"Acelhuate\" served as a water source for San Salvador during the late 1800s and early 1900s, but due to urbanization is now polluted. There are small streams running down from Lake Ilopango, and a few old aqueduct systems, but the municipality itself has no major bodies of water.\nLake Ilopango, although not located in the municipality, is the closest large body of water, being only minutes away from the San Salvador historic center. The lake is also the largest natural body of water in the country, with an area of . The Cerr\u00f3n Grande Reservoir, north of San Salvador, was formed by damming the Lempa River in the municipalities of Potonico, (Chalatenango) and Jutiapa (Caba\u00f1as). The Cerr\u00f3n Grande Dam provides a substantial portion of the region's electricity.\nDemographics.\nSpanish is the language spoken by virtually all inhabitants. English is spoken more widely than in the past, due mainly to cultural influences from the United States, especially in entertainment, and the large number of Salvadoran emigrants returned from the United States. According to the 2007 Census, 72.3% of the population of San Salvador is mestizo, 25.8% is white, having mostly Spanish ancestry, and a few of French or German descent.\nIn 2015, San Salvador was projected to have a population of 257,754 inhabitants, accounting for about 3.99% of the country's population, while the metropolitan area had 1,767,102 inhabitants, comprising 27.4% of the country's total population.\nReligion.\nThe population of San Salvador is predominantly Roman Catholic, with a significant minority of Protestants. There is more diversity of religion than in most Latin American countries. The Protestant population is mostly Evangelical. One of the largest Protestant churches in the city is the \"Iglesia Cristiana Josue\" (from the Assemblies of God), another is the \"Tabernaculo Biblico Bautista, Amigos de Israel\" (Bible Baptist Tabernacle, Friends of Israel). There are also members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which opened the San Salvador El Salvador Temple in 2011. There are also smaller Latter-day Saints chapels in Districts 1 and 3.\nAs in most of the country, Roman Catholicism plays a prominent role in the celebration of holidays, including \"Las Fiestas Agostinas\" (The August Festivals) in honor of Jesus Christ, the Patron saint of El Salvador, referred to as \"El Salvador del Mundo\" (The Savior of the World). These events are becoming less prominent with a sharp decline in the Roman Catholic population during the past decade. San Salvador is also home to about 3,500 Jews; the Jewish community is still robust, but less so since the 1980s, as a large number of them left with the start of the Salvadoran Civil War. Many Jews had migrated to El Salvador during World War II due to the work of Jos\u00e9 Castellanos Contreras, the Salvadoran diplomatic Consul General in Geneva, Switzerland, who helped a Jewish-Hungarian businessman named Gyorgy Mandl save up to 40,000 Jews in Central Europe from the Nazi persecution by giving them Salvadoran nationality papers. The city has a small community of Palestinians, mostly descendants of Palestinian Christian families who immigrated from Palestine in the late 19th and early 20th century, with the highest rate of immigration between 1910 and 1925.\nCulture.\nSan Salvador is rich in Spanish heritage, and its historical center contains architecture of a kind not found elsewhere in Latin America. The Metropolitan Cathedral was built in the 1950s combining Baroque and eclectic styles of architecture. The National palace, built in 1905, is a mix of Gothic, Neoclassical, and Renaissance Revival architecture. The National Theater is the oldest theater in Central America, being built in 1917 in the French Renaissance Revival style with details in the Rococo, Romantic and Art Nouveau architectural styles. The building contains three levels of seats, including a Presidential box at the center of the second level, and has seating for 650 people. The structure is surmounted by an ellipsoidal dome, the interior of which is adorned with a mural painted by Carlos Ca\u00f1as and a crystal chandelier.\nSan Salvador is also home to the museum Museo de Arte de El Salvador (MARTE), whose collection includes artworks dating from the mid-19th century to the contemporary era. The museum has held temporary exhibitions of works by internationally renowned artists like Picasso, Rembrandt, Salvador Dal\u00ed and Joan Mir\u00f3. The \"Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda\" (MUNA) or National Museum of Anthropology, founded in 1883 by David Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, has exhibits on human settlements, agriculture, artisans, commerce and trade, religion, arts and communication. The museum aims to foster cultural awareness for Salvadorans through exhibitions, research, publications and educational programs.\nIn 2011, the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities selected San Salvador as a \"Latin American capital of culture\", recognizing San Salvador's cultural diversity.\nThe city government is restoring the downtown area, with the goal of celebrating the city's past and promoting cultural diversity.\nCity symbols.\nThe symbols of the city are the Monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo, shield, flag, anthem, and staff of office. The first three were created as a result of a contest launched in 1943. The shield (designed by the painter Jos\u00e9 Mej\u00eda Vides) is divided into four quadrants: the two quadrants at the top right and bottom left have blue and white fields symbolizing the national flag; the top left quadrant displays a symbolic emerald necklace; and the lower right contains the bell of the Church of La Merced, representing the 1811 Independence Movement, when Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado rang the bells.\nThe flag was designed at the request of the city government. The anthem was written by Carlos Bustamante (lyrics) and Ciriaco de Jes\u00fas Alas (music).\nThe municipal staff shows a series of figures and symbols relating to local history. From top to bottom these images are: a native Amerindian, first mayor Diego de Olgu\u00edn, Carlos V of Spain, the Royal Decree which gave San Salvador its name, Mayor Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez, the priest Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado, the seal of liberation of 1811, the 1821 independence seal, the shield of the Municipal Freedom Union, the national emblem, and God.\nOn 5 May 2015, Mayor Nayib Bukele presented the redesigned city shield and flag. The new city coat of arms is silver as a symbol of purity; it has the flag of El Salvador in the center, and a ribbon on the bottom with the date 1834, the year San Salvador was declared capital of Central America. On the sides it has two swords: to the left the sword of Francisco Moraz\u00e1n, and to the right, the sword of Gerardo Barrios, representing his past victories. A crown of laurels encircles the coat of arms, which is also surrounded by 6 stars, representing the 6 districts that form the city.\nEconomy.\nSan Salvador disproportionately concentrates economic activity in the country. The metropolitan area accounts for 3% of the national territory but 70% of public and private investment is made there. The economy of San Salvador, Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n, and Santa Tecla is a mixed one composed mainly of services, private education, banking, business headquartering, and industrial manufacturing. Other municipalities in the metropolitan area depend either on industry, like Soyapango and Ilopango, on public services, like Mejicanos, or on power generation, as in Nejapa and Apopa. The other municipalities have not developed their own economies, however, they have provided the workforce required for industry in neighboring municipalities.\nSan Salvador, as well as the rest of the country, has used the U.S. dollar as its currency of exchange since 2001. Under the Monetary Integration Law, El Salvador adopted the U.S. dollar as a legal tender alongside the col\u00f3n. This decision came about as an attempt to encourage foreign investors to launch new companies in El Salvador, saving them the inconvenience of conversion to other currencies. San Salvador's economy is mostly based on remittances, followed by service and retail sector, rather by industry or manufacturing.\nFinancial sector.\nSan Salvador is home to the great majority of corporations in the country, and supports many commercial activities, including food and beverage production; the pharmaceutical and chemical industries; the sale of automobiles, handicrafts, and construction materials; as well as appliance repair. Most national companies have their headquarters in San Salvador, which is also home to regional offices for transnational entities. Unicomer Group, Almacenes Sim\u00e1n, Grupo Roble, Grupo Real, Excel Automotr\u00edz, and Grupo Q all have their central offices in San Salvador. Since the early 2010s there has been a boom in the construction of call centers providing services to national and international companies alike.\nSan Salvador lacks a consolidated financial district; this is mainly due to the lack of urban planning that has plagued the city since the aftermath of the Salvadoran Civil War in 1992. Some clusters have formed, however, in an organic manner; today most of the banking and telecommunications are concentrated along the \"Alameda Manuel Enrique Araujo\" in District Two. Business complexes and towers have sprouted in the commercial districts of \"Colonia Escal\u00f3n\" and \"Colonia San Benito\", both in District Three of the Salvadoran capital.\nWorld Trade Center San Salvador.\nThe World Trade Center San Salvador is located in District 3 \"(Colonia Escal\u00f3n)\" at Avenida Norte and Calle del Mirador. The World Trade Center is interconnected to two hotels (one of which is the Crowne Plaza Hotel), a convention center and a commercial center containing retail shops and restaurants. As of October 2012, the center consists of two towers of 8 levels each, with a total of of office space. Since their completion, the first two towers have maintained a 100% occupancy rate with multinational companies, embassies, and firms such as Banco Multisectorial de Inversiones (BMI), Ericsson, Continental Airlines, Microsoft, Inter-American Development Bank, and Banco Prom\u00e9rica maintaining offices there.\nCentro Financiero Gigante.\nCentro Financiero Gigante is a complex of office buildings consisting of five towers, the highest of which is tall and has 19 floors. It is a phased project which began with the construction of the two towers. After several years the number of buildings has increased, and it has become one of the most significant business complexes in San Salvador. The tallest tower is occupied by the Telef\u00f3nica phone company, the next tallest tower is used by RED Business Communication Systems. The complex also includes the Banco Azteca center, Stream Global Services representing Dell in Central America, The Israeli Embassy of San Salvador, Tigo, call centers, and other small offices and banks. The project started in 1997 with Phase I, the construction of the two tallest towers. In Phase II a seven-story-high tower for the old Dell company in Central America was built, and in Phase III a 12-story-high tower for Tigo and a 10-story-high tower for Telemovil. The final phase was remodeling of the Telemovil building to convert it into the Banco Azteca Center.\nAlameda Manuel Enrique Araujo and Zona Rosa.\nAlong \"Alameda Manuel Enrique Araujo\" and Zona Rosa there are many businesses, banks, and financial centers, government institutions and museums. These include AFP Confia, the Superior Council of Public Health, the HSBC Central Office, AFP Crecer, the Ministry of Public Works, the \"Centro Internacional de Feria y Convenciones\" (International Center of Fairs and Conventions), the Presidential Palace, the \"Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda David J. Guzman\" (National Museum of Anthropology), the Banco Promerica Financial Center, the Ministry of Tourism, the Channel 2 &amp; 4 Studio Center, the Channel 6 Studio Center, and the \" Centro de Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Alumbrado El\u00e9ctrico de San Salvador\" (CAESS-Centro) or Central Electric Lighting Company of San Salvador.\nCommunications.\nA relatively large proportion of residents have telephones, televisions, and access to the internet, and several communications companies have their headquarters in San Salvador. The largest are Tigo, Claro-Telecom, Movistar-Telef\u00f3nica, and Digicel.\nServices and retail shopping.\nSan Salvador's economy is based mostly on the service sector. The city has many restaurants and shopping malls, including Metrocentro, the largest shopping mall in Central America, as well as retail stores such as Wal-Mart, Office Max, and a Pricesmart warehouse club. The tallest shopping mall in the region, Centro Comercial Galerias, was built around and over an old mansion, \"La Casona\", dating from the late 1950s, which was home to a family of Spanish origin, the Guirolas.\nIndustry.\nSan Salvador has small industrial zones scattered throughout the municipality, although most of them are concentrated in the eastern section near the border with Soyapango. Much of the industry is related to food processing, beverage manufacturing, and sugar refining. Construction materials ranging from ceramic tiles to concrete blocks and concrete are produced in large quantities; plastics extrusion, including the production of piping, is also an important industry.\nIndustrias La Constancia, El Salvador's largest brewer and bottler of purified water, dominates the Salvadoran export market of beers and bottled water. The company became part of the second largest brewer in the world, SABMiller, in 2005. Its flagship brand is \"Pilsener\", a pilsner style lager beer, the national beer of El Salvador. In 2011, La Constancia centralized its operations and opened its new headquarters in San Salvador, where it moved in 1928 from the Santa Ana Department. The company produces the \"Agua Cristal\" brand of bottled water, the best selling in El Salvador and in the Central American region. The Coca-Cola company uses the La Constancia installations to manufacture its beverage brands sold in El Salvador and the rest of Central America.\nUnilever has a plant in San Salvador. Its products include foods, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. Unilever manufactures all its products sold in Central America in San Salvador.\nArchitecture.\nSan Salvador's colonial structures, especially its colonial cathedrals, have been destroyed over time by historic earthquakes, consequently Modernist and Gothic style cathedrals have taken their place. During the Salvadoran civil war, large building construction projects were halted and eventually cancelled due to the collapse of the economy; the remainder of early Modernist office and hotel buildings collapsed during the 1986 San Salvador earthquake and the January 2001 and February 2001 El Salvador earthquakes, while the few remaining old buildings were left uninhabitable. Only a few large structures have survived the earthquakes, including the Sheraton Presidente San Salvador Hotel and the\nHilton Princess San Salvador Hotel. The seismic nature of the San Salvador area has until recently hindered the construction of high rise buildings and skyscrapers in the city; however, with new technological advances and the advent of earthquake-resistant structures, high rise buildings have begun rising over San Salvador. Today the city has monuments, plazas, stadiums, high rise buildings, large malls and cathedrals built in Neo-Gothic, Modernist, Populuxe, Googie, Streamline Moderne, Art Deco and Futurist style architecture.\nTourism and sites of interest.\nHistoric Downtown.\nThe historic downtown of San Salvador includes the area where the capital city of El Salvador has been located since the 16th century. The original buildings of the Spanish colony have been mostly destroyed by natural disasters over the years. The few notable surviving buildings were erected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Mayor Norman Quijano started several large projects with the goal of restoring the former grandeur of the buildings in the center. One such project is to reroute the public transportation routes so they no longer pass through the historic downtown. Another project is the relocation of unauthorised street vendors to a designated public market.\nNational Palace.\nThe current National Palace building replaced the old National Palace built in 1866\u20131870, which was destroyed by fire on 19 December 1889. The construction, done between 1905 and 1911, was the work of engineer Jos\u00e9 Emilio Alcaine, under the direction of the foreman Pascasio Gonz\u00e1lez Erazo. To finish the project, legislation was passed that collected one colon for every \"quintal\" of coffee exported. The materials used were imported from several European countries including Germany, Italy and Belgium. The Palace's facilities were occupied by government offices until 1974.\nThe building contains four main rooms and 101 secondary rooms; each of the four main rooms has a distinctive color. The Red Room (\"Salon Rojo\") is used for receptions held by the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry, and the ceremonial presentation of ambassadors' credentials. It has been used for ceremonial purposes since the administration of General Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez. The Yellow Room (\"Salon Amarillo\") is used as an office for the President of the Republic, while the Pink Room (\"Salon Rosado\") housed the Supreme Court and later the Ministry of Defense. The Blue Room (\"Salon Azul\") was the meeting place of the Legislature of El Salvador from 1906, and its classical architecture with Ionian, Corinthian and Roman elements is notable. The room is now called the \"Salvadoran Parliament\" in commemoration of its former purpose, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974.\nMetropolitan Cathedral.\nThe Metropolitan Cathedral of the Holy Savior \"(Catedral Metropolitana de San Salvador)\" is the principal church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Salvador and the seat of the Archbishop of San Salvador. The church was twice visited by Pope John Paul II, who said that the cathedral was \"intimately allied with the joys and hopes of the Salvadoran people.\" During his visits in 1983 and 1996, the Pope knelt and prayed before the Tomb of Archbishop \u00d3scar Romero, assassinated in 1980, whose tomb here is a major draw for pilgrims. The cathedral's site is the location of the old Temple of Santo Domingo (St. Dominic).\nForty four people died on Palm Sunday, 31 March 1980, during the funeral of Archbishop Romero, as a result of a stampede after some gunmen, allegedly members of security forces (although it has never been corroborated), fired on mourners and on Romero's funeral cortege. The gunmen were never identified. The square in front of the cathedral was the site of celebrations after the signing of the Chapultepec Peace Accords that ended the Salvadoran Civil War in 1992. The cathedral was finished off with a festive tiled ceramic mural fa\u00e7ade by the Salvadoran master Fernando Llort and inaugurated on 19 March 1999. In late December 2012, the Archbishop of San Salvador, Jos\u00e9 Luis Escobar Alas, ordered the removal of the fa\u00e7ade without consulting the national government or the artist himself. Workers chipped off and destroyed all the 2,700 tiles of the mural.\nNational Theater.\nThe \"Teatro Nacional de El Salvador\", or National Theater of El Salvador, is the oldest theater in Central America. It was designed by the French architect Daniel Beylard, with construction starting on 3 November 1911. The building was inaugurated on 1 March 1917. It is of French Renaissance style with modern touches, and was decorated by the Italian architect Lucio Cappellaro.\nThe National Theater is located on the southern side of Francisco Moraz\u00e1n Plaza on Calle Delgado. It was built in the French Renaissance style with details done in the Rococo, Romantic, and Art Nouveau styles, and can seat 650 spectators in the Grand Hall. It has balconies on three levels\u2014the Presidential Balcony, located between the third and second Floor, has a direct view of center stage. The building features an ellipsoidal dome containing a mural by painter Carlos Ca\u00f1as and a crystal chandelier; other impressive spaces include the Chamber Hall and the Grand Foyer. The theater is open to tourists, and after the Historic Downtown Restoration has been used for plays, shows, operas, song recitals, and modern dance performances. It is the largest and most luxurious theater in Central America, and was declared a National Monument in 1979.\nCalle Arce.\nCalle Arce (named after Manuel Jos\u00e9 Arce, first president of the Federal Republic of Central America) is a major street in San Salvador. Mayor Norman Quijano inaugurated the first phase of its redevelopment near the Plaza de la Salud, which focuses on improvements to the sidewalks between 21st and 19th Avenida Norte. Twelve antique lights, originally from Spain and dating from 1900, will be installed, along with six benches and 40 trees.\nAt the same time, sidewalks will be renovated with ramps to provide access for people with disabilities and seniors. Calle Arce is monitored by 24 members of the Corps Metropolitan Agents (CAM), who specialize in the maintenance and protection of the new public space.\nParks and plazas.\nPlaza Gerardo Barrios.\nLa Plaza Gerardo Barrios, also known as the Civic Plaza, is located in the heart of the city. The statue that dominates the site, designed by Francisco Durini C\u00e1seres, is dedicated to President Gerardo Barrios and was unveiled in 1909. It was the work of the sculptors Antonio and Carlos Ezeta, who were brothers. The figure, made of bronze, is placed on a pedestal of granite and depicts battle scenes and the shield of El Salvador.\nPlaza Gerardo Barrios is the site of many demonstrations and political rallies. Mass is celebrated there as well, and it is the destination of many parades. The plaza is also the focal point for celebrations accompanying the feast of San Salvador on 5 and 6 August. The religious procession called \"El Descenso\" (\"The Descent\"), dedicated to the \"Divine Savior of the World\" and representing the resurrection of Jesus and his descent from the tomb, terminates there.\nPlaza Libertad.\n Plaza Libertad is the location of the \"Monumento de los H\u00e9roes\" (Monument to the Heroes), a commemoration of the centenary of the \"First Cry of Independence\" in 1811. The monument, designed by Francisco Durini C\u00e1seres, and installed in 1911, is crowned by an \"angel of freedom\" at its pinnacle holding a laurel wreath in both hands. As a consequence of increased commercial activity, the area around the plaza was enhanced with the construction of two ornate buildings, the \"Portal la Dalia\" in 1915\u20131916 and the \"Portal de Occidente\" in 1917.\nPlaza Moraz\u00e1n.\nDuring the administration of President Rafael Zaldivar, the Salvadoran government ordered the erection of a marble statue here to commemorate the fortieth anniversary (15 March 1882) of the death of Francisco Moraz\u00e1n, former president of the Federal Republic of Central America. The sculpture was created by the artist Francisco Durini Vasalli originally of Tremona, Italy. The government declared 15 March as a day of national civic celebration, and Morazan's son attended the inauguration as a representative of the Government of Honduras.\nCasa Due\u00f1as.\nThis important residential building was built in the 1920s by coffee farmer Miguel Due\u00f1as. The government confiscated the house in 1922 to cover the owner's debts, and it then remained unoccupied for years. From 1930 to 1933, Mexico leased the house for use by its diplomatic delegation, and from 1935 to 1957 the United States legation rented the house for its ambassadors' residence. Six successive U.S. ambassadors resided there, and occasional guests such as former Presidents Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson, Senator Robert Kennedy, and movie stars Clark Gable and Tony Curtis stayed there. After 1957 it was the temporary headquarters of an advertizing agency, then was vacated again in 1960. In 1973 the Department of Vocational Training Ministry of Labor occupied the structure; in 1986 it was declared a Cultural Asset by an Executive Agreement of 8 May 1985. The Ministry of Labor transferred the property to the authorities of the Ministry of Education, with a directive to explore the possibility of its restoration and rehabilitation. The restoration work began in 2001 under the leadership of Dr. Alfredo Mart\u00ednez Moreno, former director of the Salvadorean Language Academy and the Royal Spanish Academy.\nMuseums.\nSan Salvador has many museums, with the largest being the http:// (MUNA) and http:// (MARTE). MUNA's mission is to help Salvadorans reflect on their cultural identity through exhibitions, research, publications and educational programs in the fields of archeology and anthropology. The museum's exhibits demonstrate social processes of the human cultural groups that have inhabited El Salvador. MARTE's mission is to contribute to development of the country's education and culture through the conservation and dissemination of its artistic heritage, and by improving historical knowledge, reaffirming cultural values that shape the Salvadoran identity, and promoting new artistic idioms. MARTE is a private, nonprofit organization, opened on 22 May 2003. Since then the museum has become an essential element of the cultural life of Central America, with its representative view of art from the mid-19th century to contemporary times.\nA different sort of museum is the http:// (Tin Marin Children's Museum), located between Gimnasio Nacional Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Pineda and Parque Cuscatl\u00e1n. Tin Mar\u00edn seeks to contribute to children becoming integral and creative citizens through significant learning, cultural stimulation and entertaining experimentation. The museum has more than 25 exhibits, including \"The Airplane\", \"The Grocery Store\", and the Planetarium.\nSports.\nEstadio Cuscatl\u00e1n, with a capacity of over 45,000, is the largest soccer venue in Central America and the Caribbean. It was announced on 16 November 2007, that Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n would become the first soccer stadium in Central America and the Caribbean to have a large LED screen, on which spectators can view the action. The screen is 40\u00a0meters in height and width and was completed in March 2008. The stadium was built in the early 1970s just before the beginning of the civil war, intended to jump-start an era of modernization in San Salvador, but development in the country ground to a halt during the 12 years of war.\nAnother major stadium is the Estadio Jorge \"M\u00e1gico\" Gonz\u00e1lez, with a capacity of 35,000. This stadium hosted the Central American and Caribbean Games in 2002, in which El Salvador came in 6th place among 37 countries.\nSan Salvador is the home of three major soccer teams in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol de El Salvador: Alianza F.C., C.D. Atl\u00e9tico Marte and C.D. Universidad de El Salvador. Alianza F.C. and Atl\u00e9tico Marte play their home games at Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n, and C.D. Universidad de El Salvador plays theirs at Estadio Universitario UES. Alianza is well known throughout El Salvador for its loyal supporters and for the exuberant atmosphere created during games.\nEducation.\nSan Salvador has numerous private high schools, including Protestant and Catholic high schools, as well as secular ones; the city also has numerous private bilingual schools.\nTransportation.\nSan Salvador is a major regional transportation hub, served by a comprehensive public transport network. Major routes of the national transportation network run through the city.\nAirport.\nThe country's primary airport is Monse\u00f1or \u00d3scar Arnulfo Romero International Airport, which handles all international flights. It replaced Ilopango International Airport as the country's main airport on 31 January 1980. Ilopango airport is located within the city limits and could not be expanded due to the lack of land and the proximity of the surrounding population, so the new airport was built outside the city in the neighboring department of La Paz.\nMonse\u00f1or \u00d3scar Arnulfo Romero International Airport lies on flat terrain, and it is not surrounded by populated areas, so it can be expanded in the future. It is located in the municipality of San Luis Talpa, from San Salvador. With 2,076,258 passengers in 2008, it was the third busiest airport by passenger traffic in Central America\nIlopango International Airport is used for military and charter aviation. It recently underwent renovation, and re-opened in 2009. Ilopango is the host of an annual air show.\nTamarindo Regional: There are plans to rehabilitate the airport on the Eastern Salvadoran coast of El Tamarindo, La Uni\u00f3n.\nRoads.\nThe main highway passing through San Salvador is the CA-1 (Pan-American highway), which at one point becomes Bulevar Arturo Castellanos. The RN-21 (Bulevar Monse\u00f1or Romero) is a major east\u2013west road connecting the cities of Santa Tecla and Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n, finally merging in San Salvador with the RN-5 East/West (also known as Bulevar los Pr\u00f3ceres), that later turns into the North/South RN-5 heading towards the International Airport. Another major roadway is the RN-4 (Carretera Este Oeste) which runs from San Salvador through Apopa, and subsequently merges with the CA-1 Panamericana.\nRoads in the capital are called \"street\" if they run east\u2013west, and \"avenue\" if they run north\u2013south. Road numbering starts at the downtown intersection of Avenida Espana/Avenida Cuscatl\u00e1n and Delgado Arce street. Avenues to the west of this intersection have odd-number names, and to the east they have even-number names. Streets have odd-number names if they are to the north of the intersection, and even-number names if to the south.\nOne particularly heavily traveled road is 49a Avenida Norte, which connects with the RN-5 highway to the airport. An important historical street is Calle Arce, which was closed in order to create a pedestrian-only mall in the historic downtown of San Salvador. Some streets in the city are very narrow with little room for cars to pass, although many streets are wide. Speed limits are on highways, on main roads, and on secondary streets and avenues.\nSITRAMSS.\nThe San Salvador Metropolitan Area Integrated System of Transportation (SITRAMSS) was a high-volume bus transportation system. The first route of the SITRAMSS made round trips from San Martin, through Ilopango, Soyapango, San Salvador, and Antiguo Cuscatlan to Santa Tecla. Between 40 and 60 buses capable of carrying 160 passengers per trip were scheduled to start operating in the second half of 2013.\nThe departure interval was approximately eight to ten minutes.\nBy the time the buses have reached the San Salvador historic downtown, they had already transported 20,000 passengers. SITRAMSS was a public-private partnership involving the current passenger transport operators, who must purchase the buses. To pay for the infrastructure development, a loan of $50 million was provided by the Inter-American Development Bank (BID)\nBus and taxi.\nApproximately 200,000 people use the city's public bus system daily. Some of the bus transportation system is operated by the city government, but most of it is operated by the private sector. This mixture of ownership has contributed to safety and traffic problems. In 2013, when the SITRAMS commenced operation, it was intended resolve many of these problems. Bus rides typically cost between $0.20 and $0.25, depending on the route. The city government operates a free bus system for use by handicapped, elderly, and pregnant women; this is the only such system in Central America.\nA taxi system operates throughout the entire city; fares depend on the route, as taxi drivers charge based on the location of the destination, rather than on elapsed time. Taxis in San Salvador are yellow, and the fleet is composed primarily of Toyota Corollas.\nRailway.\nRailway service was absent during the 1990s, but beginning on 1 October 2007, the National Railways of El Salvador (FENADESAL) resumed service. Tickets cost $0.10. Trains depart from near the East Bus Station and travel to the town of Apopa (service suspended from 2013). There are plans to start operation of another route, connecting the northern side of San Salvador, Cuscatancingo, to Apopa and from Apopa, to the city of Nejapa.\nThere is also a historic railroad consisting of railroad cars from the 1960s which were refurbished and put into operation by the ministry of tourism. Once a month, visitors can board the antique train and experience the way San Salvadorans transported themselves in the 1960s.\nDisasters.\nThe city has suffered from many severe earthquakes, the most disastrous of which occurred in 1854. The San Salvador volcano erupted again in 1917, resulting in three major earthquakes that damaged the city so extensively the government was forced to temporarily move the capital to the city of Santa Tecla (known at the time as \"Nueva San Salvador\"). The 1986 San Salvador earthquake struck on 10 October 1986, causing considerable damage to the city and surrounding areas.\nBetween 1,000 and 1,500 people are believed to have been killed, and over 10,000 people were injured. 200,000 people were left homeless after the earthquake and a week of minor aftershocks.\nThe 2001 El Salvador earthquakes struck El Salvador on 13 January and 13 February, 2001, resulting in considerable damage to the city, especially in Las Colinas suburb, where a landslide destroyed homes and killed many people.\nDuring the 1980s, when political conflicts in El Salvador exploded into Salvadoran civil war, many people fled to the capital, since most of the fighting occurred elsewhere (San Salvador itself was not directly affected by the war until the final offensive of 1989).\nHurricanes, tsunamis, and landslides also pose a threat. In November 2009, Hurricane Ida hit the departments of San Salvador, San Vicente and Cuscatl\u00e1n. In San Vicente, the municipalities of Verapaz and Guadalupe were totally destroyed by rainfall accompanying the hurricane, and the resultant landslide. The Army and the Red Cross were able to rescue most of the victims, but many thousands of people were left homeless. The government opened public schools to be used as temporary shelters for three months. The Hurricane destroyed some bridges, and some towns lost communications. The people of El Salvador raised money for the homeless and international aid came from countries such as the United States, Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and the European Union.\nTropical Storm Agatha.\nTropical storm Agatha hit the Central American coast on Thursday, 27 May 2010. About of rainfall was recorded over a period of five days in the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador, producing sinkholes, flash floods, and mudslides. Districts particularly hard hit included downtown, El Picacho, and Montebello.\nTropical Storm Amanda.\nTropical storm Amanda caused torrential rainfall across El Salvador, which was heavily impacted by the storm. In El Salvador, torrential rainfall caused significant damage along coastal cities in the country as rivers overflowed and swept away buildings. In San Salvador, 50 houses were destroyed and 23 vehicles fell into a sinkhole. Rivers overflowed and swept away buildings, damaging 900 homes and displacing over 1,200 people. Movement restrictions in place for the then-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in El Salvador were temporarily lifted to allow people to purchase medicines, while hardware stores were allowed to open with limited capacity so people could purchase equipment for repairs. President Nayib Bukele declared a 15-day national state of emergency due to the storm. Amanda was considered the worst weather disaster to effect El Salvador in 22 years, since Hurricane Mitch. Amanda caused rainfall accumulations of at least in many parts of the country, while Mitch only caused at least in other areas over a longer period of time.\nSecurity and crime.\nConcerns about public safety in San Salvador increased in the late 1980s due to the civil war. Although it was fought primarily in the countryside, during the latter years of the war, guerrillas started attacking the capital city. San Salvador recovered quickly after the cessation of hostilities, but gang (\"mara\") violence became a problem.\nThe 18th Street gang, originating in Los Angeles, California, United States, has proliferated in San Salvador. The Mara Salvatrucha is a rival gang. In 2002 crime rates skyrocketed and the municipal government was unable to combat the rise. Recent efforts by mayor Norman Quijano to restore public safety have been somewhat successful. Security measures in San Salvador's most troubled Districts (5 and 6, which border Soyapango, and are home to many gangs) included safety campaigns and recreational activities to keep youth from joining gangs. The mayor also initiated a security camera program so the police can monitor the most heavily trafficked areas of the city. The project was launched in the historic downtown and will expand throughout the entire city.\nAs of 2011[ [update]] San Salvador had managed to reduce its crime rate, and reduce its murder rate to a level lower than that of Haiti, Venezuela, Mexico, Guatemala, or Honduras, although at over 90 murders per 100,000 residents, the per capita rate was more than 10 times higher than major cities such as New York or London. Also according to a UN Development report, San Salvador has a relatively low robbery rate of 90 per 100,000, compared to San Jos\u00e9, the capital of Costa Rica, which has 524 robberies per 100,000.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nSan Salvador is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n \nLat.

{"id": "57632", "revid": "1819986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57632", "title": "Tri-Cities, Washington", "text": "Place in Washington, United States\nThe Tri-Cities are three closely linked cities (Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland) at the confluence of the Yakima, Snake, and Columbia Rivers in the U.S. state of Washington. Located in the Columbia Basin of Eastern Washington, the cities border one another, making the Tri-Cities seem like one uninterrupted mid-sized city. The three cities function as the center of the Tri-Cities metropolitan area, which consists of Benton and Franklin counties. The Tri-Cities urban area includes the city of West Richland, the census-designated places (CDP) of West Pasco and Finley, as well as the CDP of Burbank, despite the latter being located in Walla Walla County.\nThe official 2023 estimate of the Tri-Cities MSA population is 314,253, a more than 24% increase from 2010, while the combined population of the three principal cities themselves was 228,482 according to 2023 estimates from the United States Census Bureau.\nTri-Cities Airport is located in Pasco and provides the region with commercial and private air service. Pasco is the seat of Franklin County, while the other two cities are located in Benton County. In 2010, Kiplinger rated the Tri-Cities among the Top 10 best places to raise a family, and CNN/Money ranked the Tri-Cities one of the top 10 best bets for gains in housing value, due to its relatively stable economic conditions since the early 2000s.\nArea history.\nFounding.\nPasco was the first of the Tri-Cities to be incorporated, in 1891. Kennewick was incorporated in 1904, and Richland followed in 1910. West Richland\u2014a suburb of Richland, as well as the fourth largest city in the metropolitan area\u2014was founded by dissatisfied residents of Richland, who wished to be home owners rather than renters of government-owned houses, after the arrival of Hanford. Despite attempts by Richland to annex the community, they remained separate and eventually became incorporated in 1955.\nEarly history.\nPasco was the largest city in the Tri-Cities, mostly due to its railroad station. It also had the most land for easy irrigation and farming and was still the largest up until the founding of Hanford near Richland.\nFarming was the basis of virtually every sector of the economy in the early years. Indeed, the area remained mostly rural well into the 1940s. It did not have a daily newspaper or radio station until the mid-1940s. Even today, agriculture is a big part of the Tri-Cities, Pasco in particular.\n1940s\u20131970s.\nAfter the founding of the Hanford Site in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project, Richland became the largest city of the three overnight. Richland's Columbia High School adopted \"Bombers\" as its mascot (complete with mushroom cloud logo). In 1970, Kamiakin High School (in the neighboring city of Kennewick) was founded in response to the continued influx of people. The economy continued to grow, but not without some turbulence. Every time the Hanford facilities experienced reduced funding, thousands of people would suddenly become jobless. During this time, other employers slowly made their way into the area, but they too would often be forced to cut jobs in the bad times. Since the 1970s, Kennewick has had the greatest population of the three cities. The Columbia Center Mall opened in 1969 on land newly incorporated into Kennewick, drawing growth to western Kennewick and south Richland.\n1980s\u20131990s.\nCompletion of the Interstate 182 Bridge in 1984 made Pasco much more accessible, fueling the growth of that city. With the end of the Cold War, many in the area feared a shutdown of Hanford, followed by the Tri-Cities quickly becoming a ghost town. These fears were allayed after the United States Department of Energy switched the facility's purpose from the creation of nuclear weapons to the effective sealing and disposal of radioactive waste. During the 1990s, several major corporations entered the Tri-Cities, which helped to begin diversifying the economy apart from the Hanford sector. In 1995, a sixth public high school, Southridge High, was founded in south Kennewick.\n2000s\u2013present.\nThe 2000s saw continued rapid growth as the Hanford site hired hundreds of workers to help with the cleanup effort. Additionally, the Tri-Cities saw a large influx of retirees from various areas of the Northwest. During this time, and the corresponding nationwide housing boom, all three cities flourished and grew significantly. Pasco became the fastest growing city in Washington (in terms of both percent increase and number of new residents). In 2005, the Census Bureau reported that Pasco's population had surpassed Richland's for the first time since pre-Hanford days. Fueled by the boom, Chiawana High School was founded, and by 2019 had become the largest high school in the entire state.\nDespite the economic recession of the late 2000s, the Tri-Cities area continued to maintain steady growth and a stable economic climate due in part to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which directed funding and jobs to the Hanford site and its various cleanup efforts.\nClimate and geography.\nThe Tri-Cities are in a semi-arid climate, receiving an average of of precipitation every year. Winds periodically exceed when Chinook wind conditions exist. While there are an average 225 clear days every year, these are mainly between April 1 and November 1. Temperatures range from as low as in the winter (record low in December 1919) to as high as in the summer, and Richland reached during the 2021 Western North America heat wave. The region receives a yearly average of seven inches of snow but has received as much as 50\u00a0inches. Due to the semi-arid climate and subsequent large amounts of sand, a perpetual annoyance to residents is the amount of dust blown about by the frequent winds. Thanks to the aforementioned rivers, a large amount of cheap irrigation is available.\nWashington is the most northwest of the lower 48 states\u2014consequently, the area is in the Pacific Standard Time Zone. The Tri-Cities makes up the largest metropolitan area in the southeastern quadrant of Washington. The large Cascade Mountain Range to the west contributes to the semi-arid climate, which is far drier than the famously wet western side of the state. See rain shadow for more information on this phenomenon. The region's climate results in a shrub-steppe ecosystem which has 18 endemic plant species. Just west of Richland, the Fitzner/Eberhardt Arid Lands Ecology Reserve was established to study the unique plants and animals found in the local shrub steppe ecosystem. It is the largest tract of shrub-steppe ecosystem remaining in the U.S. state of Washington.\nLimited city lights and an absence of photopollution in the Tri-Cities area allow for naked-eye and telescopic astronomy. The Tri-City Astronomy Club partners holds star gazing events at the Hanford Observatory. Hiking locations, such as Badger Mountain, Candy Mountain and Jump Off Joe Butte, provide views of sunrises and sunsets, studies of celestial bodies and stellar astronomy. The aurora borealis (or northern lights) is sometimes visible near Tri-Cities at specific times of the year.\nEducation.\nColleges and universities.\nHigher education institutions in the Tri-Cities area include:\nIn 2005, the State of Washington approved the transition of the existing Washington State University branch campus in Richland from a two-year to a four-year campus. In the fall of 2007 the campus admitted its first undergraduate students. Offering a range of programs, the campus focuses on biotechnology, computer science, and engineering, due to the nearby Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Hanford Site. The university also offers a range of majors, including English, history, and other liberal arts and sciences.\nColumbia Basin College also offers higher education courses for residents of the Tri-Cities, as well as the Columbia Basin from Mattawa, Washington, which is away, to Umatilla, Oregon, away.\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nEach city provides its own schooling services through their respective school districts\u2014Kennewick's, Pasco's, and Richland's.\nPublic high schools in the Kennewick School District include Kennewick High School, Kamiakin High School, Southridge High School. Public high schools in the Pasco School District are Pasco High School, Chiawana High School, and New Horizons High School. In the Richland School District, public high schools include Richland High School, Hanford High School, and River's Edge High School.\nThe area also contains two regional high schools, Tri-Tech and Delta High. Tri-Tech is a technical/vocational high school in the Kennewick School District that is attended by students from all over the Tri-Cities area. Delta High is a science and technology focused high school located in Pasco. It is sponsored by Pasco, Kennewick, and Richland's school districts, Battelle, Washington State University Tri-Cities, and Columbia Basin College.\nThere are also several private and faith-based schools in the area, including Tri-Cities Prep Highschool (Pasco), Kingspoint Christian School K\u201312 (Pasco), Tri-Cities Adventist School (Pasco), Liberty Christian School (Richland), Bethlehem Lutheran K\u20138 (Kennewick), and Calvary Christian School K\u20138 (Kennewick).\nIndustry.\nEarly Hanford.\nIn the 1940s, the Hanford site employed a majority of residents. The United States government built a top-secret facility to produce and separate plutonium for nuclear weapons, and decided on an area just north of then-tiny Richland. The government built temporary quarters for the more than 45,000 workers and built permanent homes and infrastructure for other personnel in Richland. The city had an overnight population explosion, yet virtually no one knew what the purpose of Hanford was until the destruction of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, by an atomic weapon containing Hanford-produced plutonium. After World War II Hanford continued work on creating material for nuclear weapons during the Cold War. After the fall of the USSR in 1991, Hanford, the site of severe nuclear contamination, changed its mission from plutonium production to environmental cleanup and restoration.\nModern Hanford.\nThe Hanford site is one of the largest cleanup projects in the United States, costing over $1.4\u00a0million per day to turn over of nuclear waste into glass through a process called vitrification. Vitrification is a proven technique in the disposal and long-term storage of nuclear waste or other hazardous wastes. Original estimates were $2.8\u00a0billion over five years to clean up the waste, though estimates quickly grew in the early 1990s to $50\u00a0billion with a completion date of 30 years. As of 2021, the additional cost to complete cleanup is now projected to be between $300 and $640 billion with an estimated completion date of 2078. Over 18\u00a0percent of all jobs in the Benton Franklin County area are nuclear-related, research-related, or engineering.\nColumbia Generating Station.\nThe Columbia Generating Station operates ten miles outside of Richland and is the only nuclear power station in the Pacific Northwest. It uses a boiling water reactor with a type 5 layout and was relicensed 10 years to operate until 2043. After nine years of construction, the plant began operating after a long and costly construction process that resulted in the largest municipal bond default in U.S. history. Originally operated and owned by the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS), the coalition changed its name to Energy Northwest in 1998 because of the negative association with the original name (commonly pronounced \"Whoops\" in place of WPPSS). WPPSS defaulted on $2.25\u00a0billion in bonds resulting in payments that exceeded $12,000 per customer, an amount which was finally paid out in 1992 (10 years later). Its 1,190 gross megawatts can power the city of Seattle, and is equivalent to about 10 percent of the electricity generated in Washington and 4 percent of all electricity used in the Pacific Northwest and has several safeguards to protect against seismic, natural, or terrorist threats.\nAgriculture.\nThe Tri-Cities economy has historically been based on farming and the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. From Pasco's incorporation in 1891 to present day, the Tri-Cities have had a large degree of farming thanks to irrigation by the three nearby rivers. Wheat is the most commonly grown product; however, large amounts of apples, corn, grapes are also grown, along with potatoes, and other products including asparagus. Cherries are also grown in the region.\nGrapes grown in the region are essential to the wine industry. Wineries draw a large population of tourists. With 160 wineries in the Columbia Valley, this industry accounts for $1 billion annually in Benton County alone.\nThe Tri-Cities' climate allows the region to have a broad and sustainable agricultural economy. Local industries provide employment for thousands of people in the Tri-Cities area. Some of the top 20 employers in agriculture include ConAgra, Tyson Foods, and Broetje Orchards. Agriculture makes up 9.5% of employment in Tri-Cities and local businesses combined employ thousands of people. In 2012, the state of Washington was rated No. 1 in the nation when it comes to growing apples, hops, spearmint oil, sweet cherries, pears, concord grapes and processing carrots. The Mid-Columbia region including the Tri-Cities grows most of these crops. The region's climate and irrigation from nearby rivers, like the Columbia, Snake, and Yakima rivers, allow farmers to produce corn, hay, wheat and potatoes. In Washington there are 39,500 farms; 1,630 of these farms are located in Benton County and 891 are located in Franklin County.\nLocal cuisine.\nThe Tri-Cities has a number of locally owned and operated restaurants. The Spudnut Shop, for example, located in northern Richland, was opened in 1948 and has been family-run ever since. The Travel Channel featured The Spudnut Shop and their donuts \"made from potato flour and then deep-fried to perfection.\" Carmine's, also a family owned restaurant in the region, served Italian food in a historic home that was constructed in downtown Kennewick in 1929. The owners retired in 2021, closing the restaurant after celebrating their 59th wedding anniversary. Also notable is the BBQ restaurant Porter's which began as a food truck in Richland and has been featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\" hosted by Guy Fieri.\nWine and breweries.\nIn contrast to Seattle, the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains, and the rain forests of the Olympic Peninsula, the Columbia Valley enjoys long, warm, summer days, and crisp cool nights. The dry weather combined with rich volcanic soils and controlled irrigation produce near-perfect conditions for the cultivation of wine grapes.\nThe range of varietals grown throughout the region include Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Riesling, and Pinot Noir.\nThe Tri-Cities region has a rich winery culture that attract tourists and visitors to the area. Some of the local microbreweries include: Ice Harbor Brewery Company, Atomic Ale Brewpub and Eatery, and White Bluff Brewing. This brewery was founded in 1996 and has two locations in the Tri-Cities metropolitan area, one in downtown Kennewick and one on Clover Island. In 2010, Ice Harbor received a bronze award for their Sternwheeler Stout, Runaway Red Ale, Indian Pale Ale (IPA) and a Silver Award for their Tangerine \"ExBEERience\" Hefeweizen at the Washington Beer Awards competition. Another micro-brewery, the Atomic Ale Brew Pub &amp; Eatery, is located in Richland and serves as Tri-Cities oldest brewpub and was opened in 1997.\nFarmers markets.\nThe Market at the Parkway in Richland, WA is a farmers market with takes place every Friday from June through October. Local artists provide music and crafts, and Fresh produce, specialty foods, arts and crafts are sold at the Richland farmers market.\nThe Pasco Farmers Market, which celebrated 25 years in 2013, takes place every Wednesday and Saturday morning beginning in May through the end of October, and consists primarily of fresh produce.\nA farmers market, located at the corner of Benton Street and Kennewick Avenue, takes place on Thursday evenings and runs annually from the end of May through October.\nOther industries.\nThe Tri-Cities is home to automobile manufacturer SSC North America.

Several motions to consolidate have not been passed.\nProposed names for such a consolidated area have included the \"Quad-Cities\" (accounting for West Richland), \"Tri-Cities\", or \"Three Rivers\". West Richland has separately been proposed to be renamed to \"Red Mountain\", in an attempt to distinguish itself from Richland.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57634", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57634", "title": "Carl Orff", "text": "German composer (1895\u20131982)\nCarl Heinrich Maria Orff (; 10 July 1895 \u2013 29 March 1982) was a German composer and music educator, who composed the cantata \"Carmina Burana\" (1937). The concepts of his Schulwerk were influential for children's music education.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nCarl Heinrich Maria Orff was born in Munich on 10 July 1895, the son of Paula Orff (n\u00e9e K\u00f6stler, 1872\u20131960) and Heinrich Orff (1869\u20131949). His family was Bavarian and was active in the Imperial German Army; his father was an army officer with strong musical interests, and his mother was a trained pianist. His grandfathers, Carl von Orff (1828\u20131905) and Karl K\u00f6stler (1837\u20131924), were both major generals and also scholars. His paternal grandmother, Fanny Orff (n\u00e9e Kraft, 1833\u20131919), was Catholic of Jewish descent. His maternal grandmother was Maria K\u00f6stler (n\u00e9e Aschenbrenner, 1845\u20131906). Orff had one sibling, his younger sister Maria (\"Mia\", 1898\u20131975), who married the architect Alwin Seifert (1890\u20131972) in 1924.\nDespite his family's military background, Orff recalled in 1970: \"In my father's house there was certainly more music making than drilling.\" At age five, he began to play piano, and later studied cello and organ. He composed a few songs and music for puppet plays. He had two vignettes published in July 1905 in \"Das gute Kind\", the children's supplement to \"Die katholische Familie\". He began attending concerts in 1903 and heard his first opera (Richard Wagner's \"The Flying Dutchman\") in 1909. The formative concerts he attended included the world premiere of Gustav Mahler's \"Das Lied von der Erde\" in 1911 and Richard Strauss conducting his opera \"Elektra\" on 4 June 1914.\nIn 1910\u201312, Orff wrote several dozen Lieder on texts by German poets, including the song set \"Fr\u00fchlingslieder\" (Opus 1, text by Ludwig Uhland) and the song cycle \"Eliland: Ein Sang von Chiemsee\" (Opus 12, text by Karl Stieler). The poet whose work he most frequently used was Heinrich Heine; he also chose texts of Walther von der Vogelweide, Princess Mathilde of Bavaria (1877\u20131906), Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, Ludwig August Frankl, Hermann Lingg, Rudolf Baumbach, Richard Beer-Hofmann, and B\u00f6rries von M\u00fcnchhausen, among others. Orff's songs fell into the style of Richard Strauss and other German composers of the day, but with hints of what would become Orff's distinctive musical language. Some of his songs were published in 1912. These include \"Eliland\", with a dedication to Karl K\u00f6stler, who funded the publication. In 1911\u201312, Orff wrote \"Zarathustra\" (Opus 14), a large work for baritone voice, three tenor-bass choruses, winds, percussion, harps, pianos, and organ, based on a passage from Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical novel \"Also sprach Zarathustra\".\nOrff studied at the Munich Academy of Music from 1912 until 1914. Orff later wrote that his decision to pursue music studies instead of completing Gymnasium was the source of family strife, as the Orff patriarch (his father's older brother, also named Karl Orff, 1863\u20131942) was against the idea. Orff had the support of his mother, who persuaded his father, and of his grandfather K\u00f6stler. Orff's teacher at the Akademie was the composer Anton Beer-Walbrunn, of whom he later wrote with respect but said that he found the academy overall to be \"conservative and old-fashioned\" (\"konservativ und altv\u00e4terlich\"). At this time, he studied the works of Arnold Schoenberg, and one of his most important influences at this time was the French composer Claude Debussy. These influences can be heard in his first stage work, the music drama \"Gisei: Das Opfer\" (\"Gisei: The Sacrifice\", Opus 20), written in 1913 but not performed until 2010. Orff's source material is a German translation of part of \"Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami\", specifically \"Terakoya\" (\"The Village School\") in Act IV. In 1914 Orff wrote \"Tanzende Faune: Ein Orchesterspiel\" (Opus 21). The work was to be performed at the Akademie\u00a0\u2013 his first performance by an orchestra\u00a0\u2013 but conductor Eberhard Schwickerath removed it from the program following an unsuccessful rehearsal; it was first performed in 1995. In 1915, he began studying piano with Hermann Zilcher. Writing to his father, he called the studies with Zilcher his most productive teacher relationship to date. Around this time he also came to know theater director Otto Falckenberg, and saw plays by August Strindberg and Frank Wedekind.\nWorld War I.\nOrff was forced into the German Army in August 1917, which was a great crisis for him. In a letter to his father dated 3 August 1917, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My future lies now more than ever completely in the dark. That I [shall] go into the battlefield is absolutely certain. Here the decision should, and will, fall (you know that I am free from sentimentality): either I find an end of everything that has pushed and almost crushed me, or I become a wholly new person and begin in a certain sense entirely new. What must come, should come entirely better as the time that was.\nThe coming fall, he was severely injured and nearly killed when a trench caved in, suffering amnesia, aphasia, and paralysis of his left-side. During his difficult recovery, he wrote to his father: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I certainly never think of something that looks like the future. ... Since I am in the battlefield, all threads and connections from earlier are torn to shreds. ... For him who has been out here once, it is better (especially in my profession) that he remains out here. When I hear music I get palpitations &amp; fever and it makes me sick; I can't think at all about when I might be able to hear a concert again, let alone make music myself. After Orff's death in 1982, his daughter wrote that she believed this experience \"made him think and rebel yet more revolutionarily.\"\nWeimar Republic.\nAfter recovering from his battle injuries, Orff held various positions at opera houses in Mannheim and Darmstadt, later returning to Munich to pursue his music studies. Around 1920, Orff was drawn to the poetry of Franz Werfel, which became the basis for numerous Lieder and choral compositions. In the mid-1920s, he began to formulate a concept he called , or elemental music, which was based on the unity of the arts symbolized by the ancient Greek Muses, and involved tone, dance, poetry, image, design, and theatrical gesture. Like many other composers of the time, he was influenced by the Russian-French \u00e9migr\u00e9 Igor Stravinsky. But while others followed the cool, balanced neoclassic works of Stravinsky, it was works such as \"Les noces\" (\"The Wedding\"), an earthy, quasi-folkloric depiction of Russian peasant wedding rites, that appealed to Orff.\nOrff came to know the work of Bertolt Brecht in 1924, which had a profound influence on him. The same year, he and Dorothee G\u00fcnther founded the G\u00fcnther-Schule for gymnastics, music, and dance in Munich. He developed his theories of music education, having constant contact with children and working with musical beginners. In 1930, Orff published a manual titled \"Schulwerk\", in which he shares his method of conducting. He was involved with the Schulwerk and its associated institutions throughout his life, although he retired from the G\u00fcnther-Schule in 1938.\nOrff also began adapting musical works of earlier eras for contemporary theatrical presentation, including Claudio Monteverdi and Alessandro Striggio's opera \"L'Orfeo\" (1607). Orff's shortened German version (with G\u00fcnther's translation), \"Orpheus\", was staged under his direction in 1925 in Mannheim, using some of the instruments that had been used in the original 1607 performance, although several of these were unavailable and had to be replaced. Orff revised the score a few years later; this version was first performed in Munich in 1929. Orff's adaptations of early music brought him very little money. The passionately declaimed opera of Monteverdi's era was almost unknown in the 1920s, and Orff's production met with reactions ranging from incomprehension to ridicule. He told his mentor Curt Sachs, who had led him to study Monteverdi and supported his \"Orpheus\", that the Munich press was against him: \"I am made out to be not only a violator of corpses (see Monteverdi), but also a youth-seducer, who systematically corrupts our good youth with exotic perversities.\"\nNazi era.\nBeginning of the Third Reich.\nOrff's relationship with German National Socialism and the Nazi Party has been a matter of considerable debate and analysis, sometimes colored by misinformation. Historian Michael H. Kater, whose work is critical of Orff, nevertheless wrote that \"Carl Orff's name to many has become synonymous with fascist art and culture, frequently by way of a rather cavalier prejudgment.\"\nOrff never joined the Party, nor did he have any leadership position with the Third Reich. He was a member of the Reichsmusikkammer, which was required of active musicians in the Third Reich.\nSeveral of Orff's friends and associates went into exile between 1933 and 1939, including Sachs and Leo Kestenberg, the latter of whom was an advocate for his Schulwerk. Orff reconnected with several of these exiled colleagues after the war and in some cases maintained lifelong friendships, as with singer and composer Karel Salmon, who emigrated within the first few months of the Nazi takeover. Another such figure is the art historian Albin von Prybram-Gladona (1890\u20131974), whose parents had converted from Judaism before his birth and who survived multiple incarcerations in concentration camps after he fled to France. Prybram-Gladona testified to Orff's character during the denazification process. Another important friend to Orff was the German-Jewish musicologist and composer Erich Katz (1900\u20131973), who fled in 1939 after temporary incarceration in Dachau. Orff reestablished contact with Katz in 1952, and Katz considered Orff a valued friend. Orff wrote a tribute upon Katz's death in the form of a letter addressed to the deceased.\n\"Carmina Burana\".\nOrff's \"Carmina Burana\" had its premiere in Frankfurt on 8 June 1937. It became very popular in Nazi Germany over the next few years. Historian Michael H. Kater wrote that \"by 1945\" it \"[stood] out as the single universally important work produced during the entire span of the Third Reich\". Oliver Rathkolb, however, has noted that subsequent popular perception has exaggerated the degree of its importance to the culture of the Third Reich, as numerous other works received more stagings. Given Orff's previous lack of commercial success, the monetary gains from \"Carmina Burana\"'s acclaim, including a 500 RM award from the city of Frankfurt, were significant to him but the composition, with its unfamiliar rhythms, was also denounced with racist taunts.\n\"Ein Sommernachtstraum\".\nOrff was one of numerous German composers under the Nazi regime who wrote new incidental music for William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" \u2013 in German \"Ein Sommernachtstraum\" \u2013 after the music of Felix Mendelssohn for that play had been banned. Orff's version was first performed on 14 October 1939 in Frankfurt as the result of a commission through that city. By his report, he had already composed music for the play as early as 1917 and 1927, long before the Frankfurt commission; no materials from these earlier (presumably incomplete) versions are extant. Orff's publisher had serious reservations about the project, and Orff's commission was unable to make the original deadline of the commission, resulting in the reduction of his payment from 5,000 RM to 3,000 RM. He later called the 1939 iteration \"a compromised (unfortunately printed) version. In place of the small onstage ensemble there was again a normal small opera orchestra, no more magical percussion, all inexcusable concessions.\" The composer's discontent, together with his initial difficulties in composition, sometimes has been interpreted at least in part as due to pangs of conscience. Thomas R\u00f6sch has written of this project: \"The autonomy of art, which Orff always held highly, was only more illusion within the dictatorship \u2013 and the insistence of the composer on a purely artistic, aesthetic viewpoint inevitably changed under this condition to a momentous error.\"\nOrff went on to rework his \"Ein Sommernachtstraum\" score three times. The next version was to have its premiere on 10 September 1944, but the closure of all theaters in dire wartime conditions prevented it from occurring. In December 1945, Orff expressed hope for a performance in Stuttgart, but when Gottfried von Einem asked him in 1946 about a premiere of this version at the Salzburg Festival, he demurred and responded defensively when Einem asked if the work had been a commission from the Third Reich. Orff made further revisions still, and this version was first performed on 30 October 1952 in Darmstadt. It also had an American performance by Leopold Stokowski at the Empire State Music Festival on 19 July 1956. Orff revised the score yet again in 1962; this final version had its first performance on in Stuttgart on 12 March 1964.\nRelationship with Kurt Huber.\nOrff was a friend of Kurt Huber (1893\u20131943), a professor at Ludwig Maximilian University, with whom he worked since 1934 on Bavarian folk music. Together with Orff's \"Schulwerk\" associate Hans Bergese (1910\u20132000), they published two volumes of folk music as \"Musik der Landschaft: Volksmusik in neuen S\u00e4tzen\" in 1942.\nIn December 1942, Huber became a member of the student resistance movement (the White Rose). He was arrested on 27 February 1943, condemned to death by the , and executed by the Nazis on 13 July 1943. By happenstance, Orff called at Huber's house on the day after his arrest. Huber's distraught wife, Clara (n\u00e9e Schlickenrieder, 1908\u20131998), hoped Orff would use his influence to help her husband, but Orff panicked upon learning of Kurt Huber's arrest, fearing that he was \"ruined\" (\"ruiniert\"). Clara Huber later said she never saw Orff again, but there is documentary evidence that they had further contact. On at least one occasion, she recalled that Orff had attempted to help her husband through Baldur von Schirach (the highest-ranking Nazi official with whom he came into contact, and whom he met at least twice), for which no further evidence has been found. In June 1949, Orff transferred his rights to \"Musik der Landschaft\" to Huber's family. Shortly after the war, Clara Huber asked Orff to contribute to a memorial volume for her husband; he contributed an emotional letter written directly to Kurt Huber, similar to what he did for Katz years later. Orff's \"Die Bernauerin\", a project which he completed in 1946 and which he had discussed with Huber before the latter's execution, is dedicated to Huber's memory. The final scene of this work, which is about the wrongful execution of Agnes Bernauer, depicts a guilt-ridden chorus begging not to be implicated in the title character's death.\nDenazification.\nIn late March 1946, Orff underwent a denazification process in Bad Homburg at a psychological screening center of the Information Control Division (ICD), a department of the Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS). Orff was rated \"Grey C, acceptable\", which his evaluator Bertram Schaffner (1912\u20132010) defined as for those \"compromised by their actions during the Nazi period but not subscribers to Nazi doctrine\".\nSome sources report that Orff had been blacklisted before the evaluation, which would have prevented him from collecting royalties on his compositions. According to more recent research by Oliver Rathkolb, there is no evidence to support this. In January 1946, American officer Newell Jenkins (1915\u20131996)\u00a0\u2013 Orff's former student (with whom he used the informal \"du\"), who went on to have a career as a conductor\u00a0\u2013 informed him that he did not need a license as a composer if he was not seeking to conduct, teach, or otherwise appear in public. Jenkins, however, hoped that Orff would take an Intendant position in Stuttgart, which Orff was considering after initially saying no. This would require evaluation, and thus Jenkins encouraged Orff to think of how he could prove that he had actively resisted Nazism, as such persons were most highly valued. Orff turned down the Stuttgart position by early March 1946, but Jenkins still insisted Orff undergo an evaluation at the end of that month. Schaffner's report notes: \"Orff does not wish a license as 'Intendant' of an opera-house, and states that he has already refused such an offer, because the work would be primarily administrative and not musical. He wishes to have permission to appear as guest-conductor.\" Orff was granted a license without any restrictions despite his rating of \"'Grey C', acceptable\", but there is no evidence that he conducted in public after the war.\nSchaffner believed that the root causes of Nazism included an underlying societal rigidity and authoritarianism in Germany, especially as they pertained to fathers in family life and institutions such as the school and the military. His theories informed his and his colleagues' denazification evaluations. In his report on Orff, Schaffner wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;O[rff]'s attitudes are not Nazi. One of his best friends, Prof. Carl [sic] Huber, with whom he published \"Musik der Landschaft\", a collection of folk songs, was killed by the Nazis in Munich in 1943. Nevertheless he was a \"Nutzniesser\" [i.e., beneficiary] of the Nazis and can at present be classified only as \"Grey C\", acceptable. In view of his antinazi point of view, his deliberate av[o]idance of positions and honors which he could have had by cooperating with the Nazis, he may at a future date be reclassified higher.\nThere is no evidence that Orff was ever reclassified, but since his license had no restrictions, this was not necessary. For Orff's psychological evaluation, Schaffner wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;1. A highly gifted, creative individual who scored high on intelligence tests ... Orff is diplomatic, ingratiating and ingenious. Retiring and unob[tr]usive, accustomed to independence and solitude since childhood, he has steadfastly pursued his career as an unattached composer. He has little personal need of \"belonging\" to a group, public honor or recognition, and prefers to work alone rather than in organizations. He is emotionally well-adjusted, purposeful and egocentric.\n2. Orff scored highest in his group on the political attitudes test. Psychiatric studies of his environment and development are consistent with an antinazi att[i]tude. On psychological grounds, [N]azism was distasteful to him; likewise on psychological grounds, he remained a passive antinazi, and tried to avoid official and personal contact bot[h] with the Nazi movement and with the war.\nSome scholars have maintained that Orff deceived his evaluators to some degree. The counterpoint is that Orff misrepresented himself in some instances, but the Americans had enough information to assess him fundamentally correctly and rate him accordingly. The report notes some of Orff's financial support from the cities of Frankfurt and Vienna, his participation in the 1936 Summer Olympics, and the music for \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (although the number of its performances was undercounted), which Orff said he wrote \"from his own private musical point of view\" but \"admit[ted] that he chose an unfortunate moment in history to write it.\"\nOrff said \"that he never got a favorable review by a Nazi music critic\"; however, his work had been enthusiastically received by audiences and many critics. He also said that \"[h]is great success\" was in 1942 with a performance of \"Carmina Burana\" in La Scala in Milan, \"not under the auspices of the Propaganda Ministry.\" In fact, Orff later publicly characterized the second staging of \"Carmina Burana\", which took place in Dresden on 4 October 1940, as the beginning of his great success. The American evaluators disbelieved Orff's account of his reception in the Third Reich: \"The fact that he was deferred ... during the war is contradictory to his claim that he was not well thought of at the Propaganda Ministry. ... He does not give a very good [e]xplanation.\" The report likewise notes Orff's very sharp rise in income in the latter part of the Third Reich.\nSurprisingly absent from the report are several factors that Orff could have used in his favor, notably his associations with Jewish colleagues as well as his own partly Jewish ancestry, the latter of which was never publicly known while he was alive. Nor is there any mention of the potentially subversive and anti-authoritarian texts in his works, notably the passages in \"Die Kluge\" (premiere 1943) that have been identified as such, sometimes even during Orff's lifetime (including by Carl Dahlhaus).\nWhite Rose controversy.\nAccording to Michael Kater, Orff cleared his name during the denazification period by claiming that he had helped establish the White Rose resistance movement in Germany. Kater also made a particularly strong case that Orff collaborated with Nazi German authorities. The source for the White Rose claim was a 1993 interview with Jenkins. Kater described his finding as \"nothing less than sensational\" (\"nichts weniger als sensationell\"). The episode was the source of considerable strife. The controversy elicited objections from two people who had known Orff in their youth during the Third Reich, one of whom recalled that Jenkins had been trying to portray Orff as a \"resistance fighter\" (\"Widerstandsk\u00e4mpfer\") and thus believed that Jenkins had been the source of the alleged legend.\nA few years later, Viennese historian Oliver Rathkolb discovered Orff's denazification file, which was distributed to reporters in a press conference at the Orff-Zentrum M\u00fcnchen on 10 February 1999. In this document, there is no claim about being in the White Rose. There is, however, a reference to Orff's relationship with Huber (see quoted passage under \"Denazification\"). Orff told Fred K. Prieberg in 1963 that he was afraid of being arrested as an associate of Huber, but made no claim that he had been involved in the White Rose himself. In 1960, Orff had described similar fears to an interviewer but explicitly said that he was not a part of the resistance himself.\nKater's accusation, as he termed it, regarding the White Rose colored much of the discourse on Carl Orff in the coming years. In some instances the debate focused more on acrimony between those involved. In \"Composers of the Nazi Era: Eight Portraits\" (2000) Kater qualified his earlier accusations to some extent after reviewing the documents that Rathkolb discovered. Subsequently, however, Kater reiterated his initial claim regarding Orff and the White Rose without any reference to the denazification file.\nWhile Kater's account has been accepted by some scholars who have investigated the matter further, Rathkolb and others have examined the theory that Orff lied about being a member of the resistance and found insufficient evidence to believe it, noting there is no solid corroboration outside of Kater's interview with Jenkins. Writing in 2021, Siegfried G\u00f6llner was not convinced that the allegation about the White Rose lie had been refuted as unambiguously as he felt Rathkolb and Thomas R\u00f6sch had claimed, but \"since the episode about the White Rose was never on the record or issued openly by Orff, it is ultimately irrelevant whether the episode reported by Jenkins to Kater actually took place or was a matter of misunderstanding. ... Kater in any case attached too much significance to the statement of Jenkins.\" In 1999, at the height of the controversy, musicologist Reinhard Schulz described the affair as a \"scholarly cockfight\" (\"wissenschaftlichen Hahnenkampfes\"), adding: \"Far more important than a single fact would be an understanding of [the] connection\" to Orff's life and creativity.\nPersonal life.\nCarl Orff was very guarded as to his personal life. When asked by the theater scholar Carl Niessen to provide a handwritten entry for a collection of autobiographies of German composers of the day, for which some of his colleagues wrote as many as three pages, he sent only: \"Carl Orff[,] born 1895 in Munich[,] living there\" \"(Carl Orff[,] geboren 1895 in M\u00fcnchen[,] lebt daselbst).\"\nOrff was married four times and had three divorces. His first marriage was in 1920 to the singer Alice Solscher (1891\u20131970). Orff's only child, Godela Orff (later Orff-B\u00fcchtemann, 1921\u20132013) was born on 21 February 1921. The couple separated about six months after Godela's birth and were divorced officially in 1927. Godela remained with her father when her mother moved to Melbourne to pursue her career around 1930. In 1939, Orff married Gertrud Willert (1914\u20132000), who had been his student and who founded a method of music therapy using the Orff-Schulwerk; they divorced in 1953. By 1952, he began a relationship with author Luise Rinser (1911\u20132002), whom he married in 1954. In 1955, they moved from Munich to Die\u00dfen am Ammersee. Their marriage was troubled and ended in divorce in 1959, by which time Orff was living with the person who would become his next wife. Orff's final marriage, which lasted to the end of his life, was with Liselotte Schmitz (1930\u20132012), who had been his secretary, and who after his death carried on his legacy in her capacity with the Carl-Orff Stiftung. They married in Andechs on 10 May 1960.\nBorn to devout Roman Catholic parents, Orff broke from religious dogma at a young age. His daughter tied his break from the church to the suicide of a classmate, and she reported that he did not have her baptized. Gertrud Orff said that \"he never went to church; to the contrary. It was probably the time of inner rebellion against things like that. ... He was a religious person, yes. But not a person of the church.\" Nevertheless, he wanted to be buried in the Baroque church of the beer-brewing Benedictine priory of Andechs, southwest of Munich; he could see this monastery from his home in Die\u00dfen.\nOrff had no desire to follow in his family's military tradition, even as a child. He later wrote: \"My father [Heinrich Orff] knew that everything soldierly lay far from me and that I could not warm up to it.\" According to Godela Orff, the composer's parents \"nevertheless always remained lovingly inclined toward him, even when his way of life did not meet their expectations\", and Orff and his sister \"were watched over and supported with loving tolerance.\" She also wrote that her father's mother, Paula Orff, always fostered her son's creativity and gave him \"the gift of inspiration\". Orff himself wrote of his mother: \"From time immemorial I was a real mother's boy. In life's serious and most difficult situations she understood me deeply with her heart, even if her ideas, strongly set in tradition, stood in the way of it.\" Paula Orff died on 22 July 1960, after which Orff's colleague Karl Amadeus Hartmann wrote to him: \"I know how intimately bonded you were with your mother, similar to me with mine, and can therefore especially sympathize with the entire gravity of the loss.\"\nGodela Orff described her relationship with her father as having been difficult at times. \"He had his life and that was that\", she tells Tony Palmer in the documentary \"O\u00a0Fortuna\". Their relationship became especially strained in the late 1940s; they reconciled around the early 1970s.\nDeath.\nOrff died of cancer in Munich on 29 March 1982, at the age of 86. He is buried in the Andechs Abbey. His tombstone bears the Latin inscription (the Ultimate End), taken from the end of his last work, .\nWorks.\n\"Carmina Burana\".\nOrff is best known for \"Carmina Burana\" (1936), a \"scenic cantata\". It is the first part of a trilogy that also includes \"Catulli Carmina\" and \"Trionfo di Afrodite\". \"Carmina Burana\" reflects his interest in medieval German poetry. The trilogy as a whole is called \"Trionfi\", or \"Triumphs\". The work is based on thirteenth-century poetry found in a manuscript dubbed the \"Codex latinus monacensis\" found in the Benedictine monastery of Benediktbeuern in 1803 and written by the Goliards; this collection is also known as \"Carmina Burana\". While \"modern\" in some of his compositional techniques, Orff was able to capture the spirit of the medieval period in this trilogy. The medieval poems, written in Latin and an early form of German, are a lament about the cruel indifference of fate (the brief opening and closing sections of Orff's work are titled \"Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi\", i.e., \"Fortune, Ruler of the World\"). The chorus that opens and concludes \"Carmina Burana\", \"O Fortuna\", is often used to denote primal forces, for example in the Oliver Stone film \"The Doors\". The work's association with fascism also led Pier Paolo Pasolini to use the movement \"Veris leta facies\" to accompany the concluding scenes of torture and murder in his final film \"Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom\". Pasolini was concerned with the question of art being appropriated by power when he made the film, which has relevance to Orff's situation.\nRelationship to pre-\"Carmina Burana\" works.\nOrff often said that, following a dress rehearsal for \"Carmina Burana\", he told his publisher the following: \"Everything that I have written up until now and that you, unfortunately, have printed you now can pulp. With \"Carmina Burana\" begins my collected works.\" Michael H. Kater has called this statement into question, citing a lack of documentary evidence and the continuation of performances of Orff's previous works after the premiere of \"Carmina Burana\", although in fact most of these performances used revised versions. Orff eventually qualified his oft-repeated statement: \"So I had said this thoughtlessly, con leggerezza [i.e. \"lightly\"]: a remark that, as I well knew, was true and also not true. I only wanted to accentuate with it the meaning that the \"Carmina Burana\" held in my creations up to that point, as was clear to me myself.\" When asked about the quotation in 1975, Orff replied: \"For the first time I had done exactly what I wanted, and I also knew that I had treated it right. Really there is nothing more to say.\" Orff went on to revise many of his earlier works, and later in his career he reissued some of his pre-\"Carmina Burana\" compositions with minimal revisions. One of his final publications was a volume of songs he had composed between 1911 and 1920.\nAfter World War II.\nMost of Orff's later works \u2013 \"Antigonae\" (1949), \"Oedipus der Tyrann\" (\"Oedipus the Tyrant\", 1959), \"Prometheus desmotes\" (\"Prometheus Bound\", 1968), and (\"Play on the End of Times\", 1973) \u2013 were based on texts or topics from antiquity. They extend the language of \"Carmina Burana\" in interesting ways, but they are expensive to stage and (on Orff's own characterization) are not operas in the conventional sense. Live performances of them have been few, even in Germany.\nIn a letter dated 8 January 1947 to his student Heinrich Sutermeister, Orff called \"Die Bernauerin\" \"the last piece in the series of my earlier work; \"Antigonae\" starts a new phase.\" \"Antigonae\" is a setting of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin's translation of the play by Sophocles. Orff first became interested in this source material shortly after his trauma in World War I and began planning his work late in 1940. The premiere took place on 9 August 1949 at the Salzburg Festival. Orff followed \"Antigonae\" with \"Oedipus der Tyrann\", also using H\u00f6lderlin's translation of Sophocles's play, and \"Prometheus,\" using the original language of the Greek play attributed to Aeschylus. Their premieres took place in Stuttgart, respectively in 1959 and 1968, conducted by Ferdinand Leitner. All three of the Greek tragedies make no cuts or alterations to the texts.\nThe Greek tragedies are scored for highly unusual ensembles centered on large percussion ensembles, which include non-Western instruments and numerous mallet instruments (including lithophone), and several pianos (four in \"Prometheus\" and six in the other two); the traditional string section is dispensed with excepting nine contrabasses. They also have six flutes and six oboes (with various auxiliary doublings of piccolo, alto flute, and English horn), as well as trumpets (six in \"Antigonae\" and \"Prometheus\"; eight in \"Oedipus der Tyrann\", behind the scene). \"Oedipus der Tyrann\" and \"Prometheus\" also have six trombones and organ. All three works also have four harps; there is additionally mandolin in \"Oedipus der Tyrann\" and four tenor banjos in \"Prometheus\".\nFollowing the premiere of \"Prometheus\", Everett Helm wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Orff does not make things easy for either singers or audience. But the retention of the original text undoubtedly evoked a mood such as could not have been created by a modern language.\"Prometheus\" is not an opera in the usual sense. Like other works by Orff, it is music theater in which the music is part of, and subordinated to, the dramatic whole. The voices declaim almost constantly \u2013 either in spoken rhythm or in a kind of psalmodic recitative. Only occasionally (and most effectively) does the stark psalmody give way to melismas that recall the more florid passages of Gregorian chant. There is no semblance of arias or concerted numbers... Brief interludes in the orchestra have the character of interjections. There is no development, either musical or psychological. The huge blocks of sound produce a static, immobile form and atmosphere ... The makeup of the orchestra ... produces, hard, metallic sounds, mercilessly driven by primitive ostinato rhythms. The whole effect is elemental to a degree, but in no sense naive. Orff's stylized primitivism masks a high degree of sophistication.\nOrff's final work for the stage, \"De temporum fine comoedia\" (\"Play on the End of Times\"), had its premiere at the Salzburg Festival on 20 August 1973, performed by Herbert von Karajan and the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne and Chorus. It has a large cast and similar scoring to the Greek tragedies with some exceptions, notably clarinetists (all with E-flat clarinets) instead of oboists and the addition of contrabassoon, horns, and tuba. Thomas R\u00f6sch has called this work \"in many respects the summation of [Orff's] entire work.\" There is no evidence Orff considered writing another stage work after \"De temporum fine comoedia\", and in 1979 he told an interviewer he was certain it was the end (\"Schlu\u00df\") of his composition. In this highly personal work, Orff presented a mystery play, sung in Greek, German, and Latin, in which he summarized his view of the end of time. His philosophy draws from many religious traditions, primarily Origen's idea of apocatastasis. \"De temporum fine comoedia\" also makes numerous references to Orff's previous compositions, notably \"Die Bernauerin\". Around the time of the premiere, he said that his works are \"as with an onion: one layer follows the others.\" On the same occasion, he said of \"De temporum fine comoedia\": \"It is all a dream, only a fantasy. Pessimistic, optimistic, as anyone wants.\"\nPedagogic works.\nIn pedagogical circles he is probably best remembered for his \"Schulwerk\" (\"School Work\"). Originally a set of pieces composed and published for the \"G\u00fcntherschule\" (which had students ranging from 12 to 22), this title was also used for his books based on radio broadcasts in Bavaria in 1949. These pieces are collectively called \"Musik f\u00fcr Kinder\" (\"Music for Children\"), and also use the term \"Schulwerk\", and were written in collaboration with his former pupil, composer and educator Gunild Keetman (1904\u20131990), who actually wrote most of the settings and arrangements in the \"Musik f\u00fcr Kinder\" (\"Music for Children\") volumes.\nOrff's ideas were developed, together with Gunild Keetman, into a very innovative approach to music education for children, known as the Orff Schulwerk. The music is elemental and combines movement, singing, playing, and improvisation.\n\"Gassenhauer\", \"Hexeneinmaleins\", and \"Passion\", which Orff composed with Keetman, were used as theme music for Terrence Malick's film \"Badlands\" (1973).\nList of compositions.\nCarl Orff's publisher is Schott Music.\nI.

{"id": "57637", "revid": "46469420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57637", "title": "Richland, Washington", "text": "City in Washington, United States\nRichland () is a city in Benton County, Washington, United States. It is located in southeastern Washington at the confluence of the Yakima and the Columbia Rivers. As of the 2020 census, the city's population was 60,560. Along with the nearby cities of Pasco and Kennewick, Richland forms the Tri-Cities metropolitan area.\nThe townsite was established in 1905 and incorporated as Richland in 1910. The U.S. Army acquired the city and surrounding areas in 1943 for the establishment of the Hanford nuclear site, part of the Manhattan Project during World War II. Richland was transformed into a bedroom community for Hanford workers and grew to 25,000 residents by the end of the war. The city remained under control of Hanford contractors until it was re-incorporated as a city in 1958.\nHistory.\nFor centuries, the village of Chemna stood at the mouth of the current Yakima River. Today that village site is called Columbia Point. From this village, the indigenous Wanapum, Yakama and Walla Walla peoples harvested the salmon runs entering the Yakima River. Captain William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition visited the mouth of the Yakima River on October 17, 1805.\nFormative years.\nIn 1904\u20131905, W.R. Amon and his son Howard purchased and proposed a town site on the north bank of the Yakima River. Postal authorities approved the designation of this town site as Richland in 1905, naming it for Nelson Rich, a state legislator and land developer. In 1906, the town was registered at the Benton County Courthouse. It was incorporated on April 28, 1910, as a fourth-class city.\nPopulation growth in Richland accelerated following the opening of a permanent bridge over the Yakima River in 1907 and a highway to Kennewick in 1926. A cable ferry to Pasco operated across the Columbia River from 1894 to 1931, when it was replaced by a modern bridge.\nWorld War II.\nRichland was a small farm town until the U.S. Army purchased of land \u2013 over half the size of Rhode Island \u2013 along the Columbia River during World War II for the Manhattan Project. On March 6, 1943, over 300 residents of Richland as well as those of the now vanished towns of White Bluffs and Hanford just upriver were evicted after a federal court order had condemned their properties for wartime use.\nThe army transformed Richland into a bedroom community for the workers on its Manhattan Project facility at the nearby Hanford Engineering Works (now the Hanford site). The population increased from 300 in July and August 1943 to 25,000 by the end of World War II in August 1945. All land and buildings were owned by the government. Housing was assigned to residents, and token rent was collected; families were assigned to houses or duplexes; single people were placed in apartments or barracks. Everything necessary was provided, from free bus service to light bulbs, and trees were planted in people's yards by the government. Much of the city was planned by Spokane architect Gustav Albin Pherson and overseen by the Army Corps of Engineers. While there were dormitories and barracks built at the time, prefabricated duplexes and single-family homes are all that survive today. Because homes were allocated based on family size and need, there were a number of floorplans available. These were each identified by a letter of the alphabet, and so came to be known as alphabet houses.\nRichland's link to the Army Engineers is suggested by its street nomenclature; many of the streets are named after famous engineers. The main street (George Washington Way) is named after the first president, who was a surveyor; Stevens Drive is named after John Frank Stevens, chief engineer of the Panama Canal and Stevens Pass; Goethals Drive is named after George W. Goethals, designer of the Panama Canal; and Thayer Drive is named after Sylvanus Thayer, superintendent of West Point and later founder of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. The rule is that if alphabet houses reside on a given street, they are named after an engineer or a type of tree.\nCold War era.\nWith the end of the war, the Hanford workers' camp, originally located north of Richland at the old Hanford town site, was closed down. Although many of the workers moved away as the war effort wound down, some of them moved to Richland, offsetting the depopulation that might otherwise have occurred. Management of the Hanford site and Richland itself was transferred to General Electric.\nFears that the Soviet Union's intentions were aggressive set off the Cold War in 1947. The capacity to produce plutonium was increased beginning in 1947. When the Soviet Union developed and tested its first nuclear weapon in 1949, the U.S. nuclear program was reinvigorated. A second post-WWII expansion began in 1950 due to the war in Korea. Richland's Cold War construction boom resulted in Richland's population growing to 27,000 people by 1952. Many of these people lived in a construction camp of trailers located in what is now north Richland. With time, these trailers were vacated and the core city grew. Others lived at Camp Columbia near Horn Rapids until the camp was closed in 1950. In 2005 several dozen houses built in the northern part of the core city during this boom were added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Gold Coast Historic District.\nTransition to private property.\nIn 1954, Harold Orlando Monson was elected the first mayor of Richland and traveled to Washington, D.C., to negotiate increased rights (such as private home ownership) for citizens in military cities across the country. The U.S. Congress passed a law the following year to mandate the transfer of Richland and Oak Ridge to local control within five years, spurring a new incorporation attempt. The federal government relinquished its land holdings in 1957 and sold the city's real estate to residents; the last home was sold on May 16, 1960. Most of the people lived in duplexes; senior tenants were given the option to purchase the building; junior tenants were given the option to purchase lots in a newly platted area of north Richland.\nRichland was re-incorporated as a chartered first-class city on December 10, 1958, five months after residents voted in favor of self-governance as a city. Among the first additions to the new city was an expanded public library, which had been built by General Electric out of a Quonset hut. As part of the transition, large areas of undeveloped land became city property. Richland's financial dependency on the federal Hanford facility changed little at this time because Hanford's mission as a weapons materials production site continued during the Cold War years.\nAfter the production boom.\nWith the shutdown of the last production reactor in 1987, the area transitioned to environmental cleanup and technology.

As of 2022,[ [update]] the city center had a population of 1,029,110 while its metropolitan area, Greater Santo Domingo, had a population of 4,274,651. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional (D.N.), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.\nSanto Domingo was founded in 1496 by the Spanish Empire and is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas. It was the first seat of Spanish colonial rule in the New World, the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo (), from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.\nSanto Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the vast majority of the country's industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger- and freight traffic.\nHistory.\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Ta\u00edno people populated the island which they called \"Kiskeya\" (mother of all lands) and \"Ayiti\" (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by \"caciques\" (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\nDating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after La Isabela, an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \"Santo Domingo\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \"Gateway to the Caribbean\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le\u00f3n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar's colonization of Cuba, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.\nIn June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nDiego Columbus, Christopher Columbus's son, arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas V\u00e1zquez de Ayll\u00f3n appointed as judges of appeal. In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos. Diego de Medrano, from Soria, was appointed royal treasurer of Santo Domingo. Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named \"repartidor de indios\" and soon named \"visitadores\" to enforce the laws.\nThe first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1521, when enslaved Africans led an uprising on Diego Colombus's sugar plantation. In 1586, the privateer Sir Francis Drake captured the city and held it for ransom. A report which reached the English government in May 1586 states that from Santo Domingo he took away 1,200 Englishmen, Frenchmen, Flemings, and \"Provincials out of prison, besides 800 of the countrey people\". Drake's successful capture signaled the decline of Spain's dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by Spanish policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but the English force was repulsed by a smaller force of local militias and Santo Domingo suffered only 25 dead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. During the 18th century, privateers from Santo Domingo patrolled the Caribbean, capturing numerous enemy merchantment.\nFrom 1795 to 1822, the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, endured a failed invasion from Haiti in 1805, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821, Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the Republic of Spanish Haiti after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led by Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was annexed by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.\nOn 27 February 1844, Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them. Dominican victory in these engagements thwarted the advance of the Haitian army towards Santo Domingo during the Dominican War of Independence.\nIn 1861, Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the Bourbon Queen Isabella II withdrew her soldiers from the island.\nOver the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two U.S. invasions in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, Harry Shepard Knapp. U.S. Marines and Dominicans clashed in Santo Domingo on 24\u201325 October 1916, resulting in the deaths of two U.S. Marines and three Dominicans.\nThe city was struck by hurricane San Zen\u00f3n in 1930, which caused major damage and killed up to 8,000 people. After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo due to the personality cult imposed by dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was once again renamed to Santo Domingo.\nIn 1962, Juan Bosch was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a civil war in the capital. Francisco Caama\u00f1o led the \"Constitucionalistas\" fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting in the streets of Santo Domingo against the \"Constitucionalistas\" on 15 and 16 June. Newsweek described it this way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Amid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the 82nd U.S. Airborne Division blasted their way four city blocks into Caama\u00f1o's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.\nEventually, the fighting would end on 31 August 1965, with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead.\nThe year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of the Americas. The Columbus Lighthouse\u00a0\u2013 Faro a Col\u00f3n\u00a0\u2013 was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.\nGeography.\nSanto Domingo is located on the southern coast of the island of Hispaniola, along the Caribbean Sea, and is the capital of the Dominican Republic. The city sits at the mouth of the Ozama River, which divides it into eastern and western sections, with the historic Colonial Zone on the west side. Its geography is characterized by a coastal plain with flat to gently rolling terrain, and the surrounding region includes some low limestone hills. The city has a tropical climate, marked by high humidity and warm temperatures year-round, with a rainy season from May to November. Its coastal location and natural harbor have historically made it an important port and commercial hub in the Caribbean.\nThe Ozama River flows before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.\nClimate.\nThe average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a borderline tropical rainforest (K\u00f6ppen \"Af\")/tropical monsoon climate (\"Am\"), as its driest month is very close to . However, the city seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with warm days with less humidity and cool nights (temperatures of ). July through September are the hottest. Santo Domingo averages of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April; however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months.\nLike many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. Hurricane Georges caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is on 29 May 2002.\nCityscape.\nArchitecture.\nMany of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the R\u00edo Ozama, also has a collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages. The Church and Convent of los Dominicos is the oldest Catholic building in continuous use in the Americas, and was the headquarters of the first university in the Americas.\nThe city's most important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa Mar\u00eda La Menor, the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Col\u00f3n, a son of Christopher Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, is one of the surviving sections of the Walls of Santo Domingo, which is the oldest military construction of European origin in the Americas; the Pant\u00e9on Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican Convent, the first convent in the Americas.\nOn the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The Alc\u00e1zar de Col\u00f3n, having once been the colonial palace of the Columbus family \u2013 beginning with his son Diego \u2013 is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.\nA 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Souc\u00ed Ports S.A.\nNeighborhoods.\nThe city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighborhoods) called \"sectores\" which could be considered as small urban towns. All \"sectores\" are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office.\nSector regions:\nGovernment and politics.\nSanto Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.\nThe city is administered by the \"Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional\" (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions.

This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.\nThe city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.\nSanto Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city.

It is the most extensive metro in the Caribbean and Central American region by total length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez and Hermanas Mirabal Avenue. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario Corridor in the city from west to east. As of August 2013, the metro consists of these two lines. Four more lines are planned to be constructed in the near future, for a total of six. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012. According to government figures more than 300,000 people ride the 31 kilometer system on a daily basis.\nIn 2018, a 5-kilometer Telef\u00e9rico de Santo Domingo (aerial cable car) was opened to provide service to the poorest areas in the east and north of the metropolitan area, and serve as a feeder for the metro. The cable car is used by more than 12,000 people daily.\nSanto Domingo is served by two airports. Aeropuerto Internacional La Isabela, an early 21st century-constructed airport located in the northern section of the city, within kilometers of the city center. It served mostly domestic and charter flight but now has several international flights. The major international airport that serves the city is Santo Domingo Las Americas, which serves North, Central and South America and also Europe.\nThe Port of Santo Domingo is located on the Ozama River. Its location at the center of the Caribbean is well suited for flexible itinerary planning and has excellent support, road and airport infrastructure within the Santo Domingo region, which facilitate access and transfers. The port is suitable for both turnaround and transit calls.\nThe port's renovation is part of a major redevelopment project, aimed at integrating the port area and the Zona Colonial and foster a cruise, yacht, and high-end tourism destination. Supported by legislation approved in 2005, the project, developed by the Sans Souci Group, also includes the development of a new sports marina and a mixed-leisure real estate development adjacent to the port.\nSanto Domingo is the terminus for four of the five national highways. The city is connected to the southwest of the country by the national highway DR-2 (Avenida George Washington and Autopista 30 de Mayo), and with the cities of the country's northwest by DR-1 (Expreso Kennedy, Corredor Duarte), which serves as a direct link to the city of Santiago de los Caballeros. DR-3 (Expreso 27 de Febrero/Autopista de Las Am\u00e9ricas) connects Santo Domingo directly to the east of the country, including the cities of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds, La Romana, and major tourist sites such as Punta Cana and B\u00e1varo, and to the Saman\u00e1 Province (in the northeast) via the Samana Highway. In the city, \"motoconchos\" (motorcycle taxis), \"guaguas\"/\"voladoras\" (low quality public buses), and \"carros p\u00fablicos\"/\"conchos\" (shared taxis) are common modes of transport. The Santo Domingo Metro is the highest quality in the region of the Caribbean and Central America. It is composed of 2 lines that cross the city.\nMain avenues.\nExpreso John F.

The country is located in Central America and bounded to the north and west by Mexico, to the east by Belize and by the Gulf of Honduras, to the east by Honduras, to the southeast by El Salvador, and to the south by the Pacific Ocean. Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing the country into three major regions: the highlands, where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains; and the limestone plateau of the Pet\u00e9n region, north of the mountains. These areas vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot and humid tropical lowlands and highland peaks and valleys.\nRegions.\nThe southern edge of the western highlands is marked by the Sierra Madre, which stretches from the Mexican border south and east, and continues at lower elevations toward El Salvador. The mountain chain is characterised by steep volcanic cones, including Tajumulco Volcano , the highest point in the country and Central America. All of Guatemala's 37 volcanoes (3 of them active: Pacaya, Santiaguito and Fuego), are in this mountain chain, and are abundant in the highlands.\nThe northern chain of mountains begins near the Mexican border with the Cuchumatanes range, then stretches east through the Chuac\u00fas and Cham\u00e1 sierras, down to the Santa Cruz and Minas sierras, near the Caribbean Sea. The northern and southern mountains are separated by the Motagua valley, where the Motagua river and its tributaries drains from the highlands into the Caribbean being navigable in its lower end, where it forms the boundary with Honduras.\nThe rivers are short and shallow in the Pacific vertient, larger and deeper, such as the Polochic which drains in Lake Izabal, R\u00edo Dulce, Motagua and Sarst\u00fan that forms the boundary with Belize in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico vertient (Usumacinta, which forms the boundary between Chiapas, Mexico and Pet\u00e9n and its tributaries such as La Pasi\u00f3n and San Pedro.\nMost of the major cities are located in the Highlands. Major cities are the capital Guatemala City, elevation 1,500 m (Central Highlands), Antigua Guatemala, elevation 1,530 m (Central Highlands), Quetzaltenango elevation 2,350 m (Western Highlands) and Puerto Barrios on the Caribbean coast. The largest lake Lago de Izabal (589.6\u00a0km2), is close to the Caribbean coast.

It is more temperate in the highlands, to freezing cold at the high of the Cuchumatanes range, and hot/drier in the easternmost departments.\nGuatemala's location on the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean makes it a target for hurricanes, including Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and Hurricane Stan in October 2005, which killed more than 1,500 people.

{"id": "57641", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57641", "title": "History of Namibia", "text": " \nThe history of Namibia has passed through several distinct stages from being colonised in the late nineteenth century to Namibia's independence on 21 March 1990.\nFrom 1884, Namibia was a German colony: German South West Africa. After the First World War, the League of Nations gave South Africa a mandate to administer the territory. Following World War II, the League of Nations was dissolved in April 1946 and its successor, the United Nations, instituted a trusteeship system to reform the administration of the former League of Nations mandates and clearly establish majority rule and independence as eventual goals for the trust territories. South Africa objected arguing that a majority of the territory's people were content with South African rule.\nLegal argument ensued over the course of the next twenty years until, in October 1966, the UN General Assembly decided to end the mandate, declaring that South Africa had no further right to administer the territory, and that henceforth South West Africa was to come under the direct responsibility of the UN (Resolution 2145 XXI of 27 October 1966).\nPre-colonial history.\nAs early as 25 000 B.C., the first humans lived in the Huns Mountains in the South of Namibia. The painted stone plates that exist from that time not only prove that these settlements existed, they also belong among the oldest works of art in the world. A fragment of a hominoid jaw, estimated to be thirteen million years old, was found in the Otavi Mountains. Findings of Stone Age weapons and tools are further proof that a long time ago early humans already hunted the wild animals of the region.\nIn the Brandberg Mountains, there are numerous rock paintings, most of them originating from around 2000 B.C. There is no reliable indication as to which ethnic groups created them. It is debatable whether the San (Bushmen), who alongside the Damara are the oldest ethnic group in Namibia, were the creators of these paintings.\nThe Nama only settled in southern Africa and southern Namibia during the first century B.C. In contrast to the San and Damara, they lived on the livestock they bred themselves.\nThe north \u2013 the Ovambo and Kavango.\nThe Ovambo, and the smaller and closely related group Kavango, lived in northern Namibia, southern Angola and, in the case of the Kavango, western Zambia. Being settled people they had an economy based on farming, cattle and fishing, but they also produced metal goods. Both groups belonged to the Bantu nation. They rarely ventured south to the central parts of the country, since the conditions there did not suit their farming way of life, but they extensively traded their knives and agricultural implements.\nBantu Migration \u2013 the Herero.\nDuring the 17th century the Herero, a pastoral, nomadic people keeping cattle, moved into Namibia. They came from the east African lakes and entered Namibia from the northwest. First they resided in Kaokoland, but in the middle of the 19th century some tribes moved farther south and into Damaraland. A number of tribes remained in Kaokoland: these were the Himba people, who are still there today. During German occupation of South West Africa about one third of the population was wiped out in a genocide that continues to provoke widespread indignation. An apology was sought in more recent times.\nThe Oorlams.\nIn the 19th century white farmers, mostly Boers, moved further north, pushing the indigenous Khoisan peoples, who put up a fierce resistance, across the Orange River. Known as Oorlams, these Khoisan adopted Boer customs and spoke a language similar to Afrikaans.\nArmed with guns, the Oorlams caused instability as more and more came to settle in Namaqualand and eventually conflict arose between them and the Nama. Under the leadership of Jonker Afrikaner, the Oorlams used their superior weapons to take control of the best grazing land. In the 1830s Jonker Afrikaner concluded an agreement with the Nama chief Oaseb whereby the Oorlams would protect the central grasslands of Namibia from the Herero who were then pushing south. In return Jonker Afrikaner was recognised as overlord, received tribute from the Nama, and settled at what today is Windhoek, on the borders of Herero territory. The Afrikaners soon came in conflict with the Herero who entered Damaraland from the south at about the same time as the Afrikaner started to expand farther north from Namaqualand. Both the Herero and the Afrikaner wanted to use the grasslands of Damaraland for their herds. This resulted in warfare between the Herero and the Oorlams as well as between the two of them and the Damara, who were the original inhabitants of the area. The Damara were displaced by the fighting and many were killed.\nWith their horses and guns, the Afrikaners proved to be militarily superior and forced the Herero to give them cattle as tribute.\nBaster immigration.\nThe last group of people today considered indigenous that arrived in Namibia were the Basters; descendants of Boer men and African women (mostly Khoisan). Being Calvinist and Afrikaans-speaking, they considered themselves to be culturally more \"white\" than \"black\". As with the Oorlams, they were forced northwards by the expansion of white settlers when, in 1868, a group of about 90 families crossed the Orange River into Namibia.\nThe Basters settled in central Namibia, where they founded the city Rehoboth. In 1872 they founded the \"Free Republic of Rehoboth\" and adopted a constitution stating that the nation should be led by a \"Kaptein\" directly elected by the people, and that there should be a small parliament, or Volkraad, consisting of three directly elected citizens.\nEuropean influence and colonization.\nThe first European to set foot on Namibian soil was the Portuguese Diogo C\u00e3o in 1485, who stopped briefly on the Skeleton Coast, and raised a limestone cross there, on his exploratory mission along the west coast of Africa. The next European to visit Namibia was also a Portuguese, Bartholomeu Dias, who stopped at what today is known as Walvis Bay and L\u00fcderitz (which he named Angra Pequena) on his way to round the Cape of Good Hope. The inhospitable Namib Desert constituted a formidable barrier and neither of the Portuguese explorers went far inland.\nThe area was vaguely regarded as Cafreria (\"the land of the kaffirs\") and similar terms over the next few centuries.\nIn 1793 the Dutch authority in the Cape decided to take control of Walvis Bay, since it was the only good deep-water harbour along the Skeleton Coast. When the United Kingdom took control of the Cape Colony in 1805, they also took over Walvis Bay. But colonial settlement in the area was limited, and neither the Dutch nor the British penetrated far into the country.\nOne of the first European groups to show interest in Namibia were the missionaries. In 1805 the London Missionary Society began working in Namibia, moving north from the Cape Colony. In 1811 they founded the town Bethanie in southern Namibia, where they built a church, which was long considered to be Namibia's oldest building, before the site at \u01c1Khauxa\u01c3nas which pre-dates European settlement was recognised.\nIn the 1840s the German Rhenish Mission Society started working in Namibia and co-operating with the London Missionary Society.\nIt was not until the 19th century, when European powers sought to carve up the African continent between them in the so-called \"Scramble for Africa\", that Europeans \u2013 Germany in the forefront \u2013 became interested in Namibia.\nThe first territorial claim on a part of Namibia came when Britain occupied Walvis Bay, confirming the settlement of 1797, and permitted the Cape Colony to annex it in 1878. The annexation was an attempt to forestall German ambitions in the area, and it also guaranteed control of the good deepwater harbour on the way to the Cape Colony and other British colonies on Africa's east coast.\nIn 1883, a German trader, Adolf L\u00fcderitz, bought Angra Pequena from the Nama chief Josef Frederiks II. The price he paid was 10,000 marks (\u2133) and 260 guns.\nHe soon renamed the coastal area after himself, giving it the name L\u00fcderitz. Believing that Britain was soon about to declare the whole area a protectorate, L\u00fcderitz advised the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck to claim it. In 1884 Bismarck did so, thereby establishing German South West Africa as a colony (Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika in German).\nA region, the Caprivi Strip, became a part of German South West Africa after the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty on 1 July 1890, between the United Kingdom and Germany. The Caprivi Strip in Namibia gave Germany access to the Zambezi River and thereby to German colonies in East Africa. In exchange for the island of Heligoland in the North Sea, Britain assumed control of the island of Zanzibar in East Africa.\nGerman South West Africa.\nSoon after declaring L\u00fcderitz and a vast area along the Atlantic coast a German protectorate, German troops were deployed as conflicts with the native tribes flared up, most significantly with the Nama. Under the leadership of the tribal chief Hendrik Witbooi, the Nama put up a fierce resistance to the German occupation. Contemporary media called the conflict \"The Hottentot Uprising\".\nThe Nama's resistance proved to be unsuccessful, however, and in 1894 Witbooi was forced to sign a \"protection treaty\" with the Germans. The treaty allowed the Nama to keep their arms, and Witbooi was released having given his word of honour not to continue with the Hottentot uprising.\nIn 1894 major Theodor Leutwein was appointed governor of German South West Africa. He tried without great success to apply the principle of \"colonialism without bloodshed\". The protection treaty did have the effect of stabilising the situation but pockets of rebellion persisted, and were put down by an elite German regiment Schutztruppe, while real peace was never achieved between the colonialists and the natives. The introduction of a veterinary pest-exclusion fence called the Red Line, which separated the north from the rest of the territory, led to more direct colonial rule south of the line and indirect control north of the line, leading to different political and economic outcomes for example between the northern Ovambo people compared to the more centrally located Herero people.\nBeing the only German colony in Africa considered suitable for white settlement at the time, Namibia attracted an influx of German settlers. In 1903 there were 3,700 Germans living in the area, and by 1910 their number had increased to 13,000. Another reason for German settlement was the discovery of diamonds in 1908. Diamond production continues to be a very important part of Namibia's economy.\nThe settlers were encouraged by the government to expropriate land from the natives, and forced labour \u2013 hard to distinguish from slavery \u2013 was used. As a result, relations between the German settlers and the natives deteriorated.\nThe Herero and Nama wars.\nThe ongoing local rebellions escalated in 1904 into the Herero and Nama Wars when the Herero attacked remote farms on the countryside, killing approximately 150 Germans.\nThe outbreak of rebellion was considered to be a result of Theodor Leutwein's softer tactics, and he was replaced by the more notorious General Lothar von Trotha.\nIn the beginning of the war the Herero, under the leadership of chief Samuel Maharero, had the upper hand. With good knowledge of the terrain they had little problem in defending themselves against the Schutztruppe (initially numbering only 766). Soon the Nama people joined the war, again under the leadership of Hendrik Witbooi.\nTo cope with the situation, Germany sent 14,000 additional troops who soon crushed the rebellion in the Battle of Waterberg in 1904. Earlier von Trotha issued an ultimatum to the Herero, denying them citizenship rights and ordering them to leave the country or be killed. To escape, the Herero retreated into the waterless Omaheke region, a western arm of the Kalahari Desert, where many of them died of thirst. The German forces guarded every water source and were given orders to shoot any adult male Herero on sight; later orders included killing all Herero and Nama, including children. Only a few of them managed to escape into neighbouring British territories. These tragic events, known as the \"Herero and Nama Genocide\", resulted in the death of between 24,000 and 65,000 Herero (estimated at 50% to 70% of the total Herero population) and 10,000 Nama (50% of the total Nama population). The genocide was characterized by widespread death by starvation and from consumption of well water which had been poisoned by the Germans in the Namib Desert.\nDescendants of Lothar von Trotha apologized to six chiefs of Herero royal houses for the actions of their ancestor on 7 October 2007.\nSouth African rule.\nIn 1915, during World War I, South Africa launched a military campaign and occupied the German colony of South West Africa.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nThe Odendaal Plan for dividing Namibia into bantustans \nIn February 1917, Mandume Ya Ndemufayo, the last king of the Kwanyama of Ovamboland, was killed in a joint attack by South African forces for resisting South African sovereignty over his people.\nOn 17 December 1920, South Africa undertook administration of South West Africa under the terms of Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and a Class C Mandate agreement by the League Council. The Class C mandate, supposed to be used for the least developed territories, gave South Africa full power of administration and legislation over the territory, but required that South Africa promote the material and moral well-being and social progress of the people.\nFollowing the League's supersession by the United Nations in 1946, South Africa refused to surrender its earlier mandate to be replaced by a United Nations Trusteeship agreement, requiring closer international monitoring of the territory's administration. Although the South African government wanted to incorporate South West Africa into its territory, it never officially did so, although it was administered as the \"de facto\" 'fifth province', with the white minority having representation in the whites-only Parliament of South Africa. In 1959, the colonial forces in Windhoek sought to remove black residents further away from the white area of town. The residents protested and the subsequent killing of eleven protesters spawned a major Namibian nationalist following and the formation of united black opposition to South African rule.\nDuring the 1960s, as the European powers granted independence to their colonies and trust territories in Africa, pressure mounted on South Africa to do so in Namibia, which was then South West Africa. On the dismissal (1966) by the International Court of Justice of a complaint brought by Ethiopia and Liberia against South Africa's continued presence in the territory, the U.N. General Assembly revoked South Africa's mandate. Under the growing international pressure to legitimize its annexation of Namibia, South Africa established in 1962 the \u2018Commission of Enquiry into South West Africa Affairs\u2019, better known as the Odendaal commission, named after Frans Hendrik Odendaal, who headed the commission. Its goal was to introduce South African racist homeland politics in Namibia, while at the same time present the occupation as a progressive and scientific way to develop and support the people in Namibia.\nNamibian struggle for independence.\nIn 1966, South West Africa People's Organisation's (SWAPO) military wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) began guerrilla attacks on South African forces, infiltrating the territory from bases in Zambia. The first attack of this kind was the battle at Omugulugwombashe on 26 August. After Angola became independent in 1975, SWAPO established bases in the southern part of the country. Hostilities intensified over the years, especially in Ovamboland.\nIn a 1971 advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice upheld UN authority over Namibia, determining that the South African presence in Namibia was illegal and that South Africa therefore was obliged to withdraw its administration from Namibia immediately. The Court also advised UN member states to refrain from implying legal recognition or assistance to the South African presence.\nThe summer 1971-72 saw a general strike of 25% of the entire working population of contract workers (13,000 people), starting in Windhoek and Walvis Bay and soon spreading to Tsumeb and other mines. In response to the contract system, which has been characterized close to slavery, and in support of Namibian independence.\nIn 1975, South Africa sponsored the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference, which sought an \"internal settlement\" to Namibia. Excluding SWAPO, the conference mainly included bantustan leaders as well as white Namibian political parties.\nInternational pressure.\nIn 1977, the Western Contact Group (WCG) was formed including Canada, France, West Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They launched a joint diplomatic effort to bring an internationally acceptable transition to independence for Namibia. The WCG's efforts led to the presentation in 1978 of Security Council Resolution 435 for settling the Namibian problem. The \"settlement proposal\", as it became known, was worked out after lengthy consultations with South Africa, the front-line states (Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), SWAPO, UN officials, and the Western Contact Group. It called for the holding of elections in Namibia under UN supervision and control, the cessation of all hostile acts by all parties, and restrictions on the activities of South African and Namibian military, paramilitary, and police.\nSouth Africa agreed to cooperate in achieving the implementation of Resolution 435. Nonetheless, in December 1978, in defiance of the UN proposal, it unilaterally held elections, which were boycotted by SWAPO and a few other political parties. South Africa continued to administer Namibia through its installed multiracial coalitions and an appointed Administrator-General. Negotiations after 1978 focused on issues such as supervision of elections connected with the implementation of the \"settlement proposal\".\nNegotiations and transition.\nIn the period, four UN Commissioners for Namibia were appointed. South Africa refused to recognize any of these United Nations appointees. Nevertheless, discussions proceeded with UN Commissioner for Namibia N\u00b02 Martti Ahtisaari who played a key role in getting the Constitutional Principles agreed in 1982 by the front-line states, SWAPO, and the Western Contact Group. This agreement created the framework for Namibia's democratic constitution. The US Government's role as mediator was both critical and disputed throughout the period, one example being the intense efforts in 1984 to obtain withdrawal of the South African Defence Force (SADF) from southern Angola. The so-called \"constructive engagement\" by US diplomatic interests was viewed negatively by those who supported internationally recognised independence, while to others US policy seemed to be aimed more towards restraining Soviet-Cuban influence in Angola and linking that to the issue of Namibian independence. In addition, US moves seemed to encourage the South Africans to delay independence by taking initiatives that would keep the Soviet-Cubans in Angola, such as dominating large tracts of southern Angola militarily while at the same time providing surrogate forces for the Angolan opposition movement, UNITA. From 1985 to 1989, a Transitional Government of National Unity, backed by South Africa and various ethnic political parties, tried unsuccessfully for recognition by the United Nations. Finally, in 1987 when prospects for Namibian independence seemed to be improving, the fourth UN Commissioner for Namibia Bernt Carlsson was appointed. Upon South Africa's relinquishing control of Namibia, Commissioner Carlsson's role would be to administer the country, formulate its framework constitution, and organize free and fair elections based upon a non-racial universal franchise.\nIn May 1988, a US mediation team \u2013 headed by Chester A. Crocker, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs \u2013 brought negotiators from Angola, Cuba, and South Africa, and observers from the Soviet Union together in London. Intense diplomatic activity characterized the next 7 months, as the parties worked out agreements to bring peace to the region and make possible the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 435 (UNSCR 435). At the Ronald Reagan/Mikhail Gorbachev summit in Moscow (29 May \u2013 1 June 1988) between leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union, it was decided that Cuban troops would be withdrawn from Angola, and Soviet military aid would cease, as soon as South Africa withdrew from Namibia. Agreements to give effect to these decisions were drawn up for signature in New York in December 1988. Cuba, South Africa, and the People's Republic of Angola agreed to a complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola. This agreement, known as the \"Brazzaville Protocol\", established a Joint Monitoring Commission (JMC) with the United States and the Soviet Union as observers. The Tripartite Accord, comprising a bilateral agreement between Cuba and Angola, and a tripartite agreement between Angola, Cuba and South Africa whereby South Africa agreed to hand control of Namibia to the United Nations, were signed at UN headquarters in New York City on 22 December 1988. (UN Commissioner N\u00b04 Bernt Carlsson was not present at the signing ceremony. He was killed on flight Pan Am 103 which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on 21 December 1988 \"en route\" from London to New York. South African foreign minister, Pik Botha, and an official delegation of 22 had a lucky escape. Their booking on Pan Am 103 was cancelled at the last minute and Pik Botha, together with a smaller delegation, caught the earlier Pan Am 101 flight to New York.)\nWithin a month of the signing of the New York Accords, South African president P. W. Botha suffered a mild stroke, which prevented him from attending a meeting with Namibian leaders on 20 January 1989. His place was taken by acting president J. Christiaan Heunis. Botha had fully recuperated by 1 April 1989 when implementation of UNSCR 435 officially started and the South African\u2013appointed Administrator-General, Louis Pienaar, began the territory's transition to independence. Former UN Commissioner N\u00b02 and now UN Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari arrived in Windhoek in April 1989 to head the UN Transition Assistance Group's (UNTAG) mission.\nThe transition got off to a shaky start. Contrary to SWAPO President Sam Nujoma's written assurances to the UN Secretary General to abide by a cease-fire and repatriate only unarmed Namibians, it was alleged that approximately 2,000 armed members of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), SWAPO's military wing, crossed the border from Angola in an apparent attempt to establish a military presence in northern Namibia. UNTAG's Martti Ahtisaari took advice from Margaret Thatcher, who was visiting Southern Africa at the time, and authorized a limited contingent of South African troops to assist the South West African Police in restoring order. A period of intense fighting followed, during which 375 PLAN fighters were killed. At a hastily arranged meeting of the Joint Monitoring Commission in Mount Etjo, a game park outside Otjiwarongo, it was agreed to confine the South African forces to base and return PLAN elements to Angola. While that problem was resolved, minor disturbances in the north continued throughout the transition period.\nIn October 1989, under orders of the UN Security Council, Pretoria was forced to demobilize some 1,600 members of Koevoet (Afrikaans for \"crowbar\"). The Koevoet issue had been one of the most difficult UNTAG faced. This counter-insurgency unit was formed by South Africa after the adoption of UNSCR 435, and was not, therefore, mentioned in the Settlement Proposal or related documents. The UN regarded Koevoet as a paramilitary unit which ought to be disbanded but the unit continued to deploy in the north in armoured and heavily armed convoys. In June 1989, the Special Representative told the Administrator-General that this behavior was totally inconsistent with the \"settlement proposal\", which required the police to be lightly armed. Moreover, the vast majority of the Koevoet personnel were quite unsuited for continued employment in the South West African Police (SWAPOL). The Security Council, in its resolution of 29 August, therefore demanded the disbanding of Koevoet and dismantling of its command structures. South African foreign minister, Pik Botha, announced on 28 September 1989 that 1,200 ex-Koevoet members would be demobilized with effect from the following day. A further 400 such personnel were demobilized on 30 October. These demobilizations were supervised by UNTAG military monitors.\nThe 11-month transition period ended relatively smoothly. Political prisoners were granted amnesty, discriminatory legislation was repealed, South Africa withdrew all its forces from Namibia, and some 42,000 refugees returned safely and voluntarily under the auspices of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Almost 98% of registered voters turned out to elect members of the Constituent Assembly. The elections were held in November 1989, overseen by foreign observers, and were certified as free and fair by the UN Special Representative, with SWAPO taking 57% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds necessary to have a free hand in revising the framework constitution that had been formulated not by UN Commissioner Bernt Carlsson but by the South African appointee Louis Pienaar. The opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance received 29% of the vote. The Constituent Assembly held its first meeting on 21 November 1989 and resolved unanimously to use the 1982 Constitutional Principles in Namibia's new constitution.\nIndependence.\nBy 9 February 1990, the Constituent Assembly had drafted and adopted a constitution. Independence Day on 21 March 1990, was attended by numerous international representatives, including the main players, the UN Secretary-General Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar and President of South Africa F W de Klerk, who jointly conferred formal independence on Namibia. United States Secretary of State James Baker arrived to Namibia on 19 March to join the celebration marking Namibia's independence.\nSam Nujoma was sworn in as the first President of Namibia watched by Nelson Mandela (who had been released from prison shortly beforehand) and representatives from 147 countries, including 20 heads of state.\nOn 1 March 1994, the coastal enclave of Walvis Bay and 12 offshore islands were transferred to Namibia by South Africa. This followed three years of bilateral negotiations between the two governments and the establishment of a transitional Joint Administrative Authority (JAA) in November 1992 to administer the territory. The peaceful resolution of this territorial dispute was praised by the international community, as it fulfilled the provisions of the UNSCR 432 (1978), which declared Walvis Bay to be an integral part of Namibia.\nIndependent Namibia.\nSince independence Namibia has successfully completed the transition from white minority apartheid rule to a democratic society. Multiparty democracy was introduced and has been maintained, with local, regional and national elections held regularly. Several registered political parties are active and represented in the National Assembly, although SWAPO Party has won every election since independence. The transition from the 15-year rule of President Sam Nujoma to his successor, Hifikepunye Pohamba in 2005 went smoothly.\nNamibian government has promoted a policy of national reconciliation and issued an amnesty for those who had fought on either side during the liberation war. The civil war in Angola had a limited impact on Namibians living in the north of the country. In 1998, Namibia Defence Force (NDF) troops were sent to the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of a Southern African Development Community (SADC) contingent. In August 1999, a secessionist attempt in the northeastern Caprivi region was successfully quashed.\nRe-election of Sam Nujoma.\nSam Nujoma won the presidential elections of 1994 with 76.34% of the votes. There was only one other candidate, Mishake Muyongo of the DTA.\nIn 1998, with one year until the scheduled presidential election when Sam Nujoma would not be allowed to participate in since he had already served the two terms that the constitution allows, SWAPO amended the constitution, allowing three terms instead of two. They were able to do this since SWAPO had a two-thirds majority in both the National Assembly of Namibia and the National Council, which is the minimum needed to amend the constitution.\nSam Nujoma was reelected as president in 1999, winning the election, that had a 62.1% turnout with 76.82%. Second was Ben Ulenga from the Congress of Democrats (COD), that won 10.49% of the votes.\nBen Ulenga is a former SWAPO member and Deputy Minister of Environment and Tourism, and High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.\nHe left SWAPO and became one of the founding members of COD in 1998, after clashing with his party on several questions. He did not approve of the amendment to the constitution, and criticised Namibia's involvement in Congo.\nNujoma was succeeded as President of Namibia by Hifikepunye Pohamba in 2005.\nLand reform.\nOne of SWAPO's policies, that had been formulated long before the party came into power, was land reform. Namibia's colonial and Apartheid past had resulted in a situation where about 20 percent of the population owned about 75 percent of all the land.\nLand was supposed to be redistributed mostly from the white minority to previously landless communities and ex-combatants. The land reform has been slow, mainly because Namibia's constitution only allows land to be bought from farmers willing to sell. Also, the price of land is very high in Namibia, which further complicates the matter. Squatting occurs when internal migrants move to the cities and live in informal settlements.\nPresident Sam Nujoma has been vocal in his support of Zimbabwe and its president Robert Mugabe. During the land crisis in Zimbabwe, where the government confiscated white farmers' land by force, fears rose among the white minority and the western world that the same method would be used in Namibia.\nInvolvement in conflicts in Angola and DRC.\nIn 1999 Namibia signed a mutual defence pact with its northern neighbour Angola.\nThis affected the Angolan Civil War that had been ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975. Both being leftist movements, SWAPO wanted to support the ruling party MPLA in Angola to fight the rebel movement UNITA, whose stronghold was in southern Angola. The defence pact allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking UNITA.\nThe Angolan civil war resulted in a large number of Angolan refugees coming to Namibia. At its peak in 2001 there were over 30,000 Angolan refugees in Namibia. The calmer situation in Angola has made it possible for many of them to return to their home with the help of UNHCR, and in 2004 only 12,600 remained in Namibia.\nMost of them reside in the refugee camp Osire north of Windhoek.\nNamibia also intervened in the Second Congo War, sending troops in support of the Democratic Republic of Congo's president Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila.\nThe Caprivi conflict.\nThe Caprivi conflict was an armed conflict between the Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA), a rebel group working for the secession of the Caprivi Strip, and the Namibian government. It started in 1994 and had its peak in the early hours of 2 August 1999 when CLA launched an attack in Katima Mulilo, the provincial capital of the Caprivi Region. Forces of the Namibian government struck back and arrested a number of alleged CLA supporters. The Caprivi conflict has led to the longest and largest trial in the history of Namibia, the Caprivi treason trial.\nAfter Sam Nujoma (2005-present).\nIn March 2005, Namibia's founding president Sam Nujoma stepped down after 15 years in power. He was succeeded by Hifikepunye Pohamba.\nIn December 2014, Prime Minister Hage Geingob, the candidate of ruling SWAPO, won the presidential elections, taking 87% of the vote. His predecessor, President Hifikepunye Pohamba, also of Swapo, had served the maximum two terms allowed by the constitution. In December 2019, President Hage Geingob was re-elected for a second term, taking 56.3% of the vote.\nOn 4 February 2024, President Hage Geingob died and he was immediately succeeded by vice-president Nangolo Mbumba as new President of Namibia.\nOn 21 March 2025, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah was sworn in as Namibia's first female president. She had won November's election with a 58% share of the vote as the candidate of the ruling South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nPre-colonisation history\nBaster history"}

{"id": "57644", "revid": "211905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57644", "title": "Sofia", "text": "Capital and largest city of Bulgaria\nSofia is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. It is situated in the Sofia Valley at the foot of the Vitosha mountain, in the western part of the country. The city is built west of the Iskar river and has many mineral springs, such as the Sofia Central Mineral Baths. It has a humid continental climate.\nKnown as Serdica in antiquity, Sofia has been an area of human habitation since at least 7000 BC. The recorded history of the city begins with the attestation of the conquest of Serdica by the Roman Republic in 29 BC from the Celtic tribe Serdi. During the decline of the Roman Empire, the city was raided by Huns, Visigoths, Avars, and Slavs. In 809, Serdica was incorporated into the First Bulgarian Empire by Khan Krum and became known as Sredets. In 1018, the Byzantines ended Bulgarian rule until 1194, when it was reincorporated by the Second Bulgarian Empire. Sredets became a major administrative, economic, cultural and literary hub until its conquest by the Ottomans in 1382. From 1530 to 1836, Sofia was the regional capital of Rumelia Eyalet, the Ottoman Empire's largest and most important province. Bulgarian rule was restored in 1878. Sofia was selected as the capital of the Third Bulgarian State in the next year, ushering a period of intense demographic and economic growth.\nSofia is the 14th-largest city in the European Union. It is surrounded by mountains such as Vitosha to the south, Lyulin to the west, and the Balkan Mountains to the north. It is the third highest European capital after Andorra la Vella and Madrid. Sofia is home to several universities, cultural institutions and commercial companies. The city has been described as the \"triangle of religious tolerance\". This is because three temples of three major world religions\u2014Christianity, Islam and Judaism\u2014are situated close together: Sveta Nedelya Church, Banya Bashi Mosque and Sofia Synagogue. This triangle was recently expanded to a \"square\" and includes the Catholic Cathedral of St Joseph.\nThe Boyana Church in Sofia, constructed during the Second Bulgarian Empire and holding much patrimonial symbolism to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, was included onto the World Heritage List in 1979. With its cultural significance in Southeast Europe, Sofia is home to the National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria, the National Palace of Culture, the Vasil Levski National Stadium, the Ivan Vazov National Theatre, the National Archaeological Museum, and the Serdica Amphitheatre. The Museum of Socialist Art includes many sculptures and posters that educate visitors about the lifestyle in communist Bulgaria.\nThe population of Sofia declined from 70,000 in the late 18th century, through 19,000 in 1870, to 11,649 in 1878, after which it began increasing. Sofia hosts some 1.28\u00a0million residents within a territory of 500\u00a0km2, a concentration of 17.9% of the country's population within the 200th percentile of the country's territory. The urban area of Sofia hosts some 1.5\u00a0million residents within 5723\u00a0km2, which comprises Sofia City Province and parts of Sofia Province (Dragoman, , , , Svoge, , , , Kostenets) and Pernik Province (, ), representing 5.16% of the country territory. The metropolitan area of Sofia is based upon one hour of car travel time, stretches internationally and includes Dimitrovgrad in Serbia. The metropolitan region of Sofia is inhabited by a population of 1.6\u00a0million.\nNames.\nFor a long time, the city possessed the name, Serdica (, \"Serdik\u0113\", or , \"Sardik\u0113\"; or ), derived from the tribe , who were either of Thracian, Celtic, or mixed Thracian-Celtic origin. The emperor Marcus Ulpius Traianus (53\u2013117 AD) gave the city the combinative name of \"Ulpia Serdica\"; Ulpia may be derived from an Umbrian cognate of the Latin word \"lupus\", meaning \"wolf\" or from the Latin \"vulpes\" (fox). It seems that the first written mention of \"Serdica\" was made during his reign and the last mention was in the 19th century in a Bulgarian text (, \"Sardaki\"). Other names given to Sofia, such as Serdonpolis (Byzantine , \"City of the Serdi\") and Triaditza (, \"Trinity\"), were mentioned by Byzantine Greek sources or coins. The Slavic name Sredets (), which is related to \"middle\" (, \"sreda\") and to the city's earliest name, first appeared on paper in an 11th-century text. The city was called \"Atralisa\" by the Arab traveller Idrisi and \"Strelisa\", \"Stralitsa\", or \"Stralitsion\" by the Crusaders.\nThe name \"Sofia\" comes from the Saint Sofia Church, as opposed to the prevailing Slavic origin of Bulgarian cities and towns. The origin is in the Greek word \"soph\u00eda\" (, \"wisdom\"). The earliest works where this latest name is registered are the duplicate of the Gospel of Serdica, in a dialogue between two salesmen from Dubrovnik around 1359, in the 14th-century Vitosha Charter of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman and in a Ragusan merchant's notes of 1376. In these documents, the city is called \"Sofia\", but, at the same time, the region and the city's inhabitants are still called \"Sredecheski\" (, \"of Sredets\"), which continued until the 20th century. The Ottomans came to favour the name Sofya (). In 1879, there was a dispute about what the name of the new Bulgarian capital should be, when the citizens created a committee of famous people, insisting for the Slavic name. Gradually, a compromise arose, officialisation of \"Sofia\" for the nationwide institutions, while legitimating the title \"Sredets\" for the administrative and church institutions, before the latter was abandoned through the years.\nGeography.\nSofia City Province has an area of 1344\u00a0km2, while the surrounding and much bigger Sofia Province is 7,059\u00a0km2. Sofia's development as a significant settlement owes much to its central position in the Balkans. It is situated in western Bulgaria, at the northern foot of the Vitosha mountain, in the Sofia Valley that is surrounded by the Balkan mountains to the north. The valley has an average altitude of . Sofia is the second highest capital of the European Union (after Madrid) and the third highest capital of Europe (after Andorra la Vella and Madrid). Unlike most European capitals, Sofia does not straddle any large river, but is surrounded by comparatively high mountains on all sides. Three mountain passes lead to the city, which have been key roads since antiquity, Vitosha being the watershed between Black and Aegean Seas.\nA number of shallow rivers cross the city, including the Boyanska, Vladayska and Perlovska. The Iskar River in its upper course flows near eastern Sofia. It takes its source in Rila, Bulgaria's highest mountain, and enters Sofia Valley near the village of German. The Iskar flows north toward the Balkan Mountains, passing between the eastern city suburbs, next to the main building and below the runways of Vasil Levski Sofia Airport, and flows out of the Sofia Valley at the town of Novi Iskar, where the scenic Iskar Gorge begins.\nThe city is known for its 49 mineral and thermal springs. Artificial and dam lakes were built in the twentieth century.\nWhile the 1818 and 1858 earthquakes were intense and destructive, the 2012 Pernik earthquake occurred west of Sofia with a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a much lower Mercalli intensity of VI (\"Strong\"). The 2014 Aegean Sea earthquake was also noticed in the city.\nClimate.\nSofia has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Dfb\"; \"Cfb\" if with \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm) with an average annual temperature of .\nWinters are relatively cold and snowy. In the coldest days temperatures can drop below , most notably in January. The lowest recorded temperature is (16 January 1893). On average, Sofia receives a total snowfall of and 56 days with snow cover. The snowiest recorded winter was 1939/1940 with a total snowfall of . The record snow depth is (25 December 2001). The coldest recorded year was 1893 with an average January temperature of and an annual temperature of .\nSummers are quite warm and sunny. In summer, the city generally remains slightly cooler than other parts of Bulgaria, due to its higher altitude. However, the city is also subject to heat waves with high temperatures reaching or exceeding on the hottest days, particularly in July and August. The highest recorded temperature is (5 July 2000). The hottest recorded month was July 2012 with an average temperature of . The warmest year on record was 2024 with an annual temperature of .\nSprings and autumns in Sofia are usually short with variable and dynamic weather.\nThe city receives an average precipitation of a year, reaching its peak in late spring and early summer when thunderstorms are common. The driest recorded year was 2000 with a total precipitation of , while the wettest year on record was 2014 with a total precipitation of .\nEnvironment.\nThe geographic position of the Sofia Valley limits the flow of air masses, increasing the chances of air pollution by particulate matter and nitrogen oxide. Solid fuel used for heating and motor vehicle traffic are significant sources of pollutants. Smog thus persists over the city as temperature inversions and the mountains surrounding the city prevent the circulation of air masses. As a result, air pollution levels in Sofia are some of the highest in Europe.\nParticulate matter concentrations are consistently above the norm. During the October 2017 \u2013 March 2018 heating season, particulate levels exceeded the norm on 70 occasions; on 7 January 2018, PM10 levels reached 632\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, some twelve times the EU norm of 50\u00a0\u03bcg/m3. Even areas with few sources of air pollution, like Gorna Banya, had PM2.5 and PM10 levels above safe thresholds. In response to hazardous spikes in air pollution, the Municipal Council implemented a variety of measures in January 2018, like more frequent washing of streets. However, a report by the European Court of Auditors issued in September 2018 revealed that Sofia has not drafted any projects to reduce air pollution from heating. The report also noted that no industrial pollution monitoring stations operate in Sofia, even though industrial facilities are active in the city. A monitoring station on Eagles' Bridge, where some of the highest particulate matter values were measured, was moved away from the location and has measured sharply lower values since then. Particulates are now largely measured by a network of 300 sensors maintained by volunteers since 2017. The European Commission has taken Bulgaria to court over its failure to curb air pollution.\nHistory.\nPrehistory and antiquity.\nThe area has a history of nearly 7,000 years, with the great attraction of the hot water springs that still flow abundantly in the centre of the city. The Neolithic village in Slatina dating to the 5th\u20136th millennium BC is documented. Another neolithic settlement was founded in the 3rd\u20134th millennium BC near the site of the modern National Art Gallery, which has been the traditional centre of the city ever since.\nThe earliest tribes who settled were the Thracian Tilataei. \nIn the 500s BC, the area became part of a Thracian state union, the Odrysian kingdom from another Thracian tribe the Odrysses.\nIn 339 BC Philip II of Macedon destroyed and ravaged the town for the first time.\nThe Celtic tribe Serdi gave their name to the city. The earliest mention of the city comes from an Athenian inscription from the 1st century BC, attesting \"Astiu ton Serdon\", i.e. city of the Serdi. According to the inscription and to the writings of Dio Cassius, the Roman general Crassus subdued the Serdi and behanded the captives.\nDio Cassius, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy say that in 27\u201329 BC Crassus attacked the region \"Segetike\", which is assumed to be Serdica, or the city of the Serdi. The ancient city is located between TZUM, Sheraton Hotel and the Presidency. It gradually became the most important Roman city of the region. It became a \"municipium\" during the reign of Emperor Trajan (98\u2013117). Serdica expanded, as turrets, protective walls, public baths, administrative and cult buildings, a civic basilica, an amphitheatre, a circus, the City council (Boul\u00e9), a large forum, a big circus (theatre), etc. were built. Serdica was a significant city on the Roman road Via Militaris, connecting Singidunum and Byzantium. In the 3rd century, it became the capital of Dacia Aureliana, and when Emperor Diocletian divided the province of Dacia Aureliana into Dacia Ripensis (at the banks of the Danube) and Dacia Mediterranea, Serdica became the capital of the latter. Serdica's citizens of Thracian descent were referred to as Illyrians probably because it was at some time the capital of Eastern Illyria (Second Illyria).\nRoman emperors Aurelian (215\u2013275) and Galerius (260\u2013311) were born in Serdica.\nThe city expanded and became a significant political and economical centre, more so as it became one of the first Roman cities where Christianity was recognised as an official religion (under Galerius). The Edict of Toleration by Galerius was issued in 311 in Serdica by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity. The Edict implicitly granted Christianity the status of \"religio licita\", a worship recognised and accepted by the Roman Empire. It was the first edict legalising Christianity, preceding the Edict of Milan by two years.\nSerdica was the capital of the Diocese of Dacia (337\u2013602).\nFor Constantine the Great it was 'Sardica mea Roma est' (Serdica is my Rome). He considered making Serdica the capital of the Byzantine Empire instead of Constantinople. which was already not dissimilar to a tetrarchic capital of the Roman Empire. In 343 AD, the Council of Sardica was held in the city, in a church located where the current 6th century Church of Saint Sophia was later built.\nThe city was destroyed in the 447 invasion of the Huns and laid in ruins for a century It was rebuilt by Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. During the reign of Justinian it flourished, being surrounded with great fortress walls whose remnants can still be seen today.\nMiddle Ages.\nSerdica became part of the First Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Khan Krum in 809, after a long siege. The fall of the strategic city prompted a major and ultimately disastrous invasion of Bulgaria by the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros I, which led to his demise at the hands of the Bulgarian army. In the aftermath of the war, the city was permanently integrated in Bulgaria and became known by the Slavic name of Sredets. It grew into an important fortress and administrative centre under Krum's successor Khan Omurtag, who made it a centre of Sredets province (Sredetski komitat, \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442). The Bulgarian patron saint John of Rila was buried in Sredets by orders of Emperor Peter I in the mid 10th century. After the conquest of the Bulgarian capital Preslav by Sviatoslav I of Kyiv and John I Tzimiskes' armies in 970\u2013971, the Bulgarian Patriarch Damyan chose Sredets for his seat in the next year and the capital of Bulgaria was temporarily moved there. In the second half of 10th century the city was ruled by Komit Nikola and his sons, known as the \"Komitopuli\". One of them was Samuil, who was eventually crowned Emperor of Bulgaria in 997. In 986, the Byzantine Emperor Basil II laid siege to Sredets but after 20 days of fruitless assaults the garrison broke out and forced the Byzantines to abandon the campaign. On his way to Constantinople, Basil II was ambushed and soundly defeated by the Bulgarians in the battle of the Gates of Trajan.\nThe city eventually fell to the Byzantine Empire in 1018, following the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria. Sredets joined the uprising of Peter Delyan in 1040\u20131041 in a failed attempt to restore Bulgarian independence and was the last stronghold of the rebels, led by the local commander Botko. During the 11th century many Pechenegs were settled down in Sofia region as Byzantine federats.\nIt was once again incorporated into the restored Bulgarian Empire in 1194 at the time of Emperor Ivan Asen I and became a major administrative and cultural centre. Several of the city's governors were members of the Bulgarian imperial family and held the title of \"sebastokrator\", the second highest at the time, after the tsar. Some known holders of the title were Kaloyan, Peter and their relative Aleksandar Asen (d. after 1232), a son of Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria (r.\u20091189\u00a0\u2013\u00a01196). In the 13th and 14th centuries Sredets was an important spiritual and literary hub with a cluster of 14 monasteries in its vicinity, that were eventually destroyed by the Ottomans. The city produced multicoloured sgraffito ceramics, jewellery and ironware.\nIn 1382/1383 or 1385, Sredets was seized by the Ottoman Empire in the course of the Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars by Lala \u015eahin Pasha, following a three-month siege. The Ottoman commander left the following description of the city garrison: \"Inside the fortress [Sofia] there is a large and elite army, its soldiers are heavily built, moustached and look war-hardened, but are used to consume wine and rakia\u2014in a word, jolly fellows.\"\nEarly modern history.\nFrom the 14th century till the 19th century Sofia was an important administrative center in the Ottoman Empire. It became the capital of the beylerbeylik of Rumelia (Rumelia Eyalet), the province that administered the Ottoman lands in Europe (the Balkans), one of the two together with the beylerbeylik of Anatolia. It was the capital of the important Sanjak of Sofia as well, including the whole of Thrace with Plovdiv and Edirne, and part of Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Skopje.\nDuring the initial stages of the Crusade of Varna in 1443, it was occupied by Hungarian forces for a short time in 1443, and the Bulgarian population celebrated a mass Saint Sofia Church. Following the defeat of the crusader forces in 1444, the city's Christians faced persecution. In 1530 Sofia became the capital of the Ottoman province (beylerbeylik) of Rumelia for about three centuries. During that time Sofia was the largest import-export-base in modern-day Bulgaria for the caravan trade with the Republic of Ragusa. In the 15th and 16th century, Sofia was expanded by Ottoman building activity. Public investments in infrastructure, education and local economy brought greater diversity to the city. Amongst others, the population consisted of Muslims, Bulgarian and Greek speaking Orthodox Christians, Armenians, Georgians, Catholic Ragusans, Jews (Romaniote, Ashkenazi and Sephardi), and Romani people. The 16th century was marked by a wave of persecutions against the Bulgarian Christians, a total of nine became New Martyrs in Sofia and were sainted by the Orthodox Church, including George the New (1515), Sophronius of Sofia (1515), George the Newest (1530), Nicholas of Sofia (1555) and Terapontius of Sofia (1555).\nWhen it comes to the cityscape, 16th century sources mention eight Friday mosques, three public libraries, numerous schools, 12 churches, three synagogues, and the largest bedesten (market) of the Balkans. Additionally, there were fountains and \"hammams\" (bathhouses). Most prominent churches such as Saint Sofia and Saint George were converted into mosques, and a number of new ones were constructed, including Banya Bashi Mosque built by the Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan. In total there were 11 big and over 100 small mosques by the 17th century. In 1610 the Vatican established the See of Sofia for Catholics of Rumelia, which existed until 1715 when most Catholics had emigrated. There was an important uprising against Ottoman rule in Sofia, Samokov and Western Bulgaria in 1737.\nSofia entered a period of economic and political decline in the 17th century, accelerated during the period of anarchy in the Ottoman Balkans of the late 18th and early 19th century, when local Ottoman warlords ravaged the countryside. 1831 Ottoman population statistics show that 42% of the Christians were non-taxpayers in the kaza of Sofia and the amount of middle-class and poor Christians were equal. Since the 18th century the \"beylerbeys\" of Rumelia often stayed in Bitola, which became the official capital of the province in 1826. Sofia remained the seat of a sanjak (district). By the 19th century the Bulgarian population had two schools and seven churches, contributing to the Bulgarian National Revival. In 1858 Nedelya Petkova created the first Bulgarian school for women in the city. In 1867 was inaugurated the first \"chitalishte\" in Sofia \u2013 a Bulgarian cultural institution. In 1870 the Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski established a revolutionary committee in the city and in the neighbouring villages. Following his capture in 1873, Vasil Levski was transferred and hanged in Sofia by the Ottomans.\nModern and contemporary history.\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378, Suleiman Pasha threatened to burn the city in defence, but the foreign diplomats Leandre Legay, Vito Positano, Rabbi Gabriel Almosnino and Josef Valdhart refused to leave the city thus saving it. Many Bulgarian residents of Sofia armed themselves and sided with the Russian forces. Sofia was relieved (see Battle of Sofia) from Ottoman rule by Russian forces under Gen. Iosif Gurko on 4 January 1878. It was proposed as a capital by Marin Drinov and was accepted as such on 3 April 1879. By the time of its liberation, the population of the city was 11,649.\nMost mosques in Sofia were destroyed in that war, seven of them destroyed in one night in December 1878 when a thunderstorm masked the noise of the explosions arranged by Russian military engineers. Following the war, the great majority of the Muslim population left Sofia.\nFor a few decades after the liberation, Sofia experienced large population growth, mainly by migration from other regions of the Principality (Kingdom since 1908) of Bulgaria, and from the still Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace.\nIn 1900, the first electric lightbulb in the city was turned on.\nIn the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria was fighting alone practically all of its neighbouring countries. When the Romanian Army entered Vrazhdebna in 1913, then a village from Sofia, now a suburb, this prompted the Tsardom of Bulgaria to capitulate. During the war, Sofia was overflown by the Romanian Air Corps, which engaged on photoreconnaissance operations and threw propaganda pamphlets to the city. Thus, Sofia became the first capital on the world to be overflown by enemy aircraft.\nDuring the Second World War, Bulgaria declared war on the US and UK on 13 December 1941 and in late 1943 and early 1944 the US and UK Air forces conducted bombings over Sofia. As a consequence of the bombings thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged including the Capital Library and thousands of books. In 1944 Sofia and the rest of Bulgaria was occupied by the Soviet Red Army and within days of the Soviet invasion Bulgaria declared war on Nazi Germany.\nIn 1945, the communist Fatherland Front took power. The transformations of Bulgaria into the People's Republic of Bulgaria in 1946 and into the Republic of Bulgaria in 1990 marked significant changes in the city's appearance. The population of Sofia expanded rapidly due to migration from rural regions. New residential areas were built in the outskirts of the city, like Druzhba, Mladost and Lyulin.\nDuring the Communist Party rule, a number of the city's most emblematic streets and squares were renamed for ideological reasons, with the original names restored after 1989.\nThe Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum, where Dimitrov's body had been preserved in a similar way to the Lenin mausoleum, was demolished in 1999.\nCityscape.\nIn Sofia there are 607,473 dwellings and 101,696 buildings. According to modern records, 39,551 dwellings were constructed until 1949, 119,943 between 1950 and 1969, 287,191 between 1970 and 1989, 57,916 in the 90s and 102,623 between 2000 and 2011. Until 1949, 13,114 buildings were constructed and between 10,000 and 20,000 in each following decade. Sofia's architecture combines a wide range of architectural styles, some of which are aesthetically incompatible. These vary from Christian Roman architecture and medieval Bulgarian fortresses to Neoclassicism and prefabricated Socialist-era apartment blocks, as well as newer glass buildings and international architecture. A number of ancient Roman, Byzantine and medieval Bulgarian buildings are preserved in the centre of the city. These include the 4th century Rotunda of St. George, the walls of the Serdica fortress and the partially preserved Amphitheatre of Serdica.\nAfter the Liberation War, knyaz Alexander Battenberg invited architects from Austria-Hungary to shape the new capital's architectural appearance.\nAmong the architects invited to work in Bulgaria were Friedrich Gr\u00fcnanger, Adolf V\u00e1clav Kol\u00e1\u0159, and Viktor Rumpelmayer, who designed the most important public buildings needed by the newly re-established Bulgarian government, as well as numerous houses for the country's elite. Later, many foreign-educated Bulgarian architects also contributed. The architecture of Sofia's centre is thus a combination of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Rococo, Neo-Renaissance and Neoclassicism, with the Vienna Secession also later playing an important part, but it is most typically Central European.\nAfter World War II and the establishment of a Communist government in Bulgaria in 1944, the architectural style was substantially altered. Stalinist Gothic public buildings emerged in the centre, notably the spacious government complex around The Largo, Vasil Levski Stadium, the Cyril and Methodius National Library and others. As the city grew outwards, the then-new neighbourhoods were dominated by many concrete tower blocks, prefabricated panel apartment buildings and examples of Brutalist architecture.\nAfter the abolition of Communism in 1989, Sofia witnessed the construction of whole business districts and neighbourhoods, as well as modern skyscraper-like glass-fronted office buildings, but also top-class residential neighbourhoods. The Capital Fort Business Centre is the first skyscraper in Bulgaria, with its 36 floors. However, the end of the old administration and centrally planned system also paved the way for chaotic and unrestrained construction, which continues today.\nGreen areas.\nThe city has an extensive green belt. Some of the neighbourhoods constructed after 2000 are densely built up and lack green spaces. There are four principal parks \u2013 Borisova gradina in the city centre and the \"Southern\", \"Western\" and \"Northern\" parks. Several smaller parks, among which the Vazrazhdane Park, Zaimov Park, City Garden and the Doctors' Garden, are located in central Sofia. The Vitosha Nature Park (the oldest national park in the Balkans) includes most of Vitosha mountain and covers an area of , with roughly half of it lying within the municipality of Sofia. Vitosha mountain is a popular hiking destination due to its proximity and ease of access via car and public transport. Two functioning cable cars provide year long access from the outskirts of the city. The mountain offers favourable skiing conditions during the winter. During the 1970s and the 1980s multiple ski slopes of varying difficulty were made available. Skiing equipment can be rented and skiing lessons are available. However, due to the bad communication between the private offshore company that runs the resort and Sofia municipality, most of the ski areas have been left to decay in the last 10 years, so that only one chairlift and one slope work.\nGovernment and law.\nLocal government.\nSofia Municipality is identical to Sofia City Province, which is distinct from Sofia Province, which surrounds but does not include the capital itself. Besides the city proper, the 24 districts of Sofia Municipality encompass three other towns and 34 villages. Districts and settlements have their own mayor who is elected in a popular election. The assembly members are chosen every four years. The common head of Sofia Municipality and all the 38 settlements is the mayor of Sofia. The mayor Vasil Terziev is serving his first term, having won the 2023 election as the nominee of the PP-DB coalition and the local Save Sofia party. After winning the first round of the election without receiving the majority of votes, Terziev entered a tight runoff against BSP candidate Vanya Grigorova, which he won with 175,044 votes, compared to Grigorova's 170,258.\nNational government.\nSofia is the seat of the executive (Council of Ministers), legislative (National Assembly) and judiciary (Supreme Court and Constitutional Court) bodies of Bulgaria, as well as all government agencies, ministries, the National Bank, and the delegation of the European Commission. The President, along with the Council of Ministers, is located on Independence Square, also known as The Largo or \"The Triangle of Power\". One of the three buildings in the architectural ensemble, the former Bulgarian Communist Party headquarters, is due to become the seat of the Parliament. A refurbishment project is due to be completed in mid-2019, while the old National Assembly building will become a museum or will only host ceremonial political events.\nUnder Bulgaria's centralised political system, Sofia concentrates much of the political and financial resources of the country. It is the only city in Bulgaria to host three electoral constituencies: the 23rd, 24th and 25th Multi-member Constituencies, which together field 42 mandates in the 240-member National Assembly.\nCrime.\nWith a murder rate of 1.7/per 100.000 people (as of 2009[ [update]]) Sofia is a relatively safe capital city. Nevertheless, in the 21st century, crimes, including Bulgarian mafia killings, caused problems in the city, where authorities had difficulties convicting the actors, which had caused the European Commission to warn the Bulgarian government that the country would not be able to join the EU unless it curbed crime (Bulgaria eventually joined in 2007). Many of the most severe crimes are contract killings that are connected to organised crime, but these had dropped in recent years after several arrests of gang members. Corruption in Bulgaria also affects Sofia's authorities. According to the director of Sofia District Police Directorate, the largest share of the crimes are thefts, making up 62.4% of all crimes in the capital city. Increasing are frauds, drug-related crimes, petty theft and vandalism. According to a survey, almost a third of Sofia's residents say that they never feel safe in the Bulgarian capital, while 20% always feel safe. As of 2015[ [update]], the consumer-reported perceived crime risk on the Numbeo database was \"high\" for theft and vandalism and \"low\" for violent crimes; safety while walking during daylight was rated \"very high\", and \"moderate\" during the night. With 1,600 prisoners, the incarceration rate is above 0.1%; however, roughly 70% of all prisoners are part of the Romani minority.\nCulture.\nArts and entertainment.\nSofia concentrates the majority of Bulgaria's leading performing arts troupes. Theatre is by far the most popular form of performing art, and theatrical venues are among the most visited, second only to cinemas. There were 3,162 theatric performances with 570,568 people attending in 2014. The Ivan Vazov National Theatre, which performs mainly classical plays and is situated in the very centre of the city, is the most prominent theatre. The National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria is a combined opera and ballet collective established in 1891. Regular performances began in 1909. Some of Bulgaria's most famous operatic singers, such as Nicolai Ghiaurov and Ghena Dimitrova, made their first appearances on the stage of the National Opera and Ballet.\nCinema is the most popular form of entertainment: there were more than 141,000 film shows with a total attendance exceeding 2,700,000 in 2014. Over the past two decades, numerous independent cinemas have closed and most shows are in shopping centre multiplexes. \"Odeon\" (not part of the Odeon Cinemas chain) shows exclusively European and independent American films, as well as 20th century classics. The Boyana Film studios was at the centre of a once-thriving domestic film industry, which declined significantly after 1990. Nu Image acquired the studios to upgrade them into Nu Boyana Film Studios, used to shoot scenes for a number of action movies like \"The Expendables 2\", \"\" and \"London Has Fallen\".\nBulgaria's largest art museums are located in the central areas of the city. Since 2015, the National Art Gallery, located in the former royal palace, the National Gallery for Foreign Art (NGFA) and the Museum of Contemporary Art \u2013 Sofia Arsenal were merged to form the National Gallery. Its largest branch is Kvadrat 500, located on the NFGA premises, where some 2,000 works are on display in twenty eight exhibition halls. The collections encompass diverse cultural items, from Ashanti Empire sculptures and Buddhist art to Dutch Golden Age painting, works by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Auguste Rodin. The crypt of the Alexander Nevsky cathedral is another branch of the National Gallery. It holds a collection of Eastern Orthodox icons from the 9th to the 19th century.\nThe National History Museum, located in Boyana, it has a vast collection of more than 650,000 historical items dating from Prehistory to the modern era, although only 10,000 of them are permanently displayed due to the lack of space. Smaller collections of historical items are displayed in the National Archaeological Museum, a former mosque located between the edifices of the National Bank and the Presidency. Two natural sciences museums\u2014the Natural History Museum and Earth and Man\u2014display minerals, animal species (alive and taxidermic) and rare materials. The Ethnographic Museum and the Museum of Military History hold large collections of Bulgarian folk costumes and armaments, respectively. The Polytechnical Museum has more than 1,000 technological items on display. The SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library, the foremost information repository in the country, holds some 1,800,000 books and more than 7,000,000 documents, manuscripts, maps and other items. \nThe city houses many cultural institutes such as the Russian Cultural Institute, the Polish Cultural Institute, the Hungarian Institute, the Czech and the Slovak Cultural Institutes, the Italian Cultural Institute, Confucius Institute, Institut Fran\u00e7ais, Goethe Institut, British Council and Instituto Cervantes which regularly organise temporary expositions of visual, sound and literary works by artists from their respective countries.\nSome of the biggest telecommunications companies, TV and radio stations, newspapers, magazines, and web portals are based in Sofia, including the Bulgarian National Television, bTV and Nova TV. Top-circulation newspapers include \"24 Chasa\" and \"Trud\".\nThe Boyana Church, a UNESCO World Heritage site, contains realistic frescoes, depicting more than 240 human images and a total 89 scenes, were painted. With their vital, humanistic realism they are a Renaissance phenomenon at its culmination phase in the context of the common-European art.\nTourism.\nSofia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Bulgaria alongside coastal and mountain resorts. Among its highlights is the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, one of the symbols of Bulgaria, constructed in the late 19th century. It occupies an area of and can hold 10,000 people.\nThe city center contains many remains of ancient Serdica that have been excavated and are on public display, including \"Complex Ancient Serdica\", eastern gate, western gate, city walls, thermal baths, 4th c. Rotunda of St. George, amphitheatre of Serdica, the tombs and basilicas under the basilica of St. Sophia.\nVitosha Boulevard, also called \"Vitoshka\", is a pedestrian zone with numerous caf\u00e9s, restaurants, fashion boutiques, and luxury goods stores. Sofia's geographic location, in the foothills of the weekend retreat Vitosha mountain, further adds to the city's specific atmosphere.\nSports.\nA large number of sports clubs are based in the city. During the Communist era, most sports clubs concentrated on all-round sporting development, therefore CSKA, Levski, Lokomotiv, and Slavia are dominant not only in football, but in many other team sports as well. Basketball and volleyball also have strong traditions in Sofia. A notable local basketball team is twice European Champions Cup finalist Lukoil Akademik. The Bulgarian Volleyball Federation is the world's second-oldest, and it was an exhibition tournament organised by the BVF in Sofia that convinced the International Olympic Committee to include volleyball as an olympic sport in 1957. Tennis is increasingly popular in the city. There are some ten tennis court complexes within the city including the one founded by former WTA top-five athlete Magdalena Maleeva.\nSofia applied to host the Winter Olympic Games in 1992 and in 1994, coming second and third respectively. The city was also an applicant for the 2014 Winter Olympics, but was not selected as candidate. In addition, Sofia hosted EuroBasket 1957 and the 1961 and 1977 Summer Universiades, as well as the 1983 and 1989 winter editions. In 2012, it hosted the FIVB World League finals.\nThe city is home to a number of large sports venues, including the 43,000-seat Vasil Levski National Stadium which hosts international football matches, as well as Balgarska Armia Stadium, Georgi Asparuhov Stadium and Lokomotiv Stadium, the main venues for outdoor musical concerts. Arena Sofia holds many indoor events and has a capacity of up to 19,000 people depending on its use. The venue was inaugurated on 30 July 2011, and the first event it hosted was a friendly volleyball match between Bulgaria and Serbia. There are two ice skating complexes\u00a0\u2014 the Winter Sports Palace with a capacity of 4,600 and the Slavia Winter Stadium with a capacity of 2,000, both containing two rinks each. A velodrome with 5,000 seats in the city's central park is undergoing renovation. There are also various other sports complexes in the city which belong to institutions other than football clubs, such as those of the National Sports Academy, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, or those of different universities. There are more than fifteen swimming complexes in the city, most of them outdoor. Nearly all of these were constructed as competition venues and therefore have seating facilities for several hundred people.\nThere are two golf courses just to the east of Sofia\u00a0\u2014 in Elin Pelin (St Sofia club) and in Ihtiman (Air Sofia club), and a horseriding club (St George club).\nSofia was designated as European Capital of Sport in 2018. The decision was announced in November 2014 by the Evaluation Committee of ACES Europe, on the grounds that \"the city is a good example of sport for all, as means to improve healthy lifestyle, integration and education, which are the basis of the initiative\".\nDemographics.\nPopulation over the years (in thousands):&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to 2018 data, the city has a population of 1,400,384 and the whole Sofia Capital Municipality of 1,500,120. The first census carried out in February 1878 by the Russian Army recorded a population of 11,694 inhabitants including 6,560 Bulgarians, 3,538 Jews, 839 Turks, and 737 Romani.\nThe ratio of women per 1,000 men was 1,102. The birth rate per 1000 people was 12.3 per mile and steadily increasing in the last 5 years, the death rate reaching 12.1 per mile and decreasing. The natural growth rate during 2009 was 0.2 per mile, the first positive growth rate in nearly 20 years. The considerable immigration to the capital from poorer regions of the country, as well as urbanisation, are among the other reasons for the increase in Sofia's population. The infant mortality rate was 5.6 per 1,000, down from 18.9 in 1980. According to the 2011 census, people aged 20\u201324 years are the most numerous group, numbering 133,170 individuals and accounting for 11% of the total 1,202,761 people. The median age is 38 though. According to the census, 1,056,738 citizens (87.9%) are recorded as ethnic Bulgarians, 17,550 (1.5%) as Romani, 6,149 (0.5%) as Turks, 9,569 (0.8%) belonged to other ethnic groups, 6,993 (0.6%) do not self-identify and 105,762 (8.8%) remained with undeclared affiliation.\nAccording to the 2011 census, throughout the whole municipality some 892,511 people (69.1%) are recorded as Eastern Orthodox Christians, 10,256 (0.8%) as Protestant, 6,767 (0.5%) as Muslim, 5,572 (0.4%) as Roman Catholic, 4,010 (0.3%) belonged to other faith and 372,475 (28.8%) declared themselves irreligious or did not mention any faith. The data says that roughly a third of the total population have already earned a university degree. Of the population aged 15\u201364 \u2013 265,248 people within the municipality (28.5%) are not economically active, the unemployed being another group of 55,553 people (6%), a large share of whom have completed higher education. The largest group are occupied in trading, followed by those in the manufacturing industry. Within the municipality, three-quarters, or 965,328 people are recorded as having access to television at home and 836,435 (64.8%) as having internet. Out of 464,865 homes \u2013 432,847 have connection to the communal sanitary sewer, while 2,732 do not have any. Of these 864 do not have any water supply and 688 have other than communal. Over 99.6% of males and females aged over 9 are recorded as literate. The largest group of the population aged over 20 are recorded to live within marriage (46.3%), another 43.8% are recorded as single and another 9.9% as having other type of coexistence/partnership, whereas not married in total are a majority and among people aged up to 40 and over 70. The people with juridical status divorced or widowed are either part of the factual singles or those having another type of partnership, each of the two constitutes by around 10% of the population aged over 20. Only over 1% of the juridically married do not de facto live within marriage. The families that consist of two people are 46.8%, another 34.2% of the families are made up by three people, whereas most of the households (36.5%) consist of only one person.\nSofia was declared the national capital in 1879. One year later, in 1880, it was the fifth-largest city in the country after Plovdiv, Varna, Ruse and Shumen. Plovdiv remained the most populous Bulgarian town until 1892 when Sofia took the lead. The city is the hot spot of internal migration, the capital population is increasing and is around 17% of the national, thus a small number of people with local roots remain today, they dominate the surrounding rural suburbs and are called Shopi. Shopi speak the Western Bulgarian dialects.\nEconomy.\nSofia is ranked as Beta- global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. It is the economic hub of Bulgaria and home to most major Bulgarian and international companies operating in the country, as well as the Bulgarian National Bank and the Bulgarian Stock Exchange. The city is ranked 62nd among financial centres worldwide. In 2015, Sofia was ranked 30th out of 300 global cities in terms of combined growth in employment and real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the highest one amongst cities in Southeast Europe. The real GDP (PPP) per capita growth at the time was 2.5% and the employment went up by 3.4% to 962,400. In 2015, Forbes listed Sofia as one of the top 10 places in the world to launch a startup business, because of the low corporate tax (10%), the fast internet connection speeds available \u2013 one of the fastest in the world, and the presence of several investment funds, including Eleven Startup Accelerator, LAUNCHub and Neveq.\nThe city's GDP (PPS) per capita stood at \u20ac29,600 ($33,760) in 2015, one of the highest in Southeast Europe and well above other cities in the country. The total nominal GDP in 2018 was 38.5\u00a0billion leva ($22.4\u00a0billion), or 33,437 leva ($19,454) per capita, and average monthly wages in March 2020 were $1,071, the highest nationally. Services dominate the economy, accounting for 88.6% of the gross value added, followed by industry 11.3% and agriculture 0.1%.\nHistorically, after World War II and the era of industrialisation under socialism, the city and its surrounding areas expanded rapidly and became the most heavily industrialised region of the country, with numerous factories producing steel, pig iron, machinery, industrial equipment, electronics, trams, chemicals, textiles, and food. The influx of workers from other parts of the country became so intense that a restriction policy was imposed, and residing in the capital was only possible after obtaining Sofianite citizenship. However, after the political changes in 1989, this kind of citizenship was removed.\nThe most dynamic sectors include Information technology (IT) and manufacturing. Sofia is a regional IT hub, ranking second among the Top 10 fastest growing tech centers in Europe in terms of annual growth of active members. The sector employs about 50,000 professionals, 30% of them involved in programming, and contributes for 14% of the city's exports. The IT sector is highly diverse and includes both multinational corporations, local companies and startups. Multinationals with major research, development, innovation and engineering centers in Sofia include the second largest global IT center of Coca-Cola, Ubisoft, Hewlett-Packard, VMware, Robert Bosch GmbH, Financial Times, Experian, etc. Several office and tech clusters have been established across the city, including Business Park Sofia, Sofia Tech Park, Capital Fort and others.\nManufacturing has registered a strong recovery since 2012, increasing the exports three-fold and the employment by 52% accounting for over 70,000 jobs. Supported by the city's R&amp;D expertise, Sofia is shifting to high value-added manufacturing including electrical equipment, precision mechanics, pharmaceuticals. There are 16 industrial and logistics parks in Sofia, some sprawling to towns in neighbouring Sofia Province, such as Bozhurishte, Kostinbrod and Elin Pelin. Manufacturing companies include Woodward, Inc., producing airframe and industrial turbomachinery systems, Festo, producing microsensors, Visteon, development and engineering of instrument clusters, LCD displays and domain controllers, Melexis, producing micro-electronic semiconductor solutions in the automotive sector, Sopharma, producing pharmaceuticals, the largest Lufthansa Technik maintenance facilities outside Germany, etc.\nTransport and infrastructure.\nWith its developing infrastructure and strategic location, Sofia is a major hub for international railway and automobile transport. Three of the ten Pan-European Transport Corridors cross the city: IV, VIII, and X. All major types of transport (except water) are represented in the city.\nThe Central Railway Station is the primary hub for domestic and international rail transport, carried out by Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ), the national rail company headquartered in the city. It is one of the main stations along BDZ Line 1, and a hub of Lines 2, 5, and 13. Line 1 provides a connection to Plovdiv, the second-largest city in Bulgaria, while Line 2 is the longest national railway and connects Sofia and Varna, the largest coastal city. Lines 5 and 13 are shorter and provide connections to Kulata and Bankya, respectively. Overall, Sofia has of railway lines.\nVasil Levski Sofia Airport handled 7,922,702 passengers in 2024.\nPublic transport is well-developed with bus (), tram (), and trolleybus () lines running in all areas of the city. The Sofia Metro became operational in January 1998 with only 5 stations and currently has four lines and 47 stations. As of 2022[ [update]], the system has of track. Six new stations were opened in 2009, two more in April 2012, and eleven more in August 2012. In 2015 seven new stations were opened and the underground extended to Vasil Levski Sofia Airport on its Northern branch and to Business Park Sofia on its Southern branch. In July 2016 the Vitosha Metro Station was opened on the M2 main line. A third line was opened in August 2020 and re-organisation of the previous lines lead to a 4th line being created. This line will complete the proposed underground system of three lines with about of lines. The master plan for the Sofia Metro includes three lines with a total of 63 stations. Until the late 2010s route taxis (marshrutka) provided an efficient and popular means of transport by being faster than public transport, but cheaper than taxis. Their use declined with the expansion of the metro and they were gradually phased out. There are around 13,000 taxi cabs operating in the city. Additionally, all-electric vehicles are available through carsharing company Spark.\nPrivate automobile ownership has grown rapidly in the 1990s; more than 1,000,000 cars were registered in Sofia after 2002. The city has the 4th-highest number of automobiles per capita in the European Union at 546.4 vehicles per 1,000 people. The municipality was known for minor and cosmetic repairs and many streets are in a poor condition. This is noticeably changing in the past years. There are different boulevards and streets in the city with a higher amount of traffic than others. These include Tsarigradsko shose, Cherni Vrah, Bulgaria, Slivnitsa, and Todor Aleksandrov boulevards, as well as the city's ring road. Consequently, traffic and air pollution problems have become more severe and receive regular criticism in local media. The extension of the underground system is hoped to alleviate the city's immense traffic problems.\nSofia has an extensive district heating system that draws on four combined heat and power (CHP) plants and boiler stations. Virtually the entire city (900,000 households and 5,900 companies) is centrally heated, using residual heat from electricity generation (3,000 MW) and gas- and oil-fired heating furnaces; total heat capacity is 4,640 MW. The heat distribution piping network is long and comprises 14,000 substations and 10,000 heated buildings.\nEducation and science.\nMuch of Bulgaria's educational capacity is concentrated in Sofia. There are 221 general, 11 special and seven arts or sports schools, 56 vocational gymnasiums and colleges, and four independent colleges. The city also hosts 23 of Bulgaria's 51 higher education establishments and more than 105,000 university students. The American College of Sofia, a private secondary school with roots in a school founded by American missionaries in 1860, is among the oldest American educational institutions outside of the United States.\nA number of secondary language schools provide education in a selected foreign language. These include the First English Language School, 91st German Language School, 164th Spanish Language School, and the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais. These are among the most sought-after secondary schools, along with Vladislav the Grammarian 73rd Secondary School and the High School of Mathematics, which topped the 2018 preference list for high school candidates.\nHigher education includes four of the five highest-ranking national universities \u2013 Sofia University (SU), the Technical University of Sofia, New Bulgarian University, and the Medical University of Sofia. Sofia University was founded in 1888. More than 20,000 students study in its 16 faculties. A number of research and cultural departments operate within SU, including its own publishing house, botanical gardens, a space research centre, a quantum electronics department, and a Confucius Institute. Rakovski Defence and Staff College, the National Academy of Art, the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy, the University of National and World Economy, and the University of Mining and Geology are other major higher education establishments in the city.\nOther institutions of national significance, such as the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) and the SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library, are located in Sofia. BAS is the centrepiece of scientific research in Bulgaria, employing more than 4,500 scientists in various institutes. Its Institute of Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy will operate the largest cyclotron in the country. All five of Bulgaria's supercomputers and supercomputing clusters are located in Sofia as well. Three of those are operated by the BAS; one by Sofia Tech Park and one by the Faculty of Physics at Sofia University.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nSofia is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCooperation agreements.\nIn addition Sofia cooperates with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57646", "revid": "44141905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57646", "title": "St. George's, Grenada", "text": "Capital and largest city of Grenada\nSt. George's (Grenadian Creole French: \"Sen J\u00f2j\") is the capital and largest city of Grenada. The city is surrounded by a hillside of an old volcano crater and is located on a horseshoe-shaped harbour.\nSt. George's is a popular Caribbean tourist destination. The town has witnessed an economic boom from 2014 to 2016, and also improved its tourism and various other sectors in 2022 while preserving its history, culture, and natural environment. The parish in which St George's is located, is the home of St. George\u2019s University School of Medicine and Maurice Bishop International Airport. The main exports are cocoa bean (cacao), nutmeg, and mace spice.\nIt has a moderate tropical climate that ensures the success of spice production. Nutmeg is a key crop, followed by spices such as cocoa, mace, cloves, vanilla, cinnamon and ginger.\nHistory.\n \nSt. George's was founded by the French in 1650 when \"La Grenade\" (Grenada) was colonised by Jacques Dyel du Parquet, the governor of Martinique. The French began their colonisation with a series of skirmishes that virtually exterminated the island's native Carib population.\nIn 1666, a wooden fortification was constructed by French colonists on a promontory overlooking Grenada's natural harbour and named \"Fort Royale\". In 1705, work started on a new star fort on the same site, with four stone-built bastions, to the design of Jean de Giou de Caylus, the Chief Engineer of the \"Islands of America\" the French West Indies. It was completed in 1710.\nMeanwhile, the original colonial settlement at the eastern edge of the harbour called \"Saint Louis\" after King Louis IX of France, later known as Port Louis, was found to be subject to flooding and malaria, so a new town was constructed called \"Ville de Fort Royal\" (\"Fort Royal Town\"). When the island was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the new administration renamed it Saint George's Town, after the patron saint of England and \"Fort Royal\" was renamed Fort George, after King George III. On 1 November 1775 there was a fire in the town of St. George's known as the great fire of St George's. After the great fire of 1771, most of the boarding houses on Granby Street were moved to Gouyave.\nFollowing the withdrawal of Bridgetown, Barbados, in the mid-1880s, St. George's went on to become the replacement capital of the former colony of the British Windward Islands.\nThe Tikal was the first art cater shop in Grenada and it was opened in December 1959. Grenada achieved independence from Britain in 1974. Following a leftist coup in 1983, the island was invaded by U. S. troops and a pro-USA government was reinstated. In 2004, St. George's and the rest of Grenada was severely battered by Hurricane Ivan. The hurricane left significant destruction across the island and crippled much of the island's infrastructure. It was estimated that some 90% of the island's homes had sustained damage and the nutmeg trees, which are key to Grenada's economy, were devastated. A year later with the help of international donors (Canada, the United States, China, Venezuela, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, and the European Union) Grenada had experienced a significant turn around in rebuilding efforts. By 2007, Grenada had participated as planned in the hosting of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Now St. George's is one of the top 10 Yacht destinations.\nCulture.\nCarnival takes place the second week in August. This festival celebrates the emancipation of slaves. The Sunday night celebrations continue into the early morning hours on Monday. On Monday a carnival pageant is held on stage at Queen's Park, where costumes, themes and calypso queens are judged. On Tuesday, St. George's vibrates to the sounds of the calypso steel bands as they parade through the streets.\nClimate.\nSt. George's has a humid tropical marine climate but has the influences of a tropical rainforest climate, with a wet season (June to November) and a noticeably dry season (December to May). St. George's sees frequent thunderstorms and occasional hurricanes from easterlies, while winter is marginally cooler and somewhat drier. The feeling of heat is exacerbated from the strong equatorial UV rays and high humidity all year. \nSpices.\nNutmeg and mace.\nNutmeg and mace come from the fruit of the aromatic \"Myristica fragrans\" tree. The tree was introduced on 3 March 1967 to the Spice Island. The nutmeg tree is an evergreen with dark green leaves and small yellow flowers, and grows up to 12 meters tall. It starts bearing fruit after seven or eight years and continues to do so for up to 40 years. The fruit looks like an apricot and when ripe, it splits open to reveal a walnut-sized seed. The seed coverings are lacy, red-orange strips, which are made into mace powder; the seed itself is ground down into nutmeg powder. It is used extensively for cooking to enhance the flavor of cakes, soups, desserts, drinks and sauces.\nCinnamon.\nThis comes from the inner bark of the cinnamon tree (\"Cinnamonum verum\"). Whole or ground, it is a popular household spice internationally. It is used to flavor beverages and cakes.\nClove.\nThis dried flavored flower bud, whole or ground (\"Syzygium aromaticum\") is used at home to season hams, sausages, meats, mincemeat pies, fish, turtle preserves and pickles.\nSugar cane.\nFrom June to December, cuttings from the tops of cane are laid in holes about deep by then covered with soil. As the cane grows taller, fertiliser is used. Between planting and harvesting, bananas, corn, peas, potatoes, and other crops are cultivated. January to May, the ripe cane are cut and delivered to the mill to be ground. Boiling and clarifying the cane juice is the next operation. The juice is strained after grinding and then taken to the clarifying copper to be boiled. (Wood coal is the main source fuel). Lime is added to speed up the operation. The liquid sugar is put into coolers for about 14 hours. The molasses is then drained off and taken to the still house to be made into rum.\nTransportation and customs.\nPrivate boats and yachts can complete customs and immigration processing in St. George's and Prickly Bay, Lance Aux Epines as well as in Carriacou. Travellers passing through Grenada are required to have a passport. Those whose travel involves stay over in other countries, should check on entry requirements for those countries. There is also a bus terminal for island wide transport.\nMain sites.\nSt. Margaret's Falls.\nSo named because it passes by seven of Grand Etang's mountain waterfalls, which are nestled in the emerald vegetation of the rain forest. The trail takes about three hours, even for experienced hikers.\nRoman Catholic cathedral.\nThe tower of St. George's Cathedral was built in 1818. The interior of the church is painted in bright colours.\nAnglican church.\nSt. George's Anglican Church was built in 1825, and a clock was later added in 1904 which plays the Westminster chimes on the hour. The church laid in ruin for a decade following heavy damage from Hurricane Ivan in 2004, when it continued to be used informally by locals for both prayer as well as school classes. Following several years of reconstruction work since the mid-2010s, the building returned to its function as a church.\nFort George.\nLocated on the promontory to the west of the harbour is Fort George. Built in 1705 by the French, many of the buildings are now used by the police. One of the rooms has been converted to a gym and another to a sort of sewing room. Much of the fort is still intact and open to visitors.\nHowever, the buildings are very dilapidated, from a combination of hurricane damage and neglect, and there is little or no information within the fort itself. There's a good view from the battlements. There is a $2.00 per person fee to visit the Fort.\nGrenada National Museum.\nThe Grenada National Museum is housed in French barracks, which date from 1704, and which later served as a prison. The building was also used as the island's first hotel. The museum displays a variety of historical items including Carib and Arawak artefacts, sugar processing machines and equipment, whaling industry items, and Josephine Bonaparte's marble bath.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57648", "revid": "51056118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57648", "title": "Taipei", "text": "Capital city of Taiwan\nTaipei (; pronounced:), officially Taipei City, is the capital and a special municipality of Taiwan. Located in Northern Taiwan, Taipei City is an enclave of the municipality of New Taipei City that sits about southwest of the northern port city of Keelung. Most of the city rests on the Taipei Basin, an ancient lakebed. The basin is bounded by the relatively narrow valleys of the Keelung and Xindian rivers, which join to form the Tamsui River along the city's western border.\nThe municipality of Taipei is home to an estimated population of 2,494,813 (March 2023), forming the core part of the Taipei\u2013Keelung metropolitan area, also known as \"Greater Taipei\", which includes the nearby cities of New Taipei and Keelung with a population of 7,047,559, the 40th most-populous urban area in the world\u2014roughly one-third of Taiwanese citizens live in the metro areas. The name \"Taipei\" can refer either to the whole metropolitan area or just the municipality alone. Taipei has been the political center of the island since 1887, when it first became the seat of Taiwan Province by the Qing dynasty until 1895 and again from 1945 to 1956 by the Republic of China (ROC) government, with an interregnum from 1895 to 1945 as the seat of the Government-General of Taiwan during the Japanese rule. The city has been the national seat of the ROC central government since 1949, and it became the nation's first special municipality (then known as Yuan-controlled municipality) on 1 July 1967, upgrading from provincial city status.\nTaipei is the economic, political, educational and cultural center of Taiwan. It has been rated an \"Alpha \u2212 City\" by GaWC. Taipei also forms a major part of a high-tech industrial area. Railways, highways, airports and bus lines connect Taipei with all parts of the island. The city is served by two airports \u2013 Songshan and Taoyuan. The municipality is home to architectural and cultural landmarks, including Taipei 101 (which was formerly the tallest building in the world), Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Dalongdong Baoan Temple, Hsing Tian Kong, Lungshan Temple of Manka, National Palace Museum, Presidential Office Building, Taipei Guest House and Zhinan Temple. Shopping districts including Ximending as well as several night markets dispersed throughout the city. Natural features include Maokong, Yangmingshan and hot springs.\nIn English-language news reports, the name \"Taipei\" often serves as a synecdoche referring to the central government that controls the Taiwan Area. Due to the ambiguous political status of Taiwan internationally, the term \"Chinese Taipei\" is also frequently used as a synonym for the entire country, as when Taiwan's governmental representatives participate in international organizations or when Taiwan's athletes compete in international sporting events, including the Olympics.\nNames.\nThe spellings \"Taipei\" and \"T\u02bbai-pei\" derive from the Wade\u2013Giles romanization \"T\u02bbai\u00b2-pei\u00b3\" which means \"the North of Taiwan\" in Chinese. The name could be also romanized as \"T\u00e1ib\u011bi\" according to Hanyu Pinyin and Tongyong Pinyin.\nThe city has also been known as \"Tai-pak\" (derived from Taiwanese Hokkien) and \"Taipeh\".\nDuring the Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945, Taipei was known as \"Taihoku\", which is the pronunciation of the Chinese characters (Kanji: ) for Taipei in Japanese.\nHistory.\nPrior to the significant influx of Han Chinese colonists, the region of Taipei Basin was mainly inhabited by the Ketagalan, a Plains Indigenous people. The number of Han colonists gradually increased in the early 18th century under Qing dynasty rule after the government began permitting development in the area. In 1875, the northern part of the island was incorporated into the new Taipeh Prefecture.\nIt was formerly established as Taipeh-fu and was the temporary capital of the island in 1887 when it was declared a province (Fukien-Taiwan Province). Taipeh was formally made the provincial capital in 1894. The romanized transcription of Taipeh was changed to Taihoku in 1895 when the Empire of Japan annexed Taiwan, based on the Japanese reading of the two characters. The writing in Chinese characters remained unaltered. Under Japanese rule, the city was administered under Taihoku Prefecture. Taiwan's Japanese rulers embarked on an extensive program of advanced urban planning that featured extensive railroad links. A number of Taipei landmarks and cultural institutions date from this period.\nFollowing the surrender of Japan to the Allies during 1945, effective control of Taiwan was handed to the Republic of China (ROC). After facing defeat from Communist forces, the ruling Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to Taiwan and declared Taipei the provisional capital of the ROC in December 1949. Taiwan's Kuomintang rulers regarded the city as the capital of Taiwan Province and their control as mandated by General Order No. 1.\nIn 1990, Taipei provided the backdrop for the Wild Lily student rallies that moved Taiwanese society from one-party rule to multi-party democracy by 1996. The city has served as the seat of Taiwan's democratically elected national government ever since.\nEarly settlers\u2013Qing dynasty.\nPrior to the 18th century, the region known as the Taipei Basin was home to Ketagalan tribes. Han Chinese colonists from Dabu County, Yongding County, Anxi and Tong'an of Southern Fujian began to settle in the Taipei Basin in 1709.\nIn the late 19th century, the Taipei area, where the major Han Chinese settlements in northern Taiwan and one of the designated overseas trade ports, Tamsui, were located, gained economic importance due to the booming overseas trade, especially that of tea export. In 1875, the northern part of Taiwan was separated from Taiwan Prefecture and incorporated into the new Taipeh Prefecture as a new administrative entity of the Qing dynasty. Having been established adjoining the flourishing townships of Bangka, Dalongdong, and Twatutia, the new prefectural capital was known as \"Chengnei\" (), \"the inner city\", and government buildings were erected there. From 1875 until the beginning of Japanese rule in 1895, Taipei was part of Tamsui County of Taipeh Prefecture and the prefectural capital.\nIn 1886, as work commenced to govern the island as a province, Taipeh was designated as the provincial capital. When Japan acquired the island in 1895 as part of the peace agreement for the First Sino-Japanese War, they retained Taipeh as the capital.\nNowadays, all that remains from the historical period is the north gate. The west gate and city walls were demolished by the Japanese while the south gate, little south gate, and east gate were extensively modified by the Kuomintang and have lost much of their original character.\nEmpire of Japan.\nAs settlement for losing the First Sino-Japanese War, China ceded the island of Taiwan to the Empire of Japan in 1895 as part of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. After the Japanese takeover, Taipei, romanized into English as Taihoku following the Japanese language pronunciation, was retained as the capital. It subsequently emerged as the political center of the Japanese Colonial Government. During that time the city acquired the characteristics of an administrative center, including many new public buildings and housing for civil servants. Much of the architecture of Taipei dates from the period of Japanese rule, including the Presidential Office Building which was the Office of the Governor-General of Taiwan.\nDuring Japanese rule, Taihoku was incorporated in 1920 as part of Taihoku Prefecture. It included Bangka, Twatutia, and among other small settlements. The eastern village of was annexed into Taihoku City in 1938. Taihoku and surrounding areas were bombed by Allied forces on several occasions. The largest of these Allied air raids, the Taihoku Air Raid, took place on 31 May 1945.\nPost-WW2 under ROC.\nUpon the Japanese defeat following the nuclear bomb destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and its consequent surrender in August 1945, the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) assumed control of Taiwan. Subsequently, Taipei was established as a provincial city and a temporary Office of the Taiwan Province Administrative Governor was established in it. In 1947 the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Chiang Kai-shek declared island-wide martial law in Taiwan as a result of the 28 February Incident, which began with incidents in Taipei but led to an island-wide crackdown on the local population by forces loyal to Chiang. Two years later, on 7 December 1949, Chiang and the Kuomintang forces were forced to flee mainland China after the defeat by Communist revolutionaries. The KMT-led national government that fled to Taiwan declared Taipei to be the provisional capital of a continuing Republic of China.\nTaipei expanded greatly in the decades after 1949, and as approved on 30 December 1966, by the Executive Yuan, Taipei was declared a special municipality on 1 July 1967. In the following year, Taipei City expanded again by annexing Shilin, Beitou, Neihu, Nangang, Jingmei, and Muzha. At that time, the city's total area increased fourfold by absorbing several outlying towns and villages and the population increased to 1.56 million people.\nThe city's population, which had reached one million in the early 1960s, also expanded rapidly after 1967, exceeding two million by the mid-1970s. Although growth within the city itself gradually slowed thereafter \u2014 its population had become relatively stable by the mid-1990s \u2013 Taipei remained one of the world's most densely populated urban areas, and the population continued to increase in the region surrounding the city, notably along the corridor between Taipei and Keelung.\nIn 1990, Taipei's 16 districts were consolidated into the current 12 districts. Mass democracy rallies that year in the plaza around Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall led to an island-wide transition to multi-party democracy, where legislators are chosen via regularly scheduled popular elections, during the presidency of Lee Teng-Hui.\nGeography.\nTaipei City is located in the Taipei Basin in northern Taiwan. It is bordered by the Xindian River on the south and the Tamsui River on the west. The generally low-lying terrain of the central areas on the western side of the municipality slopes upward to the south and east and especially to the north, where it reaches the -tall Qixing Mountain, the highest (dormant) volcano in Taiwan in Yangmingshan National Park. The northern districts of Shilin and Beitou extend north of the Keelung River and are bordered by Yangmingshan National Park. The Taipei city limits cover an area of , ranking sixteenth of twenty-five among all counties and cities in Taiwan.\nTwo peaks, Qixing Mountain and Mt. Datun, rise to the northeast of the city. Qixing Mountain is located on the Tatun Volcanic Group; its -high main peak renders it the tallest mountain at the rim of the Taipei Basin; -high Mt. Datun is a close runner up. These former volcanoes make up the western section of Yangmingshan National Park, extending from Mt. Datun northward to Mt. Caigongkeng (). Located on a broad saddle between two mountains, the area also contains the marshy Datun Pond.\nTo the southeast of the city lie the Songshan Hills and the Qingshui Ravine, which form a barrier of lush woods.\nClimate.\nTaipei has a temperate humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfa\"), with slight tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Af\") influences. Summers are long-lasting, very hot and humid, and accompanied by occasional heavy rainstorms and typhoons; while winters are short, generally warm and generally very foggy due to the northeasterly winds from the vast Siberian High being intensified by the pooling of this cooler air in the Taipei Basin. As in the rest of Northern Taiwan, daytime temperatures of Taipei can often peak above during a warm winter day, while they can dip below that same level during afternoon showers and thunderstorms in the summer. Occasional cold fronts during the winter months can drop the daily temperature by , though temperatures rarely drop below . Extreme temperatures ranged from on 13 February 1901 to on 24 July 2020, while snow has never been recorded in the city besides on mountains located within the city limit such as Yangmingshan. Due to Taiwan's location in the Pacific Ocean, it is affected by the Pacific typhoon season, which occurs between June and October.\nAir quality.\nIn comparison to other Asian cities, Taipei has \"excellent\" capabilities for managing air quality in the city. Its rainy climate, location near the coast, and strong environmental regulations have prevented air pollution from becoming a substantial health issue, at least compared to cities in southeast Asia and industrial China. However, smog is extremely common and there is poor visibility throughout the city after rainless days.\nMotor vehicle engine exhaust, particularly from motor scooters, is a source of air pollution in Taipei. There are higher levels of fine particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the mornings because of less air movement; sunlight reduces some pollution.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWhile Taipei City is home to 2,524,393 people (2022), the greater metropolitan area has a population of 7,047,559 people. Even though the population of the city has been decreasing in recent years, the population of adjacent New Taipei has been increasing. The population loss, while rapid in its early years, was slowed by lower density development and campaigns designed to increase the birthrate in the city in the 2010s. As a result, the population rose 2010\u20132015.\nDue to Taipei's geography and location in the Taipei Basin as well as differing times of settlement and differing degrees of economic development of its districts, Taipei's population is not evenly distributed. The districts of Daan, Songshan, and Datong are the most densely populated. These districts, along with adjacent communities such as Yonghe and Zhonghe, contain some of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the world.\nIn 2008, the crude birth rate stood at 7.88%, while the mortality rate stood at 5.94%. A decreasing and rapidly aging population is an important issue for the city. By the end of 2009, one in ten people in Taipei was over 65 years of age. Residents who had obtained a college education or higher accounted for 43.48% of the population, and the literacy rate stood at 99.18%.\nLike the rest of Taiwan, Taipei is composed of four major ethnic subgroups: Hoklos, Waishengren, Hakkas, and aborigines. Although Hoklos and Waishengren form the majority of the population of the city, in recent decades many Hakkas have moved into the city. The aboriginal population in the city stands at 16,713 at the end of 2018 (&lt;1%), concentrated mostly in the suburban districts. Foreigners (mainly from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Japan) numbered 71,858 at the end of 2022.\nEconomy.\nAs Taiwan's business, financial, and technology hub, Taipei has been at the center of rapid economic development in the country and has now become one of the global cities in technology and electronics. This development is part of the so-called Taiwan Economic Miracle which has seen dramatic growth in the city following foreign direct investment in the 1960s. Taiwan is now a creditor economy, holding one of the world's largest foreign exchange reserves of over US$403 billion as of December 2012.\nDespite the Asian financial crisis, the economy continues to expand at about 5% per year, with virtually full employment and low inflation. The city's GDP stand at US$327 billion in 2014. As of 2013[ [update]], the nominal GDP per capita in Taipei city is 5th highest in East Asia, behind Tokyo, Singapore, Osaka, and Hong Kong, but ahead of Seoul, as well as London and Paris, according to \"The Economist\". GDP per capita based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) in Taipei in 2015 was US$44,173, behind that of Singapore (US$90,151 in 2016 from the IMF) and Hong Kong (US$58,322 in 2016 from the IMF; also based on PPP). The \"Financial Times\" ranked Taipei highly in economic potential (2nd, behind Tokyo) and business friendliness (4th) in 2015. The city is home to 30 billionaires, the 16th most in the world, ahead of many global cities such as Los Angeles and Sydney. Business Insider also ranks Taipei the 5th most high-tech city globally, the highest in Asia, in 2017. While the IESE Cities in Motion Index 2017 ranks Taipei as the smartest technology city globally.\nTaipei's main development fields include the information and communications technology (hardware and software), biotechnology, general merchandizing (wholesale/retail), financial services, and MICE industries. Most of the country's major firms are based there including Acer Computers, Asus, CTBC Bank, Fubon Financial Holding, Tatung Company, D-Link, and others. 5 Global Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Taipei. The city also attracts many multi-national corporations, international financial institutions, foreign consulates, and business organizations to set up base there. Thus, Taipei has nearly 3,500 registered foreign businesses and attracts over 50% of the total foreign investment in Taiwan. Foreign companies with offices or regional headquarters in Taipei include Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, HSBC, Citibank, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, JP Morgan, PwC, and many others. Most financial and foreign firms like to reside in the central business district of Taipei, the Xinyi Special District: Citi, JP Morgan, DBS Bank, Cathay Life Insurance, Shin Kong Commercial Bank, and Hua Nan Bank have all established skyscrapers in the area. Meanwhile, technology and electronics companies are often co-located in the Neihu Technology Park or the Nankang Software Park. The startup and innovation scene in Taipei is also very vibrant. In 2018 alone, Microsoft announced plans to invest US$34 million to create an artificial intelligence R&amp;D center in Taipei, while Google announced it will hire 300 people and train 5,000 more in artificial intelligence for machines. Taipei is Google's biggest engineering site in Asia. IBM also announced in 2018 that it will develop a cloud research lab and expand its R&amp;D center in Taipei with eyes on artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and cloud computing. According to the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Development Index, Taipei's entrepreneurial spirit ranks 6th worldwide and 1st in Asia. Taipei has more than 400 startups and numerous incubation centers, accelerators, venture capitals, and angel investors. The city's startup ecosystem is valued at US$580 million by Startup Genome in 2018.\nTourism is a small but significant component of the local economy with international visitors totaling almost 3 million in 2008. Taipei has many top tourist attractions and contributes a significant amount to the US$6.8 billion tourism industry in Taiwan.\nCulture.\nTourism.\nTourism is a major part of Taipei's economy. In 2013, over 6.3 million overseas visitors visited Taipei, making the city the 15th most visited globally. The influx of visitors contributed US$10.8 billion to the city's economy in 2013, the 9th highest in the world and the most of any city in the Chinese-speaking world.\nCommemorative sites and museums.\nThe National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall is a monument, landmark and tourist attraction that was erected in memory of General Chiang Kai-shek, former President of the Republic of China. The structure stands at the east end of Memorial Hall Square, site of the National Concert Hall and National Theater and their adjacent parks as well as the memorial. The landmarks of Liberty Square stand within sight of Taiwan's Presidential Office Building in Taipei's Zhongzheng District.\nThe National Taiwan Museum sits nearby in what is now 228 Peace Memorial Park and has worn its present name since 1999. The museum is Taiwan's oldest, founded on 24 October 1908 by Taiwan's Japanese colonial government (1895\u20131945) as the Taiwan Governor's Museum. It was launched with a collection of 10,000 items to celebrate the opening of the island's North\u2013South Railway. In 1915 a new museum building opened its doors in what is now 228 Peace Memorial Park. This structure and the adjacent governor's office (now Presidential Office Building), served as the two most recognizable public buildings in Taiwan during its period of Japanese rule.\nThe National Palace Museum is a vast art gallery and museum built around a permanent collection centered on ancient Chinese artifacts. It should not be confused with the Palace Museum in Beijing (which it is named after); both institutions trace their origins to the same institution. The collections were divided in the 1940s as a result of the Chinese Civil War. The National Palace Museum in Taipei now boasts a truly international collection while housing one of the world's largest collections of artifacts from ancient China.\nThe Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines stands just across the road from the National Palace Museum. The museum offers displays of art and historical items by Taiwanese aborigines along with a range of multimedia displays.\nThe Taipei Fine Arts Museum was established in 1983 as the first museum in Taiwan dedicated to modern art. The museum is housed in a building designed for the purpose that takes inspiration from Japanese designs. Most art in the collection is by Taiwanese artists since 1940. Over 3,000 art works are organized into 13 groups.\nThe National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall near Taipei 101 in Xinyi District is named in honor of a founding father of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. The hall, completed on 16 May 1972, originally featured exhibits that depicted revolutionary events in the Republican period of China. Today it functions as multi-purpose social, educational, concert and cultural center for Taiwan's citizens.\nIn 2001 a new museum opened as Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei. The museum is housed in a building that formerly housed Taipei City government offices.\nTaipei 101.\nTaipei 101 is a 101-floor landmark skyscraper that claimed the title of world's tallest building when it opened in 2004, a title it held for six years before the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was completed. Designed by C.Y. Lee &amp; Partners and constructed by KTRT Joint Venture, Taipei 101 measures from ground to top, making it the first skyscraper in the world to break the half-kilometer mark in height. Built to withstand typhoon winds and earthquake tremors, its design incorporates many engineering innovations and has won numerous international awards. Today, the Taipei 101 remains one of the tallest skyscrapers in the world and holds LEED's certification as the world's largest \"green\" building. Its shopping mall and its indoor and outdoor observatories draws visitors from all over the world. Taipei 101's New Year's Eve fireworks display is a regular feature of international broadcasts.\nPerforming arts.\nThe National Theater and Concert Hall stands at Taipei's Liberty Square and host events by foreign and domestic performers. Other leading concert venues include Zhongshan Hall at Ximending and the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall near Taipei 101.\nA new venue, the Taipei Performing Arts Center opened in 2022. The venue is near the Shilin Night Market and houses three theaters for events with multi-week runs. The architectural design, by Rem Koolhaas and OMA, was determined in 2009 in an international competition. The same design process is also in place for a new Taipei Center for Popular Music and Taipei City Museum.\nShopping and recreation.\nTaipei is known for its many night markets, which include the Shilin Night Market in the Shilin District. The surrounding streets by Shilin Night Market are extremely crowded during the evening, usually opening late afternoon and operating well past midnight. Most night markets feature individual stalls selling a mixture of food, clothing, and consumer goods.\nXimending has been an area for shopping and entertainment since the 1930s. Historic structures include a concert hall, a historic cinema, and the Red House Theater. Modern structures house karaoke businesses, art film cinemas, wide-release movie cinemas, electronic stores, and a wide variety of restaurants and fashion clothing stores. The pedestrian area is especially popular with teens and has been called the \"Harajuku\" of Taipei.\nThe newly developed Xinyi District is popular with tourists and locals alike for its many entertainment and shopping venues, as well as being the home of Taipei 101, a prime tourist attraction. Malls in the area include the sprawling Shin Kong Mitsukoshi complex, Breeze Center, Bellavita, Taipei 101 mall, Eslite Bookstore's flagship store (which includes a boutique mall), The Living Mall, ATT shopping mall, and the Vieshow Cinemas (formerly known as Warner Village). The Xinyi district also serves as the center of Taipei's active nightlife, with several popular lounge bars and nightclubs concentrated in a relatively small area around the Neo19, ATT 4 FUN and Taipei 101 buildings.\nThe thriving shopping area around Taipei Main Station includes the Taipei Underground Market and the original Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store at Shin Kong Life Tower. Other popular shopping destinations include the Zhongshan Metro Mall, Dihua Street and the Guang Hua Digital Plaza. The Miramar Entertainment Park is known for its large Ferris wheel and IMAX theater.\nTaipei maintains an extensive system of parks, green spaces, and nature preserves. Parks and forestry areas of note in and around the city include Yangmingshan National Park, Taipei Zoo and Da-an Forest Park. Located north of the city center, Yangmingshan National Park is visited for its cherry blossoms, hot springs, and sulfur deposits. It is the home of writer Lin Yutang, the summer residence of Chiang Kai-shek, residences of foreign diplomats, the Chinese Culture University, the meeting place of the now defunct National Assembly of the Republic of China, and the Kuomintang Party Archives. The Taipei Zoo was founded in 1914 and covers an area of 165 hectares for animal sanctuary.\nBitan is known for boating and water sports. Tamsui is a popular sea-side resort town. Ocean beaches are accessible in several directions from Taipei.\nTemples.\nTaipei has a variety of temples dedicating to Deities from Chinese folk religion, Taoism and Chinese Buddhism. The Bangka Lungshan Temple (), built in 1738 and located in the Wanhua District, demonstrates an example of architecture with southern Chinese influences commonly seen on older buildings in Taiwan. Qingshui Temple () built in 1787 and Qingshan Temple () together with Lungshan Temple are the three most prominent landmark temples in Bangka or Wanhua District.\nOther temples include Baoan Temple () located in historic Dalongdong, a national historical site, and Xia Hai City God Temple (), located in the old Dadaocheng community, constructed with architecture similar to temples in southern Fujian. The Taipei Confucius Temple () traces its history back to 1879 during the Qing dynasty and also incorporates southern Fujian-style architecture. Ciyou Temple () in Songshan District, Guandu Temple () in Beitou District, Hsing Tian Kong () in Zhongshan District and Zhinan Temple () in Wenshan District are also popular temples for locals and tourists. Xinsheng South Road is known as the \"Road to Heaven\" due to its high concentration of temples, churches, and other houses of worship.\nThe Shandao Temple () built in 1929 and located in Zhongzheng District, is the largest Buddhist temple in Taipei. Fo Guang Shan has a modern temple known as Fo Guang Shan Taipei Vihara () in Xinyi District, while Dharma Drum Mountain owns the Degui Academy (), an education center in Zhongzheng District and the Nung Chan Monastery () in Beitou District. Linji Huguo Chan Temple () in Zhongshan District was commenced in 1900 and completed in 1911, it is one of the very few Japanese style Buddhist Temples that was well-preserved in Taiwan.\nBesides large temples, small outdoor shrines to local deities are very common and are commonly found next to roads as well as in parks and neighborhoods. Many homes and businesses may also set up small shrines of candles, figurines, and offerings. Some restaurants, for example, may set up a small shrine to the Kitchen God for success in a restaurant business.\nFestivals and events.\nMany yearly festivals are held in Taipei. In recent years some festivals, such as the Double Ten Day fireworks and concerts, are increasingly hosted on a rotating basis by a number of cities around Taiwan.\nWhen New Year's Eve arrives on the solar calendar, thousands of people converge on Taipei's Xinyi District for parades, outdoor concerts by popular artists, street shows, round-the clock nightlife. The high point is the countdown to midnight, when Taipei 101 assumes the role of the world's largest fireworks platform.\nThe Taipei Lantern Festival concludes the Lunar New Year holiday. The timing of the city's lantern exhibit coincides with the national festival in Pingxi, when thousands of fire lanterns are released into the sky. The city's lantern exhibit rotates among different downtown locales from year to year, including Liberty Square, Taipei 101, and Zhongshan Hall in Ximending.\nOn Double Ten Day, patriotic celebrations are held in front of the Presidential Office Building. Other annual festivals include Ancestors Day (Tomb-Sweeping Day), the Dragon Boat Festival, the Zhong Yuan Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival (Mooncake Festival). Qing Shan King Sacrificial Ceremony () is a century-old grand festival that is held annually in Wanhua District.\nTaipei regularly hosts its share of international events. The city recently hosted the 2009 Summer Deaflympics. This event was followed by the Taipei International Flora Exposition, a garden festival hosted from November 2010 to April 2011. The Floral Expo was the first of its kind to take place in Taiwan and only the seventh hosted in Asia; the expo admitted 110,000 visitors on 27 February 2011.\nGovernment.\nTaipei City is a special municipality which is directly under the Executive Yuan (Central Government). The mayor of Taipei City was an appointed position since Taipei's conversion to a centrally administered municipality in 1967 until the first public election was held in 1994. The position has a four-year term and is elected by direct popular vote. The first elected mayor was Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party. Ma Ying-jeou took office in 1998 for two terms, before handing it over to Hau Lung-pin who won the 2006 mayoral election on 9 December 2006. Both Chen Shui-bian and Ma Ying-Jeou went on to become President of the Republic of China. \nThe incumbent mayor, Chiang Wan-an of Kuomintang, took office on 25 December 2022.\nBased on the outcomes of previous elections in the past decade, the vote of the overall constituency of Taipei City shows a slight inclination towards the pro-KMT camp (the Pan-Blue Coalition); however, the pro-DPP camp (the Pan-Green Coalition) also has considerable support.\nKetagalan Boulevard, where the Presidential Office Building and other government structures are situated, is often the site of mass gatherings such as inauguration and national holiday parades, receptions for visiting dignitaries, political demonstrations, and public festivals.\nGarbage recycling.\nTaipei City strongly promotes garbage recycling, with such success that other countries have sent teams to study the recycling system. After the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) established a program in 1998 combining the efforts of communities, a financial resource named the Recycling Fund was made available to recycling companies and waste collectors. The EPA also introduced garbage recycling trucks, in effort to raise community recycling awareness, that broadcast classical music (specifically Beethoven's \"F\u00fcr Elise\" and Tekla B\u0105darzewska-Baranowska's \"A Maiden's Prayer\") to announce its arrival to the community. Manufacturers, vendors and importers of recyclable waste pay fees to the Fund, which uses the money to set firm prices for recyclables and subsidize local recycling efforts. Between 1998 and 2008, the recycling rate increased from 6 percent to 32 percent. This improvement enabled the government of Taipei to demonstrate its recycling system to the world at the Shanghai World Expo 2010.\nAdministrative divisions.\nTaipei City is divided up into 12 administrative districts (). Each district is further divided up into urban villages (), which are further sub-divided up into neighborhoods (). Xinyi District is the seat of the municipality where the Taipei City Government headquarters is located.\nCity planning.\nThe city is characterized by straight roads and public buildings of grand Western architectural styles. The city is built on a square grid configuration; however, these blocks are huge by international standards with sides. The area in between these blocks is infilled with lanes and alleys, which provide access to quieter residential or mixed-use development. Other than a citywide speed limit, there is little uniform planning within this \"hidden\" area; therefore, lanes (perpendicular to streets) and alleys (parallel with streets, or, conceptually, perpendicular to lanes) spill out from the main controlled-access highways. These minor roads are not always perpendicular and sometimes cut through the block diagonally.\nAlthough development began in the western districts of the city (still considered the cultural heart of Taipei) due to trade, the eastern districts have become the focus of recent development projects. Many of the western districts have become targets of urban renewal initiatives.\nTransportation.\nPublic transport accounts for a substantial portion of transportation trips in Taipei. According to a 2022 government survey, 34.9% of transportation trips were taken on public transit in Taipei, higher than any other locality in the country. Private transport consists of motor scooters, private cars, taxi cabs and bicycles. Private transport trips represented 41.6% of trips taken in Taipei in 2022, the lowest in Taiwan.\nTaipei Main Station serves as the comprehensive hub for the subway, bus, conventional rail, and high-speed rail. A contactless smartcard, known as EasyCard, can be used for all modes of public transit as well as several retail outlets. It contains credits that are deducted each time a ride is taken. The EasyCard is read via MIFARE panels on buses and in MRT stations, and it does not need to be removed from one's wallet or purse.\nMetro.\nTaipei's public transport system, the Taipei Metro (commonly referred to as the MRT), incorporates a metro and light rail system based on advanced VAL and Bombardier technology. There are currently six metro lines that are organized and labeled in three ways: by color, line number and depot station name. In addition to the rapid transit system itself, the Taipei Metro also includes several public facilities such as the Maokong Gondola, underground shopping malls, parks, and public squares. Modifications to existing railway lines to integrate them into the metro system are underway.\nIn 2017 a rapid transit line was opened to connect Taipei with Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Zhongli District. The new line is part of the new Taoyuan Metro system.\nOn 31 January 2020, Hitachi Rail Corporation officially commissioned Phase 1 of the Circular line which took place at Shisizhang station. The Circular line is a 15.4\u00a0km driverless rail system. The Circular line offered free rides beginning in February 2020 for passengers to test the route.\nRail.\nBeginning in 1983, surface rail lines in the city were moved underground as part of the Taipei Railway Underground Project. The Taiwan High Speed Rail system opened in 2007. The bullet trains connect Taipei with the west coast cities of New Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, and Tainan before terminating at Zuoying (Kaohsiung) at speeds that cut travel times by 60% or more from what they normally are on a bus or conventional train. The Taiwan Railways Administration also runs passenger and freight services throughout the entire island.\nBus.\nAn extensive city bus system serves metropolitan areas not covered by the metro, with exclusive bus lanes to facilitate transportation. Riders of the city metro system are able to use the EasyCard for discounted fares on buses, and vice versa. A unique feature of the Taipei bus system is the joint venture of private transportation companies that operate the system's routes while sharing the fare system. This route is in sharp contrast to bus systems in the U.S. which are mostly public entities. Several major intercity bus terminals are located throughout the city, including the Taipei Bus Station and Taipei City Hall Bus Station.\nAirports.\nMost scheduled international flights are served by Taoyuan International Airport in nearby Taoyuan City. Songshan Airport, at the heart of the city in the Songshan District, serves domestic flights and scheduled flights to Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Gimpo International Airport in Seoul, and about 15 destinations in the People's Republic of China. Songshan Airport is accessible by the Taipei Metro Neihu Line; Taoyuan International Airport is accessible by the Taoyuan Airport MRT.\nTicketing.\nIn 1994, following the rapid development of Taipei, a white paper for transport policies expressed the strong objective of creating a transport system for the people of Taipei to accommodate the burgeoning city's needs. In 1999, they chose Mitac consortium, which Thales-Transportation Systems is part of. Thales was then selected again in 2005 to deploy an upgrade of Taipei's public transport network with an end-to-end and fully contactless automatic fare collection solution that integrates 116 metro stations, 5,000 buses and 92 car parks.\nEducation.\nTaipei is home to the campuses of 24 universities and Academia Sinica, Taiwan's national academy which supports the Taiwan International Graduate Program:\nNational Taiwan University (NTU) was established in 1928 during the period of Japanese colonial rule. NTU has produced many political and social leaders in Taiwan. Both pan-blue and pan-green movements in Taiwan are rooted on the NTU campus. The university has six campuses in the greater Taipei region (including New Taipei) and two additional campuses in Nantou County. The university governs farms, forests, and hospitals for educational and research purposes. The main campus is in Taipei's Da-An district, where most department buildings and all the administrative buildings are located. The College of Law and the College of Medicine are located near the Presidential Office Building. The National Taiwan University Hospital is a leading international center of medical research.\nNational Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) likewise traces its origins to the Japanese colonial period. Founded as Taihoku College in 1922 and organized as a teacher training institution by the Kuomintang in 1946, NTNU has since developed into a comprehensive international university. The university boasts especially strong programs in the humanities and international education. Worldwide it is perhaps best known as home of the Mandarin Training Center, a program that offers Mandarin language training each year to over a thousand students from scores of countries throughout the world. The main campus, in Daan district near Guting metro station, is known for its historic architecture. The Shida market area surrounding this campus takes its name from the school's acronym \"\u5e2b\u5927\" in mandarin.\nSports.\nWei Chuan Dragons of Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League is a professional baseball team based in Taipei. The Taipei Highwealth team of the Popcorn League is also based in Taipei, co-sponsored by the Taipei City Government and Highwealth Construction.\nTaipei also has two professional basketball teams, the Taipei Taishin Mars of the T1 League and the Taipei Fubon Braves of the P. League+.\nMajor sporting events.\nBelow is a selected list of recent sporting events hosted by the city:\nThe Taipei Arena is located at the site of the former Taipei Municipal Baseball Stadium (demolished in 2000), with a capacity of over 15,000. It was opened on 1 December 2005 and has since held more art and cultural activities (such as live concerts) than sporting events, which it was originally designed for. The Chinese Taipei Ice Hockey League plays out of the auxiliary arena.\nTaipei Dome and Tianmu Baseball Stadium are the major baseball venues in Taipei. The Taipei Dome, known officially as the Farglory Dome, which has the capacity to house 40,071 seats, officially opened in October 2023. On April 13, 2024, the Taipei Dome hosted the largest crowd in Taiwanese professional basketball history between the New Taipei CTBC DEA and the Taipei Mars.\nTaipei Municipal Stadium is a multipurpose stadium that hosts football and track and field events, as well as concerts, both live and prerecorded. Originally built in 1956, it was demolished and reconstructed in 2009.\nYouth baseball.\nIn 2010, a Taipei baseball team\u2014Chung-Ching Junior Little League\u2014won the Junior League World Series. The achievement came after winning the Asia-Pacific Region, then defeating the Mexico Region and Latin America Region champions to become the International champion, and finally defeating the U.S. champion (Southwest Region), Rose Capital East LL (Tyler, Texas), 9\u20131. Taiwan's Little League World Series international team has won 17 championships, the most wins in the league.\nMedia.\nAs the capital, Taipei City is the headquarters for many television and radio stations in Taiwan and the center of some of the country's largest newspapers.\nTelevision.\nTelevision stations located in Taipei include the CTV MyLife, CTV News Channel, China Television, Chinese Television System, Chung T'ien Television, Dimo TV, Eastern Television, Era Television, FTV News, Follow Me TV, Formosa TV, Gala Television, Public Television Service, SET Metro, SET News, SET Taiwan, Sanlih E-Television, Shuang Xing, TTV Family, TTV Finance, TTV World, TVBS, TVBS-G, TVBS-NEWS, Taiwan Broadcasting System, Videoland Television Network and Taiwan Television.\nNewspapers.\nNewspapers include \"Apple Daily\", \"Central Daily News\", \"The China Post\", \"China Times\", \"DigiTimes\", \"Kinmen Daily News\", \"Liberty Times\", \"Mandarin Daily News\", \"Matsu Daily\", \"Min Sheng Bao\", \"Sharp Daily\", \"Taipei Times\", \"Taiwan Daily\", \"Taiwan News\", \"Taiwan Times\" and \"United Daily News\".\nInternational relations.\nTaipei was a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 before its dissolvement.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nTaipei is twinned with:\nUnited States.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOutside United States.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\nWords in native languages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also the capital of Tehran province and the administrative center for Tehran County and its Central District. With a population of around 9 million in the city, and 15 million in the metropolitan area, Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and West Asia, the second largest metropolitan area in the Middle East after Cairo, and the 24th-most-populous metropolitan area in the world. Greater Tehran includes several municipalities, including but not limited to Karaj, Eslamshahr, Shahriar, Qods, Malard, Golestan, Pakdasht, Qarchak, Nasimshahr, Parand, Pardis, Andisheh and Fardis.\nIn classical antiquity, part of the territory of present-day Tehran was controlled by Rhages/Rey/Ray). Modern Ray was absorbed into the metropolitan area of Greater Tehran. Tehran was 1st chosen as the capital of Iran in 1786 by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty, because of its proximity to Iran's territories in the Caucasus\u2014which were contested in the Russo-Iranian Wars\u2014and to avoid the vying factions of prior ruling Iranian dynasties; the capital of Iran had been moved several times throughout its long history, with Tehran becoming the 32nd. Under (1848-1896), Tehran witnessed Iran's first institute of higher learning, bank, railway line, and museum. Large-scale construction works began in the 1920s, and Tehran became a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran especially in the 20th century.\nTehran is home to many historical sites, including the World Heritage Site Golestan Palace of the Qajar dynasty and the Masoudieh, Sa'dabad, Niavaran and Marmar palace complexes of both the Qajar and Pahlavi dynasties. Landmarks include the Azadi Tower, a memorial built in 1971 to mark the 2,500th anniversary of the Persian Empire; the Milad Tower, the world's sixth-tallest self-supporting tower, completed in 2007; and the Tabiat Bridge, completed in 2014. Tehran is served by Imam Khomeini International Airport, alongside the domestic Mehrabad Airport, a central railway station, Tehran Metro, the Tehran Bus Rapid Transit system, trolleybuses, and a large network of highways.\nBecause air pollution and earthquakes, there have been plans to relocate the capital to another area, although none have been approved. A 2016 survey of 230 cities across the globe by Mercer ranked Tehran 203rd for quality of life. According to the Global Destinations Cities Index in 2016, Tehran is among the top ten fastest growing tourism destinations. In 2016, the Tehran City Council declared 6 October \"Tehran Day\", celebrating the date in 1907 when the city officially became the capital of Iran.\nEtymology.\nVarious theories on the origin of the name Tehran have been put forward. Iranian linguist Ahmad Kasravi, in an article \"Shemiran-Tehran\", suggests that Tehran, and Kehran mean \"the warm place\", and \"Shemiran\" means \"the cool place\". He lists cities with the same base and suffix and studied the components of the word in ancient Iranian languages, and came to the conclusion that Tehran and Kehran meant the same thing in different Iranian language families, as the constant \"t\" and \"k\" are close to each other in such languages. He also provided evidence that cities named \"Shemiran\" were colder than those named \"Tehran\" or \"Kehran\". He considered other theories not consider the ancient history of Iranian languages, such as \"Tirgan\" theory and \"Tahran\" theory folk etymology.\nThe official City of Tehran website says that \"Tehran\" comes from the Persian words \"Tah\" meaning \"end\", or \"bottom\", and \"Ran\" meaning \"[mountain] slope\"\u2014, the bottom of the mountain (\u062a\u0647 \u06a9\u0648\u0647), referring to Tehran's position at the foot of the Alborz mountains.\nThe most interesting toponymic theory of the place name Tehran is proposed by the Iranian linguist Zana Vahidzadeh (Dana Pishdar). According to Dana Pishdar, the etymological root of the place name Tehran should be sought in the ancient Iranian languages, such as Median and Avestan. Since the city of Rey and the area around Tehran were the largest cities in the Media region in pre-Islamic times, and since in Zoroastrian times they were considered a holy city and the center of a theocratic government similar to modern Vatican City, this suggestion does not sound illogical.\nAccording to Dana Pishdar, the name Tehran consists of two lexical elements: \"Teh\" and \"Ran.\" According to Pishdar, \"Teh\" in the ancient Median language means \"honeyberry,\" and \"Ran\" means \"foot of hills.\" Honeyberry trees used to grow in the northern parts of Tehran province. It is also mentioned in the Dehkhoda dictionary, where Dehkhoda explains it as follows: \"Teh\" is a noun used in Shemiranat and around Tehran for \"the honeyberry tree.\"\nAccording to Dana Pishdar (Zana Vahidzadeh), the word Tehran means a place where the \"honeyberry tree\" grows. The suffix \"Ran\" is also found in many names of districts and villages in modern Tehran, such as Shemiran, Niavaran, Jamaran, Kasran, and Shahran, which are also not unrelated to each other. In Avestan and also in the Avesta, \"Ran\" had the meaning of \"foot\" and \"plain,\" which is still associated with the name of the city of Rey. The Zoroastrian Medes called their largest and most important city Rhaga or Rey, which means the city located on the plain and at a foot. Therefore, the words \"Rey\" and \"Ran\" mean the foot of the mountain, and the etymological reason for this is the geographical location of Rey and Tehran, because both are located at the foot of the mountain and on a plain.\nIn English, it is also spelt \"Teheran\", with both variants being used in books since at least 1800, and \"Teheran\" being the dominant form from after WWII until shortly before the Islamic Revolution.\nHistory.\nArchaeological remains from the ancient city of Ray suggest that settlement in Tehran dates back over 6,000 years.\nClassical era.\nTehran is in the historical Media region of ( ) in northwestern Iran. By the time of the Median Empire, part of present-day Tehran was a suburb of the prominent Median city of Rhages ( ). In the Avesta's \"Videvdat\" (i, 15), Rhages is mentioned as the 12th sacred place created by Ohrmazd. In Old Persian inscriptions, Rhages appears as a province (Bistun 2, 10\u201318). From Rhages, Darius I sent reinforcements to his father Hystaspes, who was putting down a rebellion in Parthia (Bistun 3, 1\u201310). Some Middle Persian texts give Rhages as the birthplace of Zoroaster, although modern historians generally place the birth of Zoroaster in Khorasan province.\nMount Damavand, the highest peak of Iran, which is located near Tehran, is an important location in Ferdowsi's \"\u0160\u0101hn\u0101me\", an Iranian epic poem based on the ancient legends of Iran. It appears in the epics as the homeland of the protoplast Keyumars, the birthplace of King Manuchehr, the place where King Fereydun bound the dragon fiend A\u017edah\u0101k (Bivarasp), and the place where Arash shot his arrow.\nMedieval period.\nIn 641, during the reign of the Sasanian Empire, Yazdgerd III issued his last appeal to the nation from Rhages, before fleeing to Khorasan. Rhages was dominated by the Parthian House of Mihran, and Siyavakhsh\u2014the son of Mehran, the son of Bahram Chobin\u2014who resisted the seventh-century Muslim invasion of Iran. Because of this resistance, when the Arabs captured Rhages, they ordered the town destroyed and rebuilt anew by traitor aristocrat Farrukhzad.\nIn the ninth century, Tehran was a well-known village, but less so than Rhages, flourishing nearby. Rhages was described in detail by tenth-century Muslim geographers. Despite the interest that Arabian Baghdad displayed in Rhages, the number of Arabs in the city remained insignificant and the population mainly consisted of Iranians of all classes.\nThe Oghuz Turks invaded Rhages in 1035 and again in 1042, but the city was recovered under the Seljuks and the Khwarezmians. Medieval writer Najm od Din Razi declared the population of Rhages about 500,000 before the Mongol invasion. In the 13th century, the Mongols invaded Rhages, laid the city to ruins, and massacred many of its inhabitants. Others escaped to Tehran. In July 1404, Castilian ambassador Ruy Gonz\u00e1lez de Clavijo visited Tehran on a journey to Samarkand, the capital of Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur, the ruler of Iran at the time. He described it in his diary as an unwalled region.\nEarly modern era.\nItalian traveler Pietro della Valle passed through Tehran overnight in 1618, and in his memoirs called the city \"Taheran\". English traveler Thomas Herbert entered Tehran in 1627, and mentioned it as \"Tyroan\". Herbert states that the city had about 3,000 houses.\nIn the early 18th century, Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty ordered a palace and a government office built in Tehran, possibly to declare the city his capital; but he later moved his government to Shiraz. Eventually, Qajar king Agha Mohammad Khan chose Tehran as the capital of Iran in 1786. Khan's choice of his capital was based on a similar concern for the control of both northern and southern Iran. He was aware of the loyalties of the inhabitants of former capitals Isfahan and Shiraz to the Safavid and Zand dynasties respectively, and was wary of the power of the local notables in these cities. Thus, he probably viewed Tehran's lack of a substantial urban structure as a blessing, because it minimized the chances of resistance to his rule by the notables and by the general public. He had to remain within close reach of Azerbaijan and Iran's integral northern and southern Caucasian territories\u2014at that time not yet irrevocably lost per the treaties of Golestan and Turkmenchay to the neighboring Russian Empire\u2014which would follow in the course of the 19th century.\nAfter 50 years of Qajar rule, the city still barely had more than 80,000 inhabitants. Up until the 1870s, Tehran consisted of a walled citadel, a roofed bazaar, and the three main neighborhoods of Udlajan, Chale-Meydan, and Sangelaj, where the majority resided.\nDuring the long reign of Naser al-Din Shah (1848-1896), Tehran witnessed Iran's first institute of higher learning, bank, railway line and museum. The Golestan Palace was significantly rebuilt and expanded in 1865 by Haji Ab ol Hasan Mimar Navai, including the Brilliant Hall, the Mirror Hall and the Edifice of the Sun. The city expanded rapidly through multiple development plans. The first development plan in 1855 emphasized traditional spatial structure. The second, under the supervision of Dar ol Fonun in 1878, included new city walls, in the form of a perfect octagon with an area of 19 square kilometers, mimicking the Renaissance cities of Europe. Tehran was 19.79 square kilometers and had expanded more than fourfold.\nLate modern era.\nGrowing awareness of civil rights resulted in the Constitutional Revolution and the first constitution of Iran in 1906. On 2 June 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the \"Baladie\" (municipal law), providing a detailed outline of issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members' qualifications, the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote.\nMohammad Ali Shah abolished the constitution and bombarded the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled Cossack Brigade on 23 June 1908. That was followed by the capture of the city by the revolutionary forces of Ali-Qoli Khan (Sardar Asad II) and Mohammad Vali Khan (Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni) on 13 July 1909. As a result, the monarch was exiled and replaced by his son Ahmad, and the parliament was re-established.\nDuring the Persian campaign of World War I, Russian forces that were occupying the northwest of Iran marched around Qazvin and approached Tehran, causing a crisis and the dissolution of parliament. Ahmad Shah Qajar and his entourage decided to leave Tehran and move the capital to another place, sparking fears of rebellion in other cities. During the Battle of Robat Karim, Iranian forces led by Heydar Latifiyan prevented the Russians from taking Tehran, despite the latter winning the battle. This also allowed government functions to be moved to Qom and then to Isfahan, while the monarchy remained in Tehran.\nPahlavi rule.\nAfter World War I, the constituent assembly elected Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty as the new monarch, who immediately suspended the Baladie law of 1907, replacing the decentralized and autonomous city councils with centralist approaches to governance and planning. From the 1920s to the 1930s, under the rule of Reza Shah, the city was rebuilt. Several old buildings, including parts of the Golestan Palace, Tekye Dowlat, and Tupkhane Square, were replaced with modern buildings influenced by classical Iranian architecture, particularly the buildings of the National Bank, the police headquarters, the telegraph office, and the military academy.\nChanges to the urban fabric began with the street-widening act of 1933, which served as a framework for changes in all other cities. The Grand Bazaar was divided in half and many historic buildings were demolished and replaced by wide straight avenues, and the traditional texture of the city was replaced with intersecting cruciform streets that created large roundabouts in major public spaces such as the bazaar. As an attempt to create a network for easy transportation within the city, the old citadel and city walls were demolished in 1937, replaced by wide streets cutting through the urban fabric. By 1937, the city was heavily influenced by modernist planning patterns of zoning and gridiron networks.\nDuring World War II, Soviet and British troops entered the city. In 1943, Tehran was the site of the Tehran Conference, attended by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\nThe establishment of the planning organization of Iran in 1948 resulted in the first socioeconomic development plan covering the period from 1949 to 1955. These plans not only failed to slow the unbalanced growth of Tehran but, with the 1962 land reforms that Reza Shah's son and successor, Mohammad Reza Shah named the \"White Revolution\", Tehran's chaotic growth was further accentuated.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Tehran developed rapidly under Mohammad Reza Shah. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran, and ambitious projects were planned for the following decades. To resolve the problem of social exclusion, the first comprehensive plan was approved in 1968. The consortium of Iranian architect Abd-ol-Aziz Farmanfarmaian and the American firm of Victor Gruen Associates identified the main problems blighting the city as high-density suburbs, air and water pollution, inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration. Eventually, the whole plan was marginalized by the 1979 Revolution and the subsequent Iran\u2013Iraq War.\nTehran's most famous landmark, the Azadi Tower, was built by the order of the Shah in 1971. It was designed by Hossein Amanat, an architect whose design won a competition, combining elements of classical Sassanian architecture with post-classical Iranian architecture. Formerly known as the \"Shahyad Tower\", it was built to commemorate the 2,500th anniversary of the Imperial State of Iran.\nIslamic Republic.\nFollowing the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Tehran underwent profound transformations in its urban landscape, political structure, and social dynamics. The revolution led to the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which brought about a shift from a pro-Western monarchy to a theocratic system based on Islamic principles. This change was reflected in various aspects of Tehran's development. Politically, the revolution resulted in the consolidation of power by forces loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution. This period saw the establishment of new governance structures aligned with Islamic ideologies.\nDuring the Iran\u2013Iraq War from 1980 to 1988, Tehran was repeatedly targeted by airstrikes and Scud missile attacks, and the war led to substantial infrastructural damage.\nThe 435-meter-high Milad Tower, one of the proposed development projects of pre-revolutionary Iran, was completed in 2007 and has become a famous landmark of Tehran. Tabiat Bridge, a 270-meter pedestrian overpass that was designed by award-winning architect Leila Araghian, was completed in 2014. The city municipality started planting a large number of imported palm trees, replacing endemic plane trees. In June 2025, Tehran was attacked by Israeli airstrikes. On June 2025 an unprecedented event in the history of Iran and Tehran took place as people of Tehran committed mass evacuation.\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTehran had a population of 7,711,230 people, in 2,286,787 households at the time of the 2006 National Census. The 2011 census counted 8,154,051 people, in 2,624,511 households. The 2016 census recorded 8,693,706 people, in 2,911,065 households.\nLanguage and ethnicity.\nWith its cosmopolitan atmosphere, Tehran is home to diverse ethnic and linguistic groups from all over the country, with the majority being the Caspians. \nIranian Azerbaijani Turks are the second-largest ethnic group, comprising about 10-15% of the population. Tehran's other ethnic communities include Kurds, Armenians, Georgians, Bakhtyaris, Talysh, Baloch, Assyrians, Arabs, Jews, and Circassians. In the 2010 census by the Sociology Department of the University of Tehran, in many districts of Tehran across various socio-economic classes in proportion to population sizes of each district and socio-economic class, 63% of the people were born in Tehran, 98% knew Persian, 75% identified themselves as Tehrani, and 13% had some degree of proficiency in a European language.\nThere was a drastic change in ethnic-social composition in the early 1980s. After the political, social, and economic consequences of the 1979 Revolution and the years that followed, many Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis, left Iran. The majority of Iranian emigrations have left for the United States, Germany, Sweden, and Canada. With the start of the Iran\u2013Iraq War, a second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during the Iraqi air offensives on Tehran. With most major powers backing Iraq at the time, economic isolation gave yet more reason for many inhabitants to leave Tehran and the country. Having left all they had and having struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of Iran bordering Iraq.\nReligion.\nThe majority of religious Tehrani are officially Twelver Shia Muslims, which has been the main religion since the 16th-century Safavid conversion. Other religious communities include followers of the Sunni and Mystic branches of Islam, Christian denominations, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. As of October 2025, because of government restrictions, finding a recent survey is difficult. \nThere are many religious centres scattered around Tehran, from old to newly built centres, including mosques, churches, synagogues, and Zoroastrian fire temples. Tehran has a very small third-generation Indian Sikh community with a local gurdwara that was visited by the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh in 2012.\nGeography.\nLocation and subdivisions.\nCity of Tehran is bounded in the north by southern end and the highest point of Alborz Mountain Range (Tochal Peak, 3'964m), in the east by a hilly stretch of Alborz (namely, Sorkheh Hesar National Park, part of Khojir National Park and the northeastern badlands), in the southeast by Raga Mountain and in the west and southwest by fertile meadows and many villages, fed by numerous rivers and streams, mainly Karaj and Jajrud.\nThe metropolis is divided into 22 municipal districts, each with its administrative center. Of the 22 municipal districts, 20 are located in Tehran County's Central District, while districts 1 and 20 are respectively located in the counties of Shemiranat and Ray.\nNorthern Tehran is the wealthiest part of the city, with districts such as Zafaraniyeh, Jordan, Elahiyeh, Pasdaran, Kamranieh, Ajodanieh, Farmanieh, Darrous, Niavaran, Jamaran, Aghdasieh, Mahmoodieh, Velenjak, Qeytarieh, Ozgol and Ekhtiarieh. The city center houses government ministries and headquarters. Commercial centers are located further north.\nTopography.\nNorthern Tehran is at the foot of Alborz, starting at an elevation of , with many houses and streets on steep slopes and hills. There is a stretch of hills in the middle of the city (which historically divided Tehran and Shemiran) with its highest point at . Southwards and westwards of those hills, Tehran is less steep. On the east, there are numerous hills, with the highest point at . The southern end of Tehran (Rey) is at , next to a single mountain (Raga) at .\nClimate.\nTehran lies at the southern foot of the Alborz Mountains and the northern edge of the Iranian Central Plateau, giving the city a complex climate that combines mountainous influences, semi-arid plateau conditions, and localized micro-climates. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, the bulk of metropolitan Tehran is classified as a cold semi-arid (BSk), while lower elevation suburbs and plains (near Mehr\u0101b\u0101d Airport) verge on a hot semi-arid (BSh) classification. At the same time, the elevated northern districts (such as Shemiran) approach a Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\") type climate in some interpretations.\nTemperature.\nSummers in Tehran are long and dry. Daytime highs often soar to over 35 \u00b0C, and during peak heat waves they may approach or even exceed 40 \u00b0C. Nighttime minima during midsummer typically hover around 20-25 \u00b0C, though cooler nights are common in the northern districts. Winters are relatively cool in central areas but are notably colder in the higher elevations north of the city: daytime highs in January average around 7-9 \u00b0C, while overnight lows in the city centre fall to near 0-2\u00b0C or slightly below and occasionally dip below zero in the suburbs and mountain-adjacent zones.\nPrecipitation.\nAnnual total rainfall for central Tehran averages roughly 230-300 mm. The wet season spans from late autumn through early spring (roughly November to May), while the summer months (June to September) are extremely dry and often see no measurable rainfall. Most precipitation falls from frontal systems moving in from the northwest and through the Alborz range, with occasional convective storms. Snowfall occurs almost every winter, though accumulation in central Tehran is usually brief, while the northern districts and Alborz foothills receive heavier and longer-lasting snow. \nTopographical Variation.\nThe city\u2019s wide elevation range\u2014from approximately 1,100 m above sea level in the southern plains to over 1,800 m in the northern suburbs\u2014yields pronounced topographic micro-climates. The elevation rises up to at the end of Velenjak in northern Tehran. \nNorthern parts of Tehran tend to be cooler, receive slightly more precipitation (including more snow), and retain more greenery. In contrast, the more open, lower-lying southern sections of the city experience stronger daytime heating, less relief through breezes, and larger temperature differences between day and night. Indeed, the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperatures (known as diurnal range) can be modest (\u2248\u200910-12 \u00b0C) in built-up urban zones but may exceed 15-20 \u00b0C in suburbs or peripheral areas during clear, dry nights.\nUrban Effects.\nUrban expansion, the \u201cheat-island\u201d effect, and reduced vegetation have contributed to modest upward shifts in mean temperatures, particularly during summer nights. Stormwater runoff, dust from surrounding arid terrain, and air-pollution interactions further complicate the city\u2019s climate dynamics. The dominance of dry summers means that water management and green-space planning carry particular significance for Tehran\u2019s long-term habitability.\nAir Currents.\nAir currents have a great effect on Tehran's weather. The prevailing wind blowing from the west causes the west of Tehran to always be exposed to fresh air. Although this wind brings smoke and pollution from the western industrial areas, its strong wind takes polluted air out of Tehran.\nThe main direction of the prevailing wind is northwest to southeast. Other air currents that blow in the area are:\nClimate Data.\nThe highest recorded temperature was on 3 July 1958. The lowest recorded temperature was on 8 January 1969.\nIn February 2005, heavy snow covered all parts of Tehran. Snow depth was recorded as in the south and in the north. One newspaper reported that it had been the worst weather in 34 years. Ten thousand bulldozers and 13,000 municipal workers were deployed to keep the main roads open. On 5 and 6 January 2008, a wave of heavy snow and low temperatures covered Tehran in a thick layer of snow and ice, forcing the Council of Ministers to declare a state of emergency and close down the capital from 6 January to 7 January. On 3 February 2014, Tehran received heavy snowfall, specifically in the northern parts of the city, with a depth of . In one week of successive snowfalls, roads were made impassable in some areas, with the temperature ranging from \u00a0 to\u00a0 . On 3 June 2014, a severe thunderstorm with powerful microbursts created a haboob, engulfing Tehran in sand and dust and causing five deaths, with more than 57 injured. This event knocked down numerous trees and power lines. It struck between 5:00 and 6:00\u00a0p.m., dropping temperatures from \u00a0 to \u00a0 within an hour. The dramatic temperature drop was accompanied by wind gusts reaching nearly .\nDuring July and August 2025, Tehran experienced extreme heat and severe drought conditions, marking one of the most acute environmental crises in the city\u2019s recent history. Temperatures exceeded 40 \u00b0C during a prolonged heatwave, coinciding with the fifth consecutive year of below-average rainfall. Reservoir levels in the surrounding region fell, with water storage at Karaj Dam reduced by 58 percent, Lar by 34 percent, Taleghan by 32 percent, and the combined Latyan and Mamloo reservoirs by 47 percent compared to normal capacity. Inflows to major dams were reported to be 43 percent lower than the previous year. The water shortage prompted authorities to announce temporary public holidays and the closure of government offices and banks to conserve electricity and water.\nOne of the most intense rainfalls in Tehran happened on 21 April 1962, with 10 hours of rain. Meteorology determined that the amount of rainfall on that one day was equivalent to six years.\nEnvironmental issues.\nTehran is located near two major fault lines. Tehran suffers from severe air pollution, 80% of it due to cars. The remaining 20% is due to industrial pollution. Other estimates suggest that motorcycles account for 30% of air and 50% of noise pollution in Tehran. Tehran is considered one of the strongest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the Middle East. Enhanced concentration of carbon dioxide over Tehran, that likely originate from the anthropogenic urban sources in the city, is easily detectable from satellite observations throughout the year. A plan to move the capital has been discussed many times in prior years, due mainly to the environmental issues of the region. In 2010, the government announced that \"for security and administrative reasons, the plan to move the capital from Tehran has been finalized.\" There are plans to relocate 163 state firms and several universities from Tehran to avoid damages from a potential earthquake.\nCity officials are engaged in a battle to reduce air pollution. They have, for instance, encouraged taxis and buses to convert from petrol engines to compressed natural gas. The government has set up a \"Traffic Zone\" covering the city centre during peak traffic hours. Entering and driving inside this zone is only allowed with a special permit. There are efforts to raise people's awareness of the hazards of pollution. Pollution Indicator Boards have been installed all around the city to monitor the level of particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO).\nEconomy.\nTehran is the economic centre of Iran. About 30% of Iran's public-sector workforce and 45% of its large industrial firms are located in the city, and almost half of these workers are employed by the government. Most of the remainder of workers are factory workers, shopkeepers, laborers, and transport workers.\nFew foreign companies operate in Tehran, because of the government's complex international relations. But before the 1979 Revolution, many foreign companies were active in Iran. Tehran's present-day modern industries include the manufacturing of automobiles, electronics and electrical equipment, weaponry, textiles, sugar, cement, and chemical products. It is also a leading centre for the sale of carpets and furniture. The oil refining companies of Pars Oil, Speedy, and Behran are based in Tehran.\nTehran relies heavily on private cars, buses, motorcycles, and taxis, and is one of the most car-dependent cities in the world. The Tehran Stock Exchange, is a full member of the World Federation of Exchanges and a founding member of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges.\nFashion industry.\nDesign, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, retail, advertising, and other sectors of the fashion industry in Tehran have been able to grow significantly according to the needs of the country. In particular, a large number of male and female models are working in Tehran's fashion advertising and promotion sections. Despite the lack of adequate laws to support models, payments to female models have been considered high. Also, modeling of children is usually prohibited in Tehran. Clothing manufacturers are closely related to other fashion sectors in Tehran. For example, the manufacturers of women's boots and bodysuits have strengthened their exports and branding in other countries by using this connection.\nShopping.\nTehran has a wide range of shopping centers and is home to over 60 modern shopping malls. The city has a number of commercial districts, including those located at Valiasr, Davudie, and Zaferanie. The largest old bazaars are the Grand Bazaar and the Bazaar of Tajrish. Iran Mall is the largest mall in the world in area. Most of the international branded stores and upper-class shops are in the northern and western parts of the city. Tehran's retail business is growing with several newly built malls and shopping centres. Shoe (Mostly women's boots) manufacturing companies in Tehran can be reached in the malls.\nTourism.\nTehran, as one of the main tourist destinations in Iran, has a wealth of cultural attractions. It is home to royal complexes of Golestan, Saadabad, and Niavaran, which were built under the reign of the country's last two monarchies. There are several historic, artistic, and scientific museums in Tehran, including:\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art hosts works of famous artists such as Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Andy Warhol. The Iranian Imperial Crown Jewels, one of the largest jewel collections in the world, are on display at Tehran's National Jewelry Museum. Several cultural and trade exhibitions take place in Tehran, which are mainly operated by the country's International Exhibitions Company. The annual International Book Fair is known to the international publishing world as one of the most important publishing events in Asia.\nInfrastructure.\nHighways and streets.\nFollowing the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the political system changed from constitutional monarchy to Islamic republic. Then the construction of political power in the country needed to change so that new spectrums of political power and decision-making centers emerged in Iran. Motives, desires, and actions of these new political power decision-making centers in Iran made them rename streets and public places throughout the country, especially Tehran. For example Shahyad square changed to Azadi square and Pahlavi street changed to Valiasr street. The metropolis of Tehran is equipped with a large network of highways and interchanges.\nAccording to the head of Tehran Municipality's Environment and Sustainable Development Office, Tehran was designed to have a capacity of about 300,000 cars, but more than five million cars are on the roads. The automotive industry has recently developed, but international sanctions influence the production processes periodically. According to local media, Tehran has more than 200,000 taxis plying the roads daily, with several types of taxi available in the city. Airport taxis have a higher cost per kilometer as opposed to regular green and yellow taxis in the city.\nBuses.\nBuses have served the city since the 1920s. Tehran's transport system includes conventional buses, trolleybuses, and bus rapid transit (BRT). The city's four major bus stations include the South Terminal, the East Terminal, the West Terminal, and the northcentral Beyhaghi Terminal.\nThe trolleybus system was opened in 1992, using a fleet of 65 articulated trolleybuses built by Czech Republic's \u0160koda. This was the first trolleybus system in Iran. In 2005, trolleybuses were operating on five routes, all starting at Imam Hossein Square. Two routes running northeastwards operated almost entirely in a segregated busway located in the middle of the wide carriageway along Damavand Street, stopping only at purpose-built stops located about every 500 metres along the routes, effectively making these routes trolleybus-BRT (but they were not called such). The other three trolleybus routes ran south and operated in mixed traffic. Both route sections were served by limited-stop services and local (making all stops) services. A 3.2-kilometer extension from Shoosh Square to Rah Ahan Square was opened in March 2010. Visitors in 2014 found that the trolleybus system had closed, apparently sometime in 2013. However, it reopened in March 2016, operating on a single 1.8-km route between Meydan-e-Khorasan (Khorasan Square) and Bozorgrah-e-Be'sat. Around 30 vehicles had been refurbished and returned to service. Extensions were planned.\nTehran's bus rapid transit (BRT) was officially inaugurated in 2008. It has 10 lines with some 215 stations in different areas of the city. As of 2011[ [update]], the BRT system had a network of , transporting 1.8 million passengers on a daily basis.\nRailway and subway.\nTehran has a central railway station that connects services round the clock to various cities in the country, along with a Tehran\u2013Europe train line also running. The feasibility study and conceptual planning of the construction of Tehran's subway system were started in the 1970s. \nAirport.\nTehran is served by the international airports of Mehrabad and Imam Khomeini. Mehrabad Airport, an old airport in western Tehran that doubles as a military base, is mainly used for domestic and charter flights. Imam Khomeini Airport, located south of the city, handles the main international flights.\nParks and green spaces.\nThere are over 2,100 parks within the metropolis of Tehran, with one of the oldest being Jamshidie Park, which was first established as a private garden for Qajar prince Jamshid Davallu, and was then dedicated to the last empress of Iran, Farah Pahlavi. The total green space within Tehran stretches over 12,600 hectares, covering over 20 percent of the city's area. The Parks and Green Spaces Organization of Tehran was established in 1960, and is responsible for the protection of the urban nature present in the city.\nTehran's Birds Garden is the largest bird park in Iran. There is also a zoo located on the Tehran\u2013Karaj Expressway, housing over 290 species within an area of about five hectares. In 2009, the Ab-o-Atash Park (\"Water and Fire park\") was founded. Its main features are an open water fountain area for cooling in the hot climate, fire towers, and an amphitheatre.\nEnergy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGreater Tehran is supplied by surface water from the Lar dam on the Lar River in the northeast of the city, the Latyan dam on the Jajrood River in the north, the Karaj River in the northwest, as well as by groundwater in the vicinity of the city. The city experiences stark water supply inequalities: impoverished districts struggle with inadequate water provision and hazardous water quality, while affluent areas are largely exempt from these hardships.\nAccording to the national energy roadmap, the government plans to promote green technology to increase the nominal capacity of power plants from 74 gigawatts to over 120 gigawatts by the end of 2025. Solar panels have been installed in Pardisan Park for green electricity production, said Masoumeh Ebtekar, head of the Department of Environment.\nEducation.\nTehran is the largest and most important educational center in Iran. There are a total of nearly 50 major colleges and universities in Greater Tehran. Since the establishment of Dar ol Fonun by the order of Amir Kabir in the mid-19th century, Tehran has amassed a large number of institutions of higher education. Some of these institutions have played crucial roles in the unfolding of Iranian political events. Samuel M. Jordan, whom Jordan Avenue in Tehran was named after, was one of the founding pioneers of the American College of Tehran, which was one of the first modern high schools in the Middle East. Tehran is home to Iran's largest military academy and several religious schools and seminaries.\nAmong major educational institutions located in Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), University of Tehran, Sharif University of Technology, and Tehran University of Medical Sciences are the most prestigious. Other major universities located in Tehran include Tehran University of Art, Allameh Tabatabaei University, K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Shahid Beheshti University (Melli University), Kharazmi University, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology, Iran's Polymer and Petrochemical Institute, Shahed University, and Tarbiat Modarres University. Sharif University of Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran University of Science and Technology and K. N. Toosi University of Technology also located in Tehran is nationally well known for taking in the top undergraduate Engineering and Science students; and internationally recognized for training competent undergraduate students. It has probably the highest percentage of graduates who seek higher education abroad.\nCulture.\nIranian festivals are held in Tehran along with regional and western festivals. Nowruz, Chaharshanbe Suri, Sizdah Be-dar, Yald\u0101 Night, Valentine's Day and Halloween have been popular festivals in recent decades.\nArchitecture.\nThe oldest surviving architectural monuments are from the Qajar and Pahlavi eras. In Greater Tehran, monuments dating back to the Seljuk era remain as well; notably the Toqrol Tower in Ray. Rashkan Castle, dating back to the ancient Parthian Empire, of which some artifacts are housed at the National Museum; and the Bahram fire temple, which remains since the Sassanian Empire. Tehran only had a small population until the late 18th century but it began to take a more considerable role in Iranian society after it was chosen as the capital city. Despite the regular occurrence of earthquakes during the Qajar period and after, some historic buildings remain from that era. Tehran is Iran's primate city, and is considered to have the most modernized infrastructure in the country. However, the gentrification of old neighbourhoods and the demolition of buildings of cultural significance have caused concerns.\nTehran was previously a low-rise city because of seismic activity in the region, but modern high-rise developments have been built in recent decades to service its growing population. There have been no major quakes in Tehran since 1830. Tehran International Tower is the tallest skyscraper in Iran. It is 54-stories tall and located in the northern district of Yusef Abad. The Azadi Tower, a memorial built under the reign of the Pahlavi dynasty, has long been the most famous symbol of Tehran. Originally constructed in commemoration of the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran, it combines elements of the architecture of the Achaemenid and Sassanid eras with post-classical Iranian architecture. The Milad Tower, which is the sixth tallest tower and the 24th-tallest freestanding structure in the world, is the city's other famous landmark tower. Leila Araghian's Tabiat Bridge, the largest pedestrian overpass in Tehran, was completed in 2014 and is also considered a landmark.\nFashion and clothing.\nThe city has produced many notable Iranian design houses and clothing companies. Fashion events are also held in some areas of the city. Many famous Iranian models were born in Tehran, including Nazanin Afshin-Jam, Cameron Alborzian, Sahar Biniaz, Elnaaz Norouzi, Shermine Shahrivar and Sadaf Taherian. Women of Tehran widely used over-the-knee and leather boots after 2000s.\nTheater.\nUnder the reign of the Qajars, Tehran was home to the royal theatre of Tekye Dowlat, located to the southeast of the Golestan Palace, in which traditional and religious performances were observed. It was eventually demolished and replaced with a bank building in 1947, following the reforms during the reign of Reza Shah.\nBefore the 1979 Revolution, the Iranian national stage had become the most famous performing scene for known international artists and troupes in the Middle East, with the Vahdat Hall, formerly but very much still known as Roodaki Hall (spelled in multiple ways in english), constructed to function as the national stage for opera and ballet. The hall was inaugurated in October 1967 and named after prominent Persian poet Rudaki. It is home to the Tehran Symphony Orchestra, the Tehran Opera Orchestra, and the Iranian National Ballet Company.\nThe City Theater of Tehran, one of Iran's biggest theatre complexes, which contains several performance halls, was opened in 1972. It was built at the initiative and presidency of Empress Farah Pahlavi, and was designed by architect Ali Sardar Afkhami, constructed within five years.\nOne of the gathering centers of cabarets in old Tehran was Laleh-Zar Street. Famous Persian cabarets were active in the city until 1979. They also introduced many domestic artists. In common language, cabaret was sometimes called \"home of dance\" or \"dancing place\".\nThe annual events of Fajr Theater Festival and Tehran Puppet Theater Festival take place in Tehran.\nCinema.\nThe first movie theater in Tehran was established by Mirza Ebrahim Khan in 1904. Until the early 1930s, there were 15 theaters in Tehran province and 11 in other provinces. Most of the movie theatres are located downtown. The complexes of Kourosh Cinema, Mellat Gallery and Cineplex, Azadi Cinema, and Cinema Farhang are among the most popular cinema complexes in Tehran. Several film festivals are held in Tehran, including Fajr Film Festival, Children and Youth Film Festival, House of Cinema Festival, Mobile Film and Photo Festival, Nahal Festival, Roshd Film Festival, Tehran Animation Festival, Tehran Short Film Festival, and Urban Film Festival.\nMusic and dance.\nThere are a variety of concert halls in Tehran. An organization like the Roudaki Culture and Art Foundation has five different venues where more than 500 concerts take place this year. Vahdat Hall, Roudaki Hall, Ferdowsi Hall, Hafez Hall and Azadi Theater are the top five venues in Tehran, where classical, pop, traditional, rock or solo concerts take place. Erotic dancers were active and trained in Tehran until the 1979 revolution. But after this date, because of the policies of the new government, these activities were completely banned.\nSports.\nFootball and volleyball are the city's most popular sports, while wrestling, basketball, and futsal are also major parts of the city's sporting culture. Ice hockey and rugby are also popular. 12 ski resorts operate in Iran, the most famous being Tochal, Dizin, and Shemshak, all within one to three hours from the city of Tehran.\nTochal's resort is the world's fifth-highest ski resort at over above sea level at its highest point. It is also the world's nearest ski resort to a capital city. The resort was opened in 1976, shortly before the 1979 Revolution. It is equipped with an gondola lift that covers a huge vertical distance. There are two parallel chair ski lifts in Tochal that reach high near Tochal's peak, rising higher than the gondola's seventh station, which is higher than any of the European ski resorts. From the Tochal peak, there are views of the Alborz range, including the Mount Damavand, a dormant volcano.\nTehran is the site of the national stadium of Azadi, the biggest stadium by capacity in West Asia, where many of the top matches of Iran's Premier League are held. The stadium is a part of the Azadi Sport Complex, which was originally built to host the 7th Asian Games in September 1974. This was the first time the Asian Games were hosted in West Asia. Tehran played host to 3,010 athletes from 25 countries/NOCs, which was at the time the highest number of participants since the inception of the Games. That followed hosting the 6th AFC Asian Cup in June 1976, and then the first West Asian Games in November 1997. The success of the games led to the creation of the West Asian Games Federation (WAGF), and the intention of hosting the games every two years. The city had also hosted the final of the 1968 AFC Asian Cup. Several FIVB Volleyball World League courses have also been hosted in Tehran. In 2014, the city hosted the FILA Wrestling World Cup event at the Azadi Indoor Stadium.\nFood.\nThere are many restaurants and cafes in Tehran, both modern and classic, serving both Iranian and cosmopolitan cuisine. Pizzerias, sandwich bars, and kebab shops make up the majority of food shops in Tehran.\nGraffiti.\nMany styles of graffiti are seen in Tehran. Some are political and revolutionary slogans painted by governmental organizations, and some are works of art by ordinary citizens, representing their views on both social and political issues. However, unsanctioned street art is forbidden in Iran, and such works are usually short-lived. During the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, many graffiti works were created by people supporting the Green Movement. They were removed from the walls by the paramilitary Basij forces. In recent years, the Tehran Municipality has been using graffiti in order to beautify the city. Several graffiti festivals have also taken place in Tehran, including the one organized by the Tehran University of Art in October 2014.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nTehran is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nLat.

It happens that substituting \"left\" in place of \"right\" in the definition yields the same ideal, and so the notion is left\u2013right symmetric. The Jacobson radical of a ring is frequently denoted by formula_4 (or the variant formula_5), formula_6 (or variants like formula_7 or formula_8), or formula_9; the former notation will be preferred in this article to avoid confusion with other radicals of a ring or a maximal ideal. The Jacobson radical is named after Nathan Jacobson, who was the first to study it for arbitrary rings in .\nThe Jacobson radical of a ring has numerous internal characterizations, including a few definitions that successfully extend the notion to non-unital rings. The radical of a module extends the definition of the Jacobson radical to include modules. The Jacobson radical plays a prominent role in many ring- and module-theoretic results, such as Nakayama's lemma.\nDefinitions.\nThere are multiple equivalent definitions and characterizations of the Jacobson radical, but it is useful to consider the definitions based on if the ring is commutative or not.\nCommutative case.\nIn the commutative case, the Jacobson radical of a commutative ring \"R\" is defined as the intersection of all maximal ideals formula_10. If we denote Specm \"R\" as the set of all maximal ideals in \"R\" thenformula_11This definition can be used for explicit calculations in a number of simple cases, such as for local rings (\"R\", formula_12), which have a unique maximal ideal, Artinian rings, and products thereof. See the examples section for explicit computations.\nNoncommutative/general case.\nFor a general ring with unity \"R\", the Jacobson radical J(\"R\") is defined as the ideal of all elements \"r\" \u2208 \"R\" such that \"rM\" = 0 whenever \"M\" is a simple \"R\"-module. That is,\nformula_13\nThis is equivalent to the definition in the commutative case for a commutative ring \"R\" because the simple modules over a commutative ring are of the form \"R\" / formula_10 for some maximal ideal formula_10 of \"R\", and the annihilators of \"R\" / formula_10 in \"R\" are precisely the elements of formula_10, i.e. Ann\"R\"(\"R\" / formula_10) = formula_10.\nMotivation.\nUnderstanding the Jacobson radical lies in a few different cases: namely its applications and the resulting geometric interpretations, and its algebraic interpretations.\nGeometric applications.\nAlthough Jacobson originally introduced his radical as a technique for building a theory of radicals for arbitrary rings, one of the motivating reasons for why the Jacobson radical is considered in the commutative case is because of its appearance in Nakayama's lemma. This lemma is a technical tool for studying finitely generated modules over commutative rings that has an easy geometric interpretation: If we have a vector bundle \"E\" \u2192 \"X\" over a topological space \"X\", and pick a point \"p\" \u2208 \"X\", then any basis of \"E\"|\"p\" can be extended to a basis of sections of \"E\"|\"U\" \u2192 \"U\" for some neighborhood \"p\" \u2208 \"U\" \u2286 \"X\".\nAnother application is in the case of finitely generated commutative rings of the form formula_20 for some base ring \"k\" (such as a field, or the ring of integers). In this case the nilradical and the Jacobson radical coincide. This means we could interpret the Jacobson radical as a measure for how far the ideal \"I\" defining the ring \"R\" is from defining the ring of functions on an algebraic variety because of the Hilbert Nullstellensatz theorem. This is because algebraic varieties cannot have a ring of functions with infinitesimals: this is a structure that is only considered in scheme theory.\nEquivalent characterizations.\nThe Jacobson radical of a ring has various internal and external characterizations. The following equivalences appear in many noncommutative algebra texts such as , , and .\nThe following are equivalent characterizations of the Jacobson radical in rings with unity (characterizations for rings without unity are given immediately afterward):\nFor rings without unity it is possible to have \"R\" = J(\"R\"); however, the equation J(\"R\" / J(\"R\")) = {0} still holds. The following are equivalent characterizations of J(\"R\") for rings without unity:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is situated in the western central part of Bhutan, and the surrounding valley is one of Bhutan's \"dzongkhags\", the Thimphu District. The ancient capital city of Punakha was replaced by Thimphu as the capital in 1955, and in 1961 Thimphu was officially declared the capital of the Kingdom of Bhutan by the 3rd Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuck.\nThe city extends in a north\u2013south direction on the west bank of the valley formed by the Wang Chhu, which flows out into India as the Raid\u0101k River. Thimphu is the fifth highest capital in the world by altitude and the highest capital in Asia, ranging from to . Unlike many capitals, Thimphu does not have its own airport, instead relying on the Paro Airport, accessible by road away.\nThimphu, as the political and economic center of Bhutan, has a dominant agriculture and livestock base, contributing to about 45% of the country's GNP. Tourism, though a contributor to the economy, is strictly regulated, maintaining a balance between tradition, development, and modernization. Thimphu contains most of the important political buildings in Bhutan, including the National Assembly of the parliamentary democracy and Dechencholing Palace, the official residence of the King, located to the north of the city. The city\u2019s development is guided by the \"Thimphu Structure Plan, 2002\u20132027\", an urban plan aimed at protecting the fragile ecology of the valley. Some development has been supported by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.\nThe culture of Bhutan is reflected fully in Thimphu, through literature, religion, customs, national dress code, monastic practices, music, dance, and media. The annual Tshechu festival, held in September or October according to the Bhutanese calendar, is a major event featuring mask dances known as Cham dances, performed in the courtyards of the Tashichho Dzong.\nHistory.\nBefore 1960, Thimphu consisted of a group of hamlets scattered across the valley including Motithang, Changangkha, Changlimithang, Langchupakha, and Taba, some of which constitute districts of the city today (see below for district details). In 1885, a battle was held at what is now the Changlimithang sports ground in Thimphu. The decisive victory opened the way for Ugyen Wangchuck, the first King of Bhutan, to virtually control the whole country. Since this time the sports ground has been of major importance to the city; football, cricket matches and archery competitions take place there. The modern Changlimithang Stadium was built on the site in 1974. Under the Wangchuck dynasty, the country enjoyed peace and progress under successive reformist monarchs. The third king, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, reformed the old pseudo-feudal systems by abolishing serfdom, redistributing land, and reforming taxation. He also introduced many executive, legislative, and judiciary reforms. Reforms continued and in 1952 the decision was made to shift the capital from the ancient capital of Punakha to Thimphu. The fourth king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, opened the country for development and India provided the needed impetus in this process with financial and other forms of assistance. In 1961, Thimphu officially became the capital of Bhutan.\nBhutan joined the Colombo Plan in 1962, the Universal Postal Union in 1969 and became a member of the United Nations in 1971. The presence of diplomatic missions and international funding organizations in Thimphu resulted in rapid expansion of Thimphu as a metropolis.\nThe fourth king, who had established the National Assembly in 1953, devolved all executive powers to a council of ministers elected by the people in 1998. He introduced a system of voting no confidence in the king, which empowered the parliament to remove the monarch. The National Constitution Committee in Thimphu started drafting the Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan in 2001. In 2005, the fourth king of Bhutan announced his decision to hand over the reins of his kingdom to his son Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk. The coronation of the king was held in Thimphu at the refurbished Changlimithang Stadium and coincided with the centenary of the establishment of the House of Wangchuck. In 2008, this paved way for the transition from absolute monarchic rule to a parliamentary democratic constitutional monarchy, with Thimphu as the headquarters of the new government, with the national defined objective of achieving \"Gross National Happiness\" (GNH) concomitant with the growth of Gross National Product (GNP).\nGeography and climate.\nThimphu is situated in the constricted, linear valley of the Raid\u0101k River, which is also known as the Thimphu River (\"Thim Chuu or Wangchhu\"). While the surrounding hills are in an altitudinal range of (warm temperate climate between and cold temperate zone between ), the city itself has an altitude range varying between and . It is these two variations in altitude and climate which determine the habitable zones and vegetation typology for the valley. The valley, however, is thinly-forested and is spread out to the north and west. At the southern end of the city, the Lungten Zampa bridge connects the east and west banks of the Wang Chuu which flows through the heart of city.\nThe Raid\u0101k River raises in the snow fields at an altitude of about . It has many tributaries that flow from the Himalayan peaks that largely dictate the topography of the Thimphu valley. The Thimphu valley, so formed, is delimited by a steep eastern ridge that rises from the riverbed and a valley formation with gradually sloping topography, extending from Dechencholing and Simtokha, on the western banks of the Raid\u0101k. The north\u2013south orientation of the hill ranges of the valley means that they are exposed to moist monsoon winds which engulf the inner Himalayas and its lower valleys. However, the windward and leeward sides of the hill ranges have different vegetation patterns depending on the varying rainfall incidence in the two sides. Thimphu Valley, lying in the leeward side of the mountains, is comparatively dry and contains a different type of vegetation as compared to the windward side. Hence, the coniferous vegetation in the valley is attributed to this phenomenon. Punakha, the old capital of Bhutan, is on the windward side with broad-leaved trees dominating the topography.\nThe city experiences a southwest monsoon-influenced subtropical highland climate (\"Cwb\"). The southwest monsoon rainfall occurs during mid-April to September. Lightning and thunder often precedes rainfall in the region with cumulonimbus clouds and light showers dominating the weather. Continuous rainfall for several days occurs resulting in landslides and blockage of roads. Streams and rivers swell up carrying huge amounts of debris from forests. Deep puddles, thick mud, and landslides along roads form barriers to transportation. Cold winds, low temperatures at night, and moderate temperatures during the day, cloudiness, light showers and snowfall mark winter weather in this zone. Fog causes poor visibility, which poses a threat to vehicular traffic in the city. As spring approaches, the landscape is marked by violent winds and relatively dry and clear skies.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the census of 31 May 2005, the population of the city was 79,185 with a density of , with 92,929 over an area of in the entire district; the corresponding figure projected in 2010 for the district was 104,200. In 2011, the city's population was about 91,000.\nUrban structure.\nDemkhongs.\nChangangkha.\nChangangkha is a western central district, located between the Chubachu centre and Motithang to the west. It contains the Changangkha Lhakhang. Changangkha Temple is one of the oldest temples in the Thimphu valley, founded by Phajo Drugom Zhigpo, founder of the Drukpa Lineage in Bhutan, and extended by his son Nyima in the 13th century. The temple houses a statue of Thousand-armed Avalokite\u015bvara as well as very large prayer wheels and unusually large size sacred scriptures. The temple was restored in 1998\u201399. A well known incense factory, named Nado Poedzokhang, is located above the Lhakhang in Changangkha.\nChangzamtok.\nChangzamtok is a southern district from the main centre, bordered by the Hospital Area to the west, by Gongphel Lam and the Wang Chuu river to the east.\nChubachu.\nChubachu is the central district. It is bounded by the Chubachu River to the north, the Wang Chuu River to the east and Changangkha and Motithang to the west. Below Chubachu lies the Centenary Farmers Market which runs throughout the week. A weekend market is held on the western bank of the Wang Chu. To the west lies the Norzin Lam road which divides Chubachu from Motithang. This road contains the Bhutan Textile Museum and the National Library of Bhutan. The central road of the district is called Yanden Lam. The eastern road of the district is Chogyal Lam which runs northwest\u2013southeast along the banks of the Wang Chu.\nHospital Area.\nThe Hospital Area is a central district of Thimphu. Located south of the Memorial Chorten, it contains the central roundabout, JDWR Hospital and the Royal Bhutan Police national headquarters. The Gongphel Lam road divides it from Changzamthok District.\nJungshina.\nJungshina is a northern district. It contains the Wangduetse Gompa.\nKawangjangsa.\nKawangjangsa (or Kawajangsa) is a western district, north of Motithang, and north of the Chubachu River.\nThe Institute of Traditional Medicine, Institute for Zorig Chusum, the National Library of Bhutan, the Folk Heritage Museum and the Bhutan Telecom Offices are located in Kawajangsa. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has its Bhutanese headquarters here; it has been responsible for facilitating tiger conservation in Bhutan.\nLangjupakha.\nLangjupakha is a northeastern district of Thimphu. Located on the eastern bank of the Wang Chuu it contains the Royal Banquet Hall, SAARC building and National Assembly and Centre for Bhutan Studies.\nThe SAARCC building in Thimphu was initially built for the purpose of holding the SAARC (South East Asia Association for Regional Cooperation) conference, in the early 1990s. It is located across the Wang Chuu River opposite to the Tashechho Dzong. This elegant structure is built in a fusion of Bhutanese and modern architecture with high tech facilities. It presently houses the Ministries of Planning and Foreign Affairs. The National Assembly, which used to meet in the Tashechhoe Dzong until 1993, is now held in this building in an elaborately decorated assembly hall at the end of two long decorated corridors. The National Assembly meets here twice a year. The banquet hall is also close by.\nMotithang.\nMotithang is a north-western district of Thimphu. The Chubachu River divides the district from Kawajangsa further north and Chubachu district lies to the east.\nMeaning \"the meadow of pearls\", the area only developed as a residential area in the 1980s, following the initial establishment of the Motithang Hotel in 1974, on the occasion of the coronation of Jigme Singye Wangchuck. At the time, the hotel was located in the middle of forest, separated from the city by farmland but today this area has grown up with houses and gardens.\nAside from the Motithang Hotel, the district contains several notable state guest houses such as the Kungacholing and Lhundupling, Rapten Apartments and the Amankora Thimphu. It also contains the National Commission for Cultural Affairs, a UNICEF station and several grocery stores, including the Lhatshog supermarket. Schools include Motithang Higher Secondary School and Jigme Namgyal School. Other buildings in Mottithang are the Royal Bodyguard Camp and the Youth Centre.\nThere is also a notable takin wildlife sanctuary in the district, named Motithang Takin Preserve.\nSangyegang.\nSangyegang is a western district, north of the Chubachu River but south of Zilukha. It contains the Sangyegang Telecom Tower and a golf course to the east which expands north in the Zilukha part of the city.\nYangchenphug.\nYangchenphug is an eastern district, located across the Wang Chu River from the city centre and contains the Lungten Zampa Middle School and Yangchenphug High School. The main road is Dechen Lam which follows the line of the river and connects the district to Zamazingka in the south.\nZamazingka.\nZamazingka is an eastern district, located across the Wang Chu River from the city centre. The main road is Dechen Lam, which follows the line of the river and connects the district to Yangchenphug in the north and eventually leads to Paro to the south.\nZilukha.\nZilukha is a northern district, located between Jungshina to the north and Sangyegang to the south. It contains the Drubthob Gonpa/Zilukha Nunnery once belonged to the Drubthob (Realized one) Thang Thong Gyalpo often referred to as The King of the open field. In the early 15th century with his multiple talents he popularly became the Leonardo da Vinci of the Great Himalayas.\nThe place also has a great view of the majestic, Tashi Chhoe Dzong (Fortress of Glorious Religion) and government cottages nearby. A golf course spans much of the district flanking the lower eastern part.\nCity planning.\nThimphu was selected to be the capital of Bhutan in 1952 but was not officially established as capital of Bhutan until 1961. It was then a hamlet of a few houses built, around the Tashichhoe Dzong. The city has expanded slowly over the years along river banks and on high ground. Lower plains along the river have also been occupied. It was only after the country was opened for foreign visitors that it grew rapidly. Thimphu is now a major city with all civic amenities such as well planned wide roads with traffic police controlling the traffic, banks, hotels and restaurants, institutions of arts, culture, media, sports and also the traditional dzongs, monasteries and chortens. Consequently, a boom in property value in Thimphu has been reported.\nThe residential area of the city constitutes 38.3% of the total area. In the non-residential area, 9.3% of the city consists of administrative buildings, 4% of commercial establishments, 10.1% is taken up by health, educational or institutional structures, 2% by industrial establishments and 3.8% by security. The remaining 32.5% of the city constitutes dispersed open spaces with vacant lands, which need to be preserved in any future planning and expansion.\nThe Thimphu Structure Plan is a modern urban development plan for the Thimphu city, evolved in 1998, with the objective of protecting the fragile ecology of the valley, including its rivers and forests. This planning was necessitated due to growth of automobiles and pressure on the public health infrastructure in the town centre, restrictions imposed on plot coverage and building heights. The plan was approved by the Council of Ministers in 2003. An elected body, the Thimphu Municipal Corporation, is implementing the plan, drawn up by the American architect Christopher Charles Benninger. This plan is estimated to cost more than $1 billion when completed. Funds for implementation of the plan are being provided by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. There are some disputed areas between land owners and stakeholders, which has resulted in the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank requesting the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MOWHS) to resolve the issues through a process of the agreement, before further funds are released.\nThe clear planning concepts that have been established within the 'Structured Plan' are: the Tashichheo Dzong, Wang Chuu and the streams, Green Hills and their Forest cover, monasteries, temples, chortens and prayer flags, the urban core, urban villages and the urban corridor. The southern entrance of the city at Simtokha Dzong anchors the city limits with the Northern and Western limits of the Wang Chuu Valley.\nUnder a development plan for 2027, much of the city will be car-free pedestrian zones filled with arcaded walkways, plazas, courtyards, cafes, and exhibitions, with automobile traffic confined to the edges of the city. Parks and footpaths will be developed along riverfronts, and no construction will be allowed within of a river or stream. City planners also announced that the rule that buildings be constructed to reflect traditional Bhutanese architecture, which was often violated in the past, would be enforced more strictly. Many of the economic activities that take place in the city, along with military and police infrastructure, would be moved. It is expected that by this time, the city's population will have increased to 162,000.\nUrban expansion.\nOver the last 50 years, since its establishment as the capital of Bhutan, Thimphu has witnessed expansion, initially at a slow pace, then rapidly after the country was opened up to the outside world after the coronation of the fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck. Broadly, the city's natural systems are under three categories: natural (forest, bush cover, river, and watersheds), agricultural (orchards, rice paddies, grazing lands) and recreational (public open space, parks, stadium).\nThe urban expansion has seen a structured development plan for 2027. The buildings will continue to be built to retain ancient Bhutanese culture and architectural styles but with a measured and modulated blend of modern development, meeting requirements of national and civic administration and all basic civic amenities such as roads, water supply and drainage, hospitals, schools and colleges, electricity, media centres and so forth. The monuments or buildings of note are the sprawling Tashichho Dzong, built like a fortress, which is the centre of Bhutanese administration as well as monastic centre, the Memorial Chorten, Thimphu and the National Assembly of the newly formed parliamentary democracy within the monarchic rule. The Palace of the King located to the north of the city, called the Dechencholing Palace, the official residence of the King, is an impressive structure that provides a grand aerial view of the city.\nRapid expansion following the pattern of rural exodus has resulted in considerable rebuilding in the city centre and mushrooming of suburban development elsewhere. Norzin Lam, the recently upgraded main thoroughfare, is lined with shops, restaurants, retail arcades and public buildings.\nWithin the core area of the city, there is a mix of apartment blocks, small family homes and family-owned stores. By regulation, all buildings are required to be designed in traditional style with Buddhist paintings and motifs. A lively weekend market near the river supplies meat, vegetables and tourist items. Most of the city's limited light industry is located south of the main bridge. Thimphu has a growing number of commercial services and offices, which provide for ever-growing local needs.\nArchitecture.\nThe traditional architectural monuments in Thimphu, as in the rest of Bhutan, are of typical Bhutanese architecture of monasteries, dzongs (most striking fortress type structures), chortens, gateways, Lhakhangs, other sacred places and royal palaces, which are the most distinctive architectural forms of Bhutan. Prayer Flags, Mani Walls and Prayer Wheels present a propitious setting throughout the urban agglomerate of Thimphu. The most prominent architecturally elegant, traditional Bhutanese building structures in Thimphu are the Tashichho Dzong, Drubthob Goemba (now the Zilluka nunnery), Tango Goempa or Cheri Goempa, the Memorial Chorten, Thimphu, Dechen Phodrang, and Changangkha Lhakhang, all vintage monuments with rich history.\nThese are further sanctified by the recent additions to the architectural excellence of buildings, a fusion of the traditional and modern architecture which are mostly post 1962, after Thimphu became the capital of Bhutan and opened up for tourism under various Five Year Developmental Plans. The buildings under this category are the National Institute for Zorig Chusum, National Library, National Assembly cum SAARC Building, National Institute for Traditional Medicine, National Textile Museum, Voluntary Artists Studio, Royal Academy of Performing Arts, Telecom Tower and many more. The residential buildings in Thimphu have also undergone change in their construction methods without sacrificing the traditional Bhutanese designs said to be \"reminiscent of Swiss Chalets.\"\nThe most prominent landmark in Thimphu is the Tashichho Dzong (\"Fortress of the Glorious Religion\") located on the west bank of the Wang Chuu. The imposing white washed structure, as seen now, has undergone several renovations over the centuries following fires and earthquakes. Subsequent to introduction of the Drukpa Kargyu lineage by Lama Phajo and Zhabdrung acquiring the Dzong in 1641, the Dzong was renamed as Tashichho Dzong. During this time the practice of using a Dzong both as a religious centre for lamas and administrative centre for civic administration was introduced. Apart from the throne room and offices of the King of Bhutan, as an administrative building, it houses the Central Secretariat, the offices of the ministries of Home Affairs and Finance. The National Assembly, which used to be located in the Dzong, is now in a separate building called the SAARC building.\nSimtokha Dzong, known as \"Sangak Zabdhon Phodrang\" (Palace of the Profound Meaning of Secret Mantras), is said to be the oldest surviving fortress-cum-monastery in Bhutan. Established in 1629 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, it was attacked several times in the 17th century but survived and was refurbished repeatedly. It is a small dzong (only square with gate on the southern direction), located about to the south of Thimphu. It now houses a Dzongkha language learning institutes.\nDechen Phrodrang means \"Palace of Great Bliss\". It is a Buddhist monastery located to the north of Thimphu. The Dzong located at the end of Gaden Lam was originally the site of Thimphu's original Tashichhoe Dzong. In 1971, it was converted into a monastic school with 450 student monks enrolled for eight-year courses. It has a staff of 15. The monastery contains a number of important historical Bhutanese artifacts including 12th century paintings monitored by UNESCO and a noted statue of Namgyal on the upper floor. In the downstairs chapel, there is a central Sakyamuni Buddha.\nDechencholing Palace (, Wylie: \"bde chen chos gling\") is located to the northern end of the Thimphu valley on the east bank of the Thimphu Chuu. It was the residence of the late Royal Grandmother, popularly known as Gayum Phuntsho Choden Wangchuck. King Jigme Singye Wangchuck was born here on 11 November 1955, but makes his residence at the Samteling Palace (Royal Cottage).\nThe Tango Monastery is located to the north of Thimphu near Cheri Mountain. It was founded by Lama Gyalwa Lhanampa in the 13th century and built in its present form by Tenzin Rabgye, the 4th Temporal Ruler in 1688. According to local legend, the location of this monastery is the holy place where Avalokiteshvara revealed himself as \"the self-emanated form of the Wrathful Hayagriva\". The location had been prophesied in Tibet. In 1616, the Tibetan Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal meditated in its cave. The self-emanated form of the wrathful Hayagriva is deified in the monastery. It belongs to the Drukpa Kagyu School of Buddhism in Bhutan. The word 'Tango' in Bhutanese language means \"horse head\". This name conforms to the main deity Hayagriva (local name \"Tandin\") deified in the monastery.\nTango Monastery is built in the dzong fashion, and has a curved (semi-circular) outside wall and prominent main tower with recesses. It covers the caves where originally meditation and miracles were performed by saints from the 12th century onwards. Behind the series of prayer wheels are engraved slates. Inside the courtyard is a gallery, illustrating the leaders of the Drukpa Kagyupa lineage.\nCheri Monastery, also called Chagri Dorjeden Monastery, was established in 1620 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal. It was the first monastery established by Namgyal, at the young age of 27. Zhabdrung spent three years in strict retreat at Chagri and resided there for many periods throughout the rest of his life. It was at Chagri in 1623 that he established the first Drukpa Kagyu monastic order in Bhutan. The monastery, which is now a major teaching and retreat centre of the Southern Drukpa Kagyu order, is located at the northern end of Thimphu Valley, about from the capital. It sits on a hill above the end of the road at Dodeyna and it takes about an hour's walk up the steep hill to reach the monastery from there. According to Bhutanese religious histories, the place was first visited by Padmasambhava in the 8th century. In the 13th century, it was visited by Phajo Drugom Zhigpo, the Tibetan Lama who first established the Drukpa Kagyu tradition in Bhutan. There is a silver chorten inside the monastery that enshrines the ashes of Zhabdrung's father.\nThe Buddha Dordenma is a bronze statue, a 'Vajra Throne' Buddha, that is under construction amidst the ruins of Kuensel Phodrang, overlooking Thimphu city, about above the Wang Chuu river bed. This location was the palace of Sherab Wangchuck, the 13th Desi Druk. It is a gigantic Shakyamuni Buddha statue under construction. The statue will house over one lakh (one hundred thousand) smaller Buddha statues, each of which, like the Buddha Dordenma itself, will be made of bronze and gilded in gold. Upon completion, it will be one of the largest Buddha rupas in the world, at a height of . The statue alone is being built at a cost of US$47 million, by Aerosun Corporation of Nanjing, China, while the total cost of the Buddha Dordenma Project is well over US$100 million. The interior will accommodate 100,000 and 25,000 gilded Buddhas respectively. It is planned to be completed by October 2010. Apart from commemorating the centennial of the Bhutanese monarchy, it fulfils two prophecies. In the 20th century, the renowned yogi Sonam Zangpo prophesied that a large statue of either Padmasambhava, Buddha or of a phurba would be built in the region \"to bestow blessings, peace and happiness on the whole world\". Additionally the statue is mentioned in the ancient terma of Guru Padmasambhava himself, said to date from approximately the 8th century, and recovered some 800 years ago by terton Pema Lingpa.\nThe Memorial Chorten, also known as the 'Thimphu Chorten', is a chorten in Thimphu located on Doeboom Lam in the southern-central part of the city near the main roundabout and Indian Military Hospital. The chorten that dominates the skyline of Thimphu was built in 1974 to honour the 3rd King of Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (1928\u20131972). This prominent landmark in the city has golden spires and bells. In 2008, it underwent extensive renovation. This chorten is popularly known as \"the most visible religious landmark in Bhutan\". It was consecrated by the Late Dudjom Rimpoche. This chorten is unlike other chortens as it does not enshrine the mortal remains of the late King. Only the King's photo in a ceremonial dress adorns a hall in the ground floor. The King, when he was alive, wanted to build \"a chorten to represent the mind of the Buddha\". It is designed as a Tibetan style chorten, also called as the Jangchup Chorten, patterned on the design of a classical stupa, with a pyramidal pillar crowned by a crescent of Moon and Sun. The feature that is distinct here is the outward flaring of the rounded part to give the shape of a vase, rather than a dome shape. The chorten depicts larger than life size images of tantric deities, with some 36 of them in erotic poses.\nOther attractions.\nThere are several other attractions in Thimphu such as the National Post Office, the Clock Tower Square and the Motithang Takin Preserve (an erstwhile zoo).\nThe National Post Office, located in the north wing of the large General Post Office building on the Dremton Lam (Drentoen Lam), is where the famous Bhutan's Philatelic Bureau sells stamps and souvenir sheets of Bhutan stamps. In view of their colourful presentation and limited issue, stamp collectors all over the world know that Bhutan is the first country to diversify and export quality stamps; particularly, 3D stamps are collector's items. The Bhutan Postal Museum opened its doors in November 2015 and is housed on the groundfloor of the General Post Office building.\nThe Clock Tower Square is a recently renovated square surrounded by shops and restaurants. Fountains and traditional Bhutanese Mani or prayer wheels make the place more comfortable. On one side, the luxurious Druk Hotel is situated. Various programmes and activities are held here. It was also the check point for the SAARC Car Rally.\nThe Motithang Takin Preserve in Thimphu is a wildlife reserve area for Bhutan takin, the national animal of Bhutan. Originally a mini-zoo, it was converted into a preserve when it was discovered that the animals refrained from inhabiting the surrounding forest even when set free. The reason for declaring the takin as a National Animal of Bhutan on 25 November 2005 (\"Budorcas taxicolor\") is attributed to a legend of the animal's creation in Bhutan in the 15th century by Lama Drukpa Kunley. The King of Bhutan believed that it was improper for a Buddhist country to confine animals for religious and environmental reasons, so he ordered the closure of the mini-zoo and the release of the animals into the forest. However, the Takin remained rooted to the town and were seen straying in the streets of Thimphu in search of fodder. Hence, an exclusive preserve was created for them to live freely.\nEconomy.\nThimphu is the political and economic centre of Bhutan and the location of the central government. \nA morning market is held on the central square during weekends. These are the only days when the residents of Thimphu can buy fresh fruit and vegetables. The inhabitants rely on the supermarkets for other provisions throughout the week. The market also sells yak butter, cheese, wooden bowls and fabrics. A number of cheap souvenirs from Nepal are also sold at the market. Behind the open market, several shops sell Chinese and Bangladeshi crockery, appliances, shoes, silks and carpets. For many years merchants would come to the central square from all over Bhutan and market their goods and would sleep in the open air. However, in 1986, platforms were erected and in 1989 covered market halls were built over the platforms. A special building for meat products was constructed on the north side of the market. In 2006, the handicrafts section was moved to the new stalls on the other side of the new bridge, built in the traditional style in 2005.\nThe Loden Foundation, Bhutan's first registered charity, has been based in Thimphu since 2007. It is run by a board of trustees composed of prominent citizens, and the foundation has a working team in the United Kingdom (UK). The organisation was established to support education and promote learning and entrepreneurship in Bhutan and other Himalayan areas and to promote Bhutanese culture and religion in other parts of the world.\nTourism.\nInitially, when Bhutan was opened up for tourism in 1974, the government-owned Tourism Corporation was set up in Thimphu to encourage and organise individual and group tours to destinations of cultural importance in Bhutan, concentrating on Buddhism, weaving, birds, nature and trekking, and any special package. This organization was privatised in 1994 and named as Bhutan Tourism Development Corporation. The corporation also owns and manages hotels and tourist lodges at all major tourist centres in Bhutan. It has its own fleet of cars and also interpreters in several international languages to cater to tourists from various countries.\nThimphu does not have a vibrant night life but the number of nightclubs and pool rooms for young people is growing quickly.\nThe main street, Norzim Lam, contains a number of shops, small hotels, and restaurants. The Bhutan Textile Museum, the National Library, the Chang Lam Plaza and the sports field are buildings of note around this street area. Near the main square is a clock, decorated with dragons, which is now an open-air theatre site and art and craft stores and the Tashi supermarket. In the building in front of the old cinema there is a Chinese restaurant and trekking stores.\nThe Drentoen Lam street is located off the main street and contains the post office, bank, administrative buildings, and several music stores. Doebum Lam road runs parallel to the main Norzim Lam and also contains the Chamber of Commerce, Department of Tourism and the Ministry of Trade buildings and the odd bakery. In 2006, a new shopping district opened between Doebum Lam and Norzim Lam which includes the Zangdopelri shopping complex, the Phuntsho Pelri Hotel and Seasons, an Italian restaurant.\nGovernment and civic administration.\nAs the capital of Bhutan, most of the important political institutions in the country are based in Thimphu, including the embassies and the National Assembly of Bhutan. The National Assembly has 47 members, who were elected in the first ever general elections on March 24, 2008. Jigme Thinley's Druk Phuensum Tshogpa Party won a landslide victory, securing 45 seats. The People's Democratic Party won the other two, but its leader Sangay Ngedup lost the election in his constituency.\nCivic administration.\nThe Civic Administration of Thimphu city is the responsibility of the Thimphu Municipal Corporation (TMC). \nIt was established in 1995 through a royal decree. It became an autonomous corporation in 1999, following the enactment of the Municipal Act of 1999. Its headquarters is at the Lungtenzampa zone of Thimphu. The corporation is headed by a mayor (Dasho Nima Wangdi) who is called \"Thrompon\" in the Bhutanese language. The mayor is appointed by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS). \nAn executive committee comprising 17 members governs the corporation; 8 members are elected from 6 zones and 7 members are nominated from government organizations and meet nearly every 6 weeks. However, its capacity to deal with the problems is hindered by lack of adequate staff (without any proportionate increase in staff strength to deal with its large jurisdiction) and its expenditure far outstrips the revenue earned. In order to provide cost effective services, the Corporation (as the regulating body) has contemplated privatization of public services, particularly water supply, solid waste, sewerage and parking.\nCivic amenities.\nThe Thimphu metropolitan area has all the basic amenities. Further additions and improvements have been planned and are under implementation, as part of the \u2018Thimphu Structured Plan\u2019. Water Supply, sanitation and health care have been fully addressed.\nWater supply and sanitation.\nService-oriented municipal corporations have been established in the two biggest urban centres in Bhutan, namely Thimphu and Phuentsholing. Thimphu Municipal Corporation (TMC) is the service organization that has the mandate for executing urban water supply and sanitation programmes in Thimphu city. TMC is an autonomous \u2018Civic Body\u2019 under the municipal charter granted in 2003, as per the Bhutan Municipal Act of 1999. However, the overall responsibility to formulate strategies and policies for human settlement in the country rests with the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement of the central government, as the nodal agency, with its subordinate Department of Urban Development and Engineering Services made responsible for executing urban water supply and sanitation programmes.\nAccess to potable water is available to 90% of the population in Thimphu, though water supply is intermittent, attributed to leakage and high consumer demand.\nConventional piped sewerage with lagoon treatment has been installed in the core areas of Thimphu with coverage of about 70%. However, the urban sanitation issues that have been flagged for action are: to ensure provision of flush toilets or latrines with proper septic tanks and soak pits in all new houses; dismantling VIP latrines and long drop toilets; to provide piped sewerage and wastewater treatment plants in all urban areas, allocation of funds for piped sewerage and treatment plant and awareness campaign on basic sanitation.\nThimphu also has an organised waste collection and disposal system. However, the quantum of waste generation in the city, which has about 6,982 households and 1,000 institutions, was projected to double in the period 2000\u20132010. At present, the solid waste disposal is at the sanitary landfill site, which may become inadequate soon. This problem is intended to be addressed by minimizing waste generation and adopting proper waste segregation methods.\nLaw and order.\nLaw and order in Thimphu and in the country as a whole are the responsibility of the Royal Bhutan Police (RBP), a national police branch of the armed forces, established in Thimphu in September 1965 when 555 personnel were reassigned from the Royal Bhutan Army. The organization is responsible for law and order, traffic control, and crime prevention. In 1988, a fingerprint bureau was established in Thimphu, for which a female second lieutenant received specialized training. Bhutan became a member of Interpol on 19 September 2005; since then, Interpol has maintained a National Central Bureau at RBP headquarters in Thimphu.\nThe RBP is headed by a chief of police who is under the control of the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs. He is assisted by a deputy chief of police. The headquarters of the RBP is located in the capital city of Thimphu and is divided into three branches directly under the chief of police. The RBP has grouped districts into \"ranges,\" which are under the administrative control of range police officers. A district police officer heads the police force in a district. There are a number of police stations, outposts, and checkpoints in a district; the highest-ranking officer is usually designated the officer in charge of that particular area. Thimphu district and the city fall under Range I. Recruits are trained at the police training centres in Zilnon, Namgyeling\u2013Thimphu, Jigmeling\u2013Gelephu, and Tashigatshel\u2013Chukha.\nHealth care.\nBasic health facilities are provided free of any charge to all citizens in Bhutan. There are no private practitioners operating any clinics anywhere in Thimphu or Bhutan. Every citizen is treated free of any charge including foreign tourists needing medical care. The health care centre established in Thimphu is the National Referral Hospital. 'Traditional Medicine' is also in vogue and the \"Institute of Traditional Medicine\" has been set up in Thimphu to promote this widely practiced herbal medical cure in rural areas of Bhutan.\nThe National Referral Hospital (full name \"Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital\") in Thimphu was established in 1972 and is the main hospital in Bhutan. The National Referral Hospital provides free basic medical treatment as well as advanced surgeries and emergency services to citizens from all over the country. The hospital provides sophisticated health evaluation and management services in the country and has facilities of CT and MRI diagnosis equipment and improved lab services. The hospital has a library with many textbooks. The hospital is one of five medical service centres within Thimphu. The others are: two Indian hospitals (DANTAK hospital at Semtokha and IMTRAT hospital in the main town), the BHU in Dechencholing and the Outreach Clinic in Motithang.\nThe Institute of Traditional Medicine was set up in 1979 with assistance from World Health Organization (WHO) to develop and popularise Bhutanese herbal medicine, which has been used by the rural people in Bhutan for many centuries. The institute is located on a hill promontory above the Thimpu town. It is a semi-wooden structure built colourfully like a \"Manor House\". Traditionally, Bhutanese medicine has been influenced by traditional Tibetan medicine and also some aspects of Indian medicine, particularly the \"Three Humors of bile, wind and phlegm\" that \"dictates the state of our physical and spiritual health.\" The institute is staffed by scientists who claim that they have now developed a \"mixture of five herbs that could possess spermogenitic powers\" (a kind of a herbal viagra), which is under testing before development and marketing on a commercial basis. The main herb used is stated to be Cordyceps sinensis (caterpillar fungus), whose productive buds are available in the hills of Bhutan.\nLama Shenphen Zangpo.\nLama Shenphen is a monk, author and social worker in Thimphu, who has worked with troubled youth since 1998. He was born in Swansea, United Kingdom, but spent more than 28 years practicing and studying Buddhism in Taiwan and Japan. He also teaches meditation and organizes drug outreach programs from the popular Ambient Cafe, on Norzin Lam, the main street of Thimphu.\nIn 2015, lama Shephen was awarded the National order of merit, Gold, by His Majesty the King in recognition for his contribution in mentoring Bhutanese youth.\nCulture.\nThe culture of Bhutan is fully reflected in the capital city with respect to literature, religion, customs, and national dress code, the monastic practices, music, dance, literature and in the media. Modernity has been blended without sacrificing on the traditional Buddhist ethos.\nAncient literature of Bhutan is preserved in the National Library. The script used in Bhutanese literature is in the Bhutanese script (though evolved from Tibetan script) known as \"jo yig\" developed in the 16th century. The printing process of these books on handmade paper and its binding are display items at the National Library. Modern literature is still evolving and a religious biography of women titled \"delog\" is a popular religious work. There are many writers who write in English now, mostly short stories and collection of folk tales of Bhutan; a popular author is Kunzang Choeden.\nThe Royal Academy of Performing Arts (RAPA), located in Thimphu, was established at the initiative of the late King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck in 1954, with the basic objective of preserving and promoting performing arts traditions of Bhutan. In 1967, it was institutionalised as an academy and the Royal Dance troupe was its creation. The institution provides training in national dance forms of Bhutan such as mask dances and also preserves the folk dance heritage. The professional dancers of the academy hold performances during the annual Thimphu Tsechu dance festival that is held in the premises of the Tashichhoe Dzong. Performances lasting for one hour are also arranged on specially requested occasions. The present activities at the academy are being reorganised with further expansion of its programs, including curriculum development for teaching.\nEstablished in 1967 and built in the style of a traditional temple, the National Library houses many ancient Dzonghka and Tibetan texts. It has been planned as \"a major scriptural repository and research facility dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the rich literary, cultural and religious heritage\" of Bhutan. The building is very lavishly decorated and is said to represent the finest vibrant Bhutanese architecture. On the ground floor of this building, among the highly prized collections, there is a book reported to be the heaviest in the world, weighing , known as \"Bhutan:a Visual Odyssey Across the Last Himalayan Kingdom \". Traditional books and historic manuscripts written in Tibetan style, on handmade paper bound between wooden flats and tied together are also preserved here. The library also houses an old printing press that was used for printing books and prayer flags. The library is also circumambulated by devotees as a mark of worship by the devout as it enshrines holy books and images of Bhutan's famous people such as the Zhabdrung, Namgyal, Pema Linga and Guru Rinpoche. Also on display here are a model of the Punakha Dzong and the Chorten architecture.\nThe music of Bhutan has traditional genres such as zhungdra and boedra. The influence of Drukpa Buddhism and Buddhist music on Bhutanese culture is important. Many folk songs and chanting styles are derived from Drukpa music. In the 17th century, during the reign of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (1594\u20131652) great blossoming of folk music and dance (cham) took place. Instruments dating to this time include the lingm (flute), dramnyen (lute) and chiwang(fiddle). \"Ynagchen\" is an instrument made from hollow wood with 72 strings that are \"struck with two bamboo sticks.\" Rigsar music has become popular in Thimphu and Bhutan and is performed on electric piano and synthesiser. It is, however, a fusion of traditional Bhutanese and Tibetan tunes and is also influenced by Hindi music. The music albums are produced by many popular Bhutanese male and female singers not only in Rigsar music but also in traditional folk songs and religious songs. Four music CDs of religious folk music, called the 'Tibetan Buddhist Rites' released by the monasteries with a recording sung by a \"manip\" (a traveling ascetic) that reminisces the arrival of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in Bhutan in the 17th century is popular.\nTo promote music in Bhutan, two music schools have been established in Thimphu, namely the Kilu Music School and the more recent Himalayan School of Music. The Kilu Music School, established in March 2005, is the first of its kind in Thimpu where students are taught the essentials of music such as: to practice their music reading and writing skills, and to improve their listening skills.\nKheng Sonam Dorji, of Kaktong village of Zhemgang District, is a renowned and committed musician, vocalist, and composer who resides in Thimphu. He plays several instruments native to Bhutan and India. He learnt \"drangyen\" under the elders of Bhutanese folk tradition. His contributions to Bhutanese culture include a string of hit Rigsar (Bhutanese pop) albums and the sound tracks of the popular Bhutanese film, \"Travellers and Magicians (2004)\". He also participated at the Smithsonian's Festival of American Folklife (2008).\nFilms made in Bhutan are very few. Quality of films produced is in a stage of improvement. National Film awards are presented in functions held in Thimphu to encourage Bhutanese film making. The only cinema hall in Thimphu, the Luger Cinema Hall, screens Bhutanese and Hindi movies; occasionally English/foreign-language movies are also screened here.\nMask dances, popularly known as Cham dances, are performed in the courtyards of the Tashichhoe Dzong in Thimphu during the four-day Tsechu festival, held every year during Autumn (September/October) on dates corresponding to the Bhutanese calendar. Tsechu means \"tenth\", so the festival is held on the 10th day of Bhutanese month. It is a religious folk dance form of Drukpa Buddhism, which was established in 1670. Tsechus are a series of dances performed by monks and also trained dance troupes to honour the deeds of Padmasambahva alias Guru Rinpoche. They are also social events when people turn up in their best attire, with women particularly bejeweled, and large numbers witness the ritual dances and also absorb the religious teachings on Buddhism. It is performed in each district in Bhutan at different periods; the Thimphu Tsechu and the Paro Tsechu are the most popular. The Thimphu Tsechu, held for four days is usually attended by the royal family and the Chief Abbot of Bhutan and other government officials. The opening day and concluding days are important and each day has a set programme. These colourfully costumed, masked dances (performed mostly by monks) typically are moral vignettes, or based on incidents from the life of the 9th century Nyingmapa teacher Padmasambhava and other saints.\nA nightlife has begun to develop in Thimphu. Nightclubs have begun to spring up in the city. Thimphu's nightclubs have a reputation for high-quality ambience, entertainment, food, and music, and have hosted prominent Western celebrities.\nArts and crafts.\nThe arts and crafts of Bhutan that represents the exclusive \"spirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom\u2019 is defined as the art of \"Zorig Chosum\", which means the \"thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan\". The arts and crafts produced in Thimphu and other places in Bhutan include textiles, paintings, sculptures, paper making, wood carving, sword making and blacksmithing, boot making, bamboo craft, bow and arrow making and jewelry.\nThe National Institute of Zorig Chusum is the centre for Bhutanese art education. It was set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms. Painting is the main theme of the institute, which provides 4\u20136 years of training in Bhutanese traditional art forms. The curricula cover a comprehensive course of drawing, painting, wood carving, embroidery, and carving of statues. Images of Buddha are a popular painting done here.\nThere is a large government-run emporium close to the National Institute of Zorig Chusum, which deals with exquisite handicrafts, traditional arts, and jewelry; \"Gho\" and \"Kira\", the national dress of Bhutanese men and women, are available in this emporium. The town has many other privately owned emporiums which deal with thangkas, paintings, masks, brassware, antique jewellery, painted lama tables known as \"choektse\", drums, Tibetan violins and so forth. Zangma Handicrafts Emporium, in particular, sells handicrafts made in the Institute of Zorig Chusum.\nFolk Heritage Museum in Kawajangsa, Thimphu is built on the lines of a traditional Bhutanese farm house with more than 100-year-old vintage furniture. It is built as a three storied structure with rammed mud walls and wooden doors, windows and roof covered with slates. It reveals much about Bhutanese rural life. \nLocated in an innocuous building, the Voluntary Artist Studio's objective is to encourage traditional and contemporary art forms among the youth of Thimphu who are keen to imbibe these art forms. The works of these young artists are also available on sale in the 'Art Shop Gallery' of the studio.\nThe National Textile Museum in Thimphu displays various Bhutanese textiles that are extensive and rich in traditional culture. It also exhibits colourful and rare kiras and ghos (traditional Bhutanese dress, kira for women and gho for men).\nReligion.\nVajrayana Buddhism is the state religion and the dominant ethnic group is Drukpa of Kagyu Buddhism, while in southern Bhutan Hindus of Nepali ethnicity are dominant. The main monastic body with membership of 1,160 monks is headed by a chief abbot (presently Je Khenpo) who spends six months in Tashichhoe Dzong in Thimphu and the other six months in Punakha. A Council of Ecclesiastical Affairs, under the chairmanship of the chief abbot, is located in Thimphu, which is responsible for the management of the National Memorial Chorten in Thimphu, and all Buddhist meditation centres, schools of Buddhist studies and also central and district monastic bodies. The day-to-day affairs of the council are under the charge of the chief abbot.\nEducation.\nIt was only in the 1960s that roads were built in Bhutan and Thimphu when the Third King of Bhutan took the initiative after receiving education in it. Prior to that, education was limited to monastic teachings in monasteries, except for a few privileged people who went to Darjeeling to receive western-type education. Dzongkha is compulsory in all schools. Schools are co-educational and education is not compulsory but school education is virtually free. Now, education has spread to all parts of the country. Thimphu has several educational institutions from schooling level to the college level in several disciplines. There are more private schools in Thimphu than in any other place in Bhutan, which are all under the control of the Department of Education. The National Training Authority administers three technical institutes.\nThe Royal University of Bhutan (known as the RUB) located in the city was established in 2003.\nThis university includes several colleges including the Institute for Language and Culture Studies (ILCS) which provides training to undergraduate students in national language, culture and traditions of Bhutan at Simtokha Dzong. Students who graduate from this school primarily become Dzongkha teachers. Also included is the Royal Institute of Health Sciences (RIHS), which provides training to nurses and technicians, and the Royal Institute of Management (RIM) which provides training in administrative and financial management to mid-level manager. Aside from the government run colleges, private schools and colleges have also been set up in Thimphu and other regions of the country.\nWith World Bank funding, an IT Park is proposed in an area of , in of land at Babesa, within Thimphu's municipal limits. This facility shall have an incubation centre, shared technology centre and data centre without any manufacturing facility. It is a joint venture project of Thimphu Tech Park Pvt. Ltd., of Assetz Property Group Pvt. Ltd., of Singapore and Druk Holding &amp; Investments Ltd of Bhutan.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nThe layout and position of the city roads in Thimphu are dictated by its unique topography. Most premier roads, typically wide, are aligned in a north\u2013south direction, parallel to the river; the most important artery is the Norzin Lam (\"Lam\" - road/street). Branch roads wind along the hill slopes leading to residential areas. Footpaths are also well laid with access to the commercial areas and the Wang Chu River. However, its entry point is at a narrow location from the south crossed by a wooden bridge. South of the bridge is the road to Paro, Punakha, Wangdue Phodrang, Tongsa and further to the east and north. The expressway which has been built has had a large impact on development, shifting land values, decreasing transportation costs, and increasing potential growth opportunity in the southern part of the valley.\nBhutan Transport Corporation runs a regular bus service from Siliguri (which along with nearby New Jalpaiguri station are the nearest railheads) in India. It takes about four hours to reach Phuentsholing. From there, buses ply to Thimphu every day. Taxis can also be hired.\nThe unique aspect of Thimphu roads and the traffic control over the road network is that it is one of the two national capitals in the world that does not have traffic lights (the other is Ngerulmud, Palau). Local authorities had installed a set of lights but before they became operational the lights were removed. Instead of traffic lights, the city takes pride in its traffic police that directs the oncoming traffic with their dance-like movement of their arms and hands. City Bus services operate throughout the day. There are plans to introduce tram services in the city.\nAir.\nThimphu is served by the only international airport of Bhutan, Paro Airport, which is about away by road. Druk Air had its headquarters in Thimphu but now there is only a branch office. Druk Air is one of only two airlines flying into Bhutan excluding charter flights by Buddha Air and is a lifeline with the outside world for the Bhutanese people, also supporting emerging inbound tourism and export markets. The airline has in recent times been criticised for its unreliability, particularly from the Bhutanese tourism industry which is still in its infancy, and regards the very company upon which it relies as its biggest threat. Tashi Air is a more recent private airline in the country, commencing operations in 2011.\nSports.\nThe Bhutan Olympic Committee was created in November 1983 with the King of Bhutan as its president, with its headquarters in Thimphu. Following this recognition, Bhutan participated for the first time in the 1984 Olympic Games held in Los Angeles when three men and three women archers represented Bhutan. For each Olympic Summer Games since 1984, Bhutan has fielded male and female archers. They have never competed in the Winter Games; they also have never won an Olympic medal.\nArchery (\"datse\") is the national sport of Bhutan, which is played not only with traditional bows and arrows but also with modern archery techniques at the Changlimithang Sports and Archery Stadium in Thimphu. Archery is central to the cultural identity of the nation and as a result all tournaments are started with a ceremony. Women come to witness the sports in their colourful best attire and cheer their favorite teams. Men stand close to the target and taunt the players, if targets are missed. The targets are spaced at intervals. Teams which win the tournaments celebrate with their supporters by singing and performing a dance jig. Archery is organized nationally within the Bhutan Archery Federation.\nSince monks are not permitted to participate in archery, they indulge in another popular sport called the \"daygo\", a stone throwing sport which involves throwing flat circular stone like a discus. Another shot put type game known as \"pungdo\" is popular and is also played with big and heavy stones. One more typical Bhutanese game is the dart game, known locally as \"Khuru\", which is played with short targets. The darts used in the game are made of a wood block set with a nail with fins of chicken feather.\nMany modern sports are also played in the national stadium in Thimphu, in addition to locally popular sports mentioned earlier. The sports activities in vogue are football, basketball, golf, \"Kwon do\" (Bhutan earned a gold medal in this game in the South Asia Federation Games in 2004), squash, golf (popular among the elite middle class) and in recent years cricket. Thimphu has 12 cricket teams and two small golf courses; one near the India House and the other between the Tashichhoe Dzong and the National Library, known as the Royal Thimphu Golf Course (a nine-hole course), established at the initiative of King Jigme Dorji Wangchuk in 1971.\nChanglimithang Stadium, a multi-purpose stadium in Thimphu, is the National Stadium. The stadium that was built in 1974 to celebrate the Coronation of the fourth Druk Gyalpo, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1974. It had a capacity to hold 10,000 spectators. However, it was completely refurbished in 2007 to accommodate 25,000 spectators for the Centenary of Wangchuk dynasty rule in Bhutan and also the Coronation Celebrations of the fifth king of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck, held on November 6, 2008. It now covers an area of about . This was also the location where national celebrations were held from the time of the third King of Bhutan. Historicity of the Changlimithang ground is traced to the 1885 battle that established the political supremacy of Gongsar Ugyen Wangchuck, Bhutan's first king. Adjacent to the main stadium are the football ground, the cricket field and archery range. Numerous archery tournaments are held here with both the imported compound bows and traditional bamboo bows. The main stadium is used for multipurpose sports and other functions. A documentary film known as \"The Other Final\" was filmed based on a special football match arranged by FIFA that was played between the 202nd placed (out of 203 worldwide) Bhutan and 203rd-ranked Montserrat.\nMedia.\nThe Bhutan Broadcasting Service was established in 1973 as a radio service, broadcasting on short wave nationally, and on the FM band, in Thimphu. It is run by the Government of Bhutan. The service started television broadcasts and satellite channels in 1999, during the coronation of the fourth king of Bhutan. Bhutan was then the last country in the world to introduce television. As part of the King's modernization program, cable television was introduced shortly after. In 2002, there were 42 TV channels under two cable operators.\n\"Kuensel\" was first started in Thimphu as a government bulletin in 1965, and then became a national weekly in 1986 and was the only newspaper in Bhutan until 2006 when two other newspapers, namely the \"Bhutan Times\" and \"Bhutan Observer\", were introduced. \"Kuensel\", which was initially government-owned, became an autonomous corporation incorporating the Royal Government Press, in 1992. It publishes the newspaper \"Kuensel\" in English, Nepali and Dzongkha (Bhutanese) languages.\nRadio Valley FM. 99.9, a new private radio station, has started broadcasting in Thimphu. This is in addition to the older stations of BBS and Kuzoo FM.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nrtpslot.vegas"}

The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as \"Grand Tunis\", has about 2,700,000 inhabitants. As of 2020[ [update]], it is the third-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers) and the eleventh-largest in the Arab world. \nSituated on the Gulf of Tunis, behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (\u1e24alq il-W\u0101d), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies the Medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the Medina, through the Sea Gate (also known as the \"Bab el Bhar\" and the \"Porte de France\"), begins the modern part of the city called \"Ville Nouvelle\", traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by media and travel guides as \"the Tunisian Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said.\nAs the capital of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the center of the country's commercial and cultural activities.\nEtymology.\n\"Tunis\" is the transcription of the Arabic name which can be pronounced as \"T\u016bnus\", \"T\u016bnas\", or \"T\u016bnis\". All three variations were mentioned by the 12th-century Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi in his \"Mu'jam al-B\u00fbldan\" (\"Dictionary of Countries\").\nDifferent explanations exist for the origin of the name \"Tunis\". Some scholars relate it to the Carthaginian goddess \"Tanith\" ('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities. Some scholars claim that it originated from \"Tynes\", which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present-day Al-Kasbah, Tunis's old Berber village.\nAnother possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root \"ens\" which means \"to lie down\" or \"to pass the night\". The term \"Tunis\" can possibly mean \"camp at night\", \"camp\", or \"stop\", or may have referred to as \"the last stop before Carthage\" by people who were journeying to Carthage by land. There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as \"Thinisa in Numidia\" (now El Kala), \"Thunusuda\" (now Sidi-Meskin), \"Thinissut\" (now Bir Bouregba), \"Thunisa\" (now Ras Jebel) and \"Cartennae\" (now T\u00e9n\u00e8s). As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads, they undoubtedly served as rest-stations or stops.\nHistory.\nCarthage and early settlements.\nThe historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive. While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, the main sources are Greek and Roman historians, including Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage. Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily, and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage. Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there were a few Greek authors who took a favourable view, these works have been lost. The area was originally a Berber settlement. The existence of settlements in and around the area of Tunis is attested by sources dating from the 4th century BC. Situated on a hill, its location served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed. It was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control, and in the centuries that followed the settlement was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage. Thus, during Agathocles' expedition, which landed at Cape Bon in 310 BC, the town changed hands on various occasions.\nDuring the Mercenary War, it is possible that the town served as a center for the native population of the area, and that its population was mainly composed of peasants, fishermen, and craftsmen. Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage, the town's ancient ruins are not as large. According to Strabo, it was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. Both the town and Carthage were destroyed; the former, however, was rebuilt first under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry. The township is mentioned as \"Thuni\" in the Tabula Peutingeriana. In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa, the town had the title of (\"way station, resting place\"). The borough, increasingly Romanized, was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop. However, it remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time.\nFoundation and early Islamic period.\nIn the late 7th century, the Arab Muslims conquered the region, and in 698 a commune and a mosque were established at the outskirts of the ancient ruins, founded by Hassan ibn al-Nu'man, which would become the city of Tunis and the Zaytuna Mosque. The Medina of Tunis, the oldest section of the city, dates from this period, during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate. The city had the natural advantage of coastal access, via the Mediterranean, to the major ports of southern Europe. Early on, Tunis played a military role; the Umayyads recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily, with a dockyard built upon the founding of the city by order of Caliph Abd al-Malik. From the beginning of the 8th century, Tunis was the administrative center of the area: it became the Umayyad, and later the Abbasids' naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea, and took on considerable military importance. Under the Aghlabids, the city gained significance and benefited from economic improvements and became one of the most important in the caliphate, and was briefly the national capital from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II, from 902 until 909, when control over Ifriqiya was handed to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate.\nLocal opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September 945, when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis, resulting in general pillaging. With the rise of the Fatimid-viceregal Zirid dynasty the Sunni population tolerated Shi'ite rule less and less, and carried out massacres against the Shi'ite community. In 1048 the Zirid ruler Al-Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city's obedience to the Fatimids and re-established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya. This decision infuriated the Fatimid Caliph Al-Mustansir Billah. To punish the Zirids, he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya; a large part of the country was set to the torch, the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in 1057, and only a few coastal towns, including Tunis and Mahdia, escaped destruction.\nExposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city, the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas, who was based in B\u00e9ja\u00efa, in 1059. The governor appointed by B\u00e9ja\u00efa, having reestablished order in the country, did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital. This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations and brought the region back to peace and prosperity.\nNew capital of Tunisia.\nIn 1159, the Almohad 'Abd al-Mu'min took Tunis, overthrew the last Khurasanid leader, and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis. The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia. Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia, Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital.\nIn 1228, Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and, a year later, took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty. The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez. Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom, surrounding the medina, the kasbah, and the new suburbs of Tunis. In 1270 the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France, who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity. King Louis easily captured Carthage, but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery. Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and his army were forced out. At the same time, driven by the reconquest of Spain, the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life.\nDuring the Almohad and Hafsid periods, Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000. Like the Almohads, the Hafsids maintained Christian mercenaries who lived in a neighbourhood closed off with a gate near the Hafsid palace complex. They worshipped in a church dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi which visitors described as \"very beautiful and great\" and which was allowed to ring the bell, a practice forbidden by the so-called Pact of Umar and a privilege not granted to the Genoese and Venetian merchants who maintained chapels in their merchant quarters. When Jean Adorno visited Tunis in 1470, he described these Christians as assimilated culturally and linguistically into Tunisian society, though they remained Christians and would sing in Latin during mass.\nDuring this period, one of the famous travelers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta. In his travel account, when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis, the population of the city came out to meet him and the other members of his party. They all greeted them and were very curious, many were asking questions, however, no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta, greatly upsetting him. He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes. This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset, he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn Battuta until he entered the city. At the time, the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta's stay, the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place. The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival, in extravagant and most luxurious outfits. Abu Yahya arrived on horseback, where all of his relatives joined him. After the performance, the people returned to their homes.\nSpanish occupation and Ottoman control.\nThe Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan, who fled to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Charles, suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba, Tunis, and Algiers, agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535, and the city was recaptured. The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luis P\u00e9rez de Vargas, fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defenses between 1546 and 1550. \nThe Ottoman Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis, at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles, retook Tunis in 1569. However, following the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re-establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October 1573. Following these conflicts, the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August 1574. Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople, the country attained a degree of autonomy. After 1591, the Ottoman governors (Beys) were relatively independent, and both piracy and trade continued to flourish. Under the rule of deys and beys, the capital sprang into new life. Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities, among which were Moorish refugees from Spain, and economic activities diversified. To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates, then in their golden age. Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages.\nIn April 1655 the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake's fifteen ships attacked the Bey's arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty. Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings. During this period, the city prospered as a center of commerce. Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house, Algerians captured Tunis in 1756 and put the country under supervision. Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet, and the city experienced a rebellion in 1811. Under the reign of Hussein Bey II, naval defeats by the British (1826) and French (1827) saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy.\nVarious sources estimate the 19th-century population to have ranged from 90,000 to 110,000 inhabitants. During the later 19th century, Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans, particularly the French, and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city. This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls, from 1860, to accommodate growth in the suburbs. The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake, and the new districts were modernized with running water (1860), lighting gas (1872), roads, waste collection (1873), and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city center. The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat, as the newcomers increased trade with Europe, introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life.\nDevelopment under the French protectorate.\nThe creation of the French protectorate in 1881 was a turning point in Tunis's history, leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades. The city quickly spread out of its fortifications: it divided into a traditional Arab-populated old city, and a new city populated by immigrants, with a different structure from that of the traditional medina. Tunis also benefited from the French construction of a water supply, natural gas and electricity networks, public transport services, and other public infrastructure.\nUnder French rule, a substantial number of Europeans settled (like the Tunisian Italians); half of the population was European in origin. The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods.\nTunis was quiet during the First World War. After the war, the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions. In addition, a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper. In the economic sphere, commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow, while traditional industry continued to decline.\nDuring World War II, Tunis was held by Axis forces from November 1942 to May 1943. It was their last base in Africa, as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east. \nOn 7 May 1943, at about 15:30 in the afternoon, Tunis fell to troops of British 1st Army and the U.S. 1st Army, which had defeated the German 5th Panzer Army guarding the city. At midday on 20 May 1943, the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Galli\u00e9ni, and Avenue Jules Ferry, to signal the end of fighting in North Africa.\nHaving succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia, the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria, and then Sicily, and finally the mainland of Italy.\nGrowth since independence.\nAfter independence in 1956, Tunis consolidated its role as the capital, first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs. In a very short time, the colonial city transformed rapidly. As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population, the conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population.\nBecause of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital, the city continued to grow, even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs. Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded. New buildings have come to influence the urban landscape. At the same time, an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy. The Medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979.\nThe Arab League represents 22 Arab nations. It transferred its headquarters to Tunis in 1979 because of Egypt's peace with Israel. The Arab League returned to Egypt in 1990.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003. In 1985, the PLO's headquarters was bombed by Israeli Air Force F-15s, killing approximately 60 people.\n21st century.\nMany protests took place during the Arab Spring of 2011\u201312.\nOn 18 March 2015, two gunmen attacked the Bardo National Museum and held hostages. Twenty civilians and one policeman were killed in the attack, while around 50 others were injured. Five Japanese, two Colombians, and visitors from Italy, Poland, and Spain were among the dead. Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police. The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack.\nOn July 25th, 2025, hundreds of Tunisians protested in Tunis against incumbent president Kais Saied\u2019s alleged authoritarian leadership. Protesters marched under slogans such as \u201cThe Republic is a large prison\u201d and demanded the release of jailed opposition leaders, journalists, and activists. Saied has ruled by decree ever since 2021 after dissolving the parliament. The protesters called this move a \u201ccoup.\u201d They chanted, \u201cNo fear, no terror\u2026 streets belong to the people,\u201d and \u201cthe people want the fall of the regime.\u201d The protesters also carried with them a cage they said represented the political system in Tunisia. \nGeography.\nTunis is located in north-eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis, and is connected to the Mediterranean sea's Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette/Halq al Wadi. The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part. The city is further South than Sicily, on a similar latitude to C\u00e1diz, an ancient city in Southern Spain with ties to the Phoenician and Carthaginian civilizations.\nThe city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis. These hills contain places such as Notre-Dame de Tunis, Ras Tabia, La Rabta, La Kasbah, Montfleury, and La Manoubia with altitudes just above . The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and S\u00e9joumi. The isthmus between them is what geologists call the \"Tunis dome\", which includes hills of limestone and sediments. It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it. The roads also connect with Carthage, emphasizing its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.\nThe Greater Tunis area has an area of , 10% of which are urbanized, the rest being shared between bodies of water ( of lakes or lagoons) and agricultural or natural land (). However, urban growth, which is estimated to be increasing by 500 hectares per year, is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl.\nSuburbs.\nAfter World War II, suburbs began to rapidly spring up on the outskirts of Tunis. These form a large percentage of the population of the Tunis metropolitan area. It grew from 27% of the total population in 1956, to 37% in 1975 and 50% in 2006.\nClimate.\nTunis has a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"BSh\") bordering a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\"), characterized by hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. The local climate is also affected somewhat by the latitude of the city, the moderating influence of the Mediterranean sea, and the terrain of the hills.\nWinter is the wettest season of the year, when more than a third of the annual rainfall falls during this period, raining on average every two or three days. The sun may still increase the temperature from in the morning to in the afternoon on average during the winter. Frosts are rare. The lowest temperature of was recorded on 18 January 1979. In spring, rainfall declines by half. The sunshine becomes dominant in May when it reaches 10 hours a day on average. In March temperatures may vary between , and between in May. However, it is common for temperatures to soar even as early as April with record temperatures reaching . In summer, rain is almost completely absent and the sunlight is at a maximum.\nThe average temperatures in the summer months of June, July, August, and September are very high. Sea breezes may mitigate the heat, but sometimes the sirocco winds reverse the trend. Occasional thunderstorms in the afternoon can develop quickly, especially after the periods of extremely hot weather. They usually do not produce precipitation (see dry thunderstorm), but may be accompanied by a brief shower. The highest temperature of was recorded at Tunis-Carthage International Airport on July 24, 2023. In autumn, it begins to rain, often with short thunderstorms, which can sometimes cause flash floods or even flood some parts of the city. The month of November marks a break in the general heat with average temperatures ranging from .\nPolitics.\nCapital.\nTunis has been the capital of Tunisia since 1159. Under Articles 43 and 24 of the Constitution of 1959, Tunis and its suburbs host the national institutions: the Presidential Palace, which is known as Carthage Palace, residence of the President of Tunisia, the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Advisors and parliament, the Constitutional Council and the main judicial institutions and public bodies. The revised Tunisian Constitution of 2014 similarly provides that the National Assembly is to sit in Tunis (article 51) and that the Presidency is based there (article 73).\nMunicipality.\nInstitutions.\nFollowing the municipal elections of 6 May 2018, Ennahdha obtained 21 seats out of 60. Nidaa Tounes came second with 17 seats. On 3 July 2018, the head of the Ennahdha list Souad Abderrahim was elected by the council as the new mayor of the capital.\nBefore 2011, unlike other mayors in Tunisia, the mayor of Tunis was appointed by decree of the President of the Republic from among the members of the City Council.\nBudget.\nThe 2008 budget adopted by the City Council is structured as follows: 61.61 million dinars for operations and 32,516 million dinars for investment. It reflects the improved financial situation of the municipality, the year 2007 was a year registering a surplus in resources that allowed the settlement of debts of the municipality and the strengthening of its credibility with respect its suppliers and public and private partners.\nRevenues are generated by the proceeds of taxes on buildings and vacant lots, fees for the rental of municipal property, income from the operation of the public, advertising, and that the fact that the municipality has capital shares in some companies. On the expenditure side, provision is made for the consolidation of hygiene and cleanliness, the state of the environment and urban design, infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and renovation of facilities, and strengthening the logistics and means of work and transport.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe city of Tunis, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, now extends beyond the Tunis Governorate into parts of the governorates of Ben Arous, Ariana and Manouba.\nThe municipality of Tunis is divided into 15 municipal districts: These include El Bab Bhar, Bab Souika, Cit\u00e9 El Khadra, Jelloud Jebel El Kabaria, El Menzah, El Ouardia, Ettahrir, Ezzouhour, Hra\u00efria, Medina, El Omrane, El Omrane Higher S\u00e9joumi and Sidi El-Bashir.\nDemography.\nIn the years following independence, the population of the metropolitan area continued to grow: by 21.1% from 1956 to 1966 and by 28.5% from 1966 to 1975 (55.6% between 1956 and 1975). This steady growth was accompanied by changes that affected the nature of the settlement of the capital. Decolonization led to the exodus of some European minorities whose numbers dwindled every year. The gaps created by their departure were filled by Tunisians who emigrated to Tunis from other parts of the country.\nThe population of the city of Tunis exceeds 2,000,000 inhabitants. After independence, the Tunisian government implemented a plan to cope with the population growth of the city and country, a system of family planning, to attempt to lower the rate of population growth. However, between 1994 and 2004, the population of the governorate of Tunis grew more than 1.03% per annum. It represents, in the 2004 census, 9.9% of the total population of Tunisia. As in the rest of Tunisia, literacy in the region of Tunis evolved rapidly during the second half of the 20th century and has reached a level slightly higher than the national average. The education level is only exceeded by the neighboring governorate of Ariana which has many institutions of education.\nEconomy.\nOverview.\nProducts include textiles, carpets, and olive oil. Tourism also provides a significant portion of the city's income.\nBecause of the concentration of political authority (headquarters of the central government, presidency, parliament, ministries, and central government) and culture (festivals and mainstream media), Tunis is the only nationally ranking metropolis. Tunis is the heartland of the Tunisian economy and is the industrial and economic hub of the country, home to a third of Tunisian companies\u2014including almost all the head offices of companies with more than fifty employees, with the exception of the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa, headquartered in Gafsa\u2014and produces a third of the national gross domestic product.\nTunis attracts foreign investors (33% of companies, 26% of investments and 27% of employment), excluding several areas due to economic imbalances. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Tunis has the lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world. The urban unemployment rate of university graduates is increasing and the illiteracy rate remains high among the elderly (27% of women and 12% of men). The number of people living below the poverty line, falling at the national level, remains higher in urban areas. In addition, unemployment is high in young people aged 18 to 24, with one in three unemployed as compared to one in six at the national level. In Greater Tunis, the proportion of young unemployed is at 35%.\nGulf finance house or GFH has invested $10 billion in order for the construction of Tunis financial harbor, which will transform Tunisia as the gateway to Africa from Europe. The project hopes to boost the economy of Tunisia as well as increase the number of tourists visiting Tunisia annually. The project is going through planning.\nSectors.\nThe economic structure of Tunis, as well as that of the country, is overwhelmingly tertiary industry. The city is the largest financial center in the country hosting the headquarters of 65% of financial companies \u2013 while the industrial sectors are gradually declining in importance. However the secondary industry is still very represented and Tunis hosts 85% of industrial establishments in the four governorates, with a trend towards the spread of specialized industrial zones in the suburbs.\nPrimary industry such as agriculture, however, is active in specialized agricultural areas in the suburbs, particularly in the wine and olive oil industries. The generally flat terrain and the two main rivers in Tunisia, the Medjerda to the north and the Milian to the south, the soils are fertile. Tunis has several large plains, the most productive are in Ariana and La Soukra (north), the plain of Manouba (west) and the plain of Mornag (south). In addition, groundwater is easily accessible through the drilling of deep wells, providing water for the different agriculture crops. The soils are heavy and contain limestone in the north but are lighter and sandy containing clay in the south. There is much diversification in the municipality of Tunis, with Durum grown in Manouba, Olives and olive oil in Ariana and Mornag, wine (Mornag), and fruit, vegetable and legumes are grown in all regions.\nArchitecture and landscape.\nUrban landscape.\nThe Medina, built on a gentle hill slope on the way down to the Lake of Tunis, is the historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey and many mosques such as the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. Some of the fortifications around it have now largely disappeared, and it is flanked by the two suburbs of Bab Souika to the north and Bab El Jazira to the south. Located near the Bab Souika, the neighborhood of Halfaouine gained international attention through the film 'Halfaouine Child of the Terraces'.\nBut east of the original nucleus, first with the construction of the French Consulate, the modern city was built gradually with the introduction of the French protectorate at the end of the 19th century, on open land between the city and the lake. The axis to the structure of this part of the city is the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, designed by the French to be a Tunisian form of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris with its cafes, major hotels, shops, and cultural venues. On both sides of the tree lined avenue, north and south, the city was extended in various districts, with the northern end welcoming residential and business districts while the south receives industrial districts and poorer peoples.\nSouth-east of the Avenue Bourguiba the district of La Petite Sicile (Little Sicily) is adjacent to the old port area and takes its name from its original population of workers from Italy. It is now the subject of a redevelopment project including the construction of twin towers. North of the Avenue Bourguiba is the district of La Fayette, which is still home to the Great Synagogue of Tunis and the Habib Thameur Gardens, built on the site of an ancient Jewish cemetery that lay outside the walls. Also to the north is the long Avenue Mohamed V, which leads to the Boulevard of 7 November through the neighborhood of the big banks where there are hotels and Abu Nawas Lake and finally to the Belvedere area around the place Pasteur. This is where the Belvedere Park lies, the largest in the city, and home to a zoo and the Pasteur Institute founded by Adrien Loir in 1893. Continuing to the north are the most exclusive neighborhoods of Mutuelleville which house the French Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France, the Sheraton Hotel, and some embassies.\nStill further north of the Belvedere Park, behind the Boulevard of 7 November are the neighborhoods of El Menzah and El Manar now reaching the peaks of the hills overlooking the north of the town. They support a range of residential and commercial buildings. To the west of the park lies the district of El Omrane which holds the main Muslim cemetery in the capital and the warehouses of public transport. Heading east is the Tunis-Carthage International Airport and the neighborhoods of Borgel, giving his name to the existing Jewish and Christian cemeteries in the capital, and the neighborhood of Montplaisir. Beyond that, several kilometers north-east, on the road to La Marsa, the Berges du Lac was built on land reclaimed from the north shore of the lake near the airport, which has held offices of Tunisian and foreign companies, many embassies as well as shops.\nSouthwest of the Medina, on the crest of the hills across the Isthmus of Tunis, is the Montfleury district then on down to the foothills of S\u00e9joumi, the poor neighbourhood of Mellassine. Northwest of the latter, north of the National Route 3 leading to the west, is the city of Ezzouhour (formerly El Kharrouba), which spans more than and is divided into five sections. It is still surrounded by farmland and vegetables are grown which supply many of the souks in the region.\nThe south of Tunis is made up of disadvantaged neighbourhoods, especially due to the strong industry in this part of the metropolis. These include Jebel Jelloud, located in the southeast of Tunis, which concentrates on the heavy industry of cement production, the treatment plant of phosphate s, etc. The main cemetery in Tunis, the Djellaz Cemetery, dominates this part of town, perched on the slopes of a rocky outcrop.\nM\u00e9dina.\nThe medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. The Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas, and fountains dating from the Almohad and the Hafsid periods. These ancient buildings include:\nWith an area of 270 hectares (over 29 hectares for the Kasbah) and more than 100,000 people, the Medina comprises one-tenth of the population of Tunis. The planning of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not grid lines or formal geometric compositions. However, studies were undertaken in the 1930s with the arrival of the first anthropologists who found that the space of the Medina is not random: the houses are based on a socio-cultural code according to the types of complex human relations.\nDomestic architecture (palaces and townhouses), official and civilian (libraries and administrations), religious (mosques and zaou\u00efas), and services (commercial and fondouks) are located in the Medina. The notion of public space is ambiguous in the case of Medina where the streets are seen as an extension of the houses and subject to social tags. The concept of ownership is low however and souks often spill out onto public roads. Today, each district has its culture, and rivalries can be strong.\nThe northern end supports the football club of Esperance Sportive de Tunis while at the other end is the rival Club Africain. The Medina also has a social sectorization: with the neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey and the Kasbah district being aristocratic, with a population of judges and politicians, while the streets of Pacha often being military and bourgeois.\nFounded in 698 is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the surrounding area which developed throughout the Middle Ages, dividing Tunis into a main town in two suburbs, in the north (Bab Souika) and the south (Bab El Jazira). The area became the capital of a powerful kingdom during the Hafsid era and was considered a religious and intellectual home and economic center for the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. A great fusion of influences can be seen blending Andalusian styles with eastern influences, and Roman or Byzantine columns, and typical Arab architecture, characterized by the archways.\nThe architectural heritage is also omnipresent in the homes of individuals and small palace officials as well as in the palace of the sovereign of Kasbah. Although some palaces and houses date back to the Middle Ages, a greater number of prestigious houses were built in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries such as Dar Othman (early 17th century), Dar Ben Abdallah (18th century), Dar Hussein, Dar Cherif and other houses. The main palace beys are those of La Marsa, Bardo, and Ksar Said. If we add the mosques and oratories (about 200), the madrasahs (El Bachia, Slimania, El Achouria, Bir El Ahjar, Ennakhla, etc..), The zaouias (Mahrez Sidi Sidi Ali Azouz, Sidi Abdel Kader, etc.) and Tourbet El Fellari, Tourbet Aziza Othman and Tourbet El Bey the number of monuments in Tunis approaches 600. Unlike Algiers, Palermo and Naples, its historical heart has never suffered from major natural disasters or urban radical interventions. The main conflicts and potentially destructive human behavior has been experienced in the city occurred relatively recently following the country's independence which is why it made into a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Medina is one of the best-preserved urban locations in the Arab world.\nFurthermore, along the boulevards, the contribution of the architectural period 1850\u20131950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and the headquarters of the municipality of Tunis.\nOther landmarks.\nSouks.\nThe souks are a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty. Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers, and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths, and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets.\nNorth of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the Souk El Attarine, built in the early 18th century. It is known for its essences and perfumes. From this souk, there is a street leading to the Souk Ech-Chaouachine (chachia). The main company that operates it is one of the oldest in the country and they are generally descendants of Andalusian immigrants expelled from Spain. Attached to El Attarine are two other souks: the first, which runs along the western coast of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, is the Souk El Kmach which is noted for its fabrics, and the second, the Souk El Berka, which was built in the 17th century and houses embroiderers and jewelers. Given the valuable items it sells, it is the only souk whose doors are closed and guarded during the night. In the middle, there is a square where the former slave market stood until the middle of the 19th century.\nSouk El Berka leads to Souk El Leffa, a souk that sells many carpets, blankets, and other weavings, and extends with the Souk Es Sarragine, built in the early 18th century and specializing in leather. At the periphery are the souks Et Trouk, El Blat, El Blaghgia, El K\u00e9babgia, En Nhas (copper), Es Sabbaghine (dyeing) and El Grana that sell clothing and blankets and was occupied by Jewish merchants.\nWalls and gates.\nFrom the early days of its founding, Tunis has been considered an important military base. The Arab geographer El Yacoubi has written that in the 9th century Tunis was surrounded by a wall of brick and clay except for the side of the sea where it was stone. Bab El-Jazeera, perhaps the oldest gate of the south wall, opened onto the southern road. Bab Cartagena gave access to Carthage, important for bringing in construction materials needed for the city. Bab Souika (initially known as Bab El Saqqayin) had a strategic role to keep the roads to Bizerte, B\u00e9ja and Le Kef. Bab Menara (initially known as Bab El Artha) opened onto the medina and onto the suburb of El Haoua. As for El Bab Bhar, it allowed access to some funduqs where Christian merchants lived in Tunis.\nWith the development of the capital under the reign of the Hafsids, two emerging suburbs grew outside the walls; Bab El Jazira in the south and Bab Souika to the north. In the early 14th century, Hafsid Darba Ab\u00fb al-Muhammad al-Mustansir Lihy\u00e2n\u00ee ordered the construction of a second chamber including the Medina and two suburbs outside. Six new gates were built including Bab El Khadra, Bab Saadoun, Bab El Allouj (initially called Bab Er-Rehiba), Khalid or Bab Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif, Bab El Fellah and Bab Alioua. In the Ottoman period, four new gates were established: Bab Laassal, Bab Sidi Abdesselam, Bab El Bab Gorjani, and Sidi Kacem. The city retains some of these gates including Bab El Khadra, Bab El Bhar, and Bab Jedid but some of the earlier ones have long disappeared.\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.\nAs in the rest of Tunisia, a very large majority of the population of Tunis (around 99%) is Sunni Muslim. The capital is home to a large number of mosques in various architectural styles, signs of construction of their respective eras. \nThe main and oldest of them is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, founded in 689 and built in 732 and is in the heart of the Medina. Practicing the Maliki rite as the vast majority of Tunisia's Mosques. It was completely rebuilt in 864 and is a prestigious place of worship, and was long an important place of culture and knowledge with the University of Ez-Zitouna on the premises until the independence of Tunisia. It still hosts the main ceremonies marking the dates on the Muslim calendar and is regularly attended by the president.\nThe medina contains most of the major mosques in the capital which were built before the advent of the French protectorate. The mosque in the Kasbah, was founded in 1230. Practicing the Hanafi rite since 1584, it is recognisable mainly by the dome as well as its minaret, similar to the Koutoubia in Marrakesh and is the highest in the city. Ksar Mosque, also of the Hanafi rite, is located in front of Dar Hussein (Bab Menara) and was built in the 12th century. The Hammouda Pasha Mosque, built in 1655, is the second mosque built by the Hanafi rite in Tunis. Youssef Dey Mosque operated primarily as a public speaking venue before becoming a real mosque in 1631. The Sidi Mahrez Mosque is the largest mosque Hanafi mosque in terms of area but not the tallest. Built in 1692, it resembles the Ottoman S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul. The Saheb Ettaba\u00e2 Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814 was the last mosque built by the Tunis Husseinites before the French occupation.\nThe presence of modern churches in Tunis is also testimony to the French presence for half a century. Tunis is the seat of the Diocese of Tunis, with the seat located at the Cathedral of St Vincent de Paul, The church was built in 1897 on the site of the old Christian cemetery of Saint-Antoine. This includes a network of Catholic buildings, including the Church of St. Joan of Arc, but also with the Protestant Reformed Church and the Anglican church Saint-Georges.\nGreeks used to enjoy an important presence in the city since ancient times. Tunis is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Holy Archdiocese of Carthage with jurisdiction over Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. It belongs to the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, and its cathedral, small school, and other buildings are in Central Tunis.\nIn total, there are three Greek Orthodox and two Russian Orthodox parishes in Tunisia. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria also maintains jurisdiction in Tunisia.\nThe small Orthodox community is centred around the Greek Orthodox Church (1862), managed by the Greek Embassy and the Russian Orthodox Church (1957), reflecting the presence in Tunisia of a small colony of Russian immigrants.\nJudaism, meanwhile, enjoys a long tradition of presence in the city despite the emigration of a large part of the community after independence. Among the places of worship are Beit Yaakov Synagogue and especially the Great Synagogue of Tunis, built at the end of the 1940s to replace the former Great Synagogue which was demolished as part of the Jewish redevelopment area, the Hara.\nParks and greenery.\nTunis has some large parks, many of which were installed at the end of the 19th century by the authorities of the French protectorate. The largest Park, Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Park, which was founded in 1892, overlooks Lake Tunis. It is the oldest public park in the country and is built in the landscape style common to France. The park covers an area of more than one hundred hectares across roads that can be explored on foot or by car. It is also home to Tunis Zoo, which houses African fauna, and the Museum of Modern Art.\nHabib Thameur garden in Tunis has a central pond and flower beds. The Gorjani garden is an English garden located southwest of the city, which notably takes an irregular form, partly due to the steep topography of the land.\nCulture.\nMuseums.\nLocated in an old beylical palace (the palace of the Bey of Tunis since the end of the 18th century), the Bardo National Museum is the most important archaeological museum in the Maghreb, and has one of the richest Roman mosaic collections in the world. Its collections developed rapidly because of numerous archaeological discoveries in the surrounding territory.\nIn 1964, the Dar Ben Abdallah, a palace probably dating back to the 18th century, became the seat of the capital's Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions. In its exposition halls, it holds numerous traditional items, witnesses of the everyday lives of families of the Medina quarter.\nThe Museum of the National Movement is situated in Dar Ma\u00e2kal Az-Za\u00efm, which was the residence of nationalist Habib Bourguiba for the entirety of the fight for independence. After the advent of independence, a museum was built there to relate the details of the national struggle between 1938 and 1952.\nThe National Military Museum, opened in 1989 in the suburbs west of the city, holds a collection of 23,000 weapons, 13,000 of which date back to the 19th century, and some of which were used by the Tunisian troops during the Crimean War.\nMusic.\nTunis holds some of the most prestigious musical institutions in the country. The Rachidia was founded in 1934 to safeguard Arab music, and in particular to promote Tunisian and malouf music. The group is made up of 22 members, both instrumental players and choral musicians.\nThe Musical Troupe of the City of Tunis was created in 1954 by Salah El Mahdi. In 1955 he placed his student Mohamed Sa\u00e2da in charge of the ensemble, which at that time included the best artists, and later merged with the ensemble of Radio Tunis. This group contributed to the rise to stardom of numerous Tunisian singers, including Oulaya.\nThe Association of Arab Orchestra of the City of Tunis began its activities at the end of April 1982, as a workshop linked to the cultural center of the city. It worked on promoting Arab music, on music education and training, and on cooperation with various partners both in Tunisia and abroad. The Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, created in 1969 by the Minister of Culture, has also produced monthly concerts at the Municipal Theater and in various cultural spaces in the city.\nPerforming arts.\nTunis is a center of Tunisian culture. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Tunis, opened on 20 November 1902, showcases opera, ballet, symphonic concerts, drama, etc. On the stage of this theater, many performances are regularly given by Tunisian, Arabic, and international actors. The National Theatre of Tunisia is an important public enterprise in Tunis, and since 1988 been located in the Khaznadar palace (dating from the middle of the 19th century and situated in the Halfaouine quarter), renamed \"Theater Palace\". In 1993, it also took possession of the former movie theater Le Paris, with a 350-person seating capacity. During each \"cultural season\" (from October 1 to 30 June) the theater holds over 80 events. The Al Hamra theater was the second theater to be opened in Tunis, situated on El Jazira Road. Al Hamra was one of the most famous theaters in the capital during the 1930s and 1940s. After being closed for fifteen years, it was turned into a small theater in 1986, and since 2001 has housed the first Arab-African center for theater training and research. One should also note the El Teatro and \u00c9toile du Nord theater groups.\nOther arts are also represented in the capital. The National Center of the Arts established the puppet theatre in 1976. The National School of Circus Arts was founded following a meeting between the Director of the National Theater and the Director General of the National Center for Arts of Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (France) in 1998. In addition, various small theatres and cultural centers are scattered throughout the city and display various artistic performances.\nFilm.\nFilm producers and cinema have long been present in the city of Tunis. The first animated film was shown in Tunis by the Lumiere brothers as early as 1896. The first screenings were held the following year and the first cinema, the Omnia Path\u00e9, opened in October 1908. The first film club opened in Tunis in 1946 and the Globe, in 1965. The Carthage Film Festival is the oldest established film festival in Africa, running biennially until 2014 and annually thereafter.\nIn 1990, Ferid Boughedir shot the notable film \"Halfaouine Child of the Terraces\" in Halfaouine district. The films \"The English Patient\" (1996) and \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (2003) were also shot in studios in Tunis.\nFestivals.\nThe city holds several festivals each year, of which the largest is the International Festival of Carthage which takes place in July and August. Founded in 1964, much of the festival is held in Carthage in an old amphitheater with a capacity of 7,500 seats. It hosts the performances of singers, musicians, actors, dancers, and films on display on outdoor screens.\nEducation.\nTunis and its suburbs have many of the major Tunisian universities including the University of Tunis, Tunisia Private University, University of Ez-Zitouna, the University of Tunis \u2013 El Manar, the University of Carthage and the Manouba University. It therefore has the highest concentration of students in Tunisia, with a student population of 75,597 as of 2006[ [update]].\nThere are also a number of other post-secondary institutions, such as the National School of Engineers of Tunis, the National School of Science, the Graduate School of Communications of Tunis, and the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Communications of Tunis. In addition, private training institutes include the Open University of Tunis, the Central University Private Business Administration and Technology, the Graduate School of Private Engineering and Technology, and the North African Institute of Economics and Technology.\nAmong the high schools in the capital, the best-known are the Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue du Pacha (founded 1900), Lyc\u00e9e Bab El Khadhra, Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue de Russie, Lyc\u00e9e Bourguiba (formerly Lyc\u00e9e Carnot de Tunis), and the Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui. Until independence, Sadiki College (founded 1875) and Khaldounia (founded 1896) were also among the most recognized. A legacy of the French presence in the country remains, and the city retains many French schools, the most important being the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France at Mutuelleville.\nStudents can pursue language studies at small private schools such as Sidi Bou Said Centre for Languages (Centre Sidi Bou Said de Langues et d'Informatique) in the picturesque Tunis suburb of Sidi Bou Said, next to the Sidi Bou Said TGM station that specializes in Arabic, offering classes in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), classical Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and the various dialects of North Africa, the Gulf and the Levant.\nLibraries.\nTunis has some of the most important libraries in Tunisia including the National Library of Tunisia which was first installed in 1924 in the Medina, in a building built in 1810 by Hammouda Bey to serve as barracks for troops and then a jail. The library moved to its current location on Boulevard 9 April in 1938. The new building contains a reading room, conference room, laboratories, an exhibition gallery, a block of technical and administrative services, a restaurant, parking, and green space areas.\nHoused in a former home of a Hafsid scholar, the library of the Khaldounia was founded in 1896 along with the creation of the educational institution. After independence and following the consolidation of programs of education, the association ceased operations but the library is now linked to the National Library, which provides for its management.\nBuilt in the 17th century, the Dar Ben Achour also contains a library. Acquired in the late 1970s by the municipality of Tunis, the house was restored in 1983 into a library.\nIn the arts.\nAn engraving of a painting by Charles Bentley entitled . was published in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1838 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon that comments on the potential the city has for development.\nTransport.\nPublic transport.\nThe growing metropolitan area is served by an extensive network of public transportation including buses, an above-ground light rail system (le Metro), as well a regional train line (the TGM) that links the city center to its closest northern suburbs. Multi-lane autoroutes surround the city and serve the increasing number of privately owned cars one encounters in Tunisia.\nThe Tunis area is served by the m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger (Ar.: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa), as well as bus services, and is linked to other places in Tunisia by SNCFT, the national railways. The important transport authorities are the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Transports de Tunis (STT) and the Ministry of Transport (Airports)\nThe city has, as of the beginning of the 21st century, a public transportation system developed under the management of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de Tunis (STT). In addition to some 200 bus routes, the first light rail line opened in 1985. The M\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger de Tunis network has extended gradually since then to reach the suburbs. The capital is also linked to its northern suburbs by the railway line that crosses the lake, dividing the lake into two.\nNew mass transit was planned for Greater Tunis in 2009. This was the RTS (rapid rail network), the local equivalent of the Paris RER, which was to carry tens of thousands of travellers from the distant suburbs of Tunis to the centre by using either existing tracks or new tracks yet to be built.\nThe plan was for lines based on certain criteria such as population density and the lack of coverage for a given area. Among the priority lines were: Tunis-Borj C\u00e9dria (23\u00a0km) where modernization and electrification are already planned; Tunis-Mohamedia-Fouchana (19.4\u00a0km); Tunis-Manouba-Mnihla (19.2\u00a0km); Tunis-Ezzouhour-Sidi Hassine S\u00e9joumi (13.9\u00a0km). In addition, the TGM will be integrated into the light-rail network and a new line built around Ayn Zaghouan and Bhar Lazrag (8.4\u00a0km). Such an operation would require the upgrading of the docks' TGM stations so that they become suitable for light rail trains. Among other projects are a line to the city of Ennasr (8.4\u00a0km) and the extension of the Tunis-Ettadhamen to Mnihla (1.7\u00a0km). For its part, the south light-rail line was extended in November 2008 to El Mourouj with a length of . The total length of the network will eventually be in the range of .\nInfrastructure.\nTunis is served by Tunis-Carthage International Airport, located northeast of downtown, which began operating in 1940 under the name of Tunis El Aouina.\nAfter independence, in the 1960s, the National Board of Seaports, which supports all ports in the country, modernized the infrastructure of the port of Tunis. In the 21st Century, the port of Tunis underwent further transformation with a marina as part of the redevelopment district of La Petite Sicile.\nTunis is the starting point from which the main roads and all highways that serve different parts of the country of Tunis originate. This city has a high density of traffic because vehicle ownership is rising at 7.5% per year. The capital is home to approximately 40% of the cars in Tunisia, with 700,000 cars on average used in the city per day. In this context, major road infrastructure (bridges, interchanges, roads, etc..) was initiated in the late 1990s to decongest the main areas of the capital. The main roads to other Tunisian cities include: Autoroute A1, Tunis-Sfax; Autoroute A3, Tunis-Oued Zarga; and Autoroute A4, Tunis-Bizerte. Also, as part of the major infrastructure project, the city's traffic lights were increased from 5,000 to 7,500.\nSport.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sports institutions were established in Tunis, particularly in school and college settings. In 1905 the Muslim Association of Tunisia brought together students from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Sadiki College to organize gymnastics. A regional gymnastics competition was held in Tunis in 1912 with the participation of thousands of French gymnasts.\nFootball made its appearance in the capital on 15 September 1904, followed by the formal creation of the country's first league, the Racing Club Tunis, on 11 May 1905. It took some time to run properly, but it soon organized meetings between the teams in schools. The first took place on 9 June 1907, between teams from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Lyc\u00e9e Carnot (1\u20131).\nFootball is not the only discipline to emerge. Between 1928 and 1955 the city hosted nine rounds of the Grand Prix of Tunis, where notable drivers such as Marcel Lehoux, Achille Varzi, Tazio Nuvolari and Rudolf Caracciola took part. The Grand Prix of Tunis has re-emerged since 2000. The city has also held the Mediterranean Games twice, in 1967 and 2001, and the international tennis tournament, the Tunis Open, which is included in the ATP Challenger Series. The 2005 World Championship final for men in team handball was played in Tunis.\nIn total, the governorate of Tunis registered 24,095 licenses for various clubs in the municipal area in 2007. Regarding international basketball, the city hosted the FIBA Africa Championship 1965 and the FIBA Africa Championship 1987.\nThe Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST), Club Africain (CA), and Stade Tunisien are the major sports clubs in the city. A symbolic class difference is present between the EST's and the CA's supporters, despite their playing at the same stadium. The EST is supported by the majority of the masses, while the CA, a poorer club, is supported by the others.\nThe first true sports facilities were managed under the French protectorate, as illustrated by the development of the Ksar Said racecourse and construction of the Stade Chedli Zouiten in the neighborhood of Belvedere, which had long been the main stadium in the capital before being supplanted by the Olympic stadium, Stade El Menzah, where EST and CA play their football today. The Olympic stadium and village area were built to accommodate the Mediterranean Games in 1967. A 60,000-seat stadium was also built in Rad\u00e8s for the Mediterranean Games in 2001 at an estimated cost of 170 million dinars, with nearly half of the loans financed by South Korean businessmen. The Olympic Village was financed by an investment estimated at 50 million dinars. In 2008, the government announced the start of construction of a large sports complex that will include several sports academies, a 20,000-seat stadium, and a swimming centre. Known as Tunis Sports City, it will expand around the lake of Tunis, on the road to La Marsa.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nTunis is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther cooperations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located between the Grand Harbour to the east and Marsamxett Harbour to the west, its population as of 2021 was 5,157. As Malta\u2019s capital city, it is a commercial centre for shopping, bars, dining, and caf\u00e9 life. It is also the southernmost capital of Europe, and, at just , it is the European Union's smallest capital city.\nValletta's 16th-century buildings were constructed by the Knights Hospitaller. The city was named after the Frenchman Jean Parisot de Valette, who succeeded in defending the island against an Ottoman invasion during the Great Siege of Malta. The city is Baroque in character, with elements of Mannerist, Neo-Classical and Modern architecture, though the Second World War left major scars on the city, particularly the destruction of the Royal Opera House. The city was officially recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980. The city has 320 monuments, all within an area of 0.55 square kilometres (0.21 sq mi), making it one of the most concentrated historic areas in the world. Sometimes called an \"open-air museum\", Valletta was chosen as the European Capital of Culture for 2018. Valletta was also listed as the sunniest city in Europe in 2016.\nThe city is noted for its fortifications, consisting of bastions, curtains and cavaliers, along with the beauty of its Baroque palaces, gardens and churches.\nHistory.\nThe peninsula was previously called \"Xag\u0127ret Mewwija\" (Mu' awiya \u2013 Meuia; named during the Arab period) or \u0126al Newwija. Mewwija refers to a sheltered place. Some authors state that the extreme end of the peninsula was known as Xebb ir-Ras (Sheb point), of which name origins from the lighthouse on site. A family which surely owned land became known as \"Sceberras\", now a Maltese surname as Sciberras. At one point the entire peninsula became known as Sceberras.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical affiliations\n Hospitaller Malta 1566\u20131798\n French Republic 1798\u20131800\n Protectorate of Malta 1800\u20131813\n Crown Colony of Malta 1813\u20131964\n State of Malta 1964\u20131974\n Republic of Malta 1974\u2013present\nRecent scholarly studies have however shown that the Xeberras phrase is of Punic origin and means 'the headland' and 'the middle peninsula' as it actually is.\nOrder of Saint John.\nThe building of a city on the Sciberras Peninsula had been proposed by the Order of Saint John as early as 1524. Back then, the only building on the peninsula was a small watchtower dedicated to Erasmus of Formia (Saint Elmo), which had been built in 1488.\nIn 1552, the Aragonese watchtower was demolished and the larger Fort Saint Elmo was built in its place.\nIn the Great Siege of 1565, Fort Saint Elmo fell to the Ottomans, but the Order eventually won the siege with the help of Sicilian reinforcements. The victorious Grand Master, Jean de Valette, immediately set out to build a new fortified city on the Sciberras Peninsula to fortify the Order's position in Malta and bind the Knights to the island. The city took his name and was called \"La Valletta\".\nThe Grand Master asked the European kings and princes for help, receiving a lot of assistance because of the increased fame of the Order after its victory in the Great Siege. Pope Pius V sent his military architect, Francesco Laparelli, to design the new city, while Philip II of Spain sent substantial monetary aid. The foundation stone of the city was laid by Grand Master de Valette on 28 March 1566. He placed the first stone in what later became Our Lady of Victories Church.\nIn his book \"Dell'Istoria della Sacra Religione et Illustrissima Militia di San Giovanni Gierosolimitano\" (), written between 1594 and 1602, Giacomo Bosio writes that, when the cornerstone of Valletta was placed, a group of Maltese elders said: \"\"Iegi zimen en fel wardia col sceber raba iesue uquie\" (Which in modern Maltese reads, \"Ji\u0121i \u017cmien li fil-Wardija [l-G\u0127olja Sciberras] kull xiber raba' jiswa uqija\"\", and in English, \"There will come a time when every piece of land on Sciberras Hill will be worth its weight in gold\").\nDe Valette died from a stroke on 21 August 1568 at age 74 and never saw the completion of his city. Originally interred in the church of Our Lady of the Victories, his remains now rest in St. John's Co-Cathedral among the tombs of other Grand Masters of the Knights of Malta.\nFrancesco Laparelli was the city's principal designer and his plan departed from medieval Maltese architecture, which exhibited irregular winding streets and alleys. He designed the new city on a rectangular grid plan, and without any \"collacchio\" (an area restricted for important buildings). The streets were designed to be wide and straight, beginning centrally from the City Gate and ending at Fort Saint Elmo (which was rebuilt) overlooking the Mediterranean; certain bastions were built high. His assistant was the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar, who later oversaw the construction of the city himself after Laparelli's death in 1570.\nThe \"Ufficio delle Case\" regulated the building of the city as a planning authority.\nThe city of Valletta was mostly completed by the early 1570s, and it became the capital on 18 March 1571 when Grand Master Pierre de Monte moved from his seat at Fort St Angelo in Birgu to the Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta.\nSeven Auberges were built for the Order's Langues, and these were complete by the 1580s. An eighth Auberge, Auberge de Bavi\u00e8re, was later added in the 18th century.\nIn Antoine de Paule's reign, it was decided to build more fortifications to protect Valletta, and these were named the Floriana Lines after the architect who designed them, Pietro Paolo Floriani of Macerata. During Ant\u00f3nio Manoel de Vilhena's reign, a town began to form between the walls of Valletta and the Floriana Lines, and this evolved from a suburb of Valletta to Floriana, a town in its own right.\nIn 1634, a gunpowder factory explosion killed 22 people in Valletta. In 1749, Muslim slaves plotted to kill Grandmaster Pinto and take over Valletta, but the revolt was suppressed before it even started because their plans leaked out to the Order. Later in his reign, Pinto embellished the city with Baroque architecture, and many important buildings such as Auberge de Castille were remodeled or completely rebuilt in the new architectural style.\nIn 1775, during the reign of Ximenes, an unsuccessful revolt known as the Rising of the Priests occurred in which Fort Saint Elmo and Saint James Cavalier were captured by rebels, but the revolt was eventually suppressed.\nFrench occupation and British rule.\nIn 1798, the French invaded the island and expelled the Order. After the Maltese rebelled, French troops continued to occupy Valletta and the surrounding harbour area, until they capitulated to the British in September 1800. In the early 19th century, the British Civil Commissioner, Henry Pigot, agreed to demolish the majority of the city's fortifications. The demolition was again proposed in the 1870s and 1880s, but it was never carried out and the fortifications have survived largely intact.\nEventually, building projects in Valletta resumed under British rule. These projects included widening gates, demolishing and rebuilding structures, widening newer houses over the years, and installing civic projects. The Malta Railway, which linked Valletta to Mdina, was officially opened in 1883. It was closed down in 1931 after buses became a popular means of transport.\nIn 1939, Valletta was abandoned as the headquarters of the Royal Navy Mediterranean Fleet due to its proximity to Italy, and the city became a flash point during the subsequent two-year long Siege of Malta. German and Italian air raids throughout the Second World War caused much destruction in Valletta and the rest of the harbor area. The Royal Opera House, constructed at the city entrance in the 19th century, was one of the buildings lost to the raids.\nContemporary.\nIn 1980, the 24th Chess Olympiad took place in Valletta.\nThe entire city of Valletta has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1980, along with Megalithic Temples of Malta and the Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni. On 11 November 2015, Valletta hosted the Valletta Summit on Migration, in which European and African leaders discussed the European migrant crisis. After that, on 27 November 2015, the city also hosted part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2015.\nValletta was the European Capital of Culture in 2018.\nGovernment.\nLocal government.\nThe City of Valletta, Malta\u2019s Capital, was founded in 1566 by Grand Master of the Knights of St. John. \nDuring the period of the Knights of Malta, Valletta had its own Municipal Administrative Council, the Universit\u00e0, administered out of what was known the Municipio or the Banca Giuratale. The Administration attracted notable Maltese personalities. The Universitas of Valletta ran from 1577 to 1818 when the British Colonial Governor, Thomas Maithland suppressed it, taking full control of all administrative affairs of Malta. 175 year later, local administration was re-established in Malta.\nThe Valletta Local Council was established by the Local Councils Act of 1993, along with the other local councils of Malta. The first election was held on 20 November 1993. Other elections were held in 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2013, 2017. The present local council was elected in 2019. The local council is housed in a building in South Street. \nThe following people have served as Mayors of Valletta:\nNational government.\nValletta is the capital city of Malta, and is the country's administrative and commercial hub. The Parliament of Malta has been housed at the Parliament House near the city's entrance since 2015: it was previously housed at the Grandmaster's Palace in the city centre. The latter palace still houses the Office of the President of Malta, while the Auberge de Castille houses the Office of the Prime Minister of Malta. The courthouse and many government departments are also located in Valletta.\nGeography.\nThe Valletta peninsula has two natural harbours, Marsamxett and the Grand Harbour. The Grand Harbour is Malta's major port, with unloading quays at nearby Marsa. A cruise-liner terminal is located along the old seawall of the Valletta Waterfront that Portuguese Grandmaster Manuel Pinto da Fonseca built.\nClimate.\nValletta features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Csa\") with very mild, wet winters and warm to hot, slightly long, dry summers, with an average annual temperature above during the day and . Valletta experiences a lack of precipitation during the summer months and most of the precipitation occurs during the winter months. Winter temperatures are moderated by the surrounding sea, as a result, the city has very mild winters and a long seasonal lag. The official climate recording station in Malta is at Luqa Airport, which is a few miles inland from Valletta. Average high temperatures range from around in January to about in August, while average low temperatures range from around in January to in August.\nCityscape.\nThe architecture of Valletta's streets and piazzas ranges from mid-16th century Baroque to Modernism. The city is the island's principal cultural center and has a unique collection of churches, palaces and museums and act as one of the city's main visitor attractions. When Benjamin Disraeli, future British Prime Minister, visited the city in 1830, he described it as \"a city of palaces built by gentlemen for gentlemen,\" and remarked that \"Valletta equals in its noble architecture, if it does not excel, any capital in Europe,\" and in other letters called it \"comparable to Venice and C\u00e1diz\" and \"full of palaces worthy of Palladio.\"\nBuildings of historic importance include St John's Co-Cathedral, formerly the Conventual Church of the Knights of Malta. It has the only signed work and largest painting by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. The Auberge de Castille et Leon, formerly the official seat of the Knights of Malta of the Langue of Castille, L\u00e9on and Portugal, is now the office of the Prime Minister of Malta. The Grandmaster's Palace, built between 1571 and 1574 and formerly the seat of the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, used to house the Maltese Parliament, now situated in a purpose-built structure at the entrance to the city, and now houses the offices of the President of Malta.\nAdmiralty House is a Baroque palace dating to the late 1570s. It was the official residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet during the British era from the 1820s onwards. From 1974 until 2016, it was the site of the National Museum of Fine Arts.\nThe Manoel Theatre () was constructed in just ten months in 1731, by order of Grand Master Ant\u00f3nio Manoel de Vilhena, and is one of the oldest working theatres in Europe. The Mediterranean Conference Centre was formerly the Sacra Infermeria. Built in 1574, it was one of Europe's most renowned hospitals during the Renaissance. The fortifications of the port, built by the Knights as a magnificent series of bastions, demi-bastions, cavaliers and curtains, approximately high, all contribute to the unique architectural quality of the city.\nNeighbourhoods.\nValletta contains a number of unofficial neighbourhoods, including:\nEconomy.\nEurostat estimates the labour force in 2015 for the greater Valletta area at around 91,000 people. This corresponds to a share of just under 50 percent of Malta. As in Malta as a whole, tourism is an important economic sector. The most important tourist zone is the area surrounding the Grand Harbour. For the cruise industry, after several years of planning, work began in 2002 to build the Valletta Waterfront Project, a cruise terminal, in the Grand Harbour. There is also a publishing house in Valletta, Allied Newspapers Ltd., a media company. This company publishes the two market-leading newspapers, \"Times of Malta\" and \"The Sunday Times of Malta\".\nEducation.\nThe Valletta Campus of the University of Malta is situated in the Old University Building. It serves as an extension of the Msida Campus, especially offering international masters programmes.\nA church school, \"St. Albert the Great\", is also situated in Valletta. The Headmaster is Alternattiva Demokratika politician Mario Mallia.\nCulture.\nValletta was designated European Capital of Culture for 2018. The year was inaugurated with an event called Erba' Pjazez (Four Squares), with shows focused in 4 plazas in the city \u2013 Triton Square, St. George's Square, St. John's Square, and Castille Square \u2013 along with other shows in other points. This was followed by the unveiling of a public art installation, Kif Jg\u0127id il-Malti (Maltese Sayings), which featured a number of Maltese language proverb figured in gypsum, in order to engage linguistic heritage.\nSaint James Cavalier.\nSaint James Cavalier, originally a raised gun platform, was converted into a Centre of Creativity in the year 2000 as part of Malta's Millennium Project. It now houses a small theatre, a cinema, music rooms and art galleries. Various exhibitions are regularly held there. It has welcomed over a million visitors since opening.\nMusic.\nThe Valletta International Baroque Festival is held every year in January. Jazz music in Malta was introduced in the Strait Street area, frequented by Allied sailors during both World Wars. Malta's Jazz Festival took place here. Strait Street is also known as \"The Gut\". This area is undergoing a programme of regeneration. The city's dual band clubs are the \"King's Own Band Club\" () and \"La Valette National Philharmonic Society\" ().\nCarnival.\nValletta is the scene of the Maltese Carnival, held in February each year, leading up to Lent.\nIn 1823 the Valletta carnival was the scene of a human crush tragedy in which at least 110 boys died.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nValletta is twinned with:\nTransport.\nMalta International Airport is from the city in the town of Luqa. Malta's public transport system, which uses buses, operates mostly on routes to or from Valletta, with their central terminus just outside the city gate. Traffic within the city itself is restricted, with some principal roads being completely pedestrian areas. In 2006, a park and ride system was implemented in order to increase the availability of parking spaces in the city. People can leave their vehicles in a nearby Floriana car park and transfer to a van for the rest of the trip.\nIn 2007, a congestion pricing scheme was implemented to reduce long-term parking and traffic while promoting business in the city. An ANPR-based automated system takes photos of vehicles as they enter and exit the charging zone and vehicle owners are billed according to the duration of their stay.\nValletta is served by a fleet of electric taxis which transport riders from 10 points in Valletta to any destination in the city.\nAs of 2021, an underground Malta Metro is being planned, with a projected total cost of \u20ac6.2 billion, centred on the Valletta urban area.\nVirtu Ferries offer passenger and goods services to Pozzallo and Catania, Sicily.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

AllMusic describes Wakeman as a \"classically trained keyboardist extraordinaire who plied his trade with Yes and developed his own brand of live spectacular in a solo act.\"\nBorn and raised in West London, Wakeman quit his studies at the Royal College of Music in 1969 to become a full-time session musician. His early sessions included \"Space Oddity\", among other tracks, for David Bowie, and songs by Elton John, Marc Bolan, Cat Stevens, and Lou Reed. In 1970, Wakeman joined the folk rock group the Strawbs, during which his virtuosity gained national press coverage. He left in 1971 to join Yes, with whom he played on some of their most influential albums across two stints until 1980. During this time Wakeman began a solo career in 1973 and became an iconic and prominent figure in progressive rock. His highest-selling and most acclaimed albums were \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" (1973), the UK number-one \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" (1974), and \"The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table\" (1975), all concept albums. In 1974, he formed his band the English Rock Ensemble, with which he toured worldwide and continues to perform, and went on to score his first major film, \"Lisztomania\" (1975).\nWakeman had uneven success in the next two decades following a change in musical fashion and financial issues from two divorces. His most popular album was the conceptual rocker \"1984\" (1981), which was followed by the minor pop hit single \"Glory Boys\" from \"Silent Nights\" (1985). He expanded into other areas such as hosting the television show \"GasTank\", composing for television and film, forming record labels, and producing his first new-age, ambient, and Christian music with \"Country Airs\" (1986) and \"The Gospels\" (1987), respectively. In 1988, he reunited with former Yes bandmates for Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, which led to his third period in the group until 1992. Wakeman's most significant album of the 1990s was \"Return to the Centre of the Earth\" (1999), his first UK top 40 album in 18 years, and his piano album \"Piano Portraits\" (2017) produced his first UK top 10 album since 1975. Starting in 2009, Wakeman revisited his three hit albums of the 1970s by performing them live with new and expanded arrangements. From 2016 to 2020, Wakeman was a member of Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman. He continues to record albums and perform concerts worldwide in various capacities. His most recent album was \"Melancholia\", released in October 2025.\nWakeman's discography includes over 100 solo albums spanning a range of musical styles. He has also gained notoriety for his appearances on the television programs \"Live at Jongleurs\", \"Countdown\", \"Grumpy Old Men\", and \"Watchdog\", and for his radio show on Planet Rock that aired from 2005 to 2010. Wakeman has written an autobiography and two memoirs. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Yes. He was awarded a CBE for his services to music and broadcasting in 2021.\nEarly life.\nRichard Christopher Wakeman was born on 18 May 1949 at Perivale Maternity Hospital in Perivale, Middlesex. He is the only child of Mildred Helen (n\u00e9e Eastment) and Cyril Frank Wakeman. The family lived in Wood End Gardens in nearby Northolt. Cyril worked at a building suppliers, starting as an office boy at age 14 and worked up to became one of its directors, and was a pianist in Ted Heath's big band while he was in the British Army. Mildred worked at a removals firm. Wakeman attended Wood End Junior School until he was ten, followed by Drayton Manor Grammar in Hanwell. His summer holidays were spent with his parents in Exmouth. Although raised in a Christian family, Wakeman \"never had anything forced on me\" and attended South Harrow Baptist Church, which he enjoyed. He took up the church organ at twelve, joined the Boys' Brigade, and completed a two-year course to become a Sunday school teacher. At eighteen he decided to be baptised by immersion.\nWakeman was inspired to take up the piano at the age of five. His parents, aunts and uncle performed as a concert party troupe called The Wakemans until the war caused them to disband. They occasionally revived the act in the front room on Sunday evenings, playing the piano and singing songs which he heard from his upstairs bedroom. \"I used to climb out of bed and sit on the bottom of the stairs and listen.\" Eventually his parents allowed him to play a piece on the piano. \"Everybody clapped, and I thought, I'll have some more of that, and refused to go back to bed.\" Sergei Prokofiev made a strong impression on Wakeman after his father took him to a concert performance of \"Peter and the Wolf\" when he was about eight, which inspired him to tell stories with his music. He has since named the Russian composer a musical hero. Other musical influences on Wakeman during this time were trad jazz musician Kenny Ball, skiffle singer Lonnie Donegan, and pianist Russ Conway; his first music purchases were records by all three. His first keyboard was a reed organ bought from Woolworths.\nBetween the ages of seven and eighteen, Wakeman had classically trained piano and theory lessons with Dorothy Symes in Harrow, paid for by his father, who spent almost half of his income on tuition. Wakeman passed each grade with a distinction, and Symes recalled him to be an \"enjoyable pupil to teach, full of fun and with a good sense of humour\", but lacked discipline to practice scales. She noted his fondness to adapt arrangements and play a piece in his own style, revealing his natural gift at composition. His first performances to an audience were recitals that Symes put on for the parents of all her current pupils. He performed his first two recitals, \"Buy a Broom\" and \"See a Monkey on a Stick\", on stage in later life. His showmanship also developed early, when at age ten, he played Conway's honky-tonk piano hit \"Side Saddle\" instead of his intended rehearsed piece, a Clementi piano sonatina, at his annual school talent show. In the same year Symes entered Wakeman in the Southall Music Festival, which he won for his category. He went on to win many others on the competition circuit in the south and west London area over the next several years; biographer Dan Wooding reported over 100 certificates and 20 medals and cups.\nWakeman described himself as \"a horror\" at Drayton Manor school, \"I worked hard in the first year then eased up.\" He passed music, art, maths and English at O Level, and chose to study music, art, and British constitution at A-level. He failed the latter. He played in the school football team.\nCareer.\n1962\u20131969: Early career and Royal College of Music.\nWakeman played in his first band, the trad jazz outfit Brother Wakeman and the Clergymen, at age 12. Their name derived from wearing the uniform of the school shirt put on the wrong way round, to which a friend said they looked like vicars. In the same year Wakeman started playing the clarinet, and was second clarinettist in the school orchestra. In 1963 he joined the Atlantic Blues, a local five-piece group that secured a year's residency at a club for the mentally disabled in Neasden, which taught him the discipline of working within a band. He formed Curdled Milk, a joke on \"Strange Brew\" by Cream, to perform at the annual school dance. The band were unpaid after Wakeman lost control of his car and drove across the headmaster's rose garden at the front of the school, thereby forfeiting their performance fee to pay for the damage. Shortly after Wakeman, already a member of the Atlantic Blues, joined the Concordes (later the Concorde Quartet), playing dance and pop songs at local events with his cousin Alan Wakeman on saxophone and clarinet. Money earned from these gigs was used to buy his first electronic keyboard, a Hohner Pianet.\nIn 1966 he formed his own dance band, the Green Dolphin Trio, who had a residency at the Brent council social club in Alperton. He left in the following year to join the Ronnie Smith Band at the Top Rank ballroom in Watford. Here he met singer Ashley Holt, who appeared on many of Wakeman's future albums and tours. Smith fired Wakeman for not taking the dance music seriously enough, but was soon reinstated at the Top Rank in Reading. Around this time, Wakeman frequented the Red Lion pub in Brentford where he took part in jam sessions with several established musicians, including John Entwistle, James Royal, Nick Simper, and Mitch Mitchell. His first radio appearance followed soon after, when Royal invited him to take part in a live BBC session with himself, Entwistle, and guitarist Mick King.\nIn 1968, with support from his school, Wakeman acquired a scholarship at the Royal College of Music in London with the intention of becoming a concert pianist. He had to pass eight exam grades to earn his A-level music degree, but he eased up and had passed only six, which required him to do two years' work in ten months. With additional tuition from Symes, he put in the effort following a ten-shilling bet with his music teacher who believed he would not succeed, and refusing an offer to work with his father at the building suppliers. Wakeman entered the college on a performer's course with the piano as his first study, clarinet his second, and orchestration and modern music his third, but quickly found out that \"everyone else there was at least as good as me; and a lot of them much better\", and switched to a teacher's course. His orchestration professor, Philip Cannon, had a long-lasting influence on his own compositions.\nWakeman was enthusiastic to start, but this was followed with periods of disillusionment and frustration. His requests to start a rock and jazz club were denied, and one professor urged him to cut his hair short; Wakeman refused and let it grow even longer. His desire to study lessened, and spent more time drinking and hanging out with the staff at the Musical Bargain Centre, a music shop in Ealing. The owner, Dave Simms, gave Wakeman an evening job as pianist in his dance band and noticed his natural talent. One day guitarist Chas Cronk entered the shop in need of an organist and brass arranger for an upcoming recording session with Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue vocalist Jimmy Thomas. Simms suggested Wakeman, who attended the session with Cronk at Olympic Studios where he met producers Denny Cordell, Gus Dudgeon, and Tony Visconti, and engineer Keith Grant. It was his first time in a recording studio and scoring for brass; he incorrectly copied them in concert pitch, which the band corrected. Cordell was nonetheless impressed with his style of playing, and Wakeman accepted his offer to more session work for Regal Zonophone Records, which he used to compensate the small grant he had received to study, which was frowned upon by the college. Following encouragement from his clarinet professor, Basil Tschaikov, who had noted his growing preference for the more lucrative sessions and contemporary music, Wakeman dropped out from the college one year into his course.\n1969\u20131971: Session work and the Strawbs.\nAfter quitting the Royal College, Wakeman returned to the Ronnie Smith band at the Top Rank in Reading for a steady income. It was here that he met his first wife, Rosaline Woolford, and after three months, the pair became engaged. Since the Top Rank gigs were at evenings Wakeman worked sessions during the day, usually three or four, sometimes in different studios across London, starting on \u00a39 for a full session and \u00a36 for a half. Eventually, he earned as much as \u00a315. His ability to produce what was needed in a short time led to his nickname, One Take Wakeman. In addition to sessions for Dudgeon and Visconti, he had regular work from top session contractor David Katz, who at one point had Wakeman as his go-to piano player and had him play for the television series \"The Avengers\" and \"Jason King\". Wakeman is estimated to have participated in around 2,000 sessions in his career, performing and arranging music not only for other artists, but for film, television, and radio productions. Looking back on this busy period in 1976, he became increasingly disillusioned with session work because he was not involved in the songwriting, despite being paid well.\nOne of his earliest sessions was for Junior's Eyes, playing on a single and their debut album \"Battersea Power Station\", released in June 1969 with Visconti and Cordell as producers. In the same month, Dudgeon invited Wakeman into Trident Studios to play the Mellotron on \"Space Oddity\" by David Bowie, as neither was familiar enough with the instrument. They consulted Visconti, who recommended Wakeman after using him with Junior's Eyes. He recalled: \"We did a run-through and Rick came in at the right place. And what he played was exactly what I wanted ... We did one more take and it was a master. I thought, 'This is weird. This strange bloke was all covered in spots and had greasy hair, wearing the most dreadful clothes ... And off he went, just like that, back to his ballroom job.\" The single entered the UK top five and reached number one six years later. Wakeman received a \u00a39 fee for his contribution and gave an interview about the recording for the \"Middlesex County Times\", his first press appearance. He also played on the B-side, \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\", and another song, \"Memory of a Free Festival\", all three of which appeared on \"David Bowie\". In July 1970, Bowie performed an acoustic set at the White Hart pub in Acton after his weekly folk event failed to attract attendees and resulted in debt to the landlord. The gig drew around twelve people, as many thought the advertisements were a joke.\nLater in 1969, Wakeman joined the Spinning Wheel, the resident band at The Greyhound pub in Chadwell Heath, East London. He was taken on by owner Bob Wheatley, who had posted an advert in \"Melody Maker\" for an organist seven nights a week, including Sunday lunchtimes. Wakeman left home in the process and moved into a basement flat with Woolford in Ilford. During this time Simper invited Wakeman to join Warhorse, a band he was putting together after he was let go from Deep Purple. After several try-outs, Wakeman left before their first demo was recorded, showing a lack of commitment and difficulty adapting to their hard rock sound. Continuing with session work, Visconti had Wakeman play a single note on the piano at the end of Marsha Hunt's version of \"Walk on Guilded Splinters\" so he could be paid the session fee. The pair were part of a one-off recording with Marc Bolan that was released as a single under the pseudonym Dib Cochran and the Earwigs.\nIn March 1970, Dave Cousins of the folk band Strawbs offered Wakeman to join the group, who were booked for a week-long engagement at a rock circus in Paris. Visconti had Wakeman play the piano on their second album \"Dragonfly\", which was the first to have his name printed on the liner notes. He accepted, and the trip doubled as a honeymoon, having married Woolford just a few weeks before. During one show, unbeknownst to Wakeman, he pushed famed artist Salvador Dal\u00ed off the stage as he made a special guest appearance during his piano solo. The Strawbs' first major headline concert, on 11 July 1970 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, was released on the live album \"Just a Collection of Antiques and Curios\". Wakeman's virtuosity on the piano and Hammond organ brought him national press attention for the first time. \"Where is This Dream of Your Youth\" features an extended organ solo and \"Temperament of Mind\", a piano piece that developed from improvisations when the band would lose power during a gig, received a standing ovation. Wakeman was featured on the front page of \"Melody Maker\", calling him \"tomorrow's superstar\" and \"pop find of 1970\". His growing flamboyancy on stage was also reported, specifically regarding the use of a plank of wood studded with screws to hold down several keys, allowing him to play lead with both hands.\nWakeman continued to work sessions while he was in the Strawbs, and produced the theme tune to the television show \"Ask Aspel\". In early 1971, he arranged and played the piano on the Cat Stevens' UK top ten hit \"Morning Has Broken\", but was omitted from the credits. Stevens later apologised and, in 2002, had the record company pay Wakeman for the error, which he donated to one of Stevens' schools. Elton John had Wakeman play the Hammond organ on his 1971 album \"Madman Across the Water\", and was a special guest performer at John's concert at the Royal Festival Hall in March of the same year. Soon after, Wakeman found himself struggling to pay his rent for the week and desperate for work. A chance meeting with T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan on Oxford Street led to him playing a series piano glissandos on their song \"Get It On\", so he could be paid the session fee. In June 1971 Bowie invited Wakeman to his flat in Beckenham where he played early versions of some new songs on a guitar for him to learn for his next album, \"Hunky Dory\". Wakeman later called them \"the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life\", and his parts on the piano and Mellotron greatly influenced the direction of the final arrangements. \"Hunky Dory\" went to No. 3 in the UK and features the iconic songs \"Life on Mars?\", \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and \"Changes\". The experience had a lasting effect on Wakeman, who later said, \"I learned more about how to work in a studio from David than anybody.\"\nLater in 1971 an album of pop, folk, and jazz covers with Wakeman on the piano, the John Schroeder orchestra, and an unknown female vocalist was released as \"Piano Vibrations\". His name was omitted from the cover and liner notes, and he was paid \u00a336 for the four sessions it took to record it. Money that Wakeman had earned by this time allowed him and Woolford to move into a home in West Harrow. He also bought a Minimoog synthesiser at half price from actor Jack Wild, who believed it was defective because it only played one note at a time.\n\"From the Witchwood\" was his final album with the Strawbs, released in July 1971. It marked the growing differences between Wakeman and the rest of the band as his interest in their folk-oriented direction had waned, and his own songs were disregarded by Cousins who deemed them too complex musically and his lyrics \"awful\". Wakeman prioritised session work over the group and as a result, contributed little to the new music which sparked rumours of his imminent departure. The Strawbs promoted the album with a mimed performance of \"The Hangman and the Papist\" on the national television show \"Top of the Pops\", during which Wakeman played his Hammond organ with a paint roller which upset Cousins.\n1971\u20131974: First Yes stint, \"Six Wives\", and \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\".\nIn July 1971, Bowie invited Wakeman to join his new backing band, the Spiders from Mars, on the same day that bassist Chris Squire of the progressive rock group Yes asked him to join, as co-founder Tony Kaye was fired for his disinterest in keyboards other than the piano and organ. Wakeman met Yes during rehearsals for \"Fragile\" and helped contribute and arrange \"Roundabout\" and \"Heart of the Sunrise\", two of the band's iconic songs, during his first session. He decided to stay with the band as it presented more favourable opportunities, and news of his arrival in the following month made front-page news in \"Melody Maker\", his second cover feature in a year. His weekly earnings jumped from \u00a318 to \u00a350 a week.\n\"Fragile\" was recorded in five weeks so the band could resume touring and help finance new equipment for Wakeman. It features a solo track by each member; Wakeman's track, \"Cans and Brahms\", is an adaptation of the third movement of Symphony No. 4 by Johannes Brahms played on electronic keyboards. He later called it \"dreadful\" as contractual disputes between Atlantic Records, who had signed Yes, and A&amp;M Records, of which he had ties as a member of Strawbs, prevented him from recording an original composition. Wakeman said he was never credited for his contributions on \"Fragile\", including piano sections on \"Heart of the Sunrise\" and \"South Side of the Sky\", despite being told that management would sort the issue, but he enjoyed the music too much to cause further rifts. \"Fragile\" was a top ten hit in the UK and the US, and the subsequent Fragile Tour marked Wakeman's first visit to North America. While there he secured a five-album deal with A&amp;M.\nThe commercial success of \"Fragile\" allowed Wakeman to move into a large home in Gerrards Cross and start a car collection which he rented out through his new business, the Fragile Carriage Company. In the 1972 \"Melody Maker\" readers' poll, Wakeman ranked second in the Top Keyboardist category behind Keith Emerson. Yes followed \"Fragile\" with \"Close to the Edge\", now considered a landmark progressive rock album, and features Wakeman playing a wide range of keyboards, including a church organ and harpsichord. He is credited on the final track, \"Siberian Khatru\". While touring the album in the US in September 1972, a concert attendee offered his own cape for one of the band members to wear. Wakeman offered money but was given it for free, and he subsequently had his own made which coupled with his long blonde hair, created a distinct look. His first cape, made entirely of sequins by Denise Gandrup, cost US$300 to make. Wakeman is featured in the concert film \"Yessongs\", filmed at the Rainbow Theatre in December 1972, and features his solo spot in the show. In the same month at the venue, Wakeman took part in the Who's orchestral performances of \"Tommy\" as a guest musician. He also developed music for the 1972 British drama film, \"Zee and Co.\"\nWakeman's debut solo album, \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\", was released in January 1973. It was recorded throughout 1972 during gaps in touring and recording with Yes, and features members of the band, the Strawbs, and other guest musicians. The album is instrumental with its concept based on Wakeman's musical interpretations of the characteristics of the six wives of Henry VIII. Wakeman promoted the album with a mimed performance of \"Catherine Howard\" on the BBC television show \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\". Much of the television audience that night planned to watch \"Blue Movie\", an erotic film by Andy Warhol, but it was temporarily banned from broadcast for its explicit scenes. Wakeman said: \"It seems most of them, rather than watch repeats, switched over to \"Whistle Test\" and saw my preview of \"Henry\" ... and suddenly it seemed as if the whole country had discovered my music ... it was a tremendous break.\" The album reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 30 in the US, and was certified gold in the US and Australia. \"Time\" magazine named the record one of the best albums of the year. The \"Melody Maker\" readers poll awards in 1973 saw Wakeman win the Top Keyboardist category, surpassing Emerson.\nYes's double concept album \"Tales from Topographic Oceans\" was released in 1973, containing four side-long tracks based on ideas from Hindu scriptures in \"Autobiography of a Yogi\" by Paramahansa Yogananda. Wakeman had doubts about its esoteric concept and felt a lot of its music was too experimental, requiring further rehearsal. He distanced himself from the group, and spent time in the bar at Morgan Studios and played on \"Sabbra Caddabra\" on \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" by Black Sabbath in the adjacent studio. Yes toured the album for six months, playing the album in its entirety, which Wakeman also disagreed with. He openly criticised the album to the press, and his growing frustrations culminated in an incident in which he ate a curry on stage during a show in Manchester. In 2006, Wakeman clarified that his total dislike of the album is \"not entirely true\" and recognises some \"very, very nice musical moments\", but \"we had too much for a single album but not enough for a double, so we padded it out and the padding is awful\".\nDuring a break in the \"Topographic Oceans\" tour Wakeman recorded his new 40-minute work \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\", a musical adaptation of Jules Verne's science-fiction novel. Inspired to tell a story to music from \"Peter and the Wolf\" by Prokofiev, he came up with the idea in 1971 and worked with conductor David Measham and musical arrangers Wil Malone and Danny Beckerman on the piece, which features an orchestra, choir, rock band, and narrator. The album was recorded live in concert because a studio was too expensive, and Wakeman had to re-mortgage his home and sell several of his cars to help contribute \u00a340,000 to the production costs. Two concerts were held at the Royal Festival Hall on 18 January 1974, with the London Symphony Orchestra, the English Chamber Choir, actor David Hemmings as narrator, and Wakeman's five-piece band of musicians that he had played with in a west London pub\u2013vocalist Gary Pickford-Hopkins, drummer Barney James, bassist Roger Newell\u2013with his former Top Rank bandmate Ashley Holt on second vocals, and session guitarist Mike Egan. A&amp;M wanted better-known musicians for added prestige, but Wakeman wanted the album to be known for its music rather than the performers. The UK division of A&amp;M refused to sell it, but their decision was overturned as Wakeman was under contract with its US division, and label co-founder Jerry Moss had liked it and ordered its worldwide release.\nAfter touring \"Topographic Oceans\", Wakeman retreated to his Devonshire home. He heard early ideas for Yes's next album, felt he could no longer contribute to the style of music they were making, and confirmed his departure from the band on his twenty-fifth birthday. Later that day, A&amp;M informed him that \"Journey\" had entered the UK charts at No. 1, a first for the label. \"Journey\" also reached No. 3 in the US, and earned Wakeman a Grammy and Ivor Novello Award nomination. The album has sold an estimated 14 million copies worldwide. On 27 July 1974, Wakeman headlined the Crystal Palace Garden Party concert, performing selections from \"Six Wives\" and \"Journey\" in its entirety. By this time, his excessive smoking and alcohol consumption, a lack of sleep five days prior to the show, and a wrist injury from a fall had taken a toll on his health, and he needed morphine injections to get through the performance. Soon after the show, he suffered a minor heart attack.\n1974\u20131980: \"King Arthur\", \"No Earthly Connection\", and second Yes run.\nAlthough Wakeman's doctors advised him to reduce his workload and temper his excessive lifestyle, he continued to smoke and drink, and started to write music for his next album while recovering in hospital. He decided upon another concept album based on King Arthur and the various people and stories surrounding the legend named \"The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table\". Before recording the album Wakeman underwent his first tour as a solo artist that started with a 20-city trek across the US in September and October 1974, performing \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" plus selections from \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" with his band, the National Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir of America. Under doctors' orders, he was required to pass a heart monitor test before each performance. The tour continued to Japan, Australia, and New Zealand and finished in March 1975.\nRecording for \"King Arthur\" was finished in January 1975, and features Wakeman, his band, and Measham conducting the New World Orchestra and English Chamber Choir. Following its release in March 1975, the album went to No. 2 in the UK and No. 21 in the US, and earned gold certifications in the UK, Brazil, Japan, and Australia. The album was promoted with three sold-out shows at the Empire Pool with Wakeman performing with his band, orchestra, and choir to a total of 27,000 people. As the arena floor was already set up as an ice rink for a different attraction, Wakeman chose to present the show as an ice pageant with 14 skaters in costume and the musicians' stage placed in the round and decorated as a castle. The shows, though well received and a contributory factor to the album's commercial success, were expensive to produce. In 2009, the concerts ranked 79th on VH1's \"100 Greatest Shocking Moments in Rock and Roll\" program. From 1979 to 2005 (excluding 2001), and from 2019 onwards, the BBC used \"Arthur\" as the opening theme of its electoral broadcasts in the UK.\nBy mid-1975, Wakeman had achieved considerable success as a musician and contemporary rock composer. He was featured on the front cover of the January 1975 edition of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, had a farmhouse in Woodbury Salterton, Devon and purchased a former nursing home in Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire, where he housed his many cars. He ran a group companies known as Complex 7, which had a payroll of staff and a full rehearsal facility in High Wycombe. His life and career was featured on an episode of the BBC television documentary series \"Success Story\", broadcast in September 1975.\nWakeman assembled a new line-up of his band, now named the English Rock Ensemble, featuring Holt, Newell, Hodgson, and newcomers John Dunsterville on guitar, Reg Brooks and Martin Shields on brass, and Tony Fernandez on drums, who would perform on many of Wakeman's future albums and tours. The group toured the US, Canada, and Brazil from October to December 1975 with the latter dates featuring an orchestra and choir. The Brazilian leg was particularly successful, earning positive reviews and setting new audience attendance records which biographer Dan Wooding estimated to be 500,000 people in total.\nIn mid-1975, Wakeman composed and recorded the soundtrack album to \"Lisztomania\", a surreal biographical film about composer Franz Liszt written and directed by Ken Russell. The soundtrack features vocals from Roger Daltrey, who also stars in the film. Wakeman appears on-screen as Thor, the god of thunder, covered in silver paint. The soundtrack failed to chart in the UK, but went to No. 145 in the US. Wakeman looked back on the album in negative light as \"there was hardly anything of mine on it\", and criticised the production and final mix. He supervised a reissue of his original score entitled \"The Real Lisztomania\", released in 2002.\n\"No Earthly Connection\" was recorded in France and features Wakeman and his English Rock Ensemble. Initially, it was to be about mythological gods, but its lyrical subject matter changed after he claimed to have seen a UFO one night which inspired him to read up on the origins of mysterious phenomena such as the Bermuda Triangle, Stonehenge, and the Egyptian pyramids. Wakeman wrote the album without playing any of its music beforehand, and summarised it in the liner notes: \"A futuristic, autobiographical look at music, the part it plays in our pre-earth, human and after life\". Upon its release in April 1976, the album went to No. 9 in the UK and No. 67 in the US. Wakeman and his group toured the album worldwide.\nAfter touring ended in August 1976, Wakeman fell into financial trouble and was ordered to pay \u00a3350,000 \"in a matter of weeks\". Matters were worsened as his most recent tour had met its minimal expectations and its expenses had exceeded the profits. To help the situation he sold his Rolls-Royces, closed his car service company, and disbanded the English Rock Ensemble, and had further relief when A&amp;M agreed to pay his album royalties in advance. At the suggestion of his manager Brian Lane, Wakeman rehearsed with his former Yes bandmate Bill Bruford and King Crimson bassist/vocalist John Wetton for six weeks with the plan to form a rock supergroup, but disputes between the three musicians' managements coupled with the story being reported in \"Melody Maker\" caused the group to split. Around this time Wakeman finished recording the soundtrack to \"White Rock\", a documentary film about the 1976 Winter Olympics directed by Tony Maylam. The track \"After the Ball\" was one that Wakeman forgot to write; he proceeded to play it as a completely improvised single take, rather than confessing to the producers.\nWakeman's fortunes changed when he was invited to join Yes in Montreux, Switzerland in November 1976, as they were working on new songs for \"Going for the One\" (1977). Keyboardist Patrick Moraz had left during the early stages in part due to the \"enormous psychological pressures within the group\". Upon hearing the new material, which was more accessible and in a style that he could relate and contribute towards, Wakeman agreed to join the band initially as a session musician. Hours after he subsequently agreed to rejoin full-time, he found the \"Melody Maker\" had printed the headline \"Wakeman rejoins Yes\" as its front cover article. Lane had informed the press of his return without consulting him. \"Tormato\" (1978) features Wakeman playing a Birotron, a tape replay keyboard that used 8-track tape cartridges and contributed funds to its development. He is reported to have given the album its name by throwing a tomato at a showing of the art used for the album's cover.\nIn 1977, the press named Wakeman as one of the acts on A&amp;M Records who threatened to leave if the label signed the controversial punk band the Sex Pistols. He denied any involvement and said it was a publicity stunt derived by A&amp;M to drop the band. Wakeman has since dispelled rumours that he disliked punk rock, and was a key figure in getting American punk band The Tubes their first record deal, having suggested to George Daly that he contact A&amp;M executive Kip Cohen, who went on to sign them.\nWakeman's final albums for A&amp;M were released in the late 1970s. \"Rick Wakeman's Criminal Record\" (1977) is an instrumental rock album (apart from humorous vocals from Bill Oddie) similar to \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" but loosely based on criminality, and features Yes bandmates Chris Squire on bass and Alan White on drums, with Frank Ricotti on percussion. The album went to No. 25 in the UK and No. 28 in the US. The track \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" was used as the theme music to the BBC drama series \"My Son, My Son\" and subsequently released as a single. \"Rhapsodies\" (1979) was recorded in Montreux and released as a double album, with Wakeman playing shorter tracks of varied musical styles. It features Bruce Lynch, Frank Gibson Jr., and Tony Visconti as guest musicians. It also peaked at No. 25 in the UK. After touring with Yes in 1979, and failed attempts at making a new album with the band in Paris and London, Wakeman and Anderson left the group in early 1980.\n1980\u20131988: Albums for Charisma and President Records and venture into New-age and Christian music.\nIn 1980, after a four-year hiatus, Wakeman reformed the English Rock Ensemble for a European tour. Later that year he came close to forming a band with drummer Carl Palmer, bassist John Wetton, and guitarist Trevor Rabin, but opted out \"on a matter of principle\" as the record company was prepared to sign them without hearing any of the group's music. He looked back at this moment: \"I basically sealed my financial fate, and things went downhill fast.\" His father's death in November 1980 prompted him to leave Switzerland and return to the UK, which led to a record deal with Charisma Records to avoid bankruptcy. For several months of 1980 Wakeman was homeless due to his financial difficulties and second divorce, and resorted to sleeping on benches in Kensington Gardens until a former roadie let him sleep at his house.\nWakeman's first album for Charisma was \"1984\", a concept rock album based on George Orwell's dystopian novel, with a band including Steve Barnacle on bass, Gary Barnacle on saxophone, and Frank Ricotti on drums. The album features tracks with Chaka Khan, Jon Anderson, Kenny Lynch, and Tim Rice on lead vocals, who also wrote the lyrics. \"1984\" was released in June 1981 and reached No. 24 in the UK. Plans to have the album adapted into a musical were cancelled after lawyers from Orwell's estate blocked its development. In July 1981, Wakeman performed \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" for two shows in Durban, South Africa. This was followed by a world tour until the end of 1981, with a line-up of Holt, Fernandez, Tim Stone on guitar, Steve Barnacle on bass, and Cori Josiah on vocals. The tour became problematic due to growing friction within the band. In the same year, Wakeman recorded the soundtrack to the slasher horror film \"The Burning\" in New York City.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"[I] realised that there was a lot of independent labels starting up all over the place. So I contacted different countries, different labels and said look, what sort of music can you sell ... or are you looking for ... Of a period of about four years I produced about 30-odd different CDs for different markets around the world. And all of them, very, very small budgets ... it kept me alive, and kept me hanging on.\"\n\u2014Rick Wakeman on the impact the 1980s and 1990s had on his career\nWakeman's next album was \"Rock 'n' Roll Prophet\", a humorous spoof on the pop duo the Buggles released in 1982 on his own label, Moon Records. Initially titled \"Maybe '80\", it was recorded in Switzerland in 1979 but remained unreleased until he secured the rights for it following an appearance at the MIDEM music festival. A single from the album, \"I'm So Straight I'm a Weirdo\", featuring Wakeman on lead vocals, was released in 1980. Wakeman hosted the Channel 4 music show \"Gastank\" with Tony Ashton that aired in January and February 1983. He then released a second album for Charisma, \"Cost of Living\", a mixture of instrumental and rock tracks with Rice on vocals, which failed to impact the chart and \"did nothing\" to improve his finances. By this time, Wakeman was \"managerless, penniless and homeless\". In February 1983, he and Carter moved to Camberley, Surrey after the birth of their daughter Jemma. Wakeman took up work by recording the soundtrack to the official 1982 FIFA World Cup documentary film \"G'ol\u00e9!\", which was released around the same time as \"Cost of Living\" which hampered potential sales. He wrote the soundtrack for the film \"She\" with assistance from Justin Hayward and Maggie Bell, and his second Russell feature, \"Crimes of Passion\", with Bell on vocals, Fernandez on drums, and past Strawbs bandmate Chas Cronk on bass. Wakeman based the music around the themes of Symphony No. 9 by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. Wakeman also spent early 1983 writing the score to the ballet \"Killing Games\", but problems during its development led to the project being shelved, along with a potential double album of its music. In early 1984, Wakeman contributed three songs to the soundtrack of \"B.C. Rock\".\nIn 1984, Wakeman signed with the independent label President Records in an association that would last until 2007, for which he would produce almost 40 albums. The first was \"Silent Nights\", Wakeman's first solo album in over two years, featuring Fernandez, Cronk, and Rick Fenn on guitar and released in 1985. The single \"Glory Boys\" became a minor pop hit in the UK. In March 1985, Wakeman finished work on his part of the soundtrack to the comedy film \"Playing for Keeps\", which was followed by a tour of the UK, North America, and Australia to promote \"Silent Nights\". It was his first full-scale tour in four years, and his first shows in the US in over five. A live album from the UK leg was released as \"Live at Hammersmith\". The tour left Wakeman \"seriously in debt\", and he was forced to remortgage his Camberley home. In September 1985, during the tour's Australian leg, Wakeman fell ill from his alcoholism and has been teetotal since. Also in 1985, a single of Wakeman's theme tunes for the television shows \"Lytton's Diary\" and \"Database\" was released. By this time he had also composed music for the BBC show \"Paddles Up\" and the Channel 4 documentary \"Supercat\". Wakeman reunited with David Bowie to play the piano on his 1986 single \"Absolute Beginners\".\nThe latter half of the 1980s saw Wakeman venture into new musical genres. In 1986, he released his first album of new age music titled \"Country Airs\", formed of solo piano tracks inspired by walks in the countryside. It was a record he never had wanted to make, but was in need of money and accepted a \u00a35,000 advance from Coda Records to record it. It reached number one on the UK new age chart. Wakeman followed this with a tour of the Far East, and soundtrack work for \"Hero\", the film to the 1986 World Cup. In 1987, Wakeman joined the rock band Sky as a guest musician for an Australian tour. His association with new age music continued as the host of a weekly new age radio show on Capital Radio, and the release of \"The Family Album\", with a track dedicated to each of his family members and pets. The original pressing included music Wakeman had composed for the BBC television film \"The Day After the Fair\" and the feature documentary \"Mackintosh\". Also in 1987, Wakeman put out his first Christian music album titled \"The Gospels\", a double album based on the four Gospels that features tenor vocalist Ramon Remedios, actor Robert Powell as narrator, and the Eton College Chapel Choir. The music was originally written for a 1985 concert as part of a fund raising event for a church before it was expanded into a full album. Wakeman played the album with Remedios and his band at the Royal Albert Hall in London and in the following year, in Caesarea, Israel that was broadcast internationally on television. He returned to rock with \"Time Machine\", loosely based on the science fiction novel by H. G. Wells and features Roy Wood and Tracy Ackerman as guest vocalists. Released in 1988, Wakeman intended to record it with an orchestra and choir and put on a star-studded ice show, but the idea was cancelled due to lack of funds.\nIn March 1988, in a move to improve their finances, Wakeman and Carter sold their Camberley home and moved to Peel on the Isle of Man. A coach house on the site of their home was converted into a recording studio that Wakeman named Bajonor Studios, named after the first letters of his family. The 24-track studio was built as Wakeman had lost several opportunities to score films due to the high cost of renting large, professional studios, so he built his own as a compromise. Wakeman recorded there from 1990 until 2001. The new age-themed \"Aspirant Sunset\", released in 1990, was the first, and marks the first album with his longtime recording engineer Stuart Sawney. Wakeman donated 50p from every sale of his \"Aspirant\" album trilogy to CPRE, The Countryside Charity. Wakeman befriended fellow Isle of Man resident Norman Wisdom, and the two made an album together.\n1988\u20131997: ABWH, third and fourth Yes runs, \"Phantom Power\", and \"The Piano Album\".\nIn late 1988, Wakeman got together with former Yes bandmates Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, and Steve Howe to form a new group, Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. The band originated when Anderson had become increasingly frustrated with Yes's commercial direction, and left the band to make music that reflected the band's 1970s sound. Their self-titled album was released in 1989, and the tour marked Wakeman's first major US tour in ten years. Tracks originally put down for a second album were added to an in-progress Yes album and released as \"Union\" in 1991, which transformed Yes into an eight-piece formation with Wakeman sharing keyboards with original Yes member Tony Kaye. Wakeman has openly stated his dislike for \"Union\", partly due to the fact that session musicians were brought in to re-write and perform parts that he and Howe had already put down. However, he later chose the Union Tour tour of 1991\u20131992 as his favourite with Yes, where he formed a strong friendship with their 1980s guitarist and singer-songwriter Trevor Rabin. Wakeman confirmed his exit from the group in 1993 following managerial disputes with the band's and his own.\nWakeman continued with his solo career in parallel; in 1990 he revived his English Rock Ensemble with Holt, Fernandez, and Paton for a European tour and recorded a new rock score for a colourised re-release of \"The Phantom of the Opera\", featuring Chrissie Hammond on vocals, put out as \"Phantom Power\" in 1991. He embarked on two UK tours supporting his two \"The Classical Connection\" albums with himself and Paton in a stripped back stage production. In the first half of the 1990s, Wakeman performed and released music in aid of ASSIST, a California-based Christian organisation founded by journalist Dan Wooding, author of Wakeman's biography. The pair reconnected in 1989, and their first venture was \"In the Beginning\", an album of atmospheric music with Biblical readings read by Wakeman's then-wife Nina. Wakeman donated the album's entire proceedings to ASSIST. In 1994, Wakeman completed the Simply Acoustic Tour, a series of solo piano concerts in the US in aid of ASSIST. Recordings from shows in Virginia and the Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa, California was released on \"The Piano Album\" in 1995. The latter show was attended by 8,000 people. Wakeman formed Hope Records to release this new Christian music, and decided to use the royalty payments to fund the production of more albums for the label.\nIn October 1992, Wakeman embarked on a world tour with a four-piece group of Fernandez, guitarist and bassist Alan Thomson, and his son Adam Wakeman on additional keyboards. The tour lasted until 1994, and was organised as Wakeman wished to tour with a second keyboardist to \"free [him] up to do more things\" on stage. The tour marked the release of \"Wakeman with Wakeman\", an album of keyboard compositions written and performed by the pair. They released \"No Expense Spared\" in 1993, \"Romance of the Victorian Age\" in 1994, and \"Vignettes\" in 1996. In 1993, Wakeman's financial situation took an unexpected turn when he was demanded to pay almost \u00a370,000 to the Inland Revenue for interest charges and unpaid penalties related to tax he had paid for the preceding six years. He later wrote: \"With help from Brian Lane's office and Yes's accountants, in my signing away all publishing income from everything I had ever written ... Twenty-two years' work had vanished in the three seconds it had taken to sign my name.\" Wakeman credits his 1993 appearance on the evening talk show \"Danny Baker After All\" as a turning point in his television career, after he told a story about being arrested in Moscow for smuggling a KGB uniform out of the country.\nIn mid-1995, Wakeman became involved with Phillip Gandey's family circus entertainment project Cirque Surreal, writing and recording \"timeless\" pieces to enhance the show's various characters. The show was initially held at the Brighton Festival, and Wakeman went out to perform it live with his band at other venues, including the Cheltenham Festival. Around the same time, Wakeman scored the soundtrack to \"Bullet to Beijing\", a made-for-television film starring Michael Caine and Jason Connery. He also scored its sequel, \"Midnight in Saint Petersburg\". Also in 1995, Wakeman played Mellotron on two songs of Ozzy Osbourne's album \"Ozzmosis\", \"Perry Mason\" and \"I Just Want You\".\nIn the summer of 1995, Wakeman agreed to return to Yes which marked his fourth time in the group and the return of the \"classic\" line-up. They worked on new studio material and performed live shows in 1996 which was released on \"Keys to Ascension\" (1996) and \"Keys to Ascension 2\" (1997). In March 1997, Wakeman staged the North American premiere of \"The New Gospels\" for five dates after it was reworked and extended into a two-hour oratorio with a 30-piece choir, in 1994. The concerts were free with donations to ASSIST. Wakeman left Yes in May 1997 before he could tour with them, due to scheduling conflicts and lack of coordination between the artists' management. In June 1997, Wakeman became the host of the stand-up comedy television show \"Live at Jongleurs\". Later in 1997, his 20-minute choral piece \"Noah\", written for the English Chamber Choir, premiered in London. Wakeman performed the piece with the choir once more in 2011.\n1998\u20132008: \"Return to the Centre of the Earth\", English Rock Ensemble revival, and final Yes run.\nIn 1998, he started work on \"Return to the Centre of the Earth\", a sequel album to commemorate the 25th anniversary of \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\". The idea first came to Wakeman in 1991 during a tour of Italy, which led to discussions about the project with Atlantic Records that year about a re-recording of the original album with new equipment and arrangements, but the idea was rejected. It was revived in 1996 when Wakeman received offers from three record companies willing to fund and release a new \"epic\" album. After a deal with EMI Classics was made, a story based on three unnamed travellers and their attempt to follow the original route was finalised, and recording began in 1998 with a band, the London Symphony Orchestra, the English Chamber Choir, Patrick Stewart as the narrator, and guest performances from Trevor Rabin, Ozzy Osbourne, and Bonnie Tyler. Released in 1999, the album went to number 34 in the UK, Wakeman's first album to enter the chart in 12 years. Recording was temporarily disrupted because of Wakeman's health. In December 1998, Wakeman was featured on an episode of \"This Is Your Life\".\nWakeman accepted an invitation to revive his English Rock Ensemble for a South American tour in September 2000, following a renewed interest in progressive rock there. The band featured a new line-up of Fernandez, Damian Wilson on vocals, Adam Wakeman on keyboards, Ant Glynne on guitar, and Lee Pomeroy on bass. Wakeman was particularly pleased with his playing, calling it his \"best in a long time.\" The group returned in April 2001, followed by several European dates. Later that year, Wakeman entered discussions with Keith Emerson regarding a potential music project, but the idea was shelved. In 2001, Wakeman performed in his first pantomime role as Abanazar in a production of \"Aladdin\" in Truro, for the Christmas season. He made a cameo appearance in the 2002 thriller horror film \"Alone\" as a hospital patient. In 2003, Wakeman starred in the BBC television show \"Grumpy Old Men\", and stayed on as a regular until the show ended in 2006. The show increased his national profile and made him a regular in the after dinner speech circuit.\nIn April 2002, Wakeman rejoined Yes for the fifth and final time, and said it took eight months to get the necessary paperwork to make it happen. The band toured worldwide with the Full Circle Tour and 35th Anniversary Tours, which ran from 2002 to 2004. Wakeman described the band's playing during his return: \"It was far and away the best the band had ever been ... there was no staleness, there was a lot of freshness.\" The only new studio material worked on during this time were bonus tracks on \"\". After the 2004 tour Yes entered a four-year hiatus, during which Wakeman retired from large scale tours following ongoing health problems. When the band regrouped in 2008, Wakeman's son Oliver replaced him on keyboards.\nIn April 2005, Wakeman and his band performed three shows in Havana, Cuba, including an outdoor show attended by an estimated 10,000 people. They came about after Wakeman was offered to perform there to support a charitable foundation that supports a children's cancer hospital. The first two shows were filmed and released as \"Made in Cuba\", proceeds from which were given to the hospital. Cuban leader Fidel Castro greeted Wakeman, thanking him for his humanitarian support. Wakeman received some criticism following the visit, which upset him personally and made him consider retiring from live performance. He addressed the false accusations on his website, clarifying that the visit was not staged for political reasons. Wakeman later revealed that Castro gave him some earth surrounding Che Guevara's grave.\nIn June 2006, Wakeman toured the US with a solo piano tour. This was followed by a performance of \"Return to the Centre of the Earth\" with his band, orchestra, and choir in Quebec, Canada. The show featured Jon Anderson as a guest performer, which led to the pair touring the UK together as Anderson/Wakeman. Wakeman scored the 2007 documentary film \"In Search of the Great Beast 666\", about the life of occultist Aleister Crowley. He toured the UK in 2007 with a new production, the Grumpy Old Picture Show. Inspired by his appearances on \"Grumpy Old Men\", the show combined live performances and stories with visual accompaniments including old photos and pre-recorded sketches. The initial run of 14 dates were so successful, Wakeman completed a further 24 dates in the following year.\n2009\u2013present: Revisiting classic 1970s albums, Yes feat. ARW, and piano albums.\nIn May 2009, he performed his debut album \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" in its entirety for the first time at Hampton Court Palace, as part of the 500th anniversary celebrations of Henry VIII's accession to the throne. He had originally asked to perform there in 1973, but was declined until he was invited 36 years later. The shows were released on CD and DVD as \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII Live at Hampton Court Palace\".\nIn 2010, Wakeman reunited with former Yes bandmate Jon Anderson and recorded \"The Living Tree\" as Anderson/Wakeman. They toured the UK and North America in 2010 and 2011. In July 2011, Wakeman got together with Deep Purple keyboardist Jon Lord to compose and perform an original piece for the charity Sunflower Jam at the Royal Albert Hall. Following its success the pair were set to start making an album, but later in the same month Lord was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2012. Lord's performance with Wakeman was his final live concert appearance. Also in July 2011, Wakeman reunited with the Strawbs on their acoustic summer tour with a guest appearance at their show at AbbeyFest.\nIn 2012, Wakeman recorded a new and extended version of \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\", following the discovery of the original conductor's score three years prior which was considered lost. As the original album was shortened to fit a single LP, Wakeman re-recorded the album with the previously cut parts which expanded the work to 54 minutes. It features his English Rock Ensemble, the Orion Orchestra and English Chamber Choir conducted by Guy Protheroe, and narration by actor Peter Egan. In April and May 2014, Wakeman performed the expanded album on a 14-date UK tour to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the original. The re-recording of \"Journey\" became the catalyst for a new and expanded version of \"King Arthur\", following a request from a South American concert promoter, for which Wakeman wrote new music based on additional Arthurian legends. The re-record version runs for 88 minutes, and features actor Ian Lavender as narrator. It was Wakeman's first album produced via online direct-to-fan support, and released on 19 June 2016, the same day that Wakeman performed it live at the Stone Free Festival at London's O2 Arena.\nWakeman performed a series of unique shows at the Blackfriars Priory in Gloucester and The Centaur in Cheltenham in June 2013 as part of the Medieval Mystery Play Festival. The former had Wakeman performing with his sons Oliver and Adam and daughter Jemma. The Cheltenham shows featured excerpts from Wakeman's first three albums from the 1970s with his English Rock Ensemble, the Cheltenham Symphony Orchestra and a cathedral choir with new arrangements. The original plan was for Wakeman to stage \"King Arthur\" at Kingsholm Stadium that year, but it fell through. In August 2013, Wakeman performed 12 solo piano shows as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In June 2015 he announced Wakemanfest, a three-day festival at the Gliderdrome in Boston, Lincolnshire that October, featuring performances from himself and the English Rock Ensemble, the Strawbs, The Cadbury Sisters, and Cheetah vocalist Chrissie Hammond. It was postponed, in addition to a piano tour of Scandinavia following the festival, after Wakeman had an undisclosed \"serious health scare\" and took time off at the suggestion of his management and family. From 2016 to 2018, Wakeman reunited with Anderson and former Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin and toured worldwide as Anderson Rabin Wakeman (later known as Yes featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman), performing a selection of Yes music across its history.\nIn January 2016, Wakeman performed a piano version of \"Life on Mars?\" live on BBC Radio 2 as a tribute following the death of his longtime friend David Bowie. The strong reception from listeners and viewers of the YouTube video led Wakeman to release a single of the track with a piano version of \"Space Oddity\" and an original song, \"Always Together\", in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. This inspired Wakeman to produce a solo piano album of tracks that he had played on throughout his career, plus original tunes and adaptations of classical pieces. \"Piano Portraits\" was released in January 2017 and went to No. 6 in the UK, becoming Wakeman's highest-charting album since 1975 and his first to reach silver certification from the British Phonographic Institute since 1977. The follow-up album \"Piano Odyssey\" featured some orchestral and choir arrangements. Released in 2018, it reached No. 7 in the UK. Wakeman concluded the series of piano albums with the seasonal-themed \"Christmas Portraits\" in 2019. In September and October 2019, Wakeman embarked on his first solo tour of the US in 13 years with his piano shows.\nIn June 2020, Wakeman returned to his progressive rock roots with \"The Red Planet\", an instrumental concept album inspired by Mars and featuring his English Rock Ensemble. In March 2023, Wakeman released \"A Gallery of the Imagination\", featuring tracks of varied styles including songs and instrumentals.\nIn February 2023, Wakeman performed two shows at the London Palladium featuring \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\", \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" and \"King Arthur\" played in their entirety with his English Rock Ensemble and choir, plus a selection of Yes music. The shows were released as a live album. After a UK tour performing the \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" and Yes sets in 2024, Wakeman began his final solo piano tours which has visited North America and Europe. The tour featured the debut of a 30-minute piano composition \"Yessonata\", featuring various themes and melodies from Yes songs that he had originally played on. A 20-minute studio version paired with a piano suite of similar length based on themes from \"King Arthur\" was released as an album. Wakeman wrote a composition for orchestra and piano as a tribute to the life and achievements of primatologist and climate campaigner Jane Goodall, which was performed at the 2024 Starmus Festival with himself on piano.\nInstruments.\nBy the end of 1972, Wakeman's typical keyboard setup included piano, electric piano, Mellotron, Hammond organ, and Minimoog synthesizer, and he had played a pipe organ and harpsichord on record. He went on to use many later models of synthesizers including the Polymoog and the short-lived Birotron, which he helped fund in its development. Because of the advent of digital keyboards at that time, and expensive components used in the instruments' manufacture, the Birotron was never a commercial or technical success and only 35 were produced. In recent years, Wakeman has used various Korg models, a Yamaha Montage, and the Memotron, a digital version of the original Mellotron.\nAn urban legend claims that Wakeman got so frustrated with one Mellotron that he poured petrol on it and set fire to it, which he said in 2010 was only \"semi-true\", and had become an exaggerated story over time. He clarified that some were so far beyond repair they were taken apart and burnt, but he kept the frames. A double Mellotron that he had made was stolen and reappeared in America.\nIn addition to keyboards, Wakeman still owns the soprano saxophone that he used at the Royal College of Music, and can play some rhythm and bass guitar.\nRecognition and influence.\nIn his foreword for Wakeman's 1979 biography, Elton John named \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" as one of his favourite albums. He noted Wakeman's \"brilliant\" technique and wrote that his \"mastery of electronic instruments only adds to his abilities\". In 2011, MusicRadar included Wakeman among \"The 27 greatest keyboard players of all time\". In 2019, readers of \"Prog\" voted him the second greatest progressive rock keyboard player, with the magazine stating, \"Wakeman's time with Yes helped define prog as we know it, being filled with timeless brilliance [...] The man's style is fluent, and underlines a love of many genres, all cohesively brought into focus.\" In 2024, Neil McCormick of \"The Daily Telegraph\" ranked him as the second greatest keyboard player of all time.\nKeyboardists who have cited Wakeman as an influence included Dave Greenfield of the Stranglers and Mark Kelly of Marillion, who cited Wakeman as his primary influence.\nPersonal life.\nFamily.\nWakeman has been married four times and has six children. In March 1970, at the age of 20, he married Rosaline Woolford and had two sons, Oliver and Adam. They divorced in 1977. In later life Wakeman said the marriage was a mistake for both of them, as they were too young and were \"not ready for what the musical world was about to throw at me.\" Wakeman married Swiss-born Danielle Corminboeuf, a recording studio secretary, in January 1980 in the West Indies and lived with her in Montreux. They had one son, before they divorced in late 1980. In 1981, Wakeman met former Page 3 model Nina Carter and had a daughter, before they married in November 1984 and had a son. The couple separated in 2000 and finalised their divorce in 2004. Wakeman left the Isle of Man and lived in hotels for several months.\nIn the early 2000s, Wakeman had a relationship with Italian artist Alina Bencini who produced artwork for his albums released during this time. In 2004, Wakeman revealed that he had had an extramarital affair with American-born designer Denise Gandrup, who first met Wakeman in 1972 and made several of his capes. After they split in 1981, they reconnected in 1985 and had one daughter. Wakeman felt it best to keep the relationship and child secret to protect his family, but continued to financially support his daughter. As of 2023, Wakeman has thirteen grandchildren.\nIn December 2011, Wakeman married journalist Rachel Kaufman who is 25 years his junior. The pair met in 2004 when Kaufman conducted a press interview with him, and were engaged in 2007.\nHealth.\nWakeman has faced a number of health issues. In his twenties he had three heart attacks due to smoking and drinking heavily and overworking. The first two were minor and he was told they may have gone unnoticed. The third occurred soon after his headline performance at the Crystal Palace Park in July 1974. Wakeman stopped smoking in 1979, but continued to drink and recalled \"wild\" nights with Keith Moon, Vivian Stanshall, and Rick Parfitt.\nIn September 1984, Wakeman was fined \u00a3155 and banned from driving for one year for speeding and being over the drink drive limit. On 8 August 1985, Wakeman became teetotal after he fell ill during an Australian tour. He flew home where a doctor revealed he had alcoholic hepatitis, signs of cirrhosis and organ failure, and said he had six months to live if he continued to drink. In 1998, Wakeman collapsed on a golf course and was rushed to hospital, where he was diagnosed with double pneumonia, pleurisy, high blood pressure, and showed signs of Legionnaires' disease. He was placed in an induced coma, and at one point his doctors gave him 24 hours to live. Wakeman has had a vasectomy.\nIn 2016 Wakeman announced he had type-2 diabetes. In 2023, he said his playing was affected by macular degeneration in his left eye, which he treats with monthly injections. He also has arthritis in his hands, legs and feet, for which he wears half gloves while performing. In 2025, Wakeman was diagnosed with a brain and spine disorder and had corrective surgery on his spinal cord. Wakeman has never used drugs and believes that had he taken them he would have done so to excess and died.\nOther activities.\nIn the 1970s, Wakeman met Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and bought Tropical Saint, a racehorse that belonged to her. After it died, he bought Balinloning, a small horse that he had in care for a year and entered in races.\nIn 1977, Wakeman was one of several musicians, along with Peter Frampton, Mick Jagger, and Paul Simon, who were part of the ownership group of the Philadelphia Fury, a new American soccer team to compete in the North American Soccer League. The team split in 1980. Wakeman is a lifelong supporter of Brentford F.C. and in 1979, was a director of the team for one year. In 1983, he became chairman of Camberley Town F.C. while he was living there. He quit in 1987 due to his busy work schedule, but remained active as an honorary vice-president. Wakeman is also a supporter of Manchester City F.C.\nIn a 2010 interview, Wakeman was critical of Wikipedia, saying it has too many inaccuracies and mistakes, and that he would love to see it \"closed down\".\nIn June 2017 he was the castaway for the BBC Radio 4 programme \"Desert Island Discs\". His favourite piece was Giuseppe Verdi's \"Anvil Chorus\" and his book choice was \"Principles of Orchestration\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, which his orchestration professor at the Royal College had introduced to him.\nWakeman's agent for TV and media work is entertainer Roger De Courcey, best known for performing with his puppet Nookie Bear.\nWakeman has been a supporter of the Conservative Party, saying he was \"unique in [Yes] as a card-carrying Conservative\".\nWakeman had a renewal of his Christian faith which began at around the time of his 1984 marriage to Carter.\nIn the 1990s, Wakeman bought a house in Los Cristianos, Tenerife.\nIn 1993 Wakeman was invited to play the piano at the inauguration of US President Bill Clinton. He declined due to unavailability.\nIn 1996, Wakeman was involved in a plane crash while landing at Derry, Northern Ireland. The eight-seater Manx Airlines plane lost power and its undercarriage collapsed, causing the plane to land on its rear wheel and the front crashing onto the tarmac, with the propellers and engine breaking off. After passing a medical check he played at an awards ceremony dinner for the same airline.\nIn 2002, Wakeman crashed into a stationary abandoned car while driving at around 65\u00a0mph at night on the M40 motorway. Despite bleeding in his mouth, he refused hospital treatment as Yes were due to start a North American tour in a couple of days. He remembered \"nearly crying with agony on stage\" during the first week.\nIn September 2005 Wakeman began to host a Saturday morning radio show on Planet Rock called \"Rick's Place\", that went on to feature David Jensen as co-host. The show ended in December 2010 after over 200 original episodes. Several months before its cancellation, Wakeman began a pre-recorded Saturday night show on Dublin-based Radio Nova with his friend David Hoffmann which lasted through 2012. In 2009, Wakeman recorded an online interview series called \"Face to Face\" with various musicians. In 2020 he launched \"Rick's Plaice\", a subscription-based video series based on the format of his former Planet Rock show. The series lasted two seasons.\nFreemasonry.\nIn 2007 Wakeman became a Freemason, joining the Chelsea Lodge No. 3098 which is made up of entertainers. His father was a member of the Brent Valley Lodge No. 3940, and the support that Wakeman and his mother received from his friends at the Lodge following his death was a catalyst for Wakeman to learn more about Freemasonry. In 2019, Wakeman was elected as an honorary member of his late father's Lodge. In 2011, Wakeman joined the Knights Templar fraternity, and is also a member of the Vaudeville Lodge. In 2014 he was installed as the 110th Worshipful Master of the Chelsea Lodge. He was and elected as the 125th King Rat in the showbusiness fraternity and charity organisation, the Grand Order of Water Rats. Wakeman was the first person to hold both titles.

Wakeman appears in his Masonic apron in the 2017 documentary series \"Inside the Freemasons\".\nCharity work and patronage.\nIn 1988, Wakeman was elected into the Lord's Taverners cricket charity, and was chairman of the Isle of Man branch with his wife in the early 1990s. He took up golf in the 1980s after becoming teetotal, and has since taken part in many charity tournaments. From 1995 until at least 2012, the Rick Wakeman Celebrity Classic golf tournament took place at Burhill Golf Club in Surrey, raising funds in aid of the children's charity Sparks.\nWakeman is an honorary president of the Classic Rock Society, formed in Rotherham in 1991.

{"id": "57669", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57669", "title": "Windhoek", "text": "Capital and largest city of Namibia\nWindhoek (; ; ) is the capital and largest city of Namibia. It is located in central Namibia in the Khomas Highland plateau area, at around above sea level, almost exactly at the country's geographical centre. The population of Windhoek, which was 486,169 in 2023, is constantly growing due to a continued migration from other regions in Namibia.\nWindhoek is the social, economic, political, and cultural centre of the country. Nearly every Namibian national enterprise, governmental body, educational and cultural institution is headquartered there.\nThe city developed at the site of a permanent hot spring known to the local pastoral tribes. It developed rapidly after Jonker Afrikaner, Captain of the Orlam, settled there in 1840 and built a stone church for his community. In the decades following, multiple wars and armed hostilities resulted in the neglect and destruction of the new settlement. Windhoek was founded a second time in 1890 by Imperial German Army Major Curt von Fran\u00e7ois, when the territory was colonised by the German Empire.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nTheories vary on how the city got its modern name of \"Windhoek\". Most believe it is derived from the Afrikaans words 'wind' and 'corner'. Another theory suggests that Captain Jonker Afrikaner named Windhoek after the Winterhoek Mountains at Tulbagh in South Africa, where his ancestors had lived. The first known mention of the name \"Windhoek\" was in a letter from Jonker Afrikaner to Joseph Tindall, dated 12 August 1844.\nEarly settlement.\nIn 1840 Jonker Afrikaner established an Orlam settlement at Windhoek. He and his followers stayed near one of the main hot springs, located in the present-day Klein Windhoek suburb. He built a stone church that held 500 people; it was also used as a school. Two Rhenish missionaries, Carl Hugo Hahn and Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt, started working there in late 1842. Two years later they were driven out by two Methodist Wesleyans, Richard Haddy and Joseph Tindall. Gardens were laid out and for a while Windhoek prospered. A series of wars between the Nama and Herero tribes eventually destroyed the settlement. After a long absence, Hahn visited Windhoek again in 1873 and was dismayed to see that nothing remained of the town's former prosperity. In June 1885, a Swiss botanist found only jackals and starving guinea fowl amongst neglected fruit trees.\nColonial era.\nA request by merchants from L\u00fcderitzbucht resulted in the declaration in 1884 of a German protectorate over what was called German South West Africa (\"Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika\"), now Namibia. The borders of the German colony were determined in 1890 and Germany sent a protective corps, the \"Schutztruppe\" under Major Curt von\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois, to maintain order. Von\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois stationed his garrison at Windhoek, which was strategically situated as a buffer between the warring Nama and Herero peoples. The twelve strong springs provided water for the cultivation of produce and grains.\nColonial Windhoek was founded on 18 October 1890, when von\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois fixed the foundation stone of the fort, which is now known as the Alte Feste (Old Fortress). After 1907, development accelerated as indigenous people migrated from the countryside to the growing town to seek work. More European settlers arrived from Germany and South Africa. Businesses were erected on Kaiser Street (presently Independence Avenue), and along the dominant mountain ridge over the city. At this time, Windhoek's three castles, Heinitzburg, Sanderburg, and Schwerinsburg, were built.\nSouth African administration after World War I.\nThe German colonial era came to an end after the end of World War I but South West Africa, and with it Windhoek, had already fallen in 1915. Until the end of the war, the city was administered by a South African military government, and no further development occurred. In 1920, after the Treaty of Versailles, the territory was placed under a League of Nations Class C mandate and again administered by South Africa.\nAfter World War II, more capital became available to improve the area's economy. After 1955, large public projects were undertaken, such as the building of new schools and hospitals, tarring of the city's roads (a project begun in 1928 with Kaiser Street), and the building of dams and pipelines to stabilise the water supply. The city introduced the world's first potable re-use plant in 1958, treating recycled sewage and sending it directly into the town's water supply. On 1 October 1966, the then Administrator of South West Africa granted Windhoek the coat of arms, which was registered on 2 October 1970 with the South African Bureau of Heraldry. Initially a stylized aloe was the principal emblem, but this was amended to a natural aloe (\"Aloe littoralis\") on 15 September 1972. The Coat of Arms is described as \"A Windhoek aloe with a raceme of three flowers on an island. Crest: A mural crown Or. Motto: SUUM CUIQUE (\"To each their own\")\".\nWindhoek formally received its town privileges on 18 October 1965 on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the second foundation of the town by von Fran\u00e7ois.\nIn 1971, the Namibian general contract workers started from Windhoek with the goal of abolishing the contract labour system, opposing apartheid, and promoting Namibia's independence.\nSince Namibian independence.\nSince independence in 1990, Windhoek has remained the national capital, as well as the provincial capital of the central Khomas Region. Since independence and the end of warfare, the city has had accelerated growth and development.\nEconomy.\nThe city is the administrative, commercial, and industrial centre of Namibia. A 1992/93 study estimated that Windhoek provides over half of Namibia's non-agricultural employment, with its national share of employment in utilities being 96%, in transport and communication 94%, finance and business services 82%. Due to its relative size Windhoek is, even more than many other national capital cities, the social, economic, and cultural centre of the country. The University of Namibia is based in the city, as well as nearly every national enterprise, including the country's only theatre, all ministry head offices, and all major media and financial entities. The governmental budget of the city of Windhoek nearly equals those of all other Namibian local authorities combined. Of the 3,300 US$-millionaires in Namibia, 1,400 live in Windhoek.\nThe Windhoek Correctional Facility is the largest of Namibia's seven major prisons.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nWindhoek's three main access roads from Rehoboth, Gobabis, and Okahandja are paved, and are designed to be able to withstand the largest possible flood to be expected in fifty years. Sealed roads can carry traffic moving at and should last for 20 years.\nIn 1928, Kaiserstra\u00dfe, now Independence Avenue, was the first paved road in Windhoek. Ten years later the next one, Gobabis road, now Sam Nujoma Drive, was also paved. Today, out of approximately of Namibia's total road network, about is sealed.\nIn 2014, The Roads Authority planned to upgrade the Windhoek-Okahandja road to a dual carriageway. It would cost about N$1\u00a0billion and was expected to be completed in 2021. Later on, they also planned to upgrade the Windhoek and Hosea Kutako International Airport to a dual carriageway. This was expected to be completed in 2022.\nAs everywhere in Namibia, public transport is scarce and transportation across town is largely done by taxi; there were 6,492 registered taxis in 2013.\nAir.\nWindhoek is served by two airports, with the closest one being Eros Airport, located south of the city centre for smaller craft, and the other being Hosea Kutako International Airport, east of the city. A number of foreign airlines operate to and from Windhoek. Air charters and helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft rentals are also available.\nHosea Kutako International Airport handles over 800,000 passengers a year. It has one runway without capacity limitations. The other international airport is located in Walvis Bay, with domestic airports at L\u00fcderitz, Oranjemund, and Ondangwa.\nEros Airport is the busiest airport in Namibia in terms of takeoffs and landings. This city airport handles approximately 150 to 200 movements per day, amounting to roughly 50,000 per year. In 2004, the airport served 141,605 passengers, the majority of which are light aircraft. Primarily, limitations such as runway length, noise, and air space congestion have kept Eros from developing into a larger airport. Most of Namibia's charter operators have Eros as their base.\nRail.\nWindhoek is connected by rail to:\nGeography.\nExpanding the town area has \u2013 apart from financial restrictions \u2013 proven to be challenging due to its geographical location. In southern, eastern and western directions, Windhoek is surrounded by rocky, mountainous areas, which make land development costly. The southern side is not suitable for industrial development because of the presence of underground aquifers. This leaves the vast Brakwater area north of town the only feasible place for Windhoek's expansion.\nWindhoek's city council has plans to dramatically expand the city's boundaries such that the town area will cover . Windhoek would become the third-largest city in the world by area, after Tianjin and Istanbul, although its population density is only 63 inhabitants per square kilometre.\nSuburbs.\nWindhoek is subdivided into the following suburbs and townships:\nSuburbs\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTownships\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn many of Windhoek's townships residents live in shacks. In 2020 the city had a total of 41,900 of these informal housing structures, accommodating close to 100,000 inhabitants.\nClimate.\nWindhoek has over 300 sunny days per year. It experiences a hot semi-arid climate (\"BSh\") according to K\u00f6ppen climate classification as the annual average temperature is above . The temperature throughout the year would be called mild, due to altitude influence. The annual average high and low temperature range is . The coldest month is July, with an average temperature of , while the hottest month is December, with average temperature . Due to its location near the Kalahari Desert, the city receives 3,605 hours of sunshine. Precipitation is abundant during the summer season, and minimal during the winter season. The average annual precipitation is , with lows of in the 2018/19 rainy season, and in 1929/30.\nDemographics.\nIn 1971, there were roughly 26,000 white people living in Windhoek, outnumbering the black population of 24,000. About one third of white residents at the time, at least 9,000 individuals, were German speakers. In 2010 the population stood at over 325,858 (65% black; 18% other; 17% white), and has been growing 4% annually in part due to informal settlements that have even higher growth rates of nearly 10% a year. As of 2020, Windhoek has a population of 431,000.\nIn public life, Afrikaans, and to a lesser extent German, are still used as lingua francas even though the government only uses English.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPolitics.\nLocal authority elections.\nWindhoek is the only self-governed settlement in Khomas Region. It is governed by a multi-party municipal council that has fifteen seats. The council meets monthly; its decisions are taken collectively.\nSWAPO won the 2015 local authority election and gained twelve seats, by having 37,533 votes. Three opposition parties gained one seat each: The Popular Democratic Movement (PDM), formerly DTA, with 4,171 votes, the National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO) with 1,453 votes, and the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) with 1,422 votes. SWAPO also won the 2020 local authority election but lost the majority control over the town council. It obtained 20,250 votes and gained five seats. The Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020, obtained 14,028 votes and gained four seats. Two seats each went to the local branch of the Affirmative Repositioning movement (8,501 votes) and the Landless People's Movement (LPM, a new party registered in 2018, 7,365 votes). PDM (5,411 votes) and NUDO (1,455 votes) obtained one seat each.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nWindhoek is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCulture.\nWindhoek is known as the art capital of Namibia. The National Art Gallery, National Theatre and the National Museum are all located here. Two locations are part of the National Museum, the Alte Feste (historical) showcases a range of colonial items such as wagons and domestic items, while the Owela Museum (scientific; named after Owela, a traditional game played with pebbles) contains displays of minerals, fossils and meteorites and gives an insight into traditional village life.

{"id": "57671", "revid": "22939902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57671", "title": "Yaound\u00e9", "text": "Capital of Cameroon\nYaound\u00e9 (; , ) is the capital city of Cameroon. It has a population of more than 2.8 million, which makes it the second-largest city in the country after the port city Douala. It lies in the Centre Region of the nation at an elevation of about 750 metres (2,500\u00a0ft) above sea level.\nThe outpost of Epsumb or Jeundo was founded between the Nyong and Sanaga rivers at the northern edge of the area's forests in 1887 by German explorers as a trading base for rubber and ivory. A military garrison was built in 1895 which enabled further colonization. After Imperial Germany's defeat in World War I, France held eastern Cameroon as a mandate, and Yaound\u00e9 was chosen to become the capital of the colony in 1922.\nDouala remained the more important settlement, but Yaound\u00e9 saw rapid growth and continued as the seat of government for the Republic of Cameroon upon its independence in 1960. Most of Yaound\u00e9's economy is still centred on the administrative structure but major industries in Yaound\u00e9 include tobacco, dairy products, beer, clay, glass goods and timber. The city has many striking monuments and buildings, such as the Presidential Palace and Palais des Congr\u00e8s.\nHistory.\nThe earliest inhabitants of Cameroon were likely the Bakas (pygmies). They still inhabit the forests of the south and east regions. Bantu speakers originating in the Cameroonian highlands were among the first groups to move out before other invaders. During the late 1770s and early 1800s, the Fulani\u2014a pastoral Islamic people of the western Sahel\u2014conquered most of what is now northern Cameroon, subjugating or displacing its largely non-Muslim inhabitants.\nThe outpost of Epsumb or Jeundo was founded between the Nyong and Sanaga rivers at the northern edge of the area's forests in 1887, 1888, or February 1889 by the German explorers Lt.\u00a0Richard Kund and Hans Tappenbeck by the agreement of the chiefs of Ela Esono. From December 1889 to May 1895, it was occupied by the German botanist Georg August Zenker as an agricultural research station named Jaunde after the local Yaunde or Ewondo people. His settlement served as a base for the area's rubber and ivory trade, purchasing these from the natives in exchange for imported clothing and iron. It was also known in English as Yaunde Station. Major Dominik's establishment of a military garrison at the site in 1895 permitted a Pallotine mission and religious school at nearby Mvoly\u00e9 (now a suburb).\nDuring World War I, Jaunde was occupied by Belgian troops from the Congo. After Imperial Germany's defeat in that war, France held eastern Cameroon as a mandate of the League of Nations and Yaound\u00e9 was chosen to become the capital of the colony in 1922.\nDouala long remained the more important settlement, but Yaound\u00e9 saw rapid growth after 1957 due to the cocoa crisis and unrest along the coast. It continued as the seat of government for the Republic of Cameroon upon its independence.\nEconomy.\nMost of Yaound\u00e9's economy is centred on the administrative structure of the civil service and the diplomatic services. Owing to these high-profile central structures, Yaound\u00e9 has a higher standard of living and security than the rest of Cameroon.\nMajor industries in Yaound\u00e9 include tobacco, dairy products, beer, clay, glass goods and timber. It is also a regional distribution centre for coffee, cocoa, copra, sugar cane and rubber.\nLocal residents engage in urban agriculture. The city is estimated to have \"50,000 pigs and over a million chickens.\"\nIn 2010, under Mayor Jean Claude Adjessa Melingui, Yaound\u00e9 began a flood reduction project, the Yaound\u00e9 City Sanitation Master Plan, to deal with \"severe floods [that] disrupted the city 15 to 20 times a year, affecting as many as 100,000 people at a time.\" After four years, the frequency of flooding had been reduced from fifteen to three times a year, and cases of water-borne diseases such as typhoid and malaria were reduced by almost half. Although Melingui died in 2013, local officials are continuing his efforts to transform the city. Ongoing improvements to sanitation infrastructure are being carried out under a \"$152 million plan, largely financed by loans, primarily from the African Development Bank and the French Development Agency\", slated for completion in 2017.\nDespite the security issues and humanitarian crises that have plagued the central African nation, its economy remains stable. In fact, there is diversification of its productive economic activities, with the services sector contributing about half of the total domestic production. However, like many African countries, Cameroon has long suffered from corruption, which dominates almost all the sectors, particularly in the capital city. Oil, gas and mining revenues are rarely reported, which implies massive graft. In addition, there is weak protection of real and intellectual property, and the judicial system is vulnerable to political manipulation.\nAccording to Yaound\u00e9 City Council data, over 130 floods struck the city between 1980 and 2014, causing massive loss of life and economic damage. However, there has been a reduction of flooding in the city since the establishment of a sanitation master plan to address the issue. Another measure was to relocate people living along the drainage routes and in low-lying flood zones.\nArchitecture.\nThe city centre houses government offices, some hotels, and the central market. The Bastos district, with most homes owned by Cameroonians, is home to foreign embassies and the expatriate European, American and other continental communities (drawn mainly from the diplomatic corps). The presidential palace and compound are in the Etoudi district.\nAlso found in Yaound\u00e9 are:\nThere is a small zoo in the Mvog-Betsi neighbourhood. Yaound\u00e9 has a small assortment of pubs, nightclubs and restaurants.\nA distance outside Yaound\u00e9 is the NGO Ape Action Africa, which rescues and rehabilitates great apes threatened with extinction by the illegal bushmeat and deforestation trades.\nCulture.\nEwondo Populaire is a Beti-based pidgin spoken in Yaound\u00e9.\nPlaces of worship.\nThe places of worship in the city are predominantly Christian churches: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yaound\u00e9 (Catholic Church), Christian Missionary Fellowship International and Associated Churches (Pentecostal), Evangelical Church of Cameroon (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Presbyterian Church in Cameroon (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Union of Baptist Churches in Cameroon (Baptist World Alliance), Full Gospel Mission Cameroon (Assemblies of God). There are also Muslim mosques.\nClimate.\nYaound\u00e9 features a tropical wet and dry climate (Aw), and it is thermally equatorial rather than tropical, with a narrow range of monthly temperatures throughout the year. However, primarily due to the altitude, temperatures are not quite as hot as one would expect for a city located near the equator. Yaound\u00e9 has a lengthy wet season, covering a ten-month span between March and November. However, there is a noticeable decrease in precipitation within the wet season, seen during the month of July, almost giving the city the appearance of having two separate rainy seasons; this is because the city is only slightly north of the equator. It is primarily due to the relative lull in precipitation during this month that Yaound\u00e9 features a tropical wet and dry climate, as opposed to a tropical monsoon climate.\nTransport.\nTwo trans-African automobile routes pass through Yaound\u00e9:\nMany bus companies operate from the city; particularly in the Nsam and Mvan districts. Frequent buses run on the road between Yaound\u00e9 and Douala, which has witnessed several fatal accidents. Travel time by road between Douala and Yaounde is approximately 3 hours. Traffic in the city can be heavy during weekdays, but is very light during the weekends. Yaound\u00e9 has made significant progress in infrastructure, especially road construction.\nYaound\u00e9 Nsimalen International Airport is a major civilian hub, while nearby Yaound\u00e9 Airport is used by the military.\nTrain lines run west to the port city of Douala and north to N'Gaound\u00e9r\u00e9.\nEducation.\nCameroon is a bilingual country, where English and French are both official languages; therefore in the city there is a coexistence of French educational system schools, where the degree giving access to university is the Baccalaureate, and all the education is in French, and the English educational system schools, where the degree giving access to university is the GCE Advanced level.\nThere are three American schools in Cameroon, the American School of Yaounde (ASOY) and Rain Forest International School (RFIS), and the American School of Douala (ASD). There is also one Turkish School, The Amity College/School.\nYaound\u00e9 is the site of several universities: the University of Yaound\u00e9 II (on a campus outside of town), the Protestant University of Central Africa (UPAC) and the Catholic University of Central Africa (UCAC). Several of the nation's professional schools are also located in Yaounde (Higher Teacher's training college, \u00c9cole Militaire InterArmes du Cameroun) as well as various schools for Engineers (Polytech), Doctors (CUSS), Nurses and Diplomats.\nHealthcare.\nThe largest hospital is the Central Hospital of Yaound\u00e9 (\"H\u00f4pital Central de Yaound\u00e9\") with 650 beds. Yaound\u00e9 General Hospital (\"H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Yaound\u00e9\" \u2013 HGY) had 302 beds when it was built in 1985. Other hospitals are the Yaound\u00e9 Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital (\"H\u00f4pital Gyn\u00e9co-Obst\u00e9trique et P\u00e9diatrique de Yaound\u00e9\" \u2013 HGOPY) and the University Hospital Center of Yaound\u00e9 (\"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Yaound\u00e9\" \u2013 CHU).\nSports.\nThe national football team plays some of its home matches in the Ahmadou Ahidjo stadium and the football clubs Canon Yaound\u00e9, Imp\u00f4ts FC and Tonnerre Yaound\u00e9 are all based in the city. The Grand Prix Chantal Biya, a men's road bicycle racing event on the UCI Africa Tour, starts and finishes in Yaound\u00e9.\nYaound\u00e9 is also the base for the National Institute of Youth and Sport (); this school trains government workers who will be in charge of sport all across the country during their career.\nJoel Embiid, center for the Philadelphia 76ers, and Luc Mbah a Moute, who was a forward for the Los Angeles Clippers are from Yaound\u00e9, as are Samuel Umtiti, a footballer for the national team of France and FC Barcelona, Breel Embolo, a footballer for AS Monaco FC and Vincent Aboubakar, a footballer for Porto.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A self-taught musician, he began playing the piano at the age of twelve, with English singer-songwriter Elton John as one of his biggest influences in pursuing a musical career.\nUematsu joined Square in 1986, where he first met \"Final Fantasy\" creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The two later worked together on many games at the company, most notably in the \"Final Fantasy\" series. After nearly two decades with Square, Uematsu left in 2004 to create his own production company and music label, Dog Ear Records. He has since composed music as a freelancer for other games, including ones developed by Square Enix and Sakaguchi's studio Mistwalker.\nMany soundtracks and arranged albums of Uematsu's game scores have been released. Pieces from his video game works have been performed in various \"Final Fantasy\" concerts, where he has worked with conductor Arnie Roth and Game Concerts producer Thomas B\u00f6cker on several of these performances. Uematsu was also the keyboardist in The Black Mages in the 2000s, which played various hard rock versions of his \"Final Fantasy\" compositions. He has since performed with the Earthbound Papas, which he formed as the successor to The Black Mages in 2011. Uematsu has made several listings in Britain's Classic FM Hall of Fame, with the station referring to him as the Beethoven of game music.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nUematsu was born on March 21, 1959, in K\u014dchi, the capital city of K\u014dchi Prefecture, Japan. A self-taught musician, he began to play the piano when he was twelve years old, and did not take any formal piano lessons. He has an older sister who also played the piano. After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the keyboard in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career. He said it was a way to make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.\nSquare (1986\u20132004).\nUematsu joined Square in 1986, with his first work being a few tracks for \"Cruise Chaser Blassty\". He met game designer Hironobu Sakaguchi shortly after, who asked him if he wanted to create music for some of his games, to which Uematsu agreed. For the next year, he created music for a number of games which did not achieve widespread success, such as \"King's Knight\", \"3-D WorldRunner\", and \"Rad Racer\". In 1987, Uematsu and Sakaguchi collaborated on what was originally to be Sakaguchi's last contribution for Square, \"Final Fantasy\". \"Final Fantasy\"'s popularity sparked Uematsu's career in video game music, and he would go on to compose music for over 30 titles, most prominently the subsequent games in the \"Final Fantasy\" series. He scored the first installment in the \"SaGa\" series, \"The Final Fantasy Legend\", in 1989. For the second game in the series, \"Final Fantasy Legend II\" he was assisted by Kenji Ito. In late 1994, Uematsu was asked to finish the soundtrack for \"Chrono Trigger\" after Yasunori Mitsuda contracted peptic ulcers. In 1996, he co-composed the soundtrack to \"\", and created the entire score for \"Dynami Tracer\". He also created music for three of the games in the \"Hanjuku Hero\" series.\nOutside of video games, he has composed the main theme for the 2000 animated film ' and co-composed the 2001 anime ' with Shir\u014d Hamaguchi. He also inspired the \"Ten Plants\" concept albums, and released a solo album in 1994, titled \"Phantasmagoria\". Feeling gradually more dissatisfied and uninspired, Uematsu requested the assistance of composers Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano for the score to \"Final Fantasy X\" in 2001. This marked the first time that Uematsu did not compose an entire main-series \"Final Fantasy\" soundtrack. For \"Final Fantasy XI\" from 2002, he was joined by Naoshi Mizuta, who composed the majority of the soundtrack, and Kumi Tanioka; Uematsu was responsible for only eleven tracks. In 2002, fellow Square colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito asked Uematsu to join them in forming a rock band that focused on reinterpreting and expanding on Uematsu's compositions. He declined their offer at first because he was too busy with work; however, after agreeing to perform with Fukui and Sekito in a live performance as a keyboardist, he decided to join them in making a band. Another employee at Square, Mr. Matsushita, chose the name The Black Mages for their band. In 2003, Keiji Kawamori, Arata Hanyuda, and Michio Okamiya also joined the band. The Black Mages released three studio albums and performed at several concerts.\nFreelancer (2004\u2013present).\nUematsu left Square Enix in 2004 and formed his own production company, Smile Please. He later founded the music production company and record label Dog Ear Records in 2006. The reason for Uematsu's departure was that the company moved their office from Meguro to Shinjuku, Tokyo and he was not comfortable with the new location. He also stated that he had reached an age where he should gradually take his life into his own hands. He does, however, continue to compose music as a freelancer for Square Enix. In 2005, Uematsu and several members of The Black Mages created the score for the CGI film \"Final Fantasy VII Advent Children\". Uematsu composed only the main theme for \"Final Fantasy XII\" (2006); he was originally offered the job of creating the full score, but Hitoshi Sakimoto was eventually assigned as the main composer instead. Uematsu was also initially going to create the theme song for \"Final Fantasy XIII\" (2010). However, after being assigned the task of creating the entire score of \"Final Fantasy XIV\", Uematsu decided to hand the job over to Hamauzu.\nUematsu also works closely with Sakaguchi's development studio Mistwalker, and has composed for \"Blue Dragon\" (2006), \"Lost Odyssey\" (2007), \"\" (2008); \"The Last Story\" (2011); and \"Terra Battle\" (2014). He also wrote music for the cancelled game \"Cry On\". Uematsu created the main theme for \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" in 2008. He then composed the music for the 2009 anime \"Guin Saga\"; this marked the first time he provided a full score for an animated series. Uematsu has contributed music and story to e-books, such as \"Blik-0 1946\".\nUematsu appeared five times in the top 20 of the annual Classic FM Hall of Fame. In 2012, \"Aerith's Theme\", written by Uematsu for \"Final Fantasy VII\", was voted into the number 16 position in the annual Classic FM (UK) \"Hall of Fame\" top 300 chart. This was accompanied by \"Dancing Mad\" and \"To Zanarkand\". It was the first time that a piece of music written for a video game had appeared in the chart. In 2013, music from the \"Final Fantasy\" series received even greater support and was voted into the third position on the Classic FM Hall of Fame. Uematsu and his \"Final Fantasy\" music subsequently appeared at number seven in 2014, number nine in 2015, and number 17 in 2016.\nIn September 2018, Uematsu announced that he would take a hiatus in order to recover from work fatigue, which led to him being hospitalized. He composed the main theme for 2020's \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\", \"Hollow\". Sakaguchi said that Uematsu's work on 2021's \"Fantasian\" could be his last major game score due to health issues. In a video posted to the \"Fantasian\" Twitter account on October 15, 2024, Uematsu announced that this was his last project as a video game composer. This was later clarified on his Twitter account that he was not retiring from video game music entirely, but rather scaling back his involvement. He explained that while he would no longer take on full game soundtracks due to the time commitment, he would still be open to composing individual pieces, such as theme songs.\nConcerts.\nUematsu's video game compositions have been performed in numerous concerts, and various \"Final Fantasy\" concerts have also been held. Outside Japan, Uematsu's \"Final Fantasy\" music was performed live for the first time at the first event of the 2003 Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig, Germany. Other events of the \"Symphonic Game Music Concerts\" featuring \"Final Fantasy\" music were held in 2004, 2006, and 2007. The concert in 2004 featured a world premiere of \"Those Who Fight\" from \"Final Fantasy VII\". Japanese pianist Seiji Honda was invited to perform the arrangement together with the orchestra. Another world premiere was \"Dancing Mad\" from \"Final Fantasy VI\", performed by orchestra, choir, and pipe organ. The event in 2007 included \"Distant Worlds\" from \"Final Fantasy XI\", performed by Japanese opera soprano Izumi Masuda.\nA series of successful concert performances were held in Japan, including a \"Final Fantasy\" concert series titled Tour de Japon. The first stateside concert, Dear Friends \u2013 Music from Final Fantasy, took place on May 10, 2004, at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, California, and was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra and the Los Angeles Master Chorale. It was conducted by Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra director Miguel Harth-Bedoya. Due to a positive reception, a concert series for North America followed. On May 16, 2005, a follow-up concert called was performed in Los Angeles at the Gibson Amphitheatre; the concert was conducted by Arnie Roth.\nUematsu's \"Final Fantasy\" music was presented in the concert Voices \u2013 Music from Final Fantasy, which took place on February 18, 2006, at the Pacifico Yokohama convention center. Star guests included Emiko Shiratori, Rikki, Izumi Masuda, and Angela Aki. The concert focused on the songs from the \"Final Fantasy\" series and was conducted by Arnie Roth. Uematsu and several of his fellow composers were in attendance at the world premiere of Play! A Video Game Symphony in Chicago in May 2006; he composed the opening fanfare for the concert.\nUematsu's first orchestral work written for the concert hall, Merregnon: Heart of Ice, premiered on February 29, 2024, in Ludwigshafen, Germany, performed by the Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz under Eckehard Stier.\nMusical style and influences.\nThe style of Uematsu's compositions is diverse, ranging from stately classical symphonic pieces and heavy metal to new-age and hyper-percussive techno-electronica. For example, in \"Lost Odyssey\", the score ranges from classical orchestral arrangements to contemporary jazz and techno tracks. Uematsu has stated that he is a big fan of Celtic and Irish music, and some of his work contains elements from these musical styles. Uematsu's \"Final Fantasy\" scores vary from upbeat, to dark and angry, to melancholic in nature. For instance, the music of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" is dark and gloomy, while the soundtrack to \"Final Fantasy IX\" is more carefree and upbeat. His \"Final Fantasy\" music has been described as being able to convey the true emotion of a scene; an example is \"Aerith's Theme\" from \"Final Fantasy VII\". In an interview with the \"Nichi Bei Times\", Uematsu said \"I don't really self-consciously compose music for Japan or for the world, but I do think there is something in my more melancholy pieces that has a distinctly Japanese quality.\" He has been named one of the \"Innovators\" in \"Time\"'s \"Time 100: The Next Wave \u2014 Music\" feature. He has also been called the \"John Williams of the video game world\" and been credited for \"increasing the appreciation and awareness\" of video game music.\nMany of Uematsu's musical influences come from the United Kingdom and the United States. He cites Elton John as his biggest musical influence, and he has stated that he wanted to be like him. Other major inspirations include the Beatles, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and progressive rock bands. In the classical genre, he cites Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as a great influence. Uematsu has said that 1970s bands, such as Pink Floyd and King Crimson, influenced his \"Final Fantasy\" compositions. The lyrics for the piece \"One-Winged Angel\" from \"Final Fantasy VII\" were taken from the medieval poetry on which Carl Orff based his cantata \"Carmina Burana\", specifically the songs \"Estuans Interius\", \"O Fortuna\", \"Veni, Veni, Venias\" and \"Ave Formosissima\". In turn, Uematsu has had a major influence on video game music and beyond the video game industry as well. For example, \"Liberi Fatali\" from \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was played during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens during the women's synchronized swimming event. From the same game, \"Eyes on Me\", featuring Chinese pop singer Faye Wong, sold a record 400,000 copies and was the first song from a video game to win an award at the Japan Gold Disc Awards, where it won \"Song of the Year (International)\" in 2000. Uematsu said that he gets more inspiration from walking his dog than from listening to other music.\nPersonal life.\nUematsu resides in Tokyo with his wife, Reiko, whom he met during college. They have a summer cabin in Yamanakako, Yamanashi. In his spare time, he enjoys watching professional wrestling, drinking beer, and bicycling. Uematsu has said he originally wanted to become a professional wrestler, mentioning it was a career dream when he was younger.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Netherlands and its people have long played an important role as centre of cultural liberalism and tolerance. The Dutch Golden Age is popularly regarded as its zenith.\nLanguage.\nThe official language of the Netherlands is Dutch, spoken by almost all people in the Netherlands. Dutch is also spoken and official in Aruba, Belgium, Cura\u00e7ao, Sint Maarten and Suriname. It is a West Germanic, Low Franconian language that originated in the Early Middle Ages (c. 470) and was standardized in the 16th century. Frisian is also a recognized language, used by the government in the province of Friesland. Several dialects of Low Saxon (\"Nedersaksisch\" in Dutch) are spoken in much of the north and east and are recognized by the Netherlands as regional languages according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Another Dutch dialect granted the status of regional language is Limburgish, which is spoken in the south-eastern province of Limburg. However, both Dutch Low Saxon and Limburgish spread across the Dutch-German border and belong to a common Dutch-Low German dialect continuum.\nThere is a tradition of learning foreign languages in the Netherlands: about 89% of the total population have a good knowledge of English, 70% of German, 29% of French and 5% of Spanish.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBetween the Celtic and Germanic peoples and later the Roman conquerors a cultural exchange took place. An adaptation of polytheistic religions and each other's myths took place among the various tribes, coming from the Germanic, Celtic and later Roman mythology. From the 4th to the 6th century AD The Great Migration took place, in which the small Celtic-Germanic-Roman tribes in the Low Countries were gradually supplanted by three major Germanic tribes: the Franks, the Frisians and the Saxons. Around 500 the Franks, initially residing between the Rhine and the Somme embraced Christianity under the auspices of King Clovis I. However, it would take at least until AD 1000 before all the pagans were actually Christianized and the Frisian and Saxon religions became extinct, although elements were incorporated into the local Christian religion. The following centuries Catholic Christianity was the only mainstream religion in the Netherlands. The rebellious Netherlands that had united in the Union of Utrecht (1579) declared their independence from Spain in 1581, during the Eighty Years' War; Spain finally accepted this in 1648. The Dutch revolt was partially religiously motivated: during the Reformation many of the Dutch had adopted Lutheran, Anabaptist, Calvinist or Mennonite forms of Protestantism. These religious movements were suppressed by the Spanish, who supported the Counter Reformation. After independence the Netherlands adopted Calvinism as a quasi-state religion (although never formally), but practiced a degree of religious tolerance towards non-Calvinists.\nUntil late into the 20th century, the predominant religion in the Netherlands was Christianity. Although religious diversity remains, there has been a decline in religious adherence. In 2006, 34% of the Dutch population identified as Christian, decreasing till in 2015 almost 25% of the population adhered to one of the Christian faiths (11.7% Roman Catholic, 8.6% PKN, 4.2% other small Christian denominations), 5% is Muslim and 2% adheres to Hinduism or Buddhism, based on independent in-depth interviewing by Radboud University and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Approximately 67.8% of the population in 2015 has no religious affiliation, up from 61% in 2006, 53% in 1996, 43% 1979 and 33% in 1966. The Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau (Social and Cultural Planning Agency, SCP) expects the number of non-affiliated Dutch to be at 72% in 2020.\nA large majority of the Dutch population believes that religion should not have a determining role to play in politics and education. Religion is also decreasingly seen as a social binder, and is generally considered a personal matter which should not be propagated in public. The Dutch constitution guarantees freedom of education, which means that all schools that adhere to general quality criteria receive the same government funding. This includes schools based on religious principles by religious groups (especially Roman Catholic and various Protestant). Three political parties in the Dutch parliament, (CDA, and two small parties, ChristianUnion and SGP) are based upon the Christian belief. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost and the Ascension of Jesus). In the late 19th century atheism began to rise as secularism, liberalism and socialism grew; in the 1960s and 1970s Protestantism and Catholicism notably began to decline. There is one major exception: Islam, which grew considerably as the result of immigration. Since the year 2000, there has been raised awareness of religion, mainly due to Muslim extremism. Islam is not part of the Dutch identity, culture or tradition. In 2013 a Catholic became Queen consort.\nFrom a December 2014 survey by the VU University Amsterdam it was concluded that for the first time there are more atheists (25%) than theists (17%) in the Netherlands. The majority of the population being agnostic (31%) or ietsists (27%). Atheism, agnosticism and Christian atheism are on the rise and are widely accepted and considered to be non-controversial. Among those who adhere to Christianity, there are high percentages of atheists, agnostics and ietsism, since affiliation with a Christian denomination is also used in a way of cultural identification in the different parts of the Netherlands. In 2015, a vast majority of the inhabitants of the Netherlands (82%) said they had never or almost never visited a church, and 59% stated that they had never been to a church of any kind. Of all the people questioned, 24% saw themselves as atheist, which is an increase of 11% compared to the previous study done in 2006. The expected rise of spirituality (ietsism) has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006, 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual, in 2015 this has dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.\nChristianity is currently the largest religion in the Netherlands. The provinces of North Brabant and Limburg have historically been strongly Roman Catholic, and some of their people might still consider the Catholic Church as a base for their cultural identity. Protestantism in the Netherlands consists of a number of churches within various traditions. The largest of these is the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN), a United church which is Reformed and Lutheran in orientation. It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and a smaller Lutheran Church. Several orthodox Reformed and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN. Although in the Netherlands as a whole Christianity has become a minority, the Netherlands contains a Bible Belt from Zeeland to the northern parts of the province Overijssel, in which Protestant (particularly Reformed) beliefs remain strong, and even has majorities in municipal councils.\nIslam is the second-largest religion in the state. In 2012, there were about 825,000 Muslims in the Netherlands (5% of the population). Muslim numbers increased from the 1960s as a consequence of large numbers of migrant workers. These included migrants from former Dutch colonies, such as Surinam and Indonesia, but mainly migrant workers from Turkey and Morocco. During the 1990s, Muslim refugees arrived from countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, and Afghanistan.\nOther religions account for some 6% of the Dutch people. Hinduism is a minority religion in the Netherlands, with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are Indo-Surinamese. There are also sizable populations of Hindu immigrants from India and Sri Lanka, and some Western adherents of Hinduism-oriented new religious movements such as Hare Krishnas. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 Buddhists or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people. There are about 45,000 Jews in the Netherlands.\nArt and media.\nArt.\nDutch Golden Age painting was among the most acclaimed in the world at the time, during the 17th century. There was an enormous output of painting, so much so that prices declined seriously during the period. From the 1620s, Dutch painting broke decisively from the Baroque style typified by Rubens in neighbouring Flanders into a more realistic style of depiction, very much concerned with the real world. Types of paintings included historical paintings, portraiture, landscapes and cityscapes, still lifes and genre paintings. In the last four of these categories, Dutch painters established styles upon which art in Europe depended for the next two centuries. Paintings often had a moralistic subtext. The Golden Age never really recovered from the French invasion of 1672, although there was a twilight period lasting until about 1710.\nDutch painters, especially in the northern provinces, tried to evoke emotions in the spectator by letting him/her be a bystander to a scene of profound intimacy. Portrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century. A great many portraits were commissioned by wealthy individuals. Group portraits similarly were often ordered by prominent members of a city's civilian guard, by boards of trustees and regents, and the like. Often group portraits were paid for by each portrayed person individually. The key example to this is The Night Watch by Rembrandt. The amount paid determined each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. Allegories, in which painted objects conveyed symbolic meaning about the subject, were often applied. Many genre paintings, which seemingly only depicted everyday life, actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings, or conveyed a moralistic message, the meaning of which is not always easy to decipher nowadays. Favourite topics in Dutch landscapes were the dunes along the western seacoast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often a silhouette of a city in the distance.\nThe Hague School were around at the start of the 19th century. They showed all that is gravest or brightest in the landscape of Holland, all that is heaviest or clearest in its atmosphere. Amsterdam Impressionism was current during the middle of the Nineteenth century at about the same time as French Impressionism. The painters put their impressions onto canvas with rapid, visible strokes of the brush. They focused on depicting the everyday life of the city. Late nineteenth-century Amsterdam was a bustling centre of art and literature. Vincent van Gogh was a post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. In the 20th century, the Netherlands produced many fine painters and artists including (but not limited to): Roelof Frankot, Salomon Garf, Pyke Koch and many more. Around 1905-1910 pointillism was flourishing. Between 1911 and 1914 all the latest art movements arrived in the Netherlands one after another including cubism, futurism and expressionism. After World War I, De Stijl (\"the style\") was led by Piet Mondrian and promoted a pure art, consisting only of vertical and horizontal lines, and the use of primary colours.\nArchitecture.\nThe Dutch Golden Age roughly spanned the 17th century. Due to the thriving economy, cities expanded greatly. New town halls and storehouses were built, and many new canals were dug out in and around various cities such as Delft, Leiden and Amsterdam for defence and transport purposes. Many wealthy merchants had a new house built along these canals. These houses were generally very narrow and had ornamented fa\u00e7ades that befitted their new status. The reason they were narrow was because a house was taxed on the width of the fa\u00e7ade. The architecture of the first republic in Northern Europe was marked by sobriety and restraint, and was meant to reflect democratic values by quoting extensively from classical antiquity. In general, architecture in the Low Countries, both in the Counter-Reformation-influenced south and Protestant-dominated north, remained strongly invested in northern Italian Renaissance and Mannerist forms that predated the Roman High Baroque style of Borromini and Bernini. Instead, the more austere form practiced in the Dutch Republic was well suited to major building patterns: palaces for the House of Orange and new civic buildings, uninfluenced by the Counter-Reformation style that made some headway in Antwerp. At the end of the 19th century there was a remarkable neo-Gothic stream or Gothic Revival both in church and in public architecture, notably by the Roman Catholic Pierre Cuypers, who was inspired by the Frenchman Viollet le Duc. The Amsterdam Rijksmuseum (1876\u20131885) and Amsterdam Centraal Station (1881\u20131889) belong to his main buildings.\nDuring the 20th century Dutch architects played a leading role in the development of modern architecture. Out of the early 20th century rationalist architecture of Berlage, architect of the Beurs van Berlage, three separate groups developed during the 1920s, each with their own view on which direction modern architecture should take. Expressionist architects like M. de Klerk and P.J. Kramer in Amsterdam (\"See Amsterdam School\"). Functionalist architects (\"Nieuwe Zakelijkheid\" or \"Nieuwe Bouwen\") like Mart Stam, L. C. van der Vlugt, Willem Marinus Dudok and Johannes Duiker had good ties with the international modernist group CIAM. A third group came out of the De Stijl movement, among them J. J. P. Oud and Gerrit Rietveld. Both architects later built in a functionalist style. During the 1950s and 1960s a new generation of architects like Aldo van Eyck, J.B. Bakema and Herman Hertzberger, known as the \u2018Forum generation\u2019 (named after a magazine titled \"Forum\") formed a connection with international groups like Team 10. From the '80s to the present Rem Koolhaas and his Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) became one of the leading world architects. With him, formed a new generation of Dutch architects working in a modernist tradition.\nLiterature.\nSome of the most important and internationally awarded writers are:\n16th century:\n17th century:\n19th century:\n20th century:\nComic strips.\nThe Dutch have a distinct comic book tradition as well. Although there is an abundance of Flemish, Franco-Belgian, and US comics, they also created their own. Examples are Secret agent 327 and Storm, written by Martin Lodewijk and Jack, Jacky and the Juniors by Jan Kruis, as well as cartoons with a more literary style, like Viking series \"Eric de Noorman\" by Hans G. Kresse and \"Tom Poes &amp; Heer Bommel\" (Tom Puss/Oliver B. Bumble) created by Marten Toonder. The nation's love of football also translates into comics such as Roel Dijkstra and \"F.C. Knudde\".\nThe children's comic book series Miffy (Dutch: \"Nijntje\") by Dick Bruna has been published in over 50 languages, and predates the similarly drawn Hello Kitty by over ten years.\nMusic and dance.\nThe Netherlands has diverse musical traditions, ranging from folk and dance to classical music and ballet. Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as levenslied, meaning 'song of life', to an extent comparable to French chanson or German schlager. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and refrains. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include love, death and loneliness. Traditional musical instruments such as the accordion and the barrel organ are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years, many artists also use synthesizers and guitars. Artists in this genre include Jan Smit, Frans Bauer and the late Andr\u00e9 Hazes.\nMore than most other non-English speaking European countries, the Netherlands has remained closely in tune with US and British trends since the 1950s. Contemporary Dutch rock and pop music (Nederpop) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the USA and Britain. In the 1960s and 1970s, the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as Shocking Blue, (the) Golden Earring and Focus enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band Doe Maar. Today, Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both. Current symphonic metal bands Epica and Within Temptation, as well as jazz/pop singer Caro Emerald are having some international success. Contemporary local icons include rock singer Anouk, country pop singer Ilse DeLange, rock band Kane and Dutch-language duo Nick &amp; Simon.\nEarly 1990s Dutch and Belgian house music came together in Eurodance project 2 Unlimited. Selling 18 million records, the two singers in the band are the most successful Dutch music artists to this day. Tracks like \"Get Ready for This\" are still popular themes of U.S. sports events, like the NHL. In the mid 1990s Dutch language rap and hip hop (\"Nederhop\") also came to maturation and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. In the 21st century, artists with North African, Caribbean and Middle Eastern origins have profoundly influenced this genre.\nSince the 1990s, Dutch electronic dance music (EDM) has conquered the world in many forms, from trance, techno and gabber to hardstyle. Some of the world's best dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including Armin van Buuren, Ti\u00ebsto, Hardwell, Martin Garrix and Afrojack; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by DJ Mag Top 100 DJs. The Amsterdam dance event (ADE) is the world's leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic subgenres on the planet. These artists also contribute significantly to the mainstream pop music played over the airwaves all around the world, as they frequently collaborate and produce for many notable artists.\nIn classical music, Jan Sweelinck ranks as the Netherlands' most famous composer, with Louis Andriessen amongst the best-known living Dutch classical composers. Celebrated Dutch conductors, past and present, include Willem Mengelberg, Eduard van Beinum, Bernard Haitink, Jac van Steen and Jaap van Zweden. Notable violinists are Janine Jansen and Andr\u00e9 Rieu. The latter, together with his Johann Strauss Orchestra, has taken classical and waltz music on worldwide concert tours, the size and revenue of which are otherwise only seen from the world's biggest rock and pop music acts. Acclaimed harpist Lavinia Meijer in 2012 released an album of works by Philip Glass that she transcribed for harp, with the approval of the composer. The Concertgebouw (completed in 1888) in Amsterdam is home to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, considered one of the world's finest orchestras and on occasion voted the best of all.\nAruba and the five main islands of the Netherlands Antilles are part of the Lesser Antilles island chain. Their music is a mixture of native, African and Dutch elements, and is closely connected with trends from neighbouring islands like Barbados, Martinique, Trinidad and Tobago and Guadeloupe, as well as the mainland former Dutch possession of Suriname, which has exported kaseko music to great success on the islands. Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire likely have the most active and well-known music scenes. Cura\u00e7ao is known for a kind of music called tumba, which is named after the conga drums that accompany it.\nCabaret.\nThe Dutch also have their own distinct version of cabaret, with overarching themes and aimed at provoking thought, and sometimes sentiment, as well as laughs. This is exemplified in performers such as Wim Kan and Toon Hermans in the 1960s and 1970s and later diversified into a rich culture with artists such as Youp van 't Hek, Freek de Jonge, Herman van Veen, Theo Maassen, Claudia de Breij, Dolf Jansen, Brigitte Kaandorp, Hans Teeuwen and Herman Finkers.\nFilm.\nSome Dutch films \u2013 mainly by director Paul Verhoeven \u2013 have received international distribution and recognition, such as \"Turkish Delight\" (\"\"Turks Fruit\") (1973), \"Soldier of Orange\" (\"Soldaat van Oranje\") (1975), \"Spetters\" (1980) and \"The Fourth Man\" (\"De Vierde Man\"\") (1983). Verhoeven then went on to direct big Hollywood films like \"RoboCop\" and \"Basic Instinct\", and returned with Dutch film \"Black Book\" in 2006.\nOther well-known Dutch film directors are Jan de Bont (\"Speed\"), Dick Maas (\"De Lift\"), Fons Rademakers (\"The Assault\"), documentary maker Bert Haanstra and Joris Ivens. Film director Theo van Gogh achieved international notoriety in 2004 when he was murdered in the streets of Amsterdam.\nInternationally successful Dutch actors include Famke Janssen (X-Men films), Carice van Houten (\"Game of Thrones\"), Rutger Hauer (\"Blade Runner\"), Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 and Derek de Lint.\nRadio and television.\nThe Netherlands has a well-developed radio and television market, with both multiple commercial and non-commercial broadcasters. Imported TV programmes, as well as interviews with responses in a foreign language, are virtually always shown with the original sound, and subtitled. The only exception are shows for children.\nTV exports from the Netherlands mostly take the form of specific formats and franchises, most notably through internationally active TV production conglomerate Endemol, founded by Dutch media tycoons John de Mol and Joop van den Ende. Headquartered in Amsterdam, Endemol has around 90 companies in over 30 countries. Endemol and its subsidiaries create and run reality, talent, and game show franchises worldwide, including \"Big Brother, Deal or No Deal, 1 vs. 100 and The Voice.\"\nTwo of the biggest annual Dutch radio events are 3FM Serious Request and the Top 2000 \u2014 both multi-day round-the-clock national broadcasting events in the month of December, supported by other media. They both have over half of the population of the Netherlands listening to the broadcasts each year.\nSerious Request is a Red Cross fundraiser, held the week before Christmas on pop music station 3FM, and has grown to become an international franchise adopted by eight other countries.\nThe \"Top 2000\" is an integral broadcast of the 2,000 most popular songs of all time on station Radio 2 from noon 25 December Christmas Day through midnight of New Year's Eve.\nLifestyle.\nSpatial management.\nThe Netherlands is densely populated and just under one-third of its territory lies below sea level and has to be defended from nature. This has led to a rational and collective approach to spatial planning, and particularly to water management.\nIn urban planning, this is seen in:\nThe Dutch also minimise ostentatious displays of status and wealth difference, and have a low power distance. They accept the need to follow rules, but combine this with tolerance of difference and respect for privacy.\nAs the country's watery geography dictates, the Netherlands has a strong nautical culture.\nTraditions.\nA prime traditional festivity in the Netherlands is Sint Nicolaas or \"Sinterklaas\". It is celebrated on the evening before Sinterklaas' birthday on 5 December, especially in families with little children. Sinterklaas has a companion known as Zwarte Piet, which in recent years has come under scrutiny in light of accusations of racist caricatures. In the United States the original figure of Dutch \"Sinterklaas\" has merged with \"Father Christmas\" into Santa Claus. In the Netherlands, gift-bringing at Christmas has in recent decades gained some popularity too, although Sinterklaas is much more popular.\nThe national holiday is celebrated on 27 April with King's Day (\"Koningsdag\") in honour of the King's birthday. The day is moved up to Saturday if it would otherwise happen on a Sunday. The day is known for its nationwide \"vrijmarkt\" (\"free market\"), at which many Dutch sell their secondhand items. It is also an opportunity for \"orange madness\" or \"oranjegekte\", for the national colour, when the normally strait-laced Dutch let down their hair, often dyed orange for the occasion.\nWorld Animal Day has been observed since 1929, primarily by the children of the Netherlands. It is as well known as Mother's and Father's Day.\nA widespread tradition is that of serving \"beschuit met muisjes\" when people come to visit a new-born baby and its mother. \"Beschuit\" is a typical Dutch type of biscuit, \"muisjes\" are sugared anise seeds. Blue \"muisjes\" are used for a baby boy, and pink \"muisjes\" are used for a baby girl.\nMore regional traditions include the huge Easter Fires or celebrating Sint Maarten on the evening of 11 November when children go door to door with paper lanterns and candles, and sing songs in return for a treat. This holiday is celebrated in some parts of Groningen, North Holland and the southern and middle part of Limburg and to a lesser extent in South Holland and Zeeland. This celebration marks the beginning of the dark period before Christmas and the long days of winter. The same thing happens on 6 January with Epiphany in some areas in the Catholic south of the Netherlands. In the past, home-made lanterns were used, made from a hollowed out sugar beet. In North Brabant, Limburg and some other parts of the Netherlands people celebrate Carnaval similar to the carnival of the German Rhineland and Belgium Flanders.\nCuisine.\nDutch cuisine is characterized by its somewhat limited diversity; however, it varies greatly from region to region. The southern regions of the Netherlands, for example, share dishes with Flanders and vice versa. The Southern Dutch cuisine is the only Dutch culinary region which developed an haute cuisine, as it is influenced by both German cuisine and French cuisine, and it forms the base of most traditional Dutch restaurants. Dutch food is traditionally characterized by the high consumption of vegetables when compared to the consumption of meat. Dairy products are also eaten to great extent, Dutch cheeses are world-renowned with famous cheeses such as Gouda, Edam and Leiden. Dutch pastry is extremely rich and is eaten in great quantities. When it comes to alcoholic beverages wine has long been absent in Dutch cuisine (but this is changing during the last decades); traditionally there are many brands of beer and strong alcoholic spirits such as jenever and brandewijn.\nThe Dutch have all sorts of pastry and cookies (the word \"cookie\" is in fact derived from Dutch), many of them filled with marzipan, almond and chocolate. A truly huge amount of different pies and cakes can be found, most notably in the southern provinces, especially the so-called Limburgish \"vlaai\".\nSports.\nFootball is the most popular sport in the Netherlands. Notable Dutch football teams and clubs include: Amsterdamsche Football club Ajax in 1900, Feyenoord Rotterdam in 1908 and PSV Eindhoven in 1913.\nAnother almost national sport is speedskating. It is common for Northern Dutch children to learn how to skate at an early age. Long distance skating and all-round tournaments are the most popular and most successful areas for the Dutch. In the history of the world championships the champion of the 10\u00a0km has always been a Dutchman. Notable athletes are Sven Kramer, Rintje Ritsma and Ard Schenk.\nAlso popular are swimming, field hockey, judo and cycling.\nA typical Dutch sport is \"korfball\", a mixed sport played by girls and boys. The sport was invented in the Netherlands, but is now also played in countries such as Belgium, Germany and Japan. At the IKF Korfball World Championship the Dutch team has won in all cases except once.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Two experimental engines were tested at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) in 1961 and 1964 respectively.\nOn 1 January 1957, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission selected the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory to study the feasibility of applying heat from a nuclear reactor to power a ramjet engine for a Supersonic Low Altitude Missile. This would have many advantages over other contemporary nuclear weapons delivery systems: operating at Mach 3, or around , and flying as low as , it would be invulnerable to interception by contemporary air defenses, carry more nuclear warheads with greater nuclear weapon yield, deliver them with greater accuracy than was possible with intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at the time and, unlike them, could be recalled.\nThis research became known as Project Pluto, and was directed by Theodore Charles (Ted) Merkle, leader of the laboratory's R Division. Originally carried out at Livermore, California, testing was moved to new facilities constructed for $1.2\u00a0million (equivalent to $ million in 2024) on at NTS Site 401, also known as Jackass Flats. The test reactors were moved about on a railroad car that could be controlled remotely. The need to maintain supersonic speed at low altitude and in all kinds of weather meant that the reactor had to survive high temperatures and intense radiation. Ceramic nuclear fuel elements were used that contained highly enriched uranium oxide fuel and beryllium oxide neutron moderator.\nAfter a series of preliminary tests to verify the integrity of the components under conditions of strain and vibration, Tory II-A, the world's first nuclear ramjet engine, was run at full power (46 MW) on 14 May 1961. A larger, fully-functional ramjet engine was then developed called Tory II-C. This was run at full power (461 MW) on 20 May 1964, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of a nuclear-powered ramjet engine. Despite these and other successful tests, ICBM technology developed quicker than expected, and this reduced the need for cruise missiles. By the early 1960s, there was greater sensitivity about the dangers of radioactive emissions in the atmosphere, and devising an appropriate test plan for the necessary flight tests was difficult. On 1 July 1964, seven years and six months after it was started, Project Pluto was canceled.\nOrigins.\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force (USAF) considered the use of nuclear powered aircraft and missiles as part of its Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project, which was coordinated by the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Office. Research into missiles was coordinated by its Missile Projects Branch. The concept of using a nuclear reactor to provide a heat source for a ramjet was explored by Frank E. Rom and Eldon W. Sams at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Lewis Research Center in 1954 and 1955. The principle behind the nuclear ramjet was relatively simple: motion of the vehicle pushed air in through the front of the vehicle (the ram effect). If a nuclear reactor heated the air, the hot air expanded at high speed out through a nozzle at the back, providing thrust.\nAt the time, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was conducting studies of the use of a nuclear rocket as an upper stage of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on behalf of the USAF. The AEC farmed this work out to its two rival atomic weapons laboratories, the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at Livermore, California. By late 1956 improvements in nuclear weapon design had reduced the need for a nuclear upper stage, and the development effort was concentrated at LASL, where it became known as Project Rover.\nOn 1 January 1957, the USAF and the AEC selected the Livermore Laboratory to study the design of a nuclear reactor to power ramjet engines. This research became known as Project Pluto. It was directed by Theodore C. (Ted) Merkle, leader of the Laboratory's R Division.\nDevelopment.\nThe proposed use for nuclear-powered ramjets would be to power a cruise missile, called Supersonic Low Altitude Missile (SLAM). It would have many advantages over other nuclear weapons delivery systems. It was estimated that the reactor would weigh between , permitting a payload of over . Operating at Mach 3, or around and flying as low as , it would be invulnerable to interception by contemporary air defenses. It could carry more nuclear warheads than the sixteen aboard a Polaris ballistic missile submarine, they could be larger, with nuclear weapon yields of up to , and delivered with greater accuracy. Moreover, unlike an ICBM, it could be recalled.\nIt was estimated that the unit cost of each missile would be less than $5\u00a0million (equivalent to $ million in 2024), making them much cheaper than a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber. Operating costs would also be low, as keeping them in readiness would be cheaper than a submarine or bomber, and comparable with a missile silo-based ICBM. Range would not be unlimited, but would be determined by the fuel load. Merkle calculated that a MW-day of energy would burn about one gram of highly enriched uranium. A 490 MW reactor with 50 kilograms of uranium would therefore burn 1 percent of its fuel each day. Assuming that an accumulation of neutron poisons could be avoided, the missile could fly for several days. The success of the project depended upon a series of technological advances in metallurgy and materials science. Pneumatic motors necessary to control the reactor in flight had to operate while red-hot and in the presence of intense ionizing radiation. The need to maintain supersonic speed at low altitude and in all kinds of weather meant that the missile would have to fly though much denser air. In turn, this meant that it would encounter much greater air resistance and have to generate more power to overcome it. The reactor, code-named \"Tory\", would therefore have to survive high temperatures that would melt the metals used in most jet and rocket engines. \nThe solution arrived at was to use ceramic fuel elements. The core of the reactor would be made of beryllium oxide (BeO), the only available neutron moderator material that could withstand the high temperatures required. Over 80 percent of the fueled tubes were long; the rest varied in length so as to achieve the correct column length and arrangement. The tubes consisted of a BeO matrix with a grain size between in diameter containing a solid solution of urania (UO2), zirconia (ZrO2) and yttria (Y2O3). The Tory II-A reactor used a uranium-beryllia mixture, but by the time Tory II-C was built zirconia and yttria was added in a 1.06:1:1 ratio of urania:zirconia:yttria. The zirconia and yttria stabilized the urania against phase transition to triuranium octoxide (U3O8) at temperatures around . The fuel particles of the urania-zirconia-yttria mixture (known as \"horseradish\") were mostly from in size, although some were smaller or larger. The uranium was in the form of oralloy: uranium enriched to 93.2 percent uranium-235.\nThe tubes had a hexagonal cross-section measuring from one flat side to the opposite, with a diameter hole in the center. They were closely packed to form a honeycomb pattern. The metal tie rods were made of Ren\u00e9 41 and Hastelloy R235 and were cooled so they did not exceed . The ceramic tubes surrounding the tie rods (known as guard tubes) were unfueled and had smaller diameter holes. The core was surrounded by neutron reflectors on all sides.The forward reflector was thick and the aft reflector thick. Both were composed of BeO tubes. The side reflector consisted of of BeO tubes around which was of nickel shims. The reactor was controlled through the movement of hafnium control rods that moved axially within the tie rods. Twelve of the rods, known as shim rods, were located about from the central axis of the core, while two were located closer to the reflector; one was a vernier rod and the other as a safety rod. Normally the movement of the rods was restricted to but in the event of a scram they could be moved in 1.5 seconds. The shim rods were moved by four actuators, each of which handled three shim rods. The shim rods were long and in diameter, with a travel.\nThe contract to manufacture the fuel elements was awarded to the Coors Porcelain Company. The process of making horseradish involved mixing sinterable BeO powder with oralloy uranyl nitrate, yttrium nitrate and zirconium nitrate to form a slurry which was coprecipitated by adding ammonium nitrate. Because the process involved oralloy, criticality safety required a long, narrow geometry for the mix tanks. The mixture was filtered, dried and calcined at . It was then blended with a binding mixture containing polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose and water and extruded through a die at to form the tubes. The tubes were dried, the binder was burned out by heating to , and they were fired in hydrogen at to densify them. The maximum permissible effect on reactivity due to impurities in the tubes was 2 to 3 percent. In practice it was only 0.5 percent.\nTest facilities.\nTests were conducted at new facilities constructed for $1.2\u00a0million (equivalent to $ million in 2024) on of Jackass Flats at the AEC's Nevada Test Site (NTS), known as Site 401. The facilities there were shared with Project Rover. The complex included of roads, critical-assembly building, control building, assembly and shop buildings, and utilities.\nAn aggregate mine was purchased to supply the concrete for the walls of the disassembly building, Building 2201, which were thick. Building 2201 was designed to allow radioactive components to be adjusted, dissembled or replaced remotely. Operations in the main disassembly bay could be viewed through lead glass viewing windows. \"Hot\" cells adjacent to the disassembly bay were used to monitor the control rod actuators. Vaults within each cell were equipped with remote manipulators.\nAll controls were located in the central control room, which was air conditioned with a positive pressure so air always flowed towards the disassembly bay and the hot cells, and the used air from them was passed through filters. The main disassembly bay and the hot cells were accessible through openings that were normally covered with lead plates. There were showers and a radiation safety room for workers. Building 2201 also contained a maintenance shop, darkroom, offices, and equipment storage rooms. Scientists monitored the tests remotely via a television hook up from a tin shed located at a safe distance that had a fallout shelter stocked with two weeks' supply of food and water in the event of a major catastrophe.\nSome of oil well casing was necessary to store the approximately of compressed air at used to simulate ramjet flight conditions for Pluto. Three giant compressors were borrowed from the Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut that could replenish the farm in five days. A five-minute, full-power test involved of air being forced over 14 million diameter steel balls that were held in four steel tanks which were heated to .\nBecause the test reactors were highly radioactive once they were started, they were transported to and from the test site on railroad cars. The \"Jackass and Western Railroad\", as it was light-heartedly described, was said to be the world's shortest and slowest railroad. There were two locomotives, the remotely controlled electric L-1, and the diesel/electric L-2, which was manually controlled but had radiation shielding around the cab. The former was normally used; the latter was as a backup. The Cold Assembly Bay (Room 101) in Building 2201 was used for storage and assembly of components of the reactor test vehicle. It also contained a maintenance service pit and battery charger for the locomotives.\nTory II-A.\nIn 1957, the Livermore Laboratory began working on a prototype reactor called Tory II-A to test the proposed design. It was initially intended to build two Tory II-A test reactors, which were designated IIA-1 and IIA-2; ultimately only one was built. Its purpose was to test the design under conditions similar to that in a ramjet engine. To save time, money, and reduce its complexity, Tory II-A had a diameter about a third of that required for the engine, a much smaller diameter than the final design. To allow it to still reach criticality with reduced fuel, the core was surrounded by a thick nuclear graphite neutron reflector.\nThe Tory II-A design process was completed by early 1960. During the summer and early fall of that year, the core was assembled at Livermore inside a special fixture in a shielded containment building. It reached criticality on 7 October with the control vanes rotated 90\u00b0 from the full shutdown position. A test was then carried out with the cooling passages of the core and neutron reflector filled with water. Instead of the predicted increase in reactivity, there was a drop, and the reactor could not go critical at all. The water was replaced with heavy water, but it was barely able to reach criticality. It was therefore concluded that additional fuel would be required to attain the required margin for error when more components were installed.\nThe reactor was shipped to the Nevada Test Site for a series of dry runs and zero- or low-power tests. Another layer of fuel elements was added. The reactor was mounted on the test vehicle and, with heavy water for coolant, reached criticality during a test run on 9 December, with the control vanes at 65\u00b0. It was estimated that without the heavy water, 71\u00b0 would have been required. Boron rods were then inserted into the six central tie tubes. This lowered the reactivity of the core, and the vanes had to be turned to 132\u00b0 before criticality was achieved. Oralloy foils were placed in the core tubes, and the reactor was run at 150 W for ten minutes.\nThe next set of tests involved blowing air through the reactor while it was subcritical to test the integrity of the components under conditions of strain and vibration. On 17 and 18 December, air flow rates of for 30 seconds. During what was intended to be the final qualification test on 11 January 1961, with an air flow rate of and a core temperature of , the clamp holding the exit nozzle to the air duct on the test vehicle broke, and the nozzle flew through the air. Following this mishap, it was decided to conduct a test of radio-controlled disconnection and removal of the reactor from the test vehicle. During this test the electrically controlled coupler between the locomotive and the test vehicle suddenly opened, and the test vehicle careened down the track and violently struck the concrete face of the test pad bunker at the end. The test vehicle was extensively damaged, and had to be stripped down and rebuilt. All the reactor components had to be checked for cracks.\nWith repairs completed, the Tory II-A was returned to the test pad for another series of tests. It was found that without cooling water, the reactor reached criticality with the control vanes at 75\u00b0; with heavy water for coolant it was reached with them at 67\u00b0. With hot air flowing through the reactor, the core temperature was raised to , then to , and finally to . It was then operated at 10 KW for 60 seconds at . A final test was conducted on 3 May, with an air flow rate of , a core temperature of and no incidents.\nTory II-A was operated at its designed value on 14 May, when it reached a power output of 46 MW with a core temperature of . Three high power test runs were conducted on 28 September, 5 October and 6 October. These reached power levels of 144, 166 and 162 MW with core temperatures of respectively. With the tests conducted successfully, the reactor was disassembled between December 1961 and September 1962.\nTory II-C.\nTory II-A tested the reactor design and the integrity of the fuel elements under a simulation of operational conditions. Livermore now produced a second reactor, Tory II-C, which would be a fully functional engine for a ramjet missile. Issues that had been ignored in the design of Tory II-A had to be resolved in that of Tory II-C. The new design was complete by August 1962. The Tory II-C reactor was cylindrical in shape, long and in diameter. It contained about 293,000 fueled and 16,000 unfueled beryllium oxide tubes, which occupied 55 percent of its volume. The fuel loading varied through the reactor to achieve the right power profile. In operation, the core generated .\nThe checkout of the test facilities for Tory II-C testing commenced on 17 November 1962. The facilities were incomplete when this testing began, so many of the tests were in support of the construction program. These tests fell into four categories: testing of the air supply system; testing of the other facilities components; qualification of the test vehicle; and operator training. The facilities checkout ended on 5 March 1964, by which time 82 tests had been carried out.\nBefore attempting a high power reactor test, five major tests were performed. The first test, conducted on 23 March, was a subcritical test of the twelve hand-inserted and six electrically-activated auxiliary shutdown rods. The purpose of the test was to verify that the operational rods could be removed safely so long as the auxiliary rods were in place. This would mean that staff would not have to be removed from the test bunker area during checkout. The test was conducted as if it were a critical one, with all personnel evacuated from the test area and the test managed remotely from the control room. The test verified the predictions made at Livermore; the operational rods could be withdrawn safely. A cold critical test was then conducted the following day to verify that the instrumentation was working correctly.\nHot zero-power tests were conducted on 9 and 23 April. These involved testing the core under air flow conditions approaching those of a full power run. The test plan for the first test called for running air at at a rate of for 60 seconds. The test was aborted and the shim rods scrammed (shut down the reactor) when vibration exceeded a pre-set level. It turned out that the vibration of the core was not the problem: it was the transducers used to measure vibration that were not operating properly. Loose connections were repaired, and a second test scheduled. This time it was planned to operate successively at . This was done, and there was no vibration. The test also qualified the thermocouples used to monitor the core's temperature. \nThe next step was to conduct a low power test with air at on 7 May. As the air flow was reaching its maximum, shim actuator B2 became noisy and was placed on hold. Then, soon after the maximum was reached, actuator A1 detected a loss of air pressure and scrammed. Actuators A2 and B1 began moving to compensate for the loss of reactivity. A manual scram was then ordered, although in hindsight this was unnecessary. The problem with B2 was traced to a faulty wire, and the problem with A1 to a faulty pressure switch. Since there were no outstanding problems, the decision was taken to proceed with an intermediate power test on 12 May. This test aimed to simulate the conditions of a Mach 2.8 flight at . The reactor was taken to critical and the power increased to 750 kW. Air flow was then increased to at an average temperature of . The core reached . The test was concluded after an hour and 45 minutes.\nThe stage was now set for a full power test on 20 May 1964. This would simulate a Mach 2.8 flight on a hot day at sea level. The reactor was started and power raised to 700 kW. Air was introduced at and then raised to . The reactor power was then increased to around 76 MW, at which point the core temperature was . All systems were functioning normally, so the airflow was increased to and power increased until the core temperature reached , at which point the power output was around 461 MW. The reactor was run for five minutes, after which a manual scram was initiated, and the airflow reduced to for two minutes. The whole test took about an hour. Inspection of the reactor afterwards was done without disassembly. No blockages or anomalies were detected. The control rods were all in place, and there was no evidence of damage or corrosion.\nTermination.\nDespite the successful tests, the Department of Defense, the sponsor of the Pluto project, had second thoughts. ICBM technology had developed more quickly than expected, reducing the need for such highly capable cruise missiles. There were concerns about whether something so noisy, hot and radioactive could go undetected, and it would be dangerous to anyone and anything in its path. An ICBM traveled to its target faster and was less vulnerable to interception by Soviet air defenses. The main advantage of the SLAM was its ability to carry a larger payload, but the value of this was diminished by improvements in nuclear weapon design that made them smaller and lighter, and the subsequent development of multiple warhead capability in ICBMs.\nThe other major problem with the SLAM concept was the environmental damage caused by radioactive emissions during flight, and the disposal of the reactor at the end of the mission. Merkle estimated that about 100 grams of fission products would be produced, of which he expected a few grams to be released and dispersed over a wide area. Atmospheric nuclear testing was still ongoing in the early 1960s, so the radioactive emissions were not considered to be a major problem by comparison. Although small compared to that produced by a nuclear explosion, it was a problem for testing. The noise level was estimated to be a deafening 150 decibels. There was also the possibility of the missile going out of control.\nThe idea of testing it over Nevada was quickly discarded. It was proposed to conduct test flights in the vicinity of Wake Island, flying a figure-eight course. The reactor would then be dumped into the Pacific Ocean where it was deep. By the early 1960s there was increasing public awareness of the undesirable environmental impacts of radioactive contamination of the atmosphere and the ocean, and the radioactive emissions from the missile were considered unacceptable wherever the tests were conducted.\nThe AEC requested $8\u00a0million (equivalent to $ million in 2024) in fiscal year 1965 for continued tests of Tory II-C and the development of Tory III, an improved version. In April 1964, the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy recommended that $1.5\u00a0million be cut from this request. This provided continued funding for Tory II-C, but not for the development of Tory III. The Department of Defense's Director of Research and Engineering, Harold Brown, favored the continuation of Project Pluto at a low level of funding to progress the technology. This was rejected by the House Appropriations Committee; the technology had been demonstrated by the successful Tory II-C tests, and if there was no longer a military requirement for it, there was no reason to continue funding. It therefore cut another $5.5\u00a0million from the funding request, leaving only $1\u00a0million for \"mothballing\" the project.\nOn 1 July 1964, seven years and six months after it was started, Project Pluto was canceled. Merkle hosted a celebratory dinner at a nearby country club for project participants where SLAM tie tacks and bottles of \"Pluto\" mineral water were given away as souvenirs. At its peak, Project Pluto had employed around 350 people at Livermore and 100 at Site 401, and the total amount spent had been about $260\u00a0million (equivalent to $ billion in 2024).\nCleanup.\nThe Tory II-C reactor was not disassembled after the high-power test and remained at Jackass Flats until 1976, when it was disassembled at the Engine Maintenance, Assembly, and Disassembly (E-MAD) building there. In 1971 and 1972, Building 2201 was used by the Fuel Repackaging Operations Project. Fuel elements from the Tory\u00a0II reactors were removed from the hot cells in Building 2201 and taken to Area\u00a06, from whence they were shipped to the Idaho National Laboratory. Building 2201 was used in the 1970s and 1980s to house the Hydrogen Content Test Facility. Starting in 1986, the Sandia National Laboratory used it for a series of classified projects related to nuclear weapons, and in 1998 an unidentified organization used it for a classified project. Building 2201 was cleaned and decontaminated between 2007 and 2009 to make it safe for future demolition. In September 2013, it was reported that it had been demolished. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates https:// from "}
{"id": "57685", "revid": "44227202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57685", "title": "Music history", "text": "Academic field\nMusic history, sometimes called historical musicology, is a highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of musicology that studies music from a historical point of view. In theory, \"music history\" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music (e.g., the history of Nigerian music or the history of rock); in practice, these research topics are often categorized as part of ethnomusicology or cultural studies, whether or not they are ethnographically based. The terms \"music history\" and \"historical musicology\" usually refer to the history of the notated music of Western elites, sometimes called \"art music\" (by analogy to art history, which tends to focus on elite art).\nThe methods of music history include source studies (esp. manuscript studies), paleography, philology (especially textual criticism), style criticism, historiography (the choice of historical method), musical analysis, and iconography. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of music theory. Some of the intellectual products of music historians include peer-reviewed articles in journals, university press-published music history books, university textbooks, new editions of musical works, biographies of composers and other musicians, studies of the relationship between words and music, and reflections upon the role of music in society.\nPedagogy.\nAlthough most performers of classical and traditional instruments receive some instruction in music history, whether this is the history of art music, pop, or rock and roll, etc. These from their music teachers throughout their lessons and high school classes, the majority of formal music history courses are offered at the post-secondary (college or university) level. In Canada, some music students receive training prior to undergraduate studies because examinations in music history (as well as music theory) are required to complete Royal Conservatory of Music certification at the Grade 9 level and higher.\nMost medium and large institutions will offer music appreciation courses for non-music majors and music history courses for music majors. The two types of courses will usually differ in length (one to two semesters vs. two to four), breadth (many music appreciation courses begin at the late Baroque or classical eras and might omit music after WWII while courses for music majors traditionally span the period from the Middle Ages to the current era), and depth. Both types of courses broach on a narrower subject while introducing more of the tools of research in music history. The range of possible topics is virtually limitless. Some examples might be \"Music during World War I,\" \"Medieval and Renaissance instrumental music,\" \"Music and politics,\" \"Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\", or Women and music.\"\nThe methods and tools of music history are nearly as many as its subjects and therefore make a strict categorization impossible. However, a few trends and approaches can be outlined here. Like in any other historical discipline, most research in music history can be roughly divided into two categories: the establishing of factual and correct data and the interpretation of data. Most historical research does not fall into one category solely, but rather employs a combination of methods from both categories. The act of establishing factual data can never be fully separate from the act of interpretation.\nArchival work may be conducted to find connections to music or musicians in a collection of documents of broader interests (e.g., Vatican pay records, letters to a patroness of the arts) or to more systematically study a collection of documents related to a musician. In some cases, where records, scores, and letters have been digitized, archival work can be done online. One example of a composer for whom archival materials can be examined online is the Arnold Schoenberg Center.\nPerformance practice draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Scholars investigate questions such as which instruments or voices were used to perform a given work, what tempos (or tempo changes) were used, and how (or if) ornaments were used. Although performance practice was previously confined to early music from the Baroque era, since the 1990s, research in performance practice has examined other historical eras, such as how early Classical era piano concerti were performed, how the early history of recording affected the use of vibrato in classical music, or which instruments were used in Klezmer music.\nBiographical studies of composers can give us a better sense of the chronology of compositions, influences on style and works, and provide important background to the interpretation (by performers or listeners) of works. Thus biography can form one part of the larger study of the cultural significance, underlying program, or agenda of a work; a study which gained increasing importance in the 1980s and early 1990s.\nSociological studies focus on the function of music in society as well as its meaning for individuals and society as a whole. Researchers emphasizing the social importance of music (including classical music) are sometimes called New musicologists. They may examine the intersection of music and music-making with issues such as race, class, gender, sexuality (e.g. LGBTQ), and disability, among other approaches.\nSemiotic studies are most conventionally the province of music analysts rather than historians. However, crucial to the practice of musical semiotics \u2013 the interpretation of meaning in a work or style \u2013 is its situation in a historical context. The interpretative work of scholars such as Kofi Agawu and Lawrence Kramer fall between the analytic and the music historical.\nHistory.\nBefore 1898.\nThe first studies of Western musical history date back to the middle of the 18th century. G.B. Martini published a three volume history titled \"Storia della musica\" (\"History of Music\") between 1757 and 1781. Martin Gerbert published a two volume history of sacred music titled \"De cantu de musica sacra\" in 1774. Gerbert followed this work with a three volume work \"Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra\" containing significant writings on sacred music from the 3rd century onwards in 1784.\n1800\u20131950.\nIn the 20th century, the work of Johannes Wolf and others developed studies in Medieval music and early Renaissance music. Wolf's writings on the history of musical notation are considered to be particularly notable by musicologists. Historical musicology has played a critical role in renewed interest in Baroque music as well as medieval and Renaissance music. In particular, the authentic performance movement owes much to historical musicological scholarship. Towards the middle of the 20th century, musicology (and its largest subfield of historical musicology) expanded significantly as a field of study. Concurrently the number of musicological and music journals increased to create further outlets for the publication of research. The domination of German language scholarship ebbed as significant journals sprang up throughout the West, especially America.\nCritiques.\nExclusion of disciplines and musics.\nIn its most narrow definition, historical musicology is the music history of Western culture. Such a definition arbitrarily excludes disciplines other than history, cultures other than Western, and forms of music other than \"classical\" (\"art\", \"serious\", \"high culture\") or notated (\"artificial\") \u2013 implying that the omitted disciplines, cultures, and musical styles/genres are somehow inferior. A somewhat broader definition incorporating all musical humanities is still problematic, because it arbitrarily excludes the relevant (natural) sciences (acoustics, psychology, physiology, neurosciences, information and computer sciences, empirical sociology and aesthetics) as well as musical practice. The musicological sub-disciplines of music theory and music analysis have likewise historically been rather uneasily separated from the most narrow definition of historical musicology.\nWithin historical musicology, scholars have been reluctant to adopt postmodern and critical approaches that are common elsewhere in the humanities. According to Susan McClary (2000, p.\u00a01285) the discipline of \"music lags behind the other arts; it picks up ideas from other media just when they have become outmoded.\" Only in the 1990s did historical musicologists, preceded by feminist musicologists in the late 1980s, begin to address issues such as gender, sexualities, bodies, emotions, and subjectivities which dominated the humanities for twenty years before (ibid, p.\u00a010). In McClary's words (1991, p.\u00a05), \"It almost seems that musicology managed miraculously to pass directly from pre- to postfeminism without ever having to change \u2013 or even examine \u2013 its ways.\" Furthermore, in their discussion on musicology and rock music, Susan McClary and Robert Walser also address a key struggle within the discipline: how musicology has often \"dismisse[d] questions of socio-musical interaction out of hand, that part of classical music's greatness is ascribed to its autonomy from society.\" (1988, p.\u00a0283)\nExclusion of popular music.\nAccording to Richard Middleton, the strongest criticism of (historical) musicology has been that it generally ignores popular music. Though musicological study of popular music has vastly increased in quantity recently, Middleton's assertion in 1990\u2014that most major \"works of musicology, theoretical or historical, act as though popular music did not exist\"\u2014holds true. Academic and conservatory training typically only peripherally addresses this broad spectrum of musics, and many (historical) musicologists who are \"both contemptuous and condescending are looking for types of production, musical form, and listening which they associate with a \"different\" kind of music...'classical music'...and they generally find popular music lacking\"\nHe cites three main aspects of this problem (p.\u00a0104\u20136). The terminology of historical musicology is \"slanted by the needs and history of a particular music ('classical music').\" He acknowledges that \"there is a rich vocabulary for certain areas [harmony, tonality, certain part-writing and forms], important in musicology's typical corpus\"; yet he points out that there is \"an impoverished vocabulary for other areas [rhythm, pitch nuance and gradation, and timbre], which are less well developed\" in Classical music. Middleton argues that a number of \"terms are ideologically loaded\" in that \"they always involve selective, and often unconsciously formulated, conceptions of what music \"is\".\"\nAs well, he claims that historical musicology uses \"a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation,\" 'notational centricity' (Tagg 1979, p.\u00a028\u201332). As a result, \"musicological methods tend to foreground those musical parameters which can be easily notated\" such as pitch relationships or the relationship between words and music. On the other hand, historical musicology tends to \"neglect or have difficulty with parameters which are not easily notated\", such as tone colour or non-Western rhythms. In addition, he claims that the \"notation-centric training\" of Western music schools \"induces particular forms of \"listening\", and these then tend to be applied to \"all\" sorts of music, appropriately or not\". As a result, Western music students trained in historical musicology may listen to a funk or Latin song that is very rhythmically complex, but then dismiss it as a low-level musical work because it has a very simple melody and only uses two or five chords.\nNotational centricity also encourages \"reification: the score comes to be seen as 'the music', or perhaps the music in an ideal form.\" As such, music that does not use a written score, such as jazz, blues, or folk, can become demoted to a lower level of status. As well, historical musicology has \"an ideology slanted by the origins and development of a particular body of music and its aesthetic...It arose at a specific moment, in a specific context \u2013 nineteenth-century Europe, especially Germany \u2013 and in close association with that movement in the musical \"practice\" of the period which was codifying the very repertory then taken by musicology as the centre of its attention.\" These terminological, methodological, and ideological problems affect even works sympathetic to popular music. However, it is not \"that musicology \"cannot\" understand popular music, or that students of popular music should abandon musicology.\" (Middleton, p.\u00a0104).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The series centers on the adventures of a large and diverse cast of characters, headed by the titular character, Homestar Runner. It uses a blend of surreal humor, self-parody, satire, and references to popular culture, in particular video games, classic television, and popular music.\nHomestar Runner originated in 1996 as a book written by Mike Chapman and Craig Zobel, intended as a parody of children's literature. While learning Macromedia Flash, Mike and his brother Matt expanded the concept into a website, which was launched on New Year's Day 2000. While the site originally centered on the title character, the \"Strong Bad Email\" cartoon skits quickly became the site's most popular and prominent feature, with Strong Bad, initially the series' main antagonist, becoming a breakout character. Since 2000, the site has grown to encompass a variety of cartoons and web games featuring Homestar, Strong Bad, and numerous other characters.\nAt the peak of its popularity, the site was one of the most-visited sites with collections of Flash cartoons on the web, spreading via word of mouth. The site sustains itself through merchandise sales and has never featured advertisements. The Brothers Chaps have turned down offers to make a television series.\nAfter a four-year hiatus beginning in 2010, Homestar Runner returned with a new Holiday Toon on April 1, 2014, for April Fools' Day. Afterwards, co-creator Matt Chapman announced plans to give the site semi-regular updates. Since global support for Flash ended on December 31, 2020, homestarrunner.com has maintained a fully functional website through the Flash emulator Ruffle. More cartoons have since been released on the website and its YouTube channel on an occasional basis, usually to celebrate holidays.\nHistory.\n1996\u20132000: Development.\n\"Homestar Runner\" was created in Atlanta in 1996 by University of Georgia students Mike Chapman and friend Craig Zobel, who wrote the original picture book, \"The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest Man in the World Contest\", while working summer jobs surrounding the 1996 Summer Olympics.\nMatt described the origin of the name \"Homestar Runner\" as an in-joke between themselves and James Huggins, a childhood friend of the Chapman brothers while growing up in Dunwoody, Georgia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It actually comes from a friend of ours [James]. There was an old local grocery store commercial, and we live in Atlanta, and it advertised the Atlanta Braves. It was like, \"the Atlanta Braves hit home runs, and you can hit a home run with savings here!\" And so there was this player named Mark Lemke, and they said something like \"All star second baseman for the Braves\". And our friend James knows nothing about sports, and so he would always do his old-timey radio impression of this guy, and not knowing any positions in baseball or whatever, he'd just be like, \"homestar runner for the Braves\". And we were just like, \"Homestar Runner? That's the best thing we've ever heard!\"\nWhen Mike and Craig were in a bookstore and made a remark about how \"awful\" the children's books were, the idea to write their own children's book occurred to them. They spent around two hours designing the look of Homestar Runner, Pom Pom, Strong Bad, and The Cheat, and completed the book within a day. They only printed about five to ten copies to share with friends, and had no intention to publish it. However, they had no idea that their father had sent out the book as a manuscript for submission to about 80 different publishers, but they only got rejection letters back, if anything. The pair began to work on a sequel, \"Homestar Runner Goes for the Gold\", which would have introduced Strong Bad's brothers, Strong Mad and Strong Sad, but was eventually abandoned. They later used the Super NES video game \"Mario Paint\" to create the first cartoon featuring the characters.\n2000\u20132009: Launch and initial popularity.\nAround 1999 Mike recognized how popular Flash animation was taking off, and he and his younger brother Matt Chapman started to learn Flash on their own. Looking for something on which to practice, they found inspiration in the old \"children's\" book. Their initial cartoons were launched on their dedicated website, homestarrunner.com, by 2000. Mike animated the cartoons, Matt provided the voices of the male characters, and Mike's girlfriend (now wife) Missy Palmer provided the voice of Marzipan.\nThey initially started off with shorts that featured competitions between Homestar Runner as a heroic character and Strong Bad as the villain, but these did not really capture viewers. Mike and Matt came up with the idea of animating the scenes between competitions; Matt stated \"that was the stuff that was funnier, the stuff happening between the plot points, which is hilarious because we hadn't even established a routine of making cartoons about competitions, we'd made like one\". From May 2000 to February 2001, the website and cartoons started out with different art styles. In February 2001 it gained a new look, which has largely remained consistent to the present with minor changes.\nThe site grew slowly at first and primarily through word-of-mouth. They were able to sell a \"few dozen\" T-shirts by 2001. Mike moved back to New York in mid-2001 and he and Matt started crafting the first Strong Bad Email \"some kinda robot\", intending this to be a weekly feature. The Strong Bad Email series proved very popular, generating significant interest in the site; when the brothers were late in publishing a new Strong Bad Email, they received angry emails asking where the new short was, which Matt said was \"a cool feeling to know you're as important as a cup of coffee or morning crossword to some folks\". Their father suggested Matt quit his full-time job to devote time to creating more Homestar Runner shorts. With the number of visitors to the site growing, by January 2003 the site had outgrown its original web host, Yahoo. Merchandise sales paid for all of the costs of running the website as well as living costs of the creators, whose retired parents managed many of the business aspects.\nThe brothers considered the period between 2002 and 2005 to be their most creative and successful, exploring various different media for the shorts and having a large quantity of merchandise. Matt considered a day in February 2004 to be the highlight of the series, having received a demo tape from They Might Be Giants for a song to use in a Strong Bad Email short and a life-sized replica of Tom Servo from \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" producer Jim Mallon on the same day. They also reflected on how Homestar Runner had been a common point of reference over which newly formed couples bonded and how Joss Whedon incorporated references to Homestar Runner into his television shows \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Angel\" as further signs of success.\n2009\u20132014: Hiatus.\nThrough 2010 Homestar Runner remained financially viable for the brothers through sales of related merchandise. Both brothers were married by 2010 and had their children to care for, and they recognized that they would need to find other jobs to support their respective families. When Matt had a second daughter, the two agreed to put the series on hiatus, knowing they would want to come back to it but could not guarantee a time frame. Mike also noted that they had spent nearly ten years delivering a weekly cartoon, and believed that, creatively, they needed a break. The success of Homestar Runner led to Matt and Mike getting writing jobs for television animated series \"Yo Gabba Gabba!\", \"Gravity Falls\", \"The Aquabats! Super Show!\", and \"Wander Over Yonder\".\nDuring this hiatus the brothers released a small number of Homestar Runner cartoons, including ones for 2010's April Fools' Day and Decemberween holidays. They also made a special video featuring Homestar and Strong Bad for the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con to introduce a panel regarding the history of W00tstock.\n2014\u2013present: return.\nMatt, after completing work on Gravity Falls, moved back to Atlanta in 2014 where Mike was living, and the two agreed that they now had the opportunity to return to \"Homestar Runner\" on a semi-regular basis. Their first short in nearly four years, posted on April 1, 2014, poked fun at how they had not updated the site in years. Matt confirmed their commitment to continue the series in July 2014. Since then, the site has featured occasional updates, usually for holidays. Until 2017, this was mostly due to the brothers' involvement in developing the Disney XD animated show \"Two More Eggs\".\nWith the impending discontinuation of Adobe Flash in December 2020, most new \"Homestar Runner\" animations were released directly as videos to YouTube; the brothers also worked to transfer the older Flash content into video format for archival purposes. Prior to Flash's discontinuation, the Internet Archive included Homestar Runner content in its collection of Flash animations and games. The content is directly viewable in modern browsers through the Ruffle Flash emulator. The \"Homestar Runner\" website itself was also updated to use Ruffle, restoring much of its original functionality.\nCharacters.\nHomestar Runner cartoons typically center on Homestar Runner, Strong Bad, and the other ten main characters: The Cheat, Marzipan, Coach Z, Bubs, Strong Sad, Strong Mad, Pom Pom, the King of Town, the Poopsmith, and Homsar. The Brothers Chaps have described them as \u201cdumb animal characters\u201d. These characters all live in the fictional town of Free Country, USA. Each character has multiple alternate versions of themselves, such as \"Old-Timey\" and \"20X6\" versions.\nCartoons.\n\"Homestar Runner\" features several spin-off series from the main \"shorts\" and \"big 'toons\", including the most well-known, Strong Bad Email.\nStrong Bad Email.\nStrong Bad Emails (also known as \"sbemails\") is a series featuring Strong Bad answering emails from fans. Since starting in August 2001, the initially brief episodes have grown in length and scope, introducing numerous spin-offs, characters, and inside jokes, such as Homsar, Trogdor, Senor Cardgage, 20X6, the Teen Girl Squad shorts, and Homestar Runner Emails (also known as \"hremails\"). The format, however, has remained largely unchanged. Each episode typically begins with Strong Bad singing a short song to himself while booting up his computer to check fan emails. Starting a reply, he typically mocks the sender's name, spelling, and grammar, and rarely answers questions directly. While early episodes focused mostly on Strong Bad sitting at the computer with occasional cutaways, the cutaways would become more elaborate over time, allowing for more complex story lines to develop, growing tangentially from the initial email. Each episode closes with Strong Bad finishing his reply, closing the episode with a link to email Strong Bad appearing via \"The Paper\", a dot matrix printer at the top of the screen. In later episodes, it is replaced with the \"New Paper\", an inkjet printer; then with the \"Comp\u00e9-per\", a pop-up balloon; and finally with a CGI version of the original Paper, which instead promotes Strong Bad's Twitter account. As of November 24, 2025, 210 Strong Bad Emails have been released on the website (with another six exclusive to DVD releases), separable into distinct eras by Strong Bad's different computers; the Tandy 400, the Compy 386, the Lappy 486, the Comp\u00e9, and his current computer, the Lappier.\nHoliday specials.\nPrior to the 2010 hiatus, holiday specials were a regular feature of the site, released to coincide with popular holidays, specifically Halloween and Decemberween (a fictional holiday similar to Christmas also celebrated on December 25). Halloween shorts typically feature the main characters celebrating a traditional aspect of the holiday (such as ghost stories, trick-or-treating or pumpkin carving) in costume, often making pop culture references relating to their costumes. The site also usually releases a separate Halloween video where Strong Bad views a slideshow and mocks and/or appraises photos sent in by real life fans of their Halloween costumes and props modeled after \"Homestar Runner\" characters and other elements. Similarly, Decemberween cartoons typically satirize Christmas traditions such as gift-giving and carol-singing. The fact that it takes place on the same day as Christmas has been presented as just a coincidence, having been stated that Decemberween takes place \"55 days after Halloween\". April Fools' Day features various gags, such as turning the site into a paid subscription service, or turning it upside down.\nOther holidays celebrated include New Year's Day, \"The Big Game\" (around the time of the Super Bowl), St. Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, \"Senorial Day\" (a parody of Memorial Day featuring the character Senor Cardgage), Flag Day, Independence Day, Labor Day (occasionally referred to as \"Labor Dabor\"), Thanksgiving, and Easter.\nTeen Girl Squad.\nTeen Girl Squad is a crudely drawn comic strip narrated by Strong Bad, using a falsetto voice. The series was a spin off of Strong Bad Email No. 53, \"comic\", in which Strong Bad is asked to make a comic strip of a girl and her friends. The comic features four archetypal teenage girls, \"Cheerleader\", \"So and So\", \"What's Her Face\" and \"The Ugly One\", and satirizes high school life, teen movies, and television. Each episode follows the girls in typical high school situations, often leading to their gruesome deaths. A spinoff of this series is \"4 Gregs\", which follows four of the squad's nerdy classmates, all named Greg.\nMarzipan's Answering Machine.\nMarzipan's Answering Machine is a series of cartoons with almost no animation. It features messages from the other characters, being played on the answering machine belonging to the character Marzipan. In early episodes, the episode number ended in .0 (for example, Marzipan's Answering Machine Version 5.0), but since Marzipan changed to a new answering machine, the number ends in .2 (for example, Marzipan's Answering Machine Version 15.2). In every episode, Strong Bad prank calls Marzipan, badly pretending to be someone else, such as \"Detective Everybody\", \"Safety Dan\", and sometimes other characters. Although the animation is usually just a picture of the answering machine, sometimes there are short animated segments featuring the characters. As of April 1, 2016, there are 17 Marzipan's Answering Machines.\nPuppet Stuff.\nThese are live action shorts in which the regular characters are depicted by puppets. These may be skits, or musical performances with They Might Be Giants. Many Puppet Stuff videos feature the characters interacting with children, often related to The Brothers Chaps. One spin-off series, \"Biz Cas Fri\", depicts Homestar and Strong Bad's interactions from his office cubicle at work. The first Biz Cas Fri video arguably first coined the term \"Doge\".\nPowered by The Cheat.\nIn-universe, \"Powered by The Cheat\" videos are short cartoons made by the character of The Cheat, and are often music videos done for other characters. During these segments, Matt Chapman does the animation and Mike Chapman provides the voices, a switching of their usual roles. As a result, the cartoons' animations are deliberately poor.\nAlternate Universes.\nOver time, many alternate versions of the Homestar Runner world and characters appeared, parodying other cartoons and animation styles. Many of these feature in their own cartoons. The many alternate universes crossed over with each other in some cartoons, such as the 150th Strong Bad Email, \"alternate universe\".\nOld-Timey cartoons take place in an old-time setting, with most of the characters being Old-Timey counterparts of the \"Homestar Runner\" characters. These cartoons are in black and white with a film grain effect and scratchy audio quality. They parody the distinctive style of animated cartoons during the 1920s and 1930s (\u00e0 la \"Steamboat Willie\"), and can be seen as perhaps deliberately unfunny, to make a slanted joke about such old-style cartoons.\n\"20X6\" (pronounced \"twenty exty-six\"), a parody of the \"Mega Man\" and \"EarthBound\" games' \"year 200X\", originated from Strong Bad Email No. 57, \"japanese cartoon\", an email asking Strong Bad what he would look like if he were in a Japanese anime. The main character, Stinkoman, is an anime version of Strong Bad with blue hair, a shiny body and robot boots. He is always looking for a fight, asking various characters he interacts with to engage him in a \"challenge\" (\"Are you asking for a challenge?\"). There is also a game, \"Stinkoman 20X6\", which is heavily based on the \"Mega Man\" series.\n\"Cheat Commandos\" is a parody of \"G.I. Joe\" that features a cast of characters that are the same species as The Cheat. Most are based on G.I. Joe characters, or characters from other 1980s cartoons. The cartoon is constantly advertising its products in the cartoons by such methods as referring to the areas they are in as \"playsets\", a convoy truck as an \"action figure storage vehicle\", and by ending each cartoon with the phrase \"Buy all our playsets and toys!\", sung in a patriotic way. It also parodies the G.I. Joe cartoons' use of public service announcements, referring to nonsensical things like \"peer-2-teen choice behaviors\". Some cartoons feature the character Crack Stuntman, the fictional voice actor for the Cheat Commandos character Gunhaver.\nOther media.\nMusic.\nThe Homestar Runner site frequently features songs and videos within their animated shorts or as stand-alone entities. These are primarily sung and performed either by the characters or by fictitious artists serving as parodies of various genres. Real-life musicians They Might Be Giants have collaborated multiple times with the Homestar Runner site. In 2004, the Homestar Runner characters were featured in the music video to their song Experimental Film. Additionally, they have performed multiple times with a puppet of Homestar Runner. They have also collaborated on several other shorts, including Strong Bad Email No. 200, \"email thunder\".\nIn Strong Bad Email No. 58, \"dragon\", Strong Bad is asked to draw a dragon, creating Trogdor, the Burninator (stylized as TROGDOR, the BURN\u0130NATOR), and performing his heavy metal theme song. Trogdor's popularity saw the character appear on merchandise such as T-shirts, hoodies, and posters, with an extended version of the song appearing on the CD \"Strong Bad Sings and Other Type Hits\".\nIn 2002, a fictional hair metal band, Limozeen, was introduced as a parody of 1980s bands such as Skid Row, White Lion and Poison; with songs including \"Because, It's Midnite\" and \"Nite Mamas\". On March 17, 2008, \"Limozeen\" (actually the Atlanta indie band Y-O-U along with Matt Chapman on vocals) performed a live show in Atlanta, Georgia, and again on November 8, 2008, opening for indie pop band of Montreal. A college rock band called Sloshy (with the logo stylized in lower case and rotated 180 degrees, with the \"o\" being a different color, as \"\u028e\u0265so\u05dfs\") was introduced in 2007. Sloshy features songs in the musical vein of Pavement such as \"We Don't Really Even Care About You\" and \"The B-est of B-Sides\". Other fictitious artists include Scandinavian death metal parody Taranchula (although performing more in a thrash metal/sludge metal style); rapper Peacey P, with a rapping style resembling that of Snoop Dogg; and the self-absorbed R&amp;B artist Tenerence Love, a parody of Barry White and such artists.\nBrowser games.\nBeyond cartoons, \"Homestar Runner\" offers a variety of online games. Early games such as the Homestar Soundboard, \"Homestar Talker\", and Lite-Brite emulator \"Astro-Lite 2600\" are basic web toys featuring the characters, and can now be found on the \"Old Games\" section of the site. Over time, more recent games have diversified and become more complex, with many being released as products of \"Videlectrix\", a game company within the world of Homestar Runner and a side project of The Brothers Chaps, spoofing games of the 1980s. Often the games would originate as video games played by the characters in the cartoon, such as \"Secret Collect\", \"StrongBadZone\", and \"Strong Bad's RhinoFeeder\", all parodies of early Atari and arcade games, originating in the Strong Bad Email \"video games\".\n\"TROGDOR!\" which previously appeared in the \"Arcade Game\" short, features the titular dragon Trogdor the Burninator attempting to burn all the cottages on each stage without being slain by knights. A spin-off of \"TROGDOR!\", called \"Peasant's Quest\", is an adventure game featuring Rather Dashing, a young peasant in short pants. After he finds his cottage burned to the ground, he vows to kill the destroyer of his cottage, Trogdor. The game uses a system that is a near-replica of Sierra Entertainment's Adventure Game Interpreter, used in \"King's Quest\", \"Space Quest\" and several other early Sierra titles. This system is something like text adventure games yet it has simple visuals. \"Stinkoman 20X6\" is a Mega Man-style platform game featuring the characters and world of anime parody 20X6. Nine levels were added to the game over the course of 2005, while the tenth and final level was not released until December 2020, days before Flash would no longer be supported by browsers.\nThe \"Thy Dungeonman\" series are parodies of text adventure games originating from Strong Bad Email No. 94, \"video games\". In each game, your goal is to \"get ye flask\". Though the game purports to be set in the medieval era, the text is actually rendered in mock Early Modern English, in the style of William Shakespeare. \"Thy Dungeonman\" has two sequels: \"Thy Dungeonman II\", which expands on the features of the original game and can only be found on the Videlectrix site, and \"Thy Dungeonman III\" which adds basic graphics and can be found on the Homestar Runner site. \"Ye Flask\" and \"You can't get ye flask\" have become catch-phrases in the Homestar Runner universe, eventually spawning a T-shirt in the Homestar Runner store.\nIn 2007 the website produced Wii versions of some of the games on the site, for the Wii internet browser. When played on a computer, they use the mouse only.\nTwo point-and-click adventure game titles by the Brothers Chaps made in Unity have been released to Steam and Itch.io, \"Halloween Hide &amp; Seek\" and \"Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate\", an expanded remake of the original \"Dangeresque: Roomisode 1\" web game that adds two new episodes.\nStrong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People.\nOn April 10, 2008, an episodic licensed game based on the series centering around Strong Bad titled \"Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People\" (abbreviated as \"SBCG4AP\") was announced for the Wii's WiiWare service and Microsoft Windows, developed by Telltale Games in partnership with Videlectrix. The first episode, \"Homestar Ruiner\", premiered on August 11, 2008, on Telltale Games' website and in North America on Nintendo's WiiWare service on August 11, 2008. It was also released in Europe and Australia the following Friday (August 15, 2008). The second episode, \"Strong Badia the Free\", was released on September 15 on the WiiWare service in North America and on the Telltale Games' website, and in the PAL region on October 3. The third episode, \"Baddest of the Bands\", was released on Telltale Games' website and the WiiWare service in North America on October 27, and to the PAL region on November 21. The fourth episode, \"Dangeresque 3: The Criminal Projective\", was released on Telltale Games' website and WiiWare in North America on November 17, and in the PAL region on December 5. The fifth and final episode, \"8-Bit is Enough\", was released to North America on December 15 and in the PAL region on January 2, 2009. In 2010, it was decided that Telltale games would release \"SBCG4AP\" for the Mac operating system after a vote on the Telltale Games website.\nPoker Night at the Inventory.\nStrong Bad appears as one of the computer-controlled opponents in Telltale's \"Poker Night at the Inventory\", using the same model from SBCG4AP. Players can unlock in-game card sets and table designs based on Homestar Runner. Additionally, Strong Bad will occasionally bet Dangeresque Too's sunglasses in place of in-game cash; defeating him after doing so will unlock the glasses as an equippable cosmetic item for the Demoman in \"Team Fortress 2\". The game was released for PC and Mac on November 22, 2010.\nTrogdor!! The Board Game.\n\"Trogdor!! The Board Game\" is a board game made by The Brothers Chaps in collaboration with James Ernest. The campaign was put on Kickstarter on Tuesday, July 17, 2018, with a goal of $75,000, which was surpassed in the first few hours. The campaign ended on Wednesday, August 15, 2018, with a total of $1,421,903 (nearly 20 times the goal) and 23,338 backers. In 2022, an expansion pack titled \"Majicks &amp; 'Mergencies Expando Deck\" was released, adding new cards and gameplay elements. Extra copies are sold in the website's store.\nTrogdor!! is described as a cooperative puzzle area control game in which the players work together to burninate all of the game tiles, thatched-roof cottages, and peasants. Every player controls Trogdor, assuming the role of one of the twelve \"Keepers of Trogdor\". Each Keeper has unique powers and items, both decided by cards. The game is for one to six players, and play time is 30 minutes with variable levels of difficulty the players can set. The recommended age is 14+. It comes with a mini-game titled \"Stack 'Em To The Heavens\" in which you stack the meeples in different ways. An album titled \"Trogdor!! The Board Game Rulebook EP\", was made to explain the rules of the game.\nUnofficial email worm.\nAn email worm named Lacon, which featured Homestar Runner characters, was created and distributed by someone going by the name of DimenZion in 2003. It affected 32-bit Windows computers on the 10th of each month, emailing copies of itself to contacts in the computer's address book, and also adding various .exe files to the hard drive. Its final payload showed a Homestar Runner Flash animation called \"The System is Down\" in a browser window.\nImpact.\nCollaborations with other artists.\nThe Brothers Chaps have partnered up with rock band They Might Be Giants and supplied animation for a music video of their song \"Experimental Film\". The creators of \"Homestar Runner\" spent time with the band and wrote songs that have been released on the website as \"Puppet Jam\", a spin-off of \"Puppet Stuff\", where Puppet Homestar sings with TMBG. TMBG also wrote the music for Strong Bad Email No. 99, \"different town\", and the band wrote and vocalized the intro song of the 200th Strong Bad Email. Another group, The Skate Party, helped The Brothers Chaps create \"The Cheat Theme Song\". The band Y-O-U helped with the Strong Bad Sings and Other Type Hits CD, as well as songs on the strongbad_email.exe DVDs. The Brothers Chaps also employed the services of Paul and Storm of the a cappella band Da Vinci's Notebook to create a theme song for the Old-Timey version of The Cheat, called \"Ballad of The Sneak\"; the duo later wrote the theme tune for the \"Stinkoman 20X6\" game. Matt Chapman provided guest vocals as Strong Bad on The Aquabats' \"Pink Pants!\" from their 2011 album, \"Hi-Five Soup!\". Strong Bad's voice also appears on Shellac's \"Genuine Lulabelle\" off the album \"Excellent Italian Greyhound\" from 2007.\nDiscussing how he and his sibling decide which projects to work on, Mike Chapman said, \"We learned how to politely say no to things that were going to affect our lives negatively. If it's going to be fun, if we're going to enjoy doing it, and if the end project is going to be something we want to have happen, we say yes.\"\nReception.\nIn 2003, the site received several million hits a month and almost a thousand emails a day. According to Matt Chapman, the site did no advertising, but grew on word of mouth and endorsements. \"Certain bands, like fairly popular bands and stuff would link us on their site and, you know we were Shockwave site of the day a couple of times over the years.\" \"Homestar Runner\"'s popularity, coupled with its positive critical response, has led to the website receiving widespread coverage. \"Homestar Runner\" has been featured in \"Wired\", \"National Review\", \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Total Gamer\", G4, and NPR's \"All Things Considered\".\nA review published in \"National Review\" characterized the site's humor as having \"the innocence of slapstick with sharp satire of American popular culture\" \u2014 humor that \"tends to be cultural, not political.\"\nThe site-generated music has enjoyed surprising popularity, such that two songs, \"Trogdor\" by the character Strong Bad and \"Because, It's Midnite\" by Limozeen, have been included in the successful \"Guitar Hero II\" and \"\" video games, respectively.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57688", "revid": "41414086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57688", "title": "Anxiety disorder", "text": "Cognitive disorder with an excessive, irrational dread of everyday situations\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nAnxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant and uncontrollable feelings of anxiety and fear such that a person's social, occupational, and personal functions are significantly impaired. Anxiety may cause physical and cognitive symptoms, such as a sense of impending doom, restlessness, irritability, easy fatigue, difficulty concentrating, increased heart rate, chest pain, abdominal pain, and a variety of other symptoms that vary based on the individual.\nIn casual discourse, the words \"anxiety\" and \"fear\" are often used interchangeably. In clinical usage, they have distinct meanings; anxiety is clinically defined as an unpleasant emotional state for which the cause is either not readily identified or perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable, whereas fear is clinically defined as an emotional and physiological response to a recognized external threat. The umbrella term 'anxiety disorder' refers to a number of specific disorders that include fears (phobias) and/or anxiety symptoms.\nThere are several types of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, hypochondriasis, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. Individual disorders can be diagnosed using the specific and unique symptoms, triggering events, and timing. A medical professional must evaluate a person before diagnosing them with an anxiety disorder to ensure that their anxiety cannot be attributed to another medical illness or mental disorder. It is possible for an individual to have more than one anxiety disorder during their life or to have more than one anxiety disorder at the same time. Comorbid mental disorders or substance use disorders are common in those with anxiety. Comorbid depression (lifetime prevalence) is seen in 20\u201370% of those with social anxiety disorder, 50% of those with panic disorder and 43% of those with general anxiety disorder. The 12 month prevalence of alcohol or substance use disorders in those with anxiety disorders is 16.5%.\nWorldwide, anxiety disorders are the second most common type of mental disorders after depressive disorders. Anxiety disorders affect nearly 30% of adults at some point in their lives, with an estimated 4% of the global population currently experiencing an anxiety disorder. However, anxiety disorders are treatable, and a number of effective treatments are available. Most people are able to lead normal, productive lives with some form of treatment.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTypes.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common disorder characterized by long-lasting anxiety that is not focused on any one object or situation. Those with generalized anxiety disorder experience non-specific persistent fear and worry and become overly concerned with everyday matters. Generalized anxiety disorder is \"characterized by chronic excessive worry accompanied by three or more of the following symptoms: restlessness, fatigue, concentration problems, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance\". Generalized anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder to affect older adults. Anxiety can be a symptom of a medical or substance use disorder problem, and medical professionals must be aware of this. A diagnosis of GAD is made when a person has been excessively worried about an everyday problem for six months or more. These stresses can include family life, work, social life, or their own health. A person may find that they have problems making daily decisions and remembering commitments as a result of a lack of concentration and/or preoccupation with worry. A symptom can be a strained appearance, with increased sweating from the hands, feet, and axillae, along with tearfulness, which can suggest depression. Before a diagnosis of anxiety disorder is made, physicians must rule out drug-induced anxiety and other medical causes.\nIn children, GAD may be associated with headaches, restlessness, abdominal pain, and heart palpitations. Typically, it begins around eight to nine years of age.\nSpecific phobias.\nThe largest category of anxiety disorders is that of specific phobias, which includes all cases in which fear and anxiety are triggered by a specific stimulus or situation. Between 5% and 12% of the population worldwide has specific phobias. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, a phobia is an intense fear of or aversion to specific objects or situations. Individuals with a phobia typically anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering the object of their fear, which can be anything from an animal to a location to a bodily fluid to a particular situation. Common phobias are flying, blood, water, highway driving, and tunnels. When people are exposed to their phobia, they may experience trembling, shortness of breath, or rapid heartbeat. People with specific phobias often go to extreme lengths to avoid encountering their phobia. People with specific phobias understand that their fear is not proportional to the actual potential danger, but they can still become overwhelmed by it.\nPanic disorder.\nWith panic disorder, a person has brief attacks of intense terror and apprehension, often marked by trembling, shaking, confusion, dizziness, or difficulty breathing. These panic attacks are defined by the APA as fear or discomfort that abruptly arises and peaks in less than ten minutes but can last for several hours. Attacks can be triggered by stress, irrational thoughts, general fear, fear of the unknown, or even when engaging in exercise. However, sometimes the trigger is unclear, and attacks can arise without warning. To help prevent an attack, one can avoid the trigger. This can mean avoiding places, people, types of behaviors, or certain situations that have been known to cause a panic attack. This being said, not all attacks can be prevented.\nIn addition to recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, a diagnosis of panic disorder requires that said attacks have chronic consequences: either worry over the attacks' potential implications, persistent fear of future attacks, or significant changes in behavior related to the attacks. As such, those with panic disorder experience symptoms even outside of specific panic episodes. Often, normal changes in heartbeat are noticed, leading them to think something is wrong with their heart or they are about to have another panic attack. In some cases, a heightened awareness (hypervigilance) of body functioning occurs during panic attacks, wherein any perceived physiological change is interpreted as a possible life-threatening illness (i.e., extreme hypochondriasis).\nPanic disorder is commonly comorbid with anxiety due to the consistent fight or flight response that one's brain is being put under at such a high repetitive rate. Another one of the very big leading causes of someone developing a panic disorder has a lot to do with one's childhood. The article? provides knowledge on a positive trend in children who experience abuse and have low self-esteem to later on develop disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder.\nAgoraphobia.\nAgoraphobia is a specific anxiety disorder wherein an individual is afraid of being in a place or situation where escape is difficult or embarrassing or where help may be unavailable. Agoraphobia is strongly linked with panic disorder and is often precipitated by the fear of having a panic attack. A common manifestation involves needing to be in constant view of a door or other escape route. In addition to the fears themselves, the term agoraphobia is often used to refer to avoidance behaviors that individuals often develop. For example, following a panic attack while driving, someone with agoraphobia may develop anxiety over driving and will therefore avoid driving. These avoidance behaviors can have serious consequences and often reinforce the fear they are caused by. In a severe case of agoraphobia, the person may never leave their home.\nSocial anxiety disorder.\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, describes an intense fear and avoidance of negative public scrutiny, public embarrassment, humiliation, or social interaction. This fear can be specific to particular social situations (such as public speaking) or it can be experienced in most or all social situations. Roughly 7% of American adults have social anxiety disorder, and more than 75% of people experience their first symptoms in their childhood or early teenage years. Social anxiety often manifests specific physical symptoms, including blushing, sweating, rapid heart rate, and difficulty speaking. As with all phobic disorders, those with social anxiety often attempt to avoid the source of their anxiety; in the case of social anxiety, this is particularly problematic, and in severe cases, it can lead to complete social isolation.\nChildren are also affected by social anxiety disorder, although their associated symptoms are different from those of teenagers and adults. They may experience difficulty processing or retrieving information, sleep deprivation, disruptive behaviors in class, and irregular class participation.\nSocial physique anxiety (SPA) is a sub-type of social anxiety involving concern over the evaluation of one's body by others. SPA is common among adolescents, especially females.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was once an anxiety disorder (now moved to \"trauma- and stressor-related disorders\" in the DSM-5) that results from a traumatic experience. PTSD affects approximately 3.5% of U.S. adults every year, and an estimated one in eleven people will be diagnosed with PTSD in their lifetime. Post-traumatic stress can result from an extreme situation, such as combat, natural disaster, rape, hostage situations, child abuse, bullying, or even a serious accident. It can also result from long-term (chronic) exposure to a severe stressor\u2014 for example, soldiers who endure individual battles but cannot cope with continuous combat. Common symptoms include hypervigilance, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, anxiety, anger, and depression. In addition, individuals may experience sleep disturbances. People who have PTSD often try to detach themselves from their friends and family and have difficulty maintaining these close relationships. There are a number of treatments that form the basis of the care plan for those with PTSD; such treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), prolonged exposure therapy, stress inoculation therapy, medication, psychotherapy, and support from family and friends.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder research began with US military veterans of the Vietnam War, as well as natural and non-natural disaster victims. Studies have found the degree of exposure to a disaster to be the best predictor of PTSD.\nSeparation anxiety disorder.\nSeparation anxiety disorder (SepAD) is the feeling of excessive and inappropriate levels of anxiety over being separated from a person or place. Separation anxiety is a normal part of development in babies or children, and it is only when this feeling is excessive or inappropriate that it can be considered a disorder. Separation anxiety disorder affects roughly 7% of adults and 4% of children, but childhood cases tend to be more severe; in some instances, even a brief separation can produce panic. Treating a child earlier may prevent problems. This may include training the parents and family on how to deal with it. Often, the parents will reinforce the anxiety because they do not know how to properly work through it with the child. In addition to parent training and family therapy, medication, such as SSRIs, can be used to treat separation anxiety.\nObsessive\u2013compulsive disorder.\nObsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD) is not an anxiety disorder in the DSM-5 or the ICD-11. However, it was classified as such in older versions of the DSM-IV and ICD-10. OCD manifests in the form of obsessions (distressing, persistent, and intrusive thoughts or images) and compulsions (urges to repeatedly perform specific acts or rituals) that are not caused by drugs or physical disorders and which cause anxiety or distress plus (more or less important) functional disabilities. OCD affects roughly 1\u20132% of adults (somewhat more women than men) and under 3% of children and adolescents.\nA person with OCD knows that the symptoms are unreasonable and struggles against both the thoughts and the behavior. Their symptoms could be related to external events they fear, such as their home burning down because they forgot to turn off the stove, or they could worry that they will behave inappropriately. The compulsive rituals are personal rules they follow to relieve discomfort, such as needing to verify that the stove is turned off a specific number of times before leaving the house.\nIt is not certain why some people have OCD, but behavioral, cognitive, genetic, and neurobiological factors may be involved. Risk factors include family history, being single, being of a higher socioeconomic class, or not being in paid employment. Of those with OCD, about 20% of people will overcome it, and symptoms will at least reduce over time for most people (a further 50%).\nSelective mutism.\nSelective mutism (SM) is a disorder in which a person who is normally capable of speech does not speak in specific situations or to specific people. Selective mutism usually co-exists with shyness or social anxiety. People with selective mutism stay silent even when the consequences of their silence include shame, social ostracism, or even punishment. Selective mutism affects about 0.8% of people at some point in their lives.\nTesting for selective mutism is important because doctors must determine if it is an issue associated with the child's hearing or movements associated with the jaw or tongue and if the child can understand when others are speaking to them. Generally, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the recommended approach for treating selective mutism, but prospective long-term outcome studies are lacking.\nDiagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of anxiety disorders is made by symptoms, triggers, and a person's personal and family histories. There are no objective biomarkers or laboratory tests that can diagnose anxiety. It is important for a medical professional to evaluate a person for other medical and mental causes of prolonged anxiety because treatments will vary considerably.\nNumerous questionnaires have been developed for clinical use and can be used for an objective scoring system. Symptoms may vary between each sub-type of generalized anxiety disorder. Generally, symptoms must be present for at least six months, occur more days than not, and significantly impair a person's ability to function in daily life. Symptoms may include: feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge; worrying excessively; difficulty concentrating; restlessness; and irritability.\nQuestionnaires developed for clinical use include the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. Other questionnaires combine anxiety and depression measurements, such as the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Examples of specific anxiety questionnaires include the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and the Social Anxiety Questionnaire (SAQ-A30).\nThe GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 57-94% and a specificity of 82-88% in the diagnosis of general anxiety disorder. All screening questionnaires, if positive, should be followed by clinical interview including assessment of impairment and distress, avoidance behaviors, symptom history and persistence to definitively diagnose an anxiety disorder. Some organizations support routinely screening all adults for anxiety disorders, with the US Preventative Services Task Force recommending screening for all adults younger than 65.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nAnxiety disorders differ from developmentally normal fear or anxiety by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods. They differ from transient fear or anxiety, often stress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically lasting 6 months or more), although the criterion for duration is intended as a general guide with allowance for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of shorter duration in children.\nThe diagnosis of an anxiety disorder requires first ruling out an underlying medical cause. Diseases that may present similar to an anxiety disorder include certain endocrine diseases (hypo- and hyperthyroidism, hyperprolactinemia), metabolic disorders (diabetes), deficiency states (low levels of vitamin D, B2, B12, folic acid), gastrointestinal diseases (celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease), heart diseases, blood diseases (anemia), and brain degenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease). Anxiety and panic disorders as well as other neuropsychiatric disorders can be a symptom of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).\nSeveral drugs can also cause or worsen anxiety, whether through intoxication, withdrawal, or chronic use. These include alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, sedatives (including prescription benzodiazepines), opioids (including prescription painkillers and illicit drugs like heroin), stimulants (such as caffeine, cocaine, and amphetamines), hallucinogens, and inhalants.\nCauses.\nEvolutionary Perspectives.\nEvolutionary psychiatry interprets anxiety as part of an evolved defensive system calibrated to potential threat. According to the \u201csmoke-alarm principle,\u201d anxiety mechanisms are expected to err on the side of false alarms because the cost of unnecessary fear is typically lower than the cost of failing to detect genuine danger. This framework has been extended to modern settings, where mismatch between ancestral and contemporary threat profiles may contribute to chronic or generalised anxiety.\nPrevention.\nFocus is increasing on the prevention of anxiety disorders. There is tentative evidence to support the use of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness therapy. A 2013 review found no effective measures to prevent GAD in adults. A 2017 review found that psychological and educational interventions had a small benefit for the prevention of anxiety. Research indicates that predictors of the emergence of anxiety disorders partly differ from the factors that predict their persistence.\nA big factor that goes into anxiety disorder prevention starts in childhood. Based on the cited article, parents have a big part in whether or not their child will develop anxiety in their future. Specific interventions have been tested to educate parents with young children on how to care and prevent a disorder like anxiety from becoming a bigger issue in their child's teen to adult life. The study also shared that since it is such a new intervention that there is not much information on long term results, however it does seem to be looking in a positive direction.\nPerception and discrimination.\nStigma.\nPeople with an anxiety disorder may be challenged by prejudices and stereotypes held by other people, most likely as a result of misconceptions around anxiety and anxiety disorders. Misconceptions found in a data analysis from the National Survey of Mental Health Literacy and Stigma include: (1) many people believe anxiety is not a real medical illness; and (2) many people believe that people with anxiety could turn it off if they wanted to. For people experiencing the physical and mental symptoms of an anxiety disorder, stigma and negative social perception can make an individual less likely to seek treatment.\nPrejudice that some people with mental illness turn against themselves is called self-stigma.\nThere is no explicit evidence for the exact cause of stigma towards anxiety. Stigma can be divided by social scale, into the macro, intermediate, and micro levels. The macro-level marks society as a whole with the influence of mass media. The intermediate level includes healthcare professionals and their perspectives. The micro-level details the individual's contributions to the process through self-stigmatization.\nIt has become very prevalent that many college students undergo some sort of mental disorder in their early adulthood. Anxiety has become one of the main ones that has grown in prevalence over time. This is due to many issues such as different social pressures, school, career worries, etc. This has not only affected a lot of the youth in today's world but their overall quality of life. However, it is important to bring this issue to light since there is such a negative stigma when it comes to mental health; but rather than ignoring it and letting the issue grow exponentially larger, it is important to recognize ways that it can be lessened for future generations.\nStigma can be described in three conceptual ways: cognitive, emotional, and behavioral. This allows for differentiation between stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination.\nTreatment.\nTreatment options include psychotherapy, medications and lifestyle changes. There is no clear evidence as to whether psychotherapy or medication is more effective; the specific medication decision can be made by a doctor and patient with consideration for the patient's specific circumstances and symptoms. If, while on treatment with a chosen medication, the person's anxiety does not improve, another medication may be offered. Specific treatments will vary by sub-type of anxiety disorder, a person's other medical conditions, and medications.\nPsychological techniques.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for anxiety disorders and is a first-line treatment. CBT is the most widely studied and preferred form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. CBT appears to be equally effective when carried out via the internet compared to sessions completed face-to-face. There are specific CBT curriculums or strategies for the specific type of anxiety disorder. CBT has similar effectiveness to pharmacotherapy and in a meta analysis, CBT was associated with medium to large benefit effect sizes for GAD, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. CBT has low dropout rates and its positive effects have been shown to be maintained at least for 12 months. CBT is sometimes given as once weekly sessions for 8\u201320 weeks, but regimens vary widely. Booster sessions may need to be restarted for patients who have a relapse of symptoms.\nExposure and response prevention (ERP) has been found effective for treating OCD.\nMindfulness-based programs also appear to be effective for managing anxiety disorders. It is unclear if meditation has an effect on anxiety, and transcendental meditation appears to be no different from other types of meditation.\nA 2015 Cochrane review of Morita therapy for anxiety disorder in adults found insufficient evidence of an effect.\nMedications.\nFirst-line choices for medications include SSRIs or SNRIs to treat generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder or panic disorder. For adults, there is no good evidence supporting which specific medication in the SSRI or SNRI class is best for treating anxiety, so cost often drives drug choice. Fluvoxamine is effective in treating a range of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine can also help with some forms of anxiety in children and adolescents. If the chosen medicine is effective, it is recommended that it be continued for at least a year to mitigate the risk of a relapse.\nBenzodiazepines are a second line option for the pharmacologic treatment of anxiety. Benzodiazepines are associated with moderate to high effect sizes with regard to symptom relief and they have an onset usually within 1 week. Clonazepam has a longer half life and may possibly be used as once per day dosing. Benzodiazepines may also be used with SNRIs or SSRIs to initially reduce anxiety symptoms, and they may potentially be continued long term. Benzodiazepines are not a first line pharmacologic treatment of anxiety disorders and they carry risks of physical dependence, psychological dependence, overdose death (especially when combined with opioids), misuse, cognitive impairment, falls and motor vehicle crashes.\nBuspirone and pregabalin are second-line treatments for people who do not respond to SSRIs or SNRIs. Pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in treating some anxiety disorders, but there is concern regarding their off-label use due to the lack of strong scientific evidence for their efficacy in multiple conditions and their proven side effects.\nMedications need to be used with care among older adults, who are more likely to have side effects because of coexisting physical disorders. Adherence problems are more likely among older people, who may have difficulty understanding, seeing, or remembering instructions.\nIn general, medications are not seen as helpful for specific phobias, but benzodiazepines are sometimes used to help resolve acute episodes. In 2007, data were sparse for the efficacy of any drug.\nLifestyle and diet.\nLifestyle changes include exercise, for which there is moderate evidence for some improvement, regularizing sleep patterns, reducing caffeine intake, and stopping smoking. Stopping smoking has benefits for anxiety as great as or greater than those of medications. A meta-analysis found 2000\u00a0mg/day or more of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as fish oil, tended to reduce anxiety in placebo-controlled and uncontrolled studies, particularly in people with more significant symptoms.\nCannabis.\nAs of 2019[ [update]], there is little evidence for the use of cannabis in treating anxiety disorders.\nTreatments for children.\nBoth therapy and a number of medications have been found to be useful for treating childhood anxiety disorders. Therapy is generally preferred to medication.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a good first-line therapy approach. Studies have gathered substantial evidence for treatments that are not CBT-based as effective forms of treatment, expanding treatment options for those who do not respond to CBT. Although studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, evidence that it is more effective than treatment as usual, medication, or wait list controls is inconclusive. Like adults, children may undergo psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or counseling. Family therapy is a form of treatment in which the child meets with a therapist together with the primary guardians and siblings. Each family member may attend individual therapy, but family therapy is typically a form of group therapy. Art and play therapy are also used. Art therapy is most commonly used when the child will not or cannot verbally communicate due to trauma or a disability in which they are nonverbal. Participating in art activities allows the child to express what they otherwise may not be able to communicate to others. In play therapy, the child is allowed to play however they please as a therapist observes them. The therapist may intercede from time to time with a question, comment, or suggestion. This is often most effective when the family of the child plays a role in the treatment.\nEpidemiology.\nGlobally, as of 2010, approximately 273\u00a0million (4.5% of the population) had an anxiety disorder. It is more common in females (5.2%) than males (2.8%).\nIn Europe, Africa, and Asia, lifetime rates of anxiety disorders are between 9 and 16%, and yearly rates are between 4 and 7%. In the United States, the lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders is about 29%, and between 11 and 18% of adults have the condition in a given year. This difference is affected by the range of ways in which different cultures interpret anxiety symptoms and what they consider to be normative behavior. In general, anxiety disorders represent the most prevalent psychiatric condition in the United States, outside of substance use disorder.\nLike adults, children can experience anxiety disorders; between 10 and 20 percent of all children will develop a full-fledged anxiety disorder prior to the age of 18, making anxiety the most common mental health issue in young people. Anxiety disorders in children are often more challenging to identify than their adult counterparts, owing to the difficulty many parents face in discerning them from normal childhood fears. Likewise, anxiety in children is sometimes misdiagnosed as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or, due to the tendency of children to interpret their emotions physically (as stomachaches, headaches, etc.), anxiety disorders may initially be confused with physical ailments.\nAnxiety in children has a variety of causes; sometimes anxiety is rooted in biology and may be a product of another existing condition, such as autism spectrum disorder. Gifted children are also often more prone to excessive anxiety than non-gifted children. Other cases of anxiety arise from the child having experienced a traumatic event of some kind, and in some cases, the cause of the child's anxiety cannot be pinpointed.\nAnxiety in children tends to manifest along age-appropriate themes, such as fear of going to school (not related to bullying) or not performing well enough at school, fear of social rejection, fear of something happening to loved ones, etc. What separates disordered anxiety from normal childhood anxiety is the duration and intensity of the fears involved.\nAccording to a 2011 study, people who rank highly in hypercompetitive traits are at increased risk of both anxiety and depression.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Exposure therapy\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57689", "revid": "50403584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57689", "title": "Fixed-odds betting", "text": "Form of gambling\nFixed-odds betting is a form of gambling where individuals place bets on the outcome of an event, such as sports matches or horse races, at predetermined odds. In fixed-odds betting, the odds are fixed and determined at the time of placing the bet. These odds reflect the likelihood of a particular outcome occurring. If the bettor's prediction is correct, they receive a payout based on the fixed odds. This means that the potential winnings are known at the time of placing the bet, regardless of any changes in the odds leading up to the event.\nFixed-odds gambling involves placing bets on events with predetermined odds. Bookmakers aim to create an overground, where the sum of probabilities quoted for all possible outcomes exceeds 100%, ensuring profit. Imbalanced books can occur, leading to higher or lower payouts than expected. The advent of the internet and betting exchanges has led to opportunities for fixed-odds arbitrage actions and Dutch books.\nWhen a bet has a positive expected value, it is said to be getting \"the best of it.\" In contrast, \"laying odds\" refers to a bet in which more is risked than can be won, and rational bettors only engage in this type of bet if the chances of an adverse outcome are low enough. \"Lay betting\" is when a bettor bets against a specific outcome, effectively taking on the role of a bookmaker.\nOdds can be expressed in various formats, including fractional, decimal, and moneyline. Fractional odds are used primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland, while decimal odds are favored in Continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Moneyline odds are used in the United States. Converting between these formats requires specific calculations depending on the type of odds used.\nCalculating fixed odds.\nIt is customary with fixed-odds gambling to know the odds at the time of the placement of the wager (the \"live price\"), but the category also includes wagers whose price is determined only when the race or game starts (the \"starting prices\"). It is ideal for bookmakers to price/mark up a book such that the net outcome will always be in their favour: the sum of the probabilities quoted for all possible outcomes will be in excess of 100%. The excess over 100% (or overround) represents profit to the bookmaker in the event of a balanced/even book. In the more usual case of an imbalanced book, the bookmaker may have to pay out more winnings than what is staked or may earn more than mathematically expected. An imbalanced book may arise since there is no way for a bookmaker to know the true probabilities for the outcome of competitions left to human effort or to predict the bets that will be attracted from others by fixed odds compiled on the basis personal view and knowledge.\nWith the advent of Internet and bet exchange betting, the possibility of fixed-odds arbitrage actions and Dutch books against bookmakers and exchanges has expanded significantly. Betting exchanges in particular act like a stock exchange, allowing the odds to be set in the course of trading between individual bettors, usually leading to quoted odds that are reasonably close to the \"true odds\".\n\"The best of it\".\nIn making a bet where the expected value is positive, one is said to be getting \"the best of it\". For example, if one were to bet $1 at 10 to 1 odds (one could win $10) on the outcome of a coin flip, one would be getting \"the best of it\" and should always make the bet (assuming a rational and risk-neutral attitude with linear utility curves and have no preferences implying loss aversion or the like). However, if someone offered odds of 10 to 1 that a card chosen at random from a regular 52 card deck would be the ace of spades, one would be getting \"the worst of it\" because the chance is only 1 in 52 that the ace will be chosen.\nIn an entry for \"L'Encyclop\u00e9die\" (the Enlightenment-era \"French Encyclopedia\"), Denis Diderot cites a similar example in which two players, Player A and Player B, wager over a game of dice that involves rolling two six-sided dice. Player A wins if the dice add up to 12, of which there is only one possible case. Player B wins if the dice fall in any other combination, of which there are 35 possibilities. It is mathematically disadvantageous to make a bet if one gets \"the worst of it\". Accordingly, for the bet to be \"fair\", the amount each player could potentially lose or gain from the wager should be adjusted, depending on the odds of their success.\nLaying odds.\nWhen making a bet in which one must put more at risk than one can win, one is \"\". Rational bettors will do so only if the actual chances of an adverse outcome are low enough that the expected outcome even after deduction of taxes and any transaction costs is favorable to the person placing the bet. For example, if one bets $1,000 that it will rain tomorrow and can win only $200 but can lose the entire $1,000, one is laying odds that will rain tomorrow. Laying odds is reflected in the expression \"[I would] \" \u2013 with which the speaker is expressing a willingness to risk losing something of value in exchange for something worthless, because winning that bet is a certainty.\nLay betting.\n\"Lay betting\" is a bet that something will \"not happen\", so \"laying $50 on a horse\" is betting the horse will \"not\" win. Bookmakers sell bets based on the odds of a specific outcome, but lay betting allows the bettor (in some English-speaking countries, the \"punter\") to reverse roles with the bookmaker, using odds to sell the opposite outcome to the bookmaker. In this context, \"lay\" is used in the sense of \"layman\", i.e., a bet sold by someone who does not sell bets professionally. \nTypes of odds offered.\nThere are three widely used means of quoting odds:\nFractional odds.\nMost common in the United Kingdom and Ireland and common worldwide in horse racing, fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the winning bettor relative to the stake. The term \"fractional odds\" is something of a misnomer, especially when visually reinforced by using a slash (as opposed to, \"e.g.\", a colon or the word \"to\" or \"on\") to separate a potential gain from the amount that a bettor must wager in order to receive it upon a win, because the \"fraction\" in question represents not the odds of winning or even the reciprocal of the odds of winning but rather the fraction (for any odds longer than \"even money\" or chances of winning less than 50%, an improper fraction) of the amount at stake that the upside outcome represents. This fraction may be derived by subtracting 1 from the reciprocal of the chances of winning; for any odds longer than \"even money,\" this fraction will be an improper one. Odds of 4:1 (\"four-to-one\" or less commonly \"four-to-one \"against\"\") would imply that the bettor stands to make a \u00a3400 profit on a \u00a3100 stake. If the odds are 1:4 (read \"one-to-four\", or alternatively \"four-to-one \"on\"\" or \"four-to-one \"in favor\"\"), the bettor stands to make \u00a325 on a \u00a3100 stake. In either case, \"against\" or \"on\", should he win, the bettor always receives his original stake back, so if the odds are 4:1 the bettor receives a total of \u00a3500 (\u00a3400 plus the original \u00a3100). Odds of 1/1 are known as \"evens\" or \"even money\".\nNot all fractional odds are traditionally read using the lowest common denominator. Perhaps most unusual is that odds of 10:3 are read as \"one-hundred-to-thirty\".\nFractional odds are also known as \"British odds\", \"UK odds\", or, in that country, \"traditional odds\".\nDecimal odds.\nMost common in Continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, decimal odds differ from fractional odds by taking into account that the bettor must first part with their stake to make a bet; the figure quoted, therefore, is the winning amount that would be paid out to the bettor. Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to one plus the decimal value of the fractional odds; in the absence of built-in house advantage to cover overhead, profit margins, or (for an illegal enterprise) compensation for the fact that both chances of prosecution and penalties in the event of conviction tend to be higher for bookmakers than for clients, the decimal odds associated with a given outcome would be the decimal expression of the reciprocal of what the offering party assesses to be the outcome's chance of occurring. Thus, even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2. The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25. It is considered to be ideal for parlay betting because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on.\nDecimal odds are also known as \"European odds\", \"digital odds\" or \"continental odds\" and tend to be used by betting exchanges because they are the easiest to work with for trading, in this case the purchase and sale of upside and downside risk.\nMoneyline odds.\nMoneyline odds are most commonly used by United States bookmakers and so are also called \"American odds\". There are two possibilities: the figure quote can be either positive or negative. Moneyline refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a point spread.\nIf the figure quoted is positive, the odds are quoting how much money will be won on a $100 wager (done if the odds are better than even). Fractional odds of 4/1 would be quoted as +400, while fractional odds of 1/4 cannot be quoted as a positive figure.\nIf the figure quoted is negative, the moneyline odds are quoting how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done if the odds are worse than even). Fractional odds of 1/4 would be quoted as \u2212400 while fractional odds of 4/1 cannot be quoted as a negative figure.\nEven odds are quoted as +100 or \u2212100. Some but not all bookmakers display the positive symbol.\nOdds conversion.\nTo convert fractional odds to decimal, take the fractional number, convert it to decimal by doing the division, and then add 1. For example, the 4-to-1 fractional odds shown above is the same as 5 in decimal odds, while 1-to-4 would be quoted as 1.25.\nThe method for converting moneyline to decimal odds depends on whether the moneyline value is positive or negative. If the moneyline is positive, it is divided by 100 and add 1. Thus, +400 moneyline is the same as 5.0 in decimal odds. If the moneyline is negative, 100 is divided by the absolute moneyline amount (the minus signed is removed), and then 1 is added. For example, \u2212400 moneyline is 100/400\u00a0+\u00a01, or 1.25, in decimal odds.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57690", "revid": "7852030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57690", "title": "Montgomery, Alabama", "text": "Capital city of Alabama, United States\nMontgomery is the capital city of the U.S. state of Alabama and the seat of Montgomery County. It was named for Continental Army Major-General Richard Montgomery and stands beside the Alabama River on the Gulf Coastal Plain.\nThe population was 200,603 at the 2020 census. It is the third-most populous city in the state, after Huntsville and Birmingham, and the 133rd-most populous in the United States. The Montgomery metropolitan area's population in 2022 was 385,460; it is the fourth-largest in the state and 142nd among U.S. metropolitan areas.\nThe city was incorporated in 1819 as a merger of two towns situated along the Alabama River. It replaced Tuscaloosa as the state capital in 1846, representing the shift of power to the south-central area of Alabama with the growth of cotton as a commodity crop of the Black Belt and the rise of Mobile as a mercantile port on the Gulf Coast. In February 1861, Montgomery was chosen the first capital of the Confederate States of America, which it remained until the Confederate seat of government moved to Richmond, Virginia, in May of that year. In the middle of the 20th century, Montgomery was a major center of events and protests in the Civil Rights Movement, including the Montgomery bus boycott and the Selma to Montgomery marches.\nIn addition to housing many Alabama government agencies, Montgomery has a large military presence, due to Maxwell Air Force Base. It has three public universities (Alabama State University, Troy University (Montgomery campus), and Auburn University at Montgomery), two private post-secondary institutions (Faulkner University and Huntingdon College), high-tech manufacturing (particularly Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama), and many cultural attractions, such as the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice.\nMontgomery has also been recognized nationally for its downtown revitalization and new urbanism projects. It was one of the first cities in the nation to implement SmartCode Zoning.\nHistory.\nPrior to European colonization, the east bank of the Alabama River was inhabited by the Alibamu tribe of Native Americans. The Alibamu and the Coushatta, who lived on the west side of the river, were descended from the Mississippian culture. This civilization had numerous chiefdoms throughout the Midwest and South along the Mississippi and its tributaries, and had built massive earthwork mounds as part of their society about 950\u20131250 AD. Its largest location was at Cahokia, in present-day Illinois east of St. Louis.\nThe historic tribes spoke mutually intelligible Muskogean languages, which were closely related. Present-day Montgomery is built on the site of two Alibamu towns: \"Ikanatchati\" (Ekanchattee or Ecunchatty or Econachatee), meaning \"red earth;\" and \"Towassa\", built on a bluff called \"Chunnaanaauga Chatty.\" The first Europeans to travel through central Alabama were Hernando de Soto and his expedition, who in 1540 recorded going through Ikanatchati and camping for one week in Towassa.\nThe next recorded European encounter occurred more than a century later, when an English expedition from Carolina went down the Alabama River in 1697. The first permanent European settler in the Montgomery area was James McQueen, a Scots trader who settled there in 1716. He married a high-status woman in the Coushatta or Alabama tribe. Their mixed-race children were considered Muskogean, as both tribes had a matrilineal system of property and descent. The children were always considered born into their mother's clan, and gained their status from her people.\nIn 1785, Abraham Mordecai, a war veteran from a Sephardic Jewish family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, established a trading post. The Coushatta and Alabama had gradually moved south and west in the tidal plain. After the French were defeated by the British in 1763 in the Seven Years' War and ceded control of their lands, these Native American peoples moved to parts of present-day Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, then areas of Spanish rule, which they thought more favorable than British-held areas. By the time Mordecai arrived, Creek had migrated into and settled in the area, as they were moving away from Cherokee and Iroquois warfare to the north. Mordecai married a Creek woman. When her people had to cede most of their lands after the 1813-14 Creek War, she joined them in removal to Indian Territory. Mordecai brought the first cotton gin to Alabama.\nThe Upper Creek were able to discourage most white immigration until after the conclusion of the Creek War. Following their defeat by General Andrew Jackson in August 1814, the Creek tribes were forced to cede 23 million acres to the United States, including remaining land in today's Georgia and most of today's central and southern Alabama. In 1816, the Mississippi Territory (1798\u20131817) organized Montgomery County. Its former Creek lands were sold off the next year at the federal land office in Milledgeville, Georgia.\nThe first group of white settlers to come to the Montgomery area was headed by General John Scott. This group founded Alabama Town about downstream on the Alabama River from present-day downtown Montgomery. In June 1818, county courts were moved from Fort Jackson to Alabama Town. Alabama was admitted to the Union in December 1819.\nSoon after, Andrew Dexter Jr. founded New Philadelphia, the present-day eastern part of downtown. He envisioned a prominent future for his town; he set aside a hilltop known as \"Goat Hill\" as the future site of the state capitol building. New Philadelphia soon prospered, and Scott and his associates built a new town adjacent, calling it East Alabama Town. Originally rivals, the towns merged on December 3, 1819, and were incorporated as the town of Montgomery, named for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general.\nSlave traders used the Alabama River to deliver enslaved laborers to planters, to work the cotton. Buoyed by the revenues of the cotton trade at a time of high market demand, the newly united Montgomery grew quickly. In 1822, the city was designated as the county seat. A new courthouse was built at the present location of Court Square, at the foot of Market Street (now Dexter Avenue). Court Square had one of the largest slave markets in the South. The state capital was moved from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery, on January 28, 1846.\nAs state capital, Montgomery began to influence state politics, and it would also play a prominent role on the national stage. Beginning February 4, 1861, representatives from Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina met in Montgomery, host of the \"Southern Convention\", to form the Confederate States of America. Montgomery was named the first capital of the nation, and Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as president on the steps of the State Capitol. The capital was later moved to Richmond, Virginia.\nOn April 12, 1865, following the Battle of Selma, Major General James H. Wilson captured Montgomery for the Union.\nIn 1886 Montgomery became the first city in the United States to install citywide electric streetcars along a system that was nicknamed the Lightning Route. Residents followed the streetcar lines to settle in new housing in what were then \"suburban\" locations.\n As the Reconstruction era ended, mayor W. L. Moses asked the state legislature to gerrymander city boundaries. It complied and removed the districts where African Americans lived, restoring white supremacy to the city's demographics and electorate. This prevented African Americans from being elected in the municipality and denied them city services.\nOn February 12, 1945, a devastating and deadly tornado struck the western portion of the city. The tornado killed 26 people, injured 293 others, and caused a city-wide blackout which lasted for hours. The United States Weather Bureau would describe this tornado as \"the most officially observed one in history\".\nIn the post-World War II era, returning African-American veterans were among those who became active in pushing to regain their civil rights in the South: to be allowed to vote and participate in politics, to freely use public places, to end segregation. According to the historian David Beito of the University of Alabama, African Americans in Montgomery \"nurtured the modern civil rights movement.\" African Americans comprised most of the customers on the city buses, but were forced to give up seats and even stand in order to make room for whites. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man, sparking the Montgomery bus boycott. Martin Luther King Jr., then the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, and E.D. Nixon, a local civil rights advocate, founded the Montgomery Improvement Association to organize the boycott. In June 1956, the US District Court Judge Frank M. Johnson ruled that Montgomery's bus racial segregation was unconstitutional. After the US Supreme Court upheld the ruling in November, the city desegregated the bus system, and the boycott was ended.\nIn separate action, integrated teams of Freedom Riders rode South on interstate buses. In violation of federal law and the constitution, bus companies had for decades acceded to state laws and required passengers to occupy segregated seating in Southern states. Opponents of the push for integration organized mob violence at stops along the Freedom Ride. In Montgomery, there was police collaboration when a white mob attacked Freedom Riders at the Greyhound Bus Station in May 1961. Outraged national reaction resulted in the enforcement of desegregation of interstate public transportation.\nMartin Luther King Jr. returned to Montgomery in 1965. Local civil rights leaders in Selma had been protesting Jim Crow laws and practices that raised barriers to blacks registering to vote. Following the shooting of a man after a civil rights rally, the leaders decided to march to Montgomery to petition Governor George Wallace to allow free voter registration. The violence they encountered from county and state highway police outraged the country. The federal government ordered National Guard and troops to protect the marchers. Thousands more joined the marchers on the way to Montgomery, and an estimated 25,000 marchers entered the capital to press for voting rights. These actions contributed to Congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to authorize federal supervision and enforcement of the rights of African Americans and other minorities to vote.\nOn February 7, 1967, a devastating fire broke out at Dale's Penthouse, a restaurant and lounge on the top floor of the Walter Bragg Smith apartment building (now called Capital Towers) at 7 Clayton Street downtown. Twenty-six people died.\nIn recent years, Montgomery has grown and diversified its economy. Active in downtown revitalization, the city adopted a master plan in 2007; it includes the revitalization of Court Square and the riverfront, renewing the city's connection to the river. Many other projects under construction include the revitalization of Historic Dexter Avenue, pedestrian and infrastructure improvements along the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the construction of a new environmental park on West Fairview Avenue.\nGeography.\nMontgomery is located at .\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.52%) is water. The city is built over rolling terrain at an elevation of about above sea level.\nCityscape.\nDowntown Montgomery lies along the southern bank of the Alabama River, about downstream from the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers. The most prominent feature of Montgomery's skyline is the , RSA Tower, built in 1996 by the Retirement Systems of Alabama. Other prominent buildings include 60 Commerce Street, 8 Commerce Street, and the RSA Dexter Avenue Building. Downtown also contains many state and local government buildings, including the Alabama State Capitol. The Capitol is located atop a hill at one end of Dexter Avenue, along which also lies the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. was pastor. Both the Capitol and Dexter Baptist Church are recognized as National Historic Landmarks by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Other notable buildings include RSA Dexter Avenue, RSA Headquarters, Alabama Center for Commerce, RSA Union, and the Renaissance Hotel and Spa.\nOne block south of the Capitol is the First White House of the Confederacy, the 1835 Italianate-style house in which President Jefferson Davis and family lived while the Confederate capital was in Montgomery. Montgomery's third National Historic Landmark is Union Station. Passenger train service to Montgomery ceased in 1989. Today Union Station is part of the Riverfront Park development, which includes an amphitheater, a riverboat dock, a river walk, and Riverwalk Stadium.\nThe completion of a space in 2007, the Convention Center, has encouraged growth and activity in the downtown area and attracted more high-end retail and restaurants. Three blocks east of the Convention Center, Old Alabama Town showcases more than 50 restored buildings from the 19th century.

The campus was built in the 1900s in Tudor Revival and Gothic Revival styles. ASU, the Garden District, Cloverdale, and Huntingdon are all listed on the National Register of Historic Places as historic districts.\nMontgomery's east side is the fastest-growing part of the city. Development of the Dalraida neighborhood, along Atlanta Highway, began in 1909, when developers Cook and Laurie bought land from the Ware plantation. A Scotsman, Georgie Laurie named the area for D\u00e1l Riata, a 6th-7th century Gaelic overkingdom; a subsequent misspelling in an advertisement led to the current spelling. The first lots were sold in 1914. The city's two largest shopping malls (Eastdale Mall and The Shoppes at Eastchase), as well as many big-box stores and residential developments, are on the east side.\nThe area is also home of the Wynton M. Blount Cultural Park. This park contains the Alabama Shakespeare Festival and Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts.\nRevitalization.\nMontgomery has been recognized nationally for its continuing downtown revitalization. In the early 2000s, the city constructed the Montgomery Biscuits minor league baseball stadium and Riverfront Park. Following those developments, hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested by private companies that have adapted old warehouses and office buildings into loft apartments, restaurants, retail, hotels, and businesses. The demand for downtown living space has risen, as people want to have walkable, lively neighborhoods. More than 500 apartment units are under construction, including The Heights on Maxwell Boulevard, The Market District on Dexter Avenue, the Kress Building on Dexter Avenue, The Bell Building on Montgomery Street, and a new complex by the convention center. Additionally, Montgomery has recently opened a 50 million dollar white water park on July 7, located off Maxwell Boulevard.\nClimate.\nMontgomery has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\"), with short, mild winters, warm springs and autumns, and long, hot, humid summers.
